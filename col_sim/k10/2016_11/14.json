Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images Debris from fallen concrete off buildings lies on the sidewalk in Wellington, after a powerful earthquake rocked New Zealand. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the quake had a 7.8 magnitude. Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images A strong earthquake hit along the east coast of New Zealand's South Island Sunday, with a 7.8 magnitude, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake caused power outages, damaged buildings \u2014 and generated a tsunami. Emergency officials are urging people to get to high ground. \"The tsunami threat is for the east coast of all New Zealand (including Christchurch, Wellington and the Chatham islands),\" the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management said Sunday, urging residents to be wary of aftershocks and unpredictable high waves. \"There is a threat of land inundation for the East Coast of New Zealand from Southland to the East Cape,\" the agency said, referring to a roughly 1,000 mile-wide area. People in nearly 90 cities reported feeling the quake, according to the USGS. Chimneys toppled, and damage was reported more than 100 miles from the epicenter. If you are in a low lying area on the East Coast of the North, South or Chatham Islands move immediately to higher ground. #eqnz \u2014 MCDEM (@NZcivildefence) November 13, 2016 \"The November 13th M 7.8 earthquake is the largest event in the region since an M 7.3 earthquake 100 km to the northwest in June 1929,\" the USGS says . The quake struck nearly 60 miles north of New Zealand's city of Christchurch, at a depth of around 25 miles. Article continues after sponsorship The powerful quake comes after Christchurch marked the five-year anniversary of a devastating earthquake that hit the city in February of 2011 . From the USGS: \"While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area. Reverse-faulting events of the size of the November 13, 2016 earthquake are typically about 120x50 km (length x width). Within 2 hours of the M 7.8 mainshock, 9 aftershocks had occurred, ranging in size from M 4.9 to M 6.2 and extending from the region of the mainshock epicenter to about 150 km to the northeast.\" ",

Referencing thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, chanting \"Not my president\", Conway said \"I think it's time for them to give this man a chance, too.\" According to Conway, President-Elect Trump has already addressed the protesters and \"he will continue to address them. He's going to be the president of all people.\" But, she added, \"This is a two-way street.\" \"It's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters: 'This man is our president,'\" Conway continued.

Conway commented on reports RNC Chair Reince Priebus and Trump Campaign CEO Steve Bannon are the top candidates being considered for the post. While she said both will \"have big roles in a Trump administration\", she particularly highlighted what she sees as Bannon's qualifications for the job. \"I think having worked with him and known him, Steve Bannon, in this particular campaign, was the general. And he is much more the Goldman Sachs managing partner and much more the naval officer, I think, than people realize. That's a big part of his background.\" Conway denied that Bannon, who also served as editor of conservative site Breitbart, would come to Washington to proverbially \"burn it down.\" Play ",

USA TODAY NETWORK House Speaker Paul Ryan would not commit to retaining\u00a0mandatory insurance coverage of birth control in an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act, saying on a Sunday talk show he did not want to discuss \"nitty gritty details\" of policy yet. \"I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet,\" the Wisconsin Republican said on CNN's State of the Union with Jake Tapper, though he then did get\u00a0far more specific on other issues like border control. Ryan, a conservative Catholic, declined to even give his opinion on whether an Affordable Care Act should include the birth control provision. But he did reiterate President-elect Trump's support for keeping\u00a0two of the most popular aspects of the law: The prohibition on discrimination by insurers against those with preexisting conditions and the ability of parents to keep children on their health plans until they are 26. Trump suggests Obamacare's protections for the sick may stay Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards tried to assure supporters after the election that they have numbers behind them when it comes to reproductive rights. \"The majority of Americans believe in access to health care and reproductive services, in protecting the right to safe and legal abortion,\"\u00a0 she wrote \u00a0on the group's website. \"The fights to come won\u2019t be easy, but we\u2019re in this together.\" And the group urged people to send donations, make gynecological appointments and stay active on social media. \"Tweet Your Defiance With #WeWontGoBack,\" it urged. As for Medicaid coverage that has been expanded to the lowest income adults in about two thirds of states, Ryan reminded that his \"A Better Way\" \u00a0health plan will use refundable tax credits \u2014 that is, vouchers \u2014 that will allow people to buy whatever kind of health plan they want. The ACA has a list of \"essential health benefits,\" such as physicals and mammograms,\u00a0that all plans must cover, but that some critics say contributed to soaring premiums. \"We can fix what was broken in healthcare,\" said Ryan.\u00a0\u200b Ryan, who uninvited Trump to an event in Wisconsin after audio of his 2005 sexual comments to\u00a0Billy Bush surfaced,\u00a0also struck a softer tone on immigration than Trump did during the campaign. \"Securing the borders are a top priority,\" not mass deportation, Ryan said. When it comes to products coming into this country, forget trade wars or tariffs as high as 40% like those Trump discussed on the campaign trail,\u00a0Ryan said changes in the tax system will instead be used to make U.S. workers and products more competitive.

    "text": "By Christopher Ingraham November 13 at 9:46 AM Follow @_cingraham Jim Benoit, left, and Larry Eckstein discuss politics over coffee at the Eagle Square gas station in Red Lake Falls, Minn. Donald Trump sailed to victory in significant part on the back of\u00a0 white, rural, largely conservative voters drawn to his populist message.\u00a0The\u00a0upset victory has prompted soul-searching in the media, which had set\u00a0the odds of a Hillary Clinton victory from 71 percent to more than than 99\u00a0percent . \u201cWant to know what America's thinking? Try asking,\u201d the New York Times' public editor Liz Spayd wrote ,\u00a0urging the Times\u00a0to \u201cthink hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers.\u201d Margaret Sullivan, media critic at The Washington Post,\u00a0 struck a similar note . \u201cAlthough we touched down in the big red states for a few days, or interviewed some coal miners or unemployed autoworkers in the Rust Belt,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe didn\u2019t take them seriously.\u201d In\u00a0May, I moved from deep-blue Baltimore to one of those overlooked corners \u00a0of the country that swung wildly toward Trump. I have gotten to know the people who live there as friends and neighbors. Here in the town of Red Lake Falls \u2014 the seat of Red Lake County, Minn. \u2014 it wasn't easy to get a sense of which way the political winds were blowing. I didn\u2019t see a single yard sign for Clinton or Trump, although signs for state and local candidates were everywhere. Sometimes, it seemed, signs for competing Democratic and Republican candidates were planted in the same yard. But voters in Red Lake County voted for Trump in a landslide,\u00a0 61 percent to 29 percent . More striking, Clinton\u2019s showing here was the worst of any Democratic presidential candidate since at least 1960. Given the vociferous campaign that played out on TV \u2014 and seemingly across the country \u2014\u00a0I wondered how such a dramatic political shift could be happening in an almost hidden way among my neighbors. It was, in some way, no surprise that busy reporters based in D.C. and traveling nonstop around the country had not grasped the entirety of this shift. I lived here every day. I missed it, too. After the election, if there were\u00a0any place in America to take the pulse of these Trump voters, I figured it would be right here in Red Lake. And I knew just the place to go, too. Every morning down at Eagle Square, one of the local gas stations, mostly retired guys get together to talk local gossip and the issues of the day. These \u201ccoffee klatches,\u201d as they\u2019re known around here, are a big part of the region\u2019s civic fabric. [ How voters who heavily supported Obama switched over to Trump ] I visited Eagle Square on Friday morning expecting to hear from jubilant Trump voters. But what I found was something different,\u00a0 another humbling reminder of the yawning gap between what political numbers \u2014 like in the chart above \u2014 can tell you about a place and what life is actually like for the people who live there. The grizzled and cantankerous crew of retired teachers, farmers and laborers\u00a0at Eagle Square were mostly, as it turned out, loyal\u00a0Democrats who\u00a0had voted for Clinton. And like so many other people in the country, they were\u00a0wondering how their friends and neighbors with deep ties to Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Farmer-Labor Party \u00a0\u2014 the state arm of the national Democratic Party \u2014 ended up pulling the lever for Trump. \u201cI was shocked by the election,\u201d said Jim Benoit, a retiree and veteran who has lived in Red Lake Falls nearly his whole life. \u201cI say hold on to your shorts, because we're in for a ride. And not a good ride \u2014 I\u2019m really scared to death.\u201d Benoit is the kind of guy who will drop by a newcomer\u2019s house to share fried walleye recipes and apples plucked fresh off his tree. His voice carries a raspy lilt that comes from a decades-long cigarette habit cultivated in northern Minnesota. He voted for Clinton because Trump \u201cis a walking bomb. It\u2019s scary.\u201d Benoit remains hopeful that Congress will hold Trump\u2019s more authoritative\u00a0impulses in check. \u201cHe thinks you can do everything, and you can't. You\u2019ve got Congress.\u201d Ed Dahle, who retired some years ago after decades of teaching music at the Red Lake Falls High School, said he has taken to telling anyone who asks that he plans to build a wall around his house to keep Trump supporters out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to vote Republican when I was raised by a grandfather that was solid Democrat,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cAnd he told me every time he had a chance, \u2018Don't ever vote Republican because the Democrats\u00a0help the farmers.\u2019 \u201d Echoing remarks by some Clinton advisers in the aftermath of the surprise defeat, Dahle said that Clinton was defeated in places like Red Lake Falls because she didn\u2019t reach out to the working class the way her husband, former president Bill Clinton, had. \u201cWhen Hillary was up to speak, some of the people just did not feel that ease of conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey felt there was like a screen or something between them and her. And that\u2019s why so many people turned.\u201d Retired highway worker Larry Eckstein, another Clinton voter, pointed to\u00a0her\u00a0handling of a private email server as another factor in her defeat. \u201cThat email thing was really a big thing. That hung with her\u00a0for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never came out and said, \u2019Let's get it all out. Get it out now, and let\u2019s see if there's any problem.\u2019 She never came out and got rid of it.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. We\u2019ve got to get behind him.\u201d Of course, just because I happened upon a group of Democratic voters doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that Trump won big here. Allen Bertilrud, the mayor-elect of Red Lake Falls, who won the position\u00a0on a write-in ballot, swung by to chat. He wouldn\u2019t say who he voted for, but he seemed upbeat about\u00a0the results. \u201cTrump\u00a0didn\u2019t win because he was the most popular guy on the planet,\u201d Bertilrud said. \u201cHe won because he said the right things at the right time that got Hillary going. And if Hillary would have focused on the issues instead of focusing on his womanizing when she had a husband who was a womanizer, she probably would have won.\u201d He added his family has \u201cvoted Democratic\u00a0for years.\u201d But this time, \u201cthey voted for all the other Democratic candidates but Hillary.\u201d Gun control was a huge factor. Democrats\u00a0\u201ckeep harping on this gun control,\u201d he said. \u201cI can understand gun control in the metropolitan areas, but we don\u2019t see that out here. We don\u2019t have drive-by shootings. This is one of the things that they feel is one of the last rights that they have.\u201d A few blocks away from Eagle Square, Dick Brumwell, a veteran and retired schoolteacher, was helping his son fix a garage door. Brumwell is a lifelong Democrat and voted for Obama twice. But he said a vote for Clinton was off the table. \u201cEvery time Hillary would get together with a group of people, they would say, \u2018Oh, we need more food stamps or more of this,\u2019 and she would say, \u2018Okay, we'll take care of that.\u2019 She was promising everything,\u201d he\u00a0said. Brumwell vacillated on whether he could pull the lever for Trump but ultimately voted for the businessman.\u00a0\u201cI think America is so gosh darn tired of the status quo politicians, lifetime politicians, it\u2019s time to get somebody who isn\u2019t associated with the government, who has new ideas,\u201d he\u00a0said. The aftermath of the election is prompting a new wave of analysis of\u00a0the working-class voters who pushed Trump\u00a0over the finish line. There\u2019s a temptation to treat these white rural voters as a monolith.\u00a0The sense often seems to be that they\u2019re fundamentally different than\u00a0their urban counterparts \u2014 on culture, on politics and across so many other social vectors \u2014 and similar to each other. Statistically, of course, there is\u00a0some truth to this. There is a commonality out here. Nearly everyone\u00a0is white. Most folks own guns. Many have a tie\u00a0to the agricultural economy. But it\u2019s easy to overstate these commonalities.\u00a0What\u00a0I\u2019m starting to see\u00a0after six months here\u00a0is that folks in this community \u2014\u00a0and probably many others like it across the U.S. \u2014 defy easy stereotypes. Yes, Red Lake County turned out overwhelmingly for Trump. But there are plenty of Clinton voters here too. Politics is also experienced in a quieter, more personal way up here \u2014 that may be one reason yard signs for national candidates are so hard to find. Ideological disagreements tend to be hashed out in conversations between close friends, rather than shouting matches between strangers. Decisions and judgments about politics are subtler and less polarized that the election\u2019s results might\u00a0make it seem. Back at Eagle Square, Bertilrud and Dahle were arguing over the \u00a0severity of future threats the country might face. \u201cWe\u2019re $19 trillion in the hole,\u201d Bertilrud said. \u201cIf interest rates go to 5 percent, we can\u2019t even pay our interest.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a hang about that,\u201d said Dahle. \u201cRemember your great-grandchildren? They\u2019re going to have to pay for this.\u201d Dahle wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cThey\u2019re not even going to be alive if we don\u2019t get this global warming done and get rid of the damn coal. They aren\u2019t going to be alive if they can\u2019t breathe!\u201d But at the end, for these voters, the political talk was just talk and little more. \u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d Dahle said. \u201cPolitics is one thing. You disagree, and then you go on with your life. You can\u2019t hate people forever.\u201d Discussion soon turned to what Bertilrud intended to do, as the new mayor, about the plague of squirrels in Dahle\u2019s back yard. business ",

    "text": "Ankle injury could be season-ending for Bears guard Kyle Long Photos of the Chicago Bears' first-round draft pick in 2013. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Bears expect to be without Pro Bowl guard Kyle Long for an extended period after the fourth-year lineman suffered a serious injury to his right ankle during Sunday's 36-10 loss to the Buccaneers. John Fox declined to divulge the diagnosis on Long and wouldn't confirm whether X-rays on the right guard's ankle came back negative. But Fox insinuated Long might be dealing with a high ankle sprain and that the Bears were preparing to be without him for a while. With only seven games left, Long could be lost for the remainder of the season with little incentive for the 2-7 Bears to rush his recovery. \"It's tough,\" quarterback Jay Cutler said. \"He's had a bunch of injuries to one (half) of his body. And now the lower half takes a hit too. \u2026 If there's a chance for him to come back, he's a guy who will make it happen. If not, he'll be a hard guy to replace.\" Long suffered his injury on a sloppily executed shovel pass from Cutler to fullback Paul Lasike in the second quarter. As Lasike stumbled to catch the pass, he landed on the back of Long's foot. Long left the field on the back of a cart, pounding the side of the vehicle and shouting encouragement into the huddle. After dealing with a serious labrum issue in his shoulder since August and battling through a triceps strain suffered in Week 7, Long will now have his patience tested with an extended absence.

Outside linebacker Leonard Floyd had his hands on Winston for a near sack on the third-and-10 play. But Winston slipped away and eventually retreated into his own end zone, a full 25 yards behind the line of scrimmage. He sidestepped additional sack attempts from Willie Young and Cornelius Washington before launching a jump ball down the middle of the field. Evans snatched it over cornerback Tracy Porter 15 seconds after the play began. \"I couldn't believe he was able to come down with it,\" Porter said. \"I went up to make a play on the ball and he was able to give me a little nudge so he could get some freedom and make the catch.\" Rather than having to punt, the Buccaneers crossed midfield and Winston hit Freddie Martino for a 43-yard touchdown pass on the following play.

    "text": "Harry Reid Backs Rep. Keith Ellison for DNC Chair, Cites Need for 'New Thinking' By Michael Edison Hayden Nov 13, 2016, 1:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Rep. Keith Ellison Says Most Important Criteria for DNC Chair is 'Vision' 0 Shares Email Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has joined some other party leaders in throwing his support behind Rep. Keith Ellison to become the new chair of the Democratic National Committee , saying the Minnesota congressman would bring \"new thinking and a fresh start.\" \"My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done. Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith,\" Reid said in a statement issued by his communications director. Ellison of Minnesota has yet to throw his hat in the ring for election as chair of the party committee. But he said today on ABC News' \"This Week\" that he will announce 'real soon' whether he will run for the post. 5 Missteps That May Have Doomed the Clinton Campaign Reid's endorsement follows Ellison's winning the backing of New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , who is slated to take over as the Senate 's Democratic leader when Reid retires at the end of the year. \"Without a Democratic White House, Schumer\u2019s view is the DNC is where grassroots organizing in sync with legislative battles should be organized,\u201d Schumer spokesperson Matt House told ABC News on Friday. Ellison was elected to Congress in 2006 and gained increased visibility during the 2016 election in part through his appearances on Sunday morning talk shows like \"This Week,\" where he foresaw long before many pundits that Trump could become the GOP presidential nominee. The Minnesota representative also became just the second member of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, a race the Vermont senator ultimately lost to Clinton. Ellison remains popular among Sanders' still-vocal supporters. Sanders has endorsed Ellison for DNC chair and launched a petition in support of his candidacy on his website. Sean Proctor/Bloomberg via Getty Images Keith Ellison and Bernie Sanders speak during a campaign event in Dearborn, Michigan, March 7, 2016. The support of both Reid and Schumer for Ellison potentially signals a change in direction for a party that appears severely bruised in the wake of Nov. 8th's election upset. Reid and Schumer had both endorsed Clinton in the Democratic Primary , as had with an overwhelming majority of party leaders. The Democratic National Committee is now headed by Acting Chair Donna Brazile , who stepped in just before the party convention in July when then-Chair Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in the wake of leaked emails showing some DNC staffers favoring Clinton over Sanders in the primary. More recently, other leaked emails posted by WikiLeaks appeared to show that Brazile too may have helped the Clinton campaign when she was active with the party committee but before she was acting chair. Besides Ellison, other possible candidates for DNC chair include former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean who announced on Twitter that he was throwing his hat in the ring to take the job again. Dean held the post from 2005-2006 and employed what he called a \u201c50-state\u201d strategy that attempted to put even traditionally GOP-leaning congressional seats into contention. Democrats took control of Congress during his term. But Dean's popularity with the party's progressive base has waned. In March, he drew criticism from some activists for his advocacy of the controversial superdelegate system used during Democratic Party primaries. \"Super delegates don't \"represent people;\" I'm not elected by anyone. I'll do what I think is right for the country,\" Dean tweeted then. In addition to Dean, Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a former presidential contender, has also expressed interest in becoming DNC chair. According to the emails posted on Wikileaks this month, many of Clinton\u2019s top advisers seemed to like former Michigan Governor Jen Granholm for the job of DNC Chair. Other names floated include New Hampshire Party Chair Ray Buckley and South Carolina Party Chair Jamie Harrison. ABC News' Miriam Khan, Morgan Winsor, and MaryAlice Parks contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Lawyers File Motion to Delay Trump University Trial By The Associated Press SAN DIEGO \u0097 Nov 13, 2016, 3:06 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Nov. 4, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Hershey, Pa. Trump is scheduled to go on trial this month in a class-action lawsuit against him and his now-defunct Trump University, potentially taking the witness stand weeks before his inauguration as president of the United States. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the Indiana-born jurist who was accused of bias by Trump during the campaign for his Mexican heritage, will hold a hearing Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, on jury instructions and what evidence to allow at trial. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci, File) 0 Shares Email Donald Trump's attorneys filed a motion to delay until after the presidential inauguration a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect and his now-defunct Trump University . In the motion filed Saturday evening in San Diego federal court, Trump's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli argues that the extra months would give both sides time to possibly reach a settlement. Petrocelli lays out a detailed plan that would postpone the trial until sometime soon after the Jan. 20 inauguration to allow the president-elect to focus his time and energy on the transition to the White House , the San Diego Union-Tribune reported ( http://bit.ly/2fNK97O ). The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success in real estate is scheduled to begin Nov. 28. The motion also requests that Trump be excused from having to testify live or in person. Instead, his lawyers argue he should be allowed to be questioned by both sides in a videotaped deposition for trial purposes either shortly before Jan. 20 \u2014 when his transition duties would be nearly complete \u2014 or at a later time. That video would then be played at trial. Petrocelli asks that the specific date and location of the recording would be kept secret, until trial, the newspaper said. In addition, the video testimony would be used not only in this case, but in a similar Trump University lawsuit also in San Diego that is not as close to trial \u2014 ensuring Trump won't have to testify twice. \"The videotaped testimony will ensure no additional delay of trial based on future scheduling unpredictability,\" Petrocelli wrote. If U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel denies the motion, Petrocelli requests an immediate stay on the proceedings so he can appeal to a higher court. Curiel was informed Thursday during a hearing in the case that Trump would be seeking a continuance. The judge didn't signal how he would rule on the request for a trial delay, but he encouraged efforts to settle. He has been reluctant to postpone the 6 ?-year-old case any longer. The lawsuit filed in 2010 on behalf of former customers says Trump University gave seminars and classes across the country under the guise of being an accredited school, which it wasn't, and pressured people to spend up to $35,000 on mentorships from Trump's \"hand-picked\" instructors. The claims largely mirror another class-action complaint in San Diego and a lawsuit in New York. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump repeats vow to build border wall, but admits 'there could be some fencing' Published               November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump, in his first television interview since his surprise election victory, repeated his vows to build a wall across America's southern border, deport criminal illegal aliens, and repeal and replace ObamaCare. PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP WILLING TO KEEP PARTS OF OBAMACARE But Trump also appeared to back off from commiting to build a solid wall, telling CBS' \"60 Minutes\" the barrier might look more like a fence in spots.\u00a0 \"Certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\" Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl. \"I'm very good at this, it's called construction.\" Trump emphasized that securing the border is his very first immigration priority, but he also promised to deport\u00a0people living in the country illegally who had committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses.\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 \"What we are going to do is get the people that are [criminals] and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\" Trump said. \"We have a lot of these people. Probably two million, it could be even three million. We are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized,\" Trump added, \"we're going to make a determination on [other undocumented immigrants] ... But before we make that determination ... we want to secure our border. Early in the GOP primaries, Trump had vowed to immediately deport all 11 million people living in the country illegally. But his comments Sunday echoed House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who told CNN that the Republican administration was \"not looking for mass deportations.\" \"We are not going to do that,\" Ryan emphasized in the interview that aired earlier Sunday. The real estate mogul also echoed remarks he made to the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, in which he said he favors keeping the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of patients\u2019 existing conditions, and a provision that allows parents to provide years of additional coverage for children on their insurance policies. \"It'll be just fine. We're not going to have, like, a two day period and we're not going to have-- a two-year period where there's nothing,\" Trump said.\u00a0 Trump also appeared to back away from his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, over her use of a private email server. Trump made such a promise during the second presidential debate against Clinton during a rhetorical duel that ended with Trump saying if he was president, \"you'd be in jail.\" \"She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things,\" Trump said, to which Stahl responded, \"I know, but a special prosecutor?\" \"I don't want to hurt them, I don't want to hurt them,\" Trump said. \"They\u2019re, they\u2019re good people. I don't want to hurt them.\" Regarding another of his campaign promises, Trump vowed to nominate a Supreme Court justice that would be pro-life and pro-Second Amendment. However, the president-elect showed no interest in re-litigating last year's Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marraige, an issue of departure between him and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \"It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it\u2019s done,\" Trump said, later adding, \"I'm fine with that.\" Trump touched on the protests that have broken out across the nation since his election, complaning that the coverage represented a \"double standard.\" \"If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, 'Oh, that's a terrible thing,'\" he said. \"And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude.\" However the president-elect said that he was \"saddened\" by reports that some of his supporters had harassed minorities since Tuesday's vote. \"And I say, 'Stop it.' ... I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\" Trump also told \"60 Minutes\" he would eschew the $400,000 annual salary for the president, taking only $1 a year.

Hughes was not admitted entrance to the concert, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP). The AFP reported that the venue's co-director would not allow Hughes to enter after he told Fox Business Channel that he thought Muslim security personnel at the venue collaborated with attackers. Hughes later apologized and retracted his statement. Jesse Hughes, the singer of US rock group Eagles of Death Metal, blows a kiss before the start of the concert at the Olympia concert hall in Paris, on Feb. 16. JOEL SAGET / AFP - Getty Images The band's manager, Marc Pollack, refuted the claim that Hughes was not admitted to the concert in an interview with Billboard, describing the co-director's description of the situation as false. Hughes, at the town hall, offered his gratitude to the people of France. \"And from the second that the first bullets started flying, this country took care of us. And we are grateful forever, and I just hope everyone here knows how much we love this country and every person in it,\" he said. Sting's performance at the newly restored Bataclan included a moment of silence and statement in French, saying he hoped \"to remember and honor those who lost their lives in the attacks a year ago and to celebrate the life and the music of this historic venue.\" Phil McCausland ",

Daniel York, left, shown with AT&T executives Bart Peters and Chris Long, celebrate the season premiere of DirecTV's \"Kingdom\" with actor Nick Jonas. (Getty Images for DirecTV) Meg James Contact Reporter When the Weather Channel \u2019s carriage contract came up for renewal nearly\u00a0three years ago, DirecTV\u2019s chief content officer demanded the small network slash its programming fees by 75%. After the\u00a0Weather Channel\u00a0refused, DirecTV abruptly replaced it with a lesser-known\u00a0programming service \u2014 confusing\u00a0viewers who suddenly couldn\u2019t find their favorite\u00a0meteorologist on TV. It was a vintage hardball tactic\u00a0by Daniel York, one of the most powerful executives in television who\u00a0is at the center of a federal lawsuit alleging\u00a0 collusion among television companies that prevented tens of thousands of baseball fans from watching the Los Angeles Dodgers on TV. Those who know\u00a0York\u00a0describe him as\u00a0the alpha male of the pay-TV pack \u2014\u00a0an executive with\u00a0a\u00a0long memory and a swashbuckling style. Now as AT&T Entertainment\u2019s chief content officer, he is the gatekeeper of the Dallas phone company\u2019s\u00a0vast television systems, which since last year includes DirecTV. He has the power to make or break cable networks by deciding\u00a0which ones are available in the more than 25\u00a0million homes served by AT&T \u2014 and how much his company will pay for the rights to distribute them. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the 53-year-old executive\u00a0was the ringleader in a\u00a0campaign\u00a0to ensure\u00a0the cable channel owned by the Dodgers, SportsNet LA, would remain on the bench. York, who works at DirecTV\u2019s headquarters in\u00a0El Segundo, allegedly traded calls, text messages\u00a0and inside information with his counterparts at Charter Communications, Cox Communications and AT&T (before the phone company\u00a0swallowed DirecTV) to thwart rival Time Warner Cable, which had the rights to distribute SportsNet LA. Time Warner Cable struck out in its efforts to win carriage for the pricey channel. The Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit\u00a0against AT&T\u2019s DirecTV unit, which came this month after a nearly two-year investigation,\u00a0has laid bare\u00a0the inner workings of the insular world of pay-TV distribution. Consumers in recent years have become collateral damage, watching helplessly as favorite channels,\u00a0including CBS,\u00a0Nickelodeon, Univision and Turner Classic Movies, get yanked\u00a0from program\u00a0lineups as\u00a0big media companies haggle\u00a0over billion-dollar carriage contracts. York, through an AT&T spokesman, declined to comment for this story and he did not respond to emails or a message\u00a0left at his home. But more than a dozen current and former senior industry executives interviewed by The Times, including several DirecTV insiders,\u00a0describe him\u00a0as a driven and brash executive who was bent on leveling the\u00a0field\u00a0at a time when he perceived that TV networks, such as CBS and\u00a0Fox, were gaining an upper hand in contract talks. \"We all negotiate hard to get good deals,\u201d said one veteran TV executive who was not authorized to discuss the situation. \u201cBut Dan mashes your face into the cement.\" Bargaining sessions with York include shouting matches, all-nighters and occasional tears shed by those on the opposite side of the negotiating table, according to executives interviewed. But, they say, he often gets results.\u00a0Before joining DirecTV in mid-2012, York spent nearly eight years building AT&T\u2019s U-Verse fiber-optic video\u00a0service from scratch to nearly 6 million customers. When AT&T acquired DirecTV last year, York\u2019s\u00a0turf grew\u00a0and he now controls an annual programming budget of $17.2 billion, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson.\u00a0 Refusing to carry the Dodgers channel, in effect, saved DirecTV\u00a0more than $200 million in programming costs the\u00a0satellite TV provider\u00a0would have had to pay Time Warner Cable over the three years that SportsNet LA has been in operation. That expense, insiders said, would have been\u00a0passed along to customers. But York\u2019s\u00a0tactics may prove costly for AT&T.\u00a0\u00a0The antitrust lawsuit could result in a steep fine and pave the way for wide carriage of SportsNet LA. It also comes at a crucial time as AT&T\u00a0seeks Justice Department approval of\u00a0its proposed $85.4-billion takeover of Time Warner Inc., which owns HBO, CNN\u00a0and the Warner Bros. studio.\u00a0Critics, including President-Elect Donald Trump , have raised concerns that a frenzy of media consolidations is unfairly squeezing the little guy and wiping out competition.\u00a0 AT&T declined to comment for this story, but earlier defended DirecTV\u2019s action, saying: \"No one wanted to force all of their customers to pay the inflated prices that Time Warner Cable was demanding for a channel devoted solely to L.A. Dodgers baseball.\" The 2014 negotiations over the\u00a0Dodgers channel came amid an explosion of sports channels in recent years, taxing a business model that already was under strain.\u00a0As much as $25 of a consumer\u2019s monthly cable\u00a0television bill goes to pay for the various sports networks. And no where are\u00a0there more sports channels than in LA.\u00a0 DirecTV was determined to hold the line.\u00a0The company in 2013 and 2014 was clawing to maintain its base of subscribers. \u201cGrowth was starting to dry up,\u201d said Ian Olgeirson, research director at consulting firm SNL Kagan.\u00a0\u201cThe market overall was feeling more pressure.\u201d\u00a0 Programming costs were rising at a time when more consumers were ditching or scaling back their cable TV service\u00a0and switching to low-cost video streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. \u201cThese new\u00a0services threaten\u00a0their legacy businesses \u2014\u00a0they are getting squeezed,\u201d said a longtime\u00a0media executive who has represented popular cable channels.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd desperate people do desperate things.\u201d :: York was born and raised in Michigan and\u00a0still follows his college team, the Michigan State Spartans . He is married with two children and his wife is a food blogger. He has been in the media business more than 20 years, first working\u00a0in HBO marketing and sports, and then at the pay-per-view program distributor, In\u00a0Demand. There, he\u00a0made a few\u00a0enemies. \u201cI hate this guy [York] to this day,\u201d said professional wrestling executive Paul Heyman\u00a0during an April 2014 broadcast of a show hosted by\u00a0 Steve Austin , an actor and former wrestler. Fifteen years ago, Heyman was desperate to keep afloat\u00a0his\u00a0Philadelphia-based venture,\u00a0Extreme Championship Wrestling.\u00a0It needed TV distribution for exposure\u00a0and it needed money. Heyman said York\u2019s company, In Demand, owed ECW\u00a0$2.8 million for a previous pay-per-view event.\u00a0 \u201cDan York said to me: Once you get distribution, we'll give you your money \u2026\u00a0but if you don't get distribution, we know you're going down and it's going to be cheaper for us to pay pennies on the dollar to a bankruptcy trustee,\u201d Heyman said on Austin\u2019s show. \u201cThat\u2019s why we went out of business.\u201d\u00a0 York in 2004 joined SBC (which became AT&T). He was charged with getting AT&T\u2019s fiber-optic\u00a0video service, AT&T U-Verse, off the ground and worked for years to negotiate carriage deals with TV networks. Because his firm was the new kid on the pay-TV block, York had little leverage to negotiate favorable contracts\u00a0for AT&T.\u00a0 That, according to his associates, appeared to bother\u00a0York. By 2010, U-Verse\u00a0had gained\u00a0more than 2\u00a0million subscribers, giving York a stronger hand in negotiations.\u00a0 He seized on the\u00a0vulnerability of the independently owned Hallmark channels, known for\u00a0wholesome fare and made-for-TV movies.When Hallmark\u2019s contract was up for renewal in 2010,\u00a0York demanded that Hallmark slash its already low rates by as much as 80% to\u00a0stay on the service. Hallmark refused and its two channels were dropped \u2014\u00a0a\u00a0blackout that lasted five years.\u00a0 \u201cI have a lot of respect for Dan,\u201d Bill Abbott, chief executive of Hallmark\u2019s parent, Crown Media Networks, said last week, noting\u00a0the dispute with U-Verse\u00a0ended last year on amicable terms.\u00a0\u201cI understand that he and other distributors are trying to save every penny they\u00a0can to manage programming costs.\u201d\u00a0 Several executives interviewed said York seemed to take his underdog\u00a0status at AT&T personally.\u00a0When York\u00a0was running AT&T\u2019s\u00a0video service, he was\u00a0the\u00a0\u201c90-pound weakling who had been getting sand kicked in his face,\u201d said one executive who did not want to be identified. But that\u00a0changed when York\u00a0joined DirecTV in mid-2012.\u00a0 \u201cHe grew\u00a0muscles,\u201d the\u00a0executive said, noting that York became a titan overnight because he now was representing\u00a0a company with nearly 20 million subscribers. Just as he was settling in at\u00a0DirecTV, its\u00a0main rival, Time Warner Cable, was making the rounds to line up\u00a0carriage for a new\u00a0channel featuring the Los Angeles Lakers. DirecTV was interested, but planned to grind down the price. But Time Warner Cable\u2019s top negotiator, Melinda Witmer,\u00a0had a different idea. \u00a0She offered\u00a0a special rate and enticed\u00a0Charter, AT&T and Cox Communications to carry the channel \u2014\u00a0leaving DirecTV as the big\u00a0holdout. With hundreds of customers fleeing, DirecTV was forced to\u00a0cave\u00a0in to Time Warner Cable\u2019s\u00a0demands.\u00a0 York and other DirecTV executives\u00a0immediately regretted their decision\u00a0 to carry the Lakers\u00a0channel. They\u00a0figured\u00a0they were paying twice what the channel was worth, according to the government lawsuit.\u00a0Viewership fell after Lakers star Dwight Howard left the team and, then, Kobe Bryant got injured and\u00a0played\u00a0only six games that\u00a0season. Meanwhile, in early 2014, York told Weather Channel executives that DirecTV\u00a0would not pay any rate increase, and instead demanded that the channel roll back its fees. The Weather Channel refused -- only to be replaced by programming from WeatherNation. The move\u00a0backfired. Hilton Hotels threatened to drop DirecTV from its\u00a0hotel rooms.\u00a0DirecTV capitulated,\u00a0and was forced to swallow a rate hike for the Weather Channel \u2014\u00a0adding insult to injury.\u00a0In return, DirecTV demanded that Weather Channel make a public apology for the fuss.\u00a0Weather Channel executives\u00a0were furious,\u00a0but they served it up:\u00a0\u201cOur apologies to DirecTV\u00a0and their customers for the disruption of our service and for initiating a\u00a0public campaign,\u201d Weather Co.\u2019s CEO said in the unusual apology. \u201cWhat did that accomplish?\u201d\u00a0one of the executives involved in the dispute said of the forced apology.\u00a0 :: While the Weather Channel fight was raging, a different skirmish was unfolding\u00a0inside DirecTV. Time Warner Cable\u2019s Witmer was making the rounds again, this time trying to\u00a0win carriage for the Dodgers channel, SportsNet LA, which is\u00a0owned by Guggenheim Baseball Management. Money was reserved\u00a0in DirecTV\u2019s programming budget to cover\u00a0the Dodgers channel\u00a0affiliate fees and marketing executives\u00a0argued that DirecTV owed it to local fans and subscribers,\u00a0\u00a0according to the Justice Department lawsuit. But \u201chaving been burned\u201d by Time Warner Cable on the Lakers channel, York and\u00a0DirecTV\u00a0weren\u2019t about to get played again, the Justice Department lawsuit said. Executives from Charter, Cox and AT&T testified under oath to federal prosecutors that they had been comparing\u00a0notes with York\u00a0in 2013 and 2014 about whether to carry\u00a0the Dodgers channel. York\u2019s assurance that DirecTV would not take the channel without giving the others a heads-up,\u00a0emboldened them to hold firm against Time Warner Cable. That collusion, according to the Justice Department, did not allow the free market to work \u2014\u00a0and baseball fans\u00a0suffered. \u201cThis makes Dan York look vindictive, but some could view him as something of a hero,\u201d said Paul F. Rothstein, a Georgetown University law professor. \u201cHe was working in service to his company and its customers \u2014\u00a0he wasn\u2019t going to be the victim of price gouging again.\u201d Caption 'Arrival' movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews 'Arrival' directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Tzi Ma, and Mark O\u2019Brien.

He was 74. Russell's wife, Jan Bridges, said that he died in his sleep, according to a statement on his website . In a later statement obtained by ABC News, she added in part, \"He was recovering from heart surgery in July and looked forward to getting back on the road in January. We appreciate everyone\u2019s love and support.\" Earlier this year, Russell had to postpone 28 concerts between July and September after suffering a heart attack . Still, his website said then in a statement that the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was \"optimistic\" and able to make a complete recovery. Elton John and Leon Russell: Dueling Pianos In the 1960s, Russell made a name for himself as an in-demand session keyboardist. He was part of the Wrecking Crew, a famed collective of studio musicians. Russell also established himself as a songwriter. Some of the best-known songs that he wrote are \"Delta Lady,\" \"Superstar,\" \"This Masquerade\" and \"A Song for You.\" His solo career scored him Top 20 hits, including his 1972 single \"Tight Rope\" and 1975's \"Lady Blue.\" He also collaborated with artists such as Joe Cocker and Delaney & Bonnie, and toured with Edgar Winter, The New Grass Revival and Willie Nelson . In 2010, Russell collaborated with Elton John -- a longtime admirer of Russell's -- on his acclaimed album \"The Union.\" On \" Good Morning America ,\" John said of Russell, \"He was my biggest influence as a piano player, a singer and a songwriter.\" The following year, in 2011, Russell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . 0 Shares ",

The time and attention to prepare and testify will take him away from imperative transition work at a critical time,\" Trump's attorneys write in court documents filed this weekend. His attorneys emphasized the \"momentous, exceedingly complex\" task ahead of Trump as he prepares to take over the White House. Related: Trump University Staffers Describe 'Fraudulent Scheme' In New Court Documents \"The 69 days until inauguration are critical and all-consuming. President-Elect Trump must receive daily security briefings, make executive appointments (ultimately, thousands), and establish relationships with appointees, members of Congress, governors, and foreign leaders. He must also develop important policy priorities,\" they wrote. The trial in the civil suit brought against Trump's for-profit real-estate university, which students involved in another lawsuit described as a \"fraudulent scheme,\" was originally scheduled for Nov. 28. If the judge approves the motion, the earliest the trial could take place is late January. Trump's attorneys also proposed allowing the president-elect to record a videotaped testimony prior to the trial date, arguing that would \"ensure no additional delay of trial based on future scheduling unpredictability.\" They suggest that videotaped could be used in another related case, to \"allow President-elect Trump to focus on transitioning to office.\" Donald Trump listens as Michael Sexton introduces him at a news conference in New York where he announced the establishment of Trump University on  May 23, 2005. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is suing Trump for $40 million, saying that \"Trump University\" didn't deliver on its advertised promise to make students rich, but instead steered them into expensive yet mostly useless seminars.

And a couple of years ago, it just caught on... I think it's just because someone took the word 'super' and put it in front of the word 'moon.' \" That astrologer was Richard Noelle, who created the supermoon label in 1979. How To Photograph It First of all, don't frame the moon alone in the sky, Bill Ingalls, NASA's senior photographer, says : \"Don't make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself with no reference to anything.\" Instead, scout a location that can let you add context to the scene, Ingalls says. And if you're stuck using a smartphone, Ingalls says, \"You're not going to get a giant moon in your shot, but you can do something more panoramic, including some foreground that's interesting. Think about being in an urban area where it's a little bit brighter.\" Those using more advanced equipment can stick with the daylight white balance setting \u2014 after all, the light is coming from the sun. Many people will be posting images of this supermoon online \u2014 try the #supermoon hashtag on Instagram and/or Twitter . What Is It? The moon's elliptical and roughly 28-day orbit means that its distance from Earth when it's completely full varies. While the full moon always looks large along a horizon, the effect should be even greater for the next two days. \"There's this optical illusion, which, as it's rising or when it's setting, it looks really big,\" Faherty says. She says to look at the moon \"close to the horizon, where you get this optical illusion where your brain doesn't quite know how to interpret the size of the moon with the buildings and the horizon.\" One thing the supermoon isn't: rare. We're finishing 2016 with a sequence of three supermoons, on Oct. 16, Nov. 14 and Dec. 14. But the one in the middle is unusually close and completely full. \"I'm hoping that this will get people to go outside and look at the moon a bit more,\" Faherty says, \"because it's fun to go out and know, as you're standing there and looking up, that it's closer to you than it's been in quite a long time.\" A Place In History The last time a supermoon was this close, the year was 1948 \u2014 the same year President Harry Truman pulled off a surprising election upset of Gov. Thomas Dewey. That was one year after Hillary Clinton was born, and two after Donald Trump's birth. Back then, a gallon of gas cost 16 cents. The full moon in November also has other names. Space.com reports, \"Algonquin Native American tribes as well as American colonists called the November full moon the Beaver Moon because 'this was the time to set beaver traps before the swamps froze,'\" citing the Old Farmer's Almanac . The next Beaver Supermoon that's this close and full will be on Nov. 25, 2034. ",

Phil McCausland Taking part in her first march, Lizzy Lovinger, 28, said that as a queer woman she feared the racist, xenophobic and misogynistic rhetoric that grew out of Trump's campaign but believed this movement was encouraging. \"I think this is a really promising show of support for women, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, and for survivors of violence, and I think it is important to be here and be part of that support,\" she said. Between chants like \"We are the popular vote,\" Madeline Mendez, 50, said she knew many of her immigrant neighbors were worried that they could be deported and separated from their children. As a lifelong New Yorker who grew up in East Harlem, she said, she had never seen a protest like this. Anti-Trump protesters march down West 59th Street in New York City on Sunday. Phil McCausland \"It's not only the blacks and Hispanics. It's everybody: caucasians, Jews, Muslims \u2014 it's everybody sticking together,\" Mendez said. \"I felt like we were going backward [after the election], but in reality: we're not.\" New York police estimated that 25,000 turned out Saturday. They chanted phrases such as \"We reject the president-elect.\" Protests were also held in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, Miami, Birmingham, Alabama, and Fresno, California, among other places. Police in Portland, Oregon, said they used tear gas and \"diversionary bang devices\" to make 71 arrests during an \"unpermitted\" march Saturday, a day after a protester was shot in a confrontation on a bridge. Two people were arrested in connection with the shooting. Protesters throwing burning road flares at police at Broadway & Stark.

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times \u201cThis morning,\u201d another wrote, \u201cI started mentally planning how I would react if someone were to refer to me as the N word. It has already happened to 3 of my friends.\u201d Ms. Dodson had tapped out her own message: \u201cThe vast majority of my daughter\u2019s DC Public Schools PreK classmates are the children of immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are 3 and 4 year olds! I am so frightened.\u201d In some ways, the echo chamber was the winner of this election. Here we are, deeply connected. And yet red America is typing away to red America, and blue America is typing away to blue America. The day after the election, some people said the echo chamber had begun to feel like a prison. I called Ms. Haun and Ms. Dodson and thanked them for letting me hang out in their social spaces. Ms. Dodson said that she had two or three Facebook friends who supported Mr. Trump, but no real-life friends who did, and that she had been trying to get out of her bubble. \u201dI have this suspicion that I have no idea what\u2019s going on in the rest of white America,\u201d she said. Ms. Haun has a few friends who support Mrs. Clinton, but they largely avoid talking about politics online, she said. She was less concerned than Ms. Dodson about getting trapped in a loop of ideas. \u201cWe want to be inclusive in our echo chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone wants to come in, come on in.\u201d JULIE TURKEWITZ In Power, but Still Not Elite NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Perhaps the best way to understand \u201cthe elite\u201d that Mr. Trump railed against is to consider what it is not \u2014 or at least how it differs from the way Clinton supporters might see it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Elite does not simply mean having a lot of money. Mr. Trump, who inherited millions, is not considered an elite sellout by his supporters any more than Edward J. Snowden is considered a tool of the government for having worked at the National Security Agency. Rather, the thinking goes, it\u2019s because Mr. Trump knows how it all works that he is in the best position to take it all apart. \u201cThe people he hung around, with all those wealthy folks and how they manipulated everything,\u201d made him uniquely qualified, said Pat Bruce, a conservative activist in the suburbs of Jackson, Miss., who grew excited about the Trump campaign when she saw that \u201che never changed what he said to fit what they wanted him to say.\u201d Photo At a diner in Erie, Pa. Erie County, reliably Democratic in the past, backed Mr. Trump this year. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Elite does not necessarily mean educated either. While university professors might be scorned as condescending eggheads, book smarts are prized when used against the bookish. While covering the 2012 Republican primary races in the Deep South, I remember conservatives crowing giddily about Newt Gingrich\u2019s ability to demolish foes in a debate. Elite is certainly not, as many on the left would argue, a function of historical advantage: being, say, a white Christian male in a country that has long made little room for anyone else. It is in some ways exactly not this. Rather, much of Mr. Trump\u2019s support arose from frustration that the majority must grant marginalized groups \u2014 immigrants, transgender people \u2014 particular protection and deference. Last year, the political leadership of Mississippi came out for the dedication of a 110-foot metal cross south of Jackson, an event at which speakers talked of taking a stand despite \u201cpeople coming against you, of course, your atheists, your critics.\u201d There, in the most religious state in the country, atheists are an extreme minority. But they are the ones who ignite the court battles, who mean no prayers at high school football games, who must be accommodated. This is, to many, what constitutes the elite: the people who set the cultural and societal norms, and who do so without their input or influence. Across Trump-supporting social media this week, some were celebrating but many others \u2014 including the president-elect himself \u2014 were expressing deep frustration . Even after a stunning victory, they saw themselves being described as bigoted and unenlightened. And even with the Republicans having achieved near-total control of all levels of government, this remained an aggravating conundrum: The elites are still the ones who decide who gets to be elite. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 11, 2016 Guided by Religion Religion is a purple state. There were indeed plenty of religious folks cheering at Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, but there were plenty of clergy members who fought hard to elect Mrs. Clinton. Advertisement Continue reading the main story White evangelicals stuck with Mr. Trump. Exit polls show that 81 percent voted for him, more than either of the past two Republican presidential candidates drew. Majorities of Mormons and white Catholics, as well as many mainline Protestants, also supported Mr. Trump, undeterred by his offensive language and harsh perspectives on Mexicans, Muslims and the disabled. Photo Supporters prayed before a Trump event in Panama City Beach, Fla., in October. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times In interviews this year, I often heard bewilderment and resentment from these believers at the pace of cultural and demographic change. Still reeling from last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision to legalize gay marriage, they felt pummeled this year when the Obama administration set rules for transgender students in school bathrooms . They were disturbed to see businesses setting aside prayer rooms for Muslims when Christians were not allowed to recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer at high school graduation. Mr. Trump told them he was their \u201clast chance\u201d to protect their religious liberty and limit abortion \u2014 and many believed it. The Clinton camp included many evangelicals, but they were predominantly black, Latino, Asian and female. Her supporters also included two-thirds of Latino Catholics and four in 10 white Catholics; Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities; and those who say they have no religious affiliation. Photo A church service that Hillary Clinton attended last week in Philadelphia. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times These voters are also guided by religious and moral values, but they arrive at a completely different destination than do conservatives. Their concerns are poverty, economic inequality, immigration, health care, criminal justice reform, voting rights, gay and transgender rights, reproductive choice , climate change and environmental protection. The Rev. William Barber II, a black minister and civil rights leader in North Carolina, held \u201c moral revivals \u201d in 22 states this year with three friends: the Rev. James A. Forbes, the Rev. Traci Blackmon and Sister Simone Campbell. After the election, Mr. Barber\u2019s Twitter feed went silent until Friday, when he put out a stream of posts. \u201cThis is where we redouble our commitment to be instruments of truth, love, and justice,\u201d he wrote, rallying people of faith to lead the way in resisting the Trump administration. LAURIE GOODSTEIN As ugly as it is we must see the sickness of our country openly and clearly. \u2014         Rev. Dr. Barber (@RevDrBarber) Nov. 11, 2016 Seeing a Nation Under Siege A Trump supporter called me Thursday to criticize my coverage of the president-elect\u2019s immigration policies. He pointed to it as an example of egregious bias that he said had led the news media to miss the groundswell of support that lifted Mr. Trump to victory. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His tone was hostile at first, but we got to talking. The supporter, Douglas Freeman, a 67-year-old retired postal worker from Knoxville, Tenn., explained why Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to raise a border wall and punish cities that protect immigrants here illegally resonated with his view of the United States as a nation under siege \u2014 from outside and within. \u201cHe speaks with conviction and passion,\u201d Mr. Freeman said of Mr. Trump, \u201cand he is obviously an American patriot who is very upset with the political ruling class, which is selling our sovereignty out to globalism.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen he said Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, we stood up and cheered.\u201d Photo Construction last week of a fence along the border with Mexico, near Sunland Park, N.M. Credit Christian Torres/Associated Press For Mr. Freeman, Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt immigration talk signified that he was a true rebel who would take on the powers that be, including in the Republican Party. \u201cWe have a two-party duopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to destroy this country by importing armies of people who will vote to keep the checks flowing from the federal government.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speech to a Brazilian bank, in which she said open borders throughout the Western Hemisphere were \u201cmy dream\u201d \u2014 an excerpt that was released by WikiLeaks \u2014 confirmed that for Mr. Freeman. In covering immigration for The Times, I\u2019ve been to the southwest border many times in recent years. I have not seen the wide-open boundary Mr. Freeman depicts. There are 700 miles of walls and fences, 17,000 Border Patrol agents, and drones and aerial cameras. Homeland Security officials said last week that they were detaining more than 41,000 immigrants and opening jails for more.

Argus Leader 8:54 p.m. EST November 13, 2016 x Share Spurred by fear and outrage, protesters around the country rallied and marched Friday as they have done daily since Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory. (Nov. 11) AP Dakota Access Pipeline protesters link arms during a demonstration outside of a pipeline staging area County Road 82 in Mandan, N.D. on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016. The peaceful protest ended without any arrests made despite heavy law enforcement presence at the staging area. (Photo: Josh Morgan for Argus Leader Meda) CANNONBALL, N.D. \u2014\u00a0Amy Lewis was driving through South Dakota when she got the news. She switched on her car radio on election night to hear that Democrat Hillary Clinton was losing must-win states, that Donald Trump was about to become president-elect of the United States, and that Republicans would retain control of both houses of Congress. Lewis began to cry. She\u2019d been on her way to Oceti Sakowin, one of three camps set up near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. 4 ways the Dakota Access Pipeline could be stopped Trump has pledged to expand fossil fuel exploration, owns stock in the pipeline and took campaign contributions from a pipeline executive. \u201cI was like everyone else \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Lewis, a member of the Ponca tribe of Nebraska who lives in Austin, Texas. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to come. Stopping any of this with a Republican house and Senate is going to be next to impossible.\u201d But then Lewis called her mother, who opposes the pipeline but had worried for her daughter\u2019s safety. \u201cShe said, \u2018I want you to be there now, more than I ever have,'\u201d Lewis said. Lewis completed her journey the next day and soon found herself surrounded by well over 1,000 people at a camp that appeared unmoved by the ascendancy of a pro-oil president-elect. A Dakota Access Pipeline protester leads more than a hundred others down County Road 82 during a demonstration outside of a pipeline staging area in Mandan, N.D. on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Josh Morgan/Argus Leader) Actions continued as the week drew to a close. Protesters blocked Highway 6 northwest of the camp Friday and locked arms at the entrance to a Dakota Access staging area just west of Mandan on Saturday. Organizers have been planning a series of demonstrations nationwide Tuesday since before the election. The goal of those 153 events nationwide \u2014 including one at Standing Rock with activist Robert Kennedy\u00a0Jr. \u2014 is to push President Obama to take action to delay or stop the 1,172-mile project through executive action. That message is more urgent now, said Jade Begay, an organizer on the ground at Oceti Sakowin who works with the Indigenous Environmental Network. \u201cOur fight has gotten a lot harder, but it actually makes us stronger,\u201d Begay said. \u201cThis is our time to put pressure on President Obama.\u201d Rubber bullet strikes camerawoman at Dakota pipeline protest The Obama administration took action this fall, but the decisions lacked finality. Three federal agencies forced the delay of an easement to drill beneath Lake Oahe to complete the final 90-115 feet of North Dakota construction in September, just hours after a judge ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had properly consulted Standing Rock on the project\u2019s potential impact to culturally sensitive sites. Obama said a re-route was on the table earlier this month, but the Justice Department said Thursday it plans to offer a \u201cpath forward\u201d on the easement. Trump\u2019s election has given pipeline supporters hope for an end to such rhetoric, and with good reason. Drummers lead a group of Dakota Access Pipeline protesters to the Oceti Sakowin campground after a special ceremony honoring Native American veterans took place on N.D. Highway 1806 on Friday, Nov. 11, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Josh Morgan/Argus Leader) Trump has between $500,000 and $1 million invested in the pipeline, according to a financial disclosure form filed with the Federal Election Commission before Nov. 8. Kelcy Warren, CEO of Dakota Access operator Energy Transfer Partners, contributed $103,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump\u2019s priorities for his first 100 days include a re-start to the stalled Keystone XL pipeline and an across-the-board expansion of oil, coal and natural gas production. In a call with analysts last week, Warren called Trump\u2019s commitment to infrastructure \u201crefreshing.\u201d None of that news has slowed the steady growth of the North Dakota opposition camps. The flags of hundreds of indigenous tribes worldwide fly in the right-of-way along Highway 1806 leading to Oceti Sakowin and line the well-traveled dirt paths that weave through it. All day and all night, a sacred fire burns, prayers are spoken or sung over the beat of traditional drums and campers paint banners bearing phrases like \u201cNoDAPL,\u201d \u201cWater is Life\u201d or \u201cDefend the Sacred.\u201d The camp has\u00a0grown markedly in the past two weeks, Begay said, with at least 20 new large tipis erected and the placement of additional solar panels for electricity. A wooden enclosure for the camp\u2019s water supply is rising just south of the sacred fire and yurts are popping up all along the grounds to prepare for the coming winter. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely grown,\u201d Begay said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s lost spirit.\u201d Sonny Iron Cloud, 25, has watched the growth, as well. He left Sioux Falls to come home to Standing Rock a few months ago. Amy Lewis of Austin, Texas, left, and other Dakota Access Pipeline protesters relax at their campsite at the Oceti Sakowin campground near Cannon Ball, N.D. on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Josh Morgan) He\u2019s left the camp a few times since then, and each time he\u2019s returned to find larger crowds, particularly on Saturdays and Sundays. \u201cIt gets really packed here on the weekends,\u201d Iron Cloud said. Iron Cloud didn\u2019t see any sort of exodus after the election Tuesday \u2014 or even a slowing of the visitors to the tipi where he and a group of young men care for a handful of Crow Creek Reservation horses. \u201cPeople stayed,\u201d Iron Cloud said. \u201cPeople are here until the end.\u201d Philadelphia-born Joe Kirby, 31, arrived Thursday from Portland, Ore. Kirby spent months working with Occupy Philadelphia activists in 2011 and says he\u2019s ready to stay in North Dakota as long as he can be useful to the cause. \u201cNow it seems bigger,\u201d Kirby said of Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cIf anything, it makes me even more committed to change things.\u201d Twelve students from Linfield College in McMinville, Ore.,\u00a0arrived Friday to volunteer. They\u2019d planned their trip in a Linfield vehicle 10 days before learning the election\u2019s outcome. Sarah Stark, a 21-year-old senior, was disappointed in the outcome, but it didn\u2019t detract from their desire to \u201cdo something beyond online activism\u201d to help the protest movement. \u201cI think it gave our group more of a reason to come,\u201d Stark said.

Highway 1806 near Cannon Ball, N.D. on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Josh Morgan) Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II formally responded to Trump\u2019s election Wednesday, urging President Obama to \u201cset a lasting and true legacy and respect the sovereignty and treaty rights of Standing Rock and tribal nations across the U.S.\u201d On Friday, however, Archambault II took a conciliatory tone, saying the tribe is ready to work with anyone on the issue of alternative, renewable energy. \u201cWhen the new president made his speech, he said, \u2018We need to unify,\u2019\u201d Archambault II said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at that and saying we can take the good with the bad.\u201d The bad is expected in tribal communities, he said. Historically, the election of one presidential candidate over another has made scant difference in the day-to-day lives of indigenous communities. Democrats and Republicans alike have overlooked tribal struggles and sidestepped tribal sovereignty for hundreds of years. \u201cWe understand that there is a lot at stake with this new president, but when you think of the Great Sioux Nation, we\u2019ve had a lot of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived with high poverty rates regardless of who the president is.\u201d Follow John Hult on Twitter:\u00a0@ArgusJHultor ",

By Katie Zezima , Dan Balz and Chris Cillizza November 13 at 4:46 PM Follow @katiezez Follow @danbalz Follow @thefix Donald Trump speaks with Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in March. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as\u00a0his chief of staff, according to Trump's campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider\u00a0who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party. Priebus was recommended by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and will be a bridge between the White House and the Republican-led Congress, as well as the heads of Cabinet agencies. [ The next big political fight could be between Trump and Republicans ] The choice signals Trump's willingness to work within the very establishment he assailed on the campaign trail. Priebus, a lawyer and longtime Wisconsin political operative, has been head of the RNC since 2011 and is well liked within Washington after years of forging ties with Republican leaders and lawmakers. He will undoubtedly start to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a \u201cstar.\u201d Trump had the chance to go in the opposite direction in picking his chief of staff: His antagonistic campaign chief executive and head of Brietbart News, Steve Bannon, also was said to be in the running for the job.\u00a0Bannon will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor instead. As head of\u00a0Breitbart News, Bannon launched political attacks against Ryan and other Republican leaders, assailing them as weak and ineffective, during the campaign.\u00a0Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, also was believed to be in the running. [ How the Republican Party created Donald Trump ] Priebus had a few clashes with Trump during the campaign; after the 2005 tape was released, Priebus slammed Trump, stating, \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d But his main goal has been to unite his party. Since Trump's victory, Priebus said, the president-elect\u00a0has worked to move away from his divisive campaign rhetoric. \u201cOnce it was determined he was going to be the winner, he started looking at and thinking about that speech,\u201d Priebus said on Fox News of Trump's victory speech on Tuesday. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re going to calm the waters. We\u2019re going to bring people together. We\u2019re not going to brag.' \u201d He added that Trump is a \u201creflective person\u201d and that his public persona at rallies does not represent the complete man. \u201cThe guy in private is the gracious, personable guy that I\u2019ve gotten to know.\u00a0\u2026 I think that\u2019s part of the reason why he won,\u201d Priebus said. Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who is on Trump's transition team, said the president-elect can work with both sides of the aisle in Congress \u2014 something Priebus will no doubt help smooth. \u201cTrump has got to be the salesman,\u201d Gingrich said on CBS's \u201cFace the Nation. \u201cTake something big like infrastructure. He can work with [Senate Democratic leader] Chuck Schumer on infrastructure. He can find a bipartisan path that allows us to dramatically improve infrastructure, something Trump knows an immense amount about.\u201d politics ",

I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects. Donald Trump:\u2013and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But-- Lesley Stahl: Like-- Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation. \u201cI think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually not. I\u2019m a very sober person.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it. Donald Trump: Well, he didn\u2019t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that. Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or-- Donald Trump: No, I think I\u2019m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually not. I\u2019m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found\u2014it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting. [Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.] Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you\u2019ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you\u2019re-- unqualified-- Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like? Lesley Stahl: Yeah. Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other\u2014 Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness? Donald Trump: I\u2019ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that\u2019s strange. I\u2019m actually surprised to tell you that. It\u2019s-- you know, a little bit strange. Donald Trump appears in his first extensive post-election with 60 Minutes\u2019 Lesley Stahl. Close [Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.] Lesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency? Donald Trump: No, I think it\u2019s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They\u2019ve let \u2018em down on the job front. They\u2019ve even let \u2018em down in terms of the war front. You know, we\u2019ve been fighting this war for 15 years-- Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign. Donald Trump: We\u2019ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what\u2019s been taking place over a longer period of time than that. Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president? Donald Trump: You know, I\u2019ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it\u2019s going to be America first. It\u2019s not going to be what we\u2019re doing\u2014we, we\u2019ve lost-- we\u2019re losing this country. We\u2019re losing this country. That\u2019s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in? \u00a0Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don\u2019t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be. Lesley Stahl: Can you be? Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that\u2019s easier. Honestly to do that, it\u2019s easier. Lesley Stahl: So let\u2019s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you\u2019re going to do what you said or you\u2019re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall? \u00a0Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley Stahl: They\u2019re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence? Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction. Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence? Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be \u2013 it could be some fencing. Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants? Donald Trump: \u00a0What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we\u2019re getting them out of our country, they\u2019re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that you\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it\u2019s very important, we want to secure our border. [Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.] Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away? Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We\u2019re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes-- Lesley Stahl: And you\u2019ve got both Houses? Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things-- Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split. Donald Trump: It\u2019s been a long time since it\u2019s happened. Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don\u2019t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed. Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money. Donald Trump: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team\u2014 Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that? \u00a0Donald Trump: I don\u2019t like it, no. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: You don\u2019t like it, but your own transition team, it\u2019s filled with lobbyists. \u00a0Donald Trump: That\u2019s the only people you have down there. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby. Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody\u2019s a lobbyist down there-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Well, wait \u00a0Donald Trump: That\u2019s what they are. They\u2019re lobbyists or special interests\u2014 Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team. \u00a0Donald Trump:\u2013we are trying to clean up Washington. Look-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: How can you claim-- \u00a0Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that\u2019s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we\u2019re going to clean it up. We\u2019re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we\u2019re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren\u2019t happy about, but we\u2019re putting on term limits. We\u2019re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist. Lesley Stahl: But you\u2019re, but you\u2019re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them? Donald Trump: I\u2019m saying that they know the system right now, but we\u2019re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Let\u2019s talk about your cabinet. \u00a0Donald Trump: OK. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions? \u00a0Donald Trump: Yes. Donald Trump: Well, I can\u2019t tell you that, but I have made-- Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on\u2014 Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I\u2019ve spoken to many of them and I\u2019ll call the rest of them, but and I said, \u201cBoy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.\u201d France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia\u2014and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country. Lesley Stahl: One of the things you\u2019re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you\u2019ll do that quickly? Donald Trump: Yes. Very important. Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade? Donald Trump: So look, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen-- I\u2019m going to-- I\u2019m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They\u2019ll be very\u2014 Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law-- Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They\u2019ll be pro-life, they\u2019ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody\u2019s talking about the Second Amendment and they\u2019re trying to dice it up and change it, they\u2019re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won\u2019t be able to get an abortion? \u00a0Donald Trump: No, it\u2019ll go back to the states. Lesley Stahl: By state\u2014no some -- \u00a0Donald Trump: Yeah. \u00a0Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they\u2019ll perhaps have to go, they\u2019ll have to go to another state. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: And that\u2019s OK? Donald Trump: Well, we\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you\u2019re taking on? \u00a0Donald Trump: No. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Not at all? \u00a0Donald Trump: I respect it. But I\u2019m not scared by it. Lesley Stahl: Now you\u2019re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric-- Donald Trump: That\u2019s only because they don\u2019t know me. I really believe that\u2019s only because-- Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that\u2019s-- Donald Trump: I just don\u2019t think they know me. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they\u2019re demonstrating against? Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are\u2014 \u00a0Donald Trump: Well Lesley\u2014 \u00a0Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah-- Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about \u2013 they\u2019re in every city. Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don\u2019t you say to yourself, I guess you don\u2019t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They\u2019re afraid. \u00a0Donald Trump: I would tell them don\u2019t be afraid, absolutely. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d President-elect Donald J. Trump \u00a0Lesley Stahl: But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying, I said it- \u00a0Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I\u2019ve been saying it. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: OK. Donald Trump: Don\u2019t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don\u2019t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here. It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton\u2019s edge in the popular vote, have been significant. When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name\u2026 or against his supporters.\u00a0 Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters. Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that-- Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it? Donald Trump: I don\u2019t hear it\u2014I saw, I saw one or two instances\u2026 Lesley Stahl: On social media? Donald Trump: But I think it\u2019s a very small amount. Again, I think it\u2019s-- Trump addresses reports of violence: \"Stop it\" Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people? Donald Trump: I would say don\u2019t do it, that\u2019s terrible, \u2018cause I\u2019m gonna bring this country together. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: They\u2019re harassing Latinos, Muslims-- Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u201cStop it.\u201d If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it. During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email issue. So we asked him if he plans to carry that out. That part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back. The First Lady President-elect Donald Trump and future first lady Melania Trump Close CBS News On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.\u00a0 Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That\u2019s 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks. When we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in.\u00a0 He was subdued.\u00a0 We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame. Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators. Donald Trump: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals\u2014and you said it was unfair. Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are -- Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you\u2019re upset about just put out there when you\u2019re president? Donald Trump: So it\u2019s a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people-- Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up? Donald Trump: It\u2019s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I\u2019ll give it up entirely and throw out, that\u2019s a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I\u2019m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I\u2019m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, \u2018cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That\u2019s very tough-- Lesley Stahl: But you\u2019re going to do that as president? President-elect Donald Trump and future first lady Melania Trump sat down with Lesley Stahl in New York City on Friday, Nov. 11, 2016. Close Chris Albert Donald Trump: I\u2019m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I\u2019m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It\u2019s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It\u2019s-- it\u2019s where it\u2019s at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they\u2019re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that. Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail? Special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton? Donald Trump: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do, I\u2019m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we\u2019ve been talking about. Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you-- Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away. Lesley Stahl: You called her \u201ccrooked Hillary,\u201d said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \u201cLock em\u2019 up.\u201d Donald Trump: Yeah. She did-- Lesley Stahl: Do you\u2014 Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things-- Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might\u2026 Donald Trump: I don\u2019t want to hurt them. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. They\u2019re, they\u2019re good people. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together. With that\u2026 [Donald Trump: You look great, honey.] We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She\u2019ll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She\u2019s from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams\u2019 wife Louisa was the first.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You\u2019re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little-- Future first lady Melania Trump Close CBS News Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it\u2019s-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it\u2019s-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I\u2019m very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart. Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she\u2019s going to be? Donald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she\u2019s very warm. And I think she\u2019ll have a platform where she\u2019ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that\u2019s what she wants to do. Lesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you\u2019ve already said you\u2019re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media. Melania Trump: I think it\u2019s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way. It\u2019s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign. Melania Trump speaks up if husband crosses line Lesley Stahl: What about your husband\u2019s tweeting? Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following. Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, \u201cCome on\u201d? Melania Trump: I did. Donald Trump: She does-- Melania Trump: I-- Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But\u2026 Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you? Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn\u2019t-- Donald Trump: I\u2019m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don\u2019t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across. Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him? Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time. Lesley Stahl: All the time? Melania Trump: All the time. Lesley Stahl: And does-- Melania Trump: And-- Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he-- Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He\u2019s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it. Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval? Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he\u2019s affected every bit as much. Maybe more. Lesley Stahl: Maybe more. Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, \u201cI would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.\u201d And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed. Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10? Melania Trump: 10. Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know? Melania Trump: He knows. He knows-- Lesley Stahl: He knows? Melania Trump: --what\u2019s going on. And, he\u2019s very proud of his dad. Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given-- Melania Trump: No. Lesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign? Melania Trump: No. I didn\u2019t feel it. Lesley Stahl: Not at all? Melania Trump: No. Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting. Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice. Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That\u2019s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right? Melania Trump: They\u2019re here. Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you? Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that. Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair\u2019s out of place. Are you both prepared for this? Melania Trump: We are used to it. Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, \u2018cause I\u2019ve had a lot. But I\u2019ve never had anything like this. Lesley Stahl: You won\u2019t be able to walk down the street-- Melania Trump: I didn\u2019t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It\u2019s another level, but it will continue. At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces. Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation? Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don\u2019t-- I haven\u2019t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think -- Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much? Donald Trump: Well, there\u2019s been a lotta leaking, there\u2019s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I\u2019d answer a question like that. Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you\u2019re not sure. Donald Trump: Well, sure, I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns? Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I\u2019m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn\u2019t care because I won the election very easily. So they don\u2019t care. I never thought they did care. Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy. Donald Trump: I do. Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it\u2019s rigged? Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College. Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think-- Donald Trump: You know, it\u2019s-- Lesley Stahl: --it\u2019s rigged? Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated-- Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you\u2019re saying that-- Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I\u2019m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There\u2019s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there\u2019s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system. Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? You\u2019re not going to take any vacations? You\u2019ve said that. Donald Trump: We have so much work. There\u2019s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We\u2019re lowering taxes, we\u2019re taking care of health care. I mean, there\u2019s just so much to be done. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be very big on vacations, no. Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president\u2019s salary? Donald Trump: Well, I\u2019ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I\u2019ll take $1 a year. But it\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t even know what it is. Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is? Lesley Stahl: $400,000 you\u2019re giving up. Donald Trump: No, I\u2019m not gonna take the salary. I\u2019m not taking it. In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS . The Trump Family Lesley Stahl spoke with President-elect Donald Trump and his family, including Melania, Ivanka, Tiffany, Eric and Donald, Jr.\u00a0 Close Chris Albert On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America\u2019s ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency.\u00a0 They feel their America hasn\u2019t been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again. But Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal wasn\u2019t just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest. Hillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women.\u00a0 Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president.\u00a0 Her base didn\u2019t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump\u2019s new and energized coalition. On Friday Mr. Trump\u2019s four older children \u2013 Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father\u2019s surprising victory. Lesley Stahl: Set the scene. It\u2019s election night. Your father-- no one\u2019s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room. ",

    "text": "AP November 12, 2016, 8:15 PM Border Patrol agents sent to Texas to deal with spike in illegal entry U.S. Border Patrol agents detain undocumented immigrants after they crossed the border from Mexico into the United States Aug. 7, 2015, in McAllen, Texas. John Moore/Getty Images Email DINBURG, Texas -- About 150 Border Patrol agents will be deployed to South Texas from Arizona, California and elsewhere to help process a spike in immigrants who have been apprehended after illegally entering the U.S., federal officials announced Saturday. Agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego will be temporarily reassigned to the Rio Grande Valley, and agents working another portion of the Texas border will join them, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. The number of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is growing, in part because of the presidential election. Manuel Bojorquez repor... The additional agents will assist with screening and processing immigrants taken into custody along the border, many of whom are unaccompanied children and families. Hundreds of thousands of people have sought asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border in the last two years, and the majority are Central American families who often turn themselves in as opposed to mostly Mexican men trying to evade capture, according to a federal report obtained last month by The Associated Press. Since 2014, the Rio Grande Valley has led the nation as the region with the most apprehensions of immigrants entering the U.S. illegally. Asylum seekers, many of them fleeing drug-fueled violence south of the border, peaked in 2014 at 170,000, nearly triple the 63,000 who arrived the previous year. Before 2012, there were fewer than 30,000 a year. Leaders in the South Texas city of McAllen said earlier this month that they\u2019re struggling to provide services and noted that October was the busiest month since 2014 for a church support center, with more than 5,600 immigrants offered assistance. The city and local groups have spent nearly $1 million over two years to provide showers, tents and other needs, Mayor Jim Darling told The Monitor newspaper. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story The grass-roots activists may be angered by the selection of Mr. Priebus as chief of staff, viewing him as a deal maker who will be too eager to push the new president toward compromise on issues like taxes, immigration, trade, health care and the environment. In a statement Sunday afternoon, the transition team emphasized that the two men would work \u201cas equal partners to transform the federal government.\u201d That simultaneous announcement is consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s management style in his businesses and in his campaign: creating rival power structures beneath him and encouraging them to battle it out. It is also a reflection of who has the ear of the president-elect: his children, and especially Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both of them had argued that the chief of staff job should not be held by someone too controversial, according to several people familiar with the decision-making inside the transition effort. Mr. Kushner is likely to wield great influence over the new president regardless of whether he holds a formal title. Mr. Kushner, who has no experience in politics or government, often gets the final word in advising Mr. Trump. But while Mr. Trump apparently feels comfortable with Mr. Priebus, the people with knowledge of his weekend decision said that Mr. Bannon was still the adviser who was better able to talk forcefully to the president-elect during difficult moments. The transition team appeared eager to appease concerns among Mr. Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters that choosing Mr. Priebus meant that the president-elect had already caved to the Washington \u201cswamp\u201d he had promised to drain. The team also wanted to mollify Mr. Bannon, and to that end, the official statement mentioned Mr. Bannon first. \u201cWe had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in the statement. \u201cWe will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Priebus said he looked forward to working with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump \u201cto create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Mr. Priebus is expected to have multiple deputies, including Katie Walsh, the chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, who is close to Mr. Priebus and helped ensure a tight working relationship between the party\u2019s operational infrastructure and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. A list of possibilities for key posts in the new administration. A onetime Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Bannon has transformed himself into a media figure who favors a scorched-earth style of politics and is deeply suspicious of the government establishment and the corporate elite. During the campaign, he pushed Mr. Trump to embrace a fierce populism that helped fuel his victory. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last summer to put Mr. Bannon in charge of his campaign was part of an effort to reset a candidacy that had suffered from controversies surrounding high-level campaign officials. But Mr. Bannon is viewed with alarm by many, including some Republicans. Anna Navarro, a longtime Republican strategist who opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign, said on Twitter on Sunday: \u201cOh, hell! White supremacist, anti gay, anti Semite, vindictive, scary-ass dude named Senior Strategist.

The Albany Times-Union says hundreds of people were evacuated and the mall was locked down. (AP Photo/Michael Groll) 0 Shares Email Hundreds of shoppers at a crowded mall fled in panic amid gunfire that erupted near an Apple store in suburban Albany. There were no immediate reports of injuries in the violent melee Saturday at Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, Police Chief Carol Lawlor said. More than 100 officers with assault rifles were deployed \"because a shooter may still be in the mall,\" she said about six hours after the shooting. Witnesses told law enforcement authorities they heard one, possibly two, shots fired at about 2:30 p.m. near the Apple store on the street level, Lawlor said. Authorities with SWAT teams were searching for suspects into the night, the chief said. Police locked down the mall, one of the largest in New York, with 250 stores and restaurants. Both shoppers and employees already inside businesses were instructed to shelter in place. A police helicopter flew overhead while investigators checked security cameras for clues they hoped would lead to suspects. They were examining footage that showed a man in a white shirt and black hoodie near the shooting scene. State Police Maj. Bill Keeler told the Albany Times-Union that reports suggested a possible confrontation between two men who fled. Mall management is working with authorities, Lawlor said, \"and hopefully we'll bring this to a successful conclusion.\" She said the mall could open Sunday, \"but we're not done yet.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show the police chief's last name is Lawlor, not Lawlar and the shopping mall is Crossgates, not Crosslands. 0 Shares ",

By Amy B Wang November 13 at 4:03 PM Follow @amybwang (CBS/YouTube) In a \"60 Minutes\u201d interview scheduled to air Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants who \u201chave criminal records\u201d after his inauguration next January. \u201cWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,\u201d Trump told \"60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl, according to a preview of the interview released by CBS . \u201cBut we\u2019re getting them out of our country. They\u2019re here illegally.\u201d Stahl had pressed Trump about his campaign pledge to deport \u201cmillions and millions of undocumented immigrants.\u201d Trump told her that after securing the border, his administration would make a \u201cdetermination\u201d on the remaining undocumented immigrants in the country. \u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about \u2014 who are terrific people. They\u2019re terrific people, but we are gonna make a determination at that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut before we make that determination . . . it\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.\u201d His comments echoed those he had made at the start of his campaign : \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\u201d Trump had said last June when he announced his candidacy. \u201cThey're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s fuzzy math on undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes ] According to The Washington Post Fact Checker , Trump likely gets these estimates from\u00a0a Department of Homeland Security fiscal 2013 report \u00a0saying there were 1.9 million \u201cremovable criminal aliens.\u201d However, that figure includes undocumented immigrants and people who are lawful permanent residents, or those who have temporary visas. As for how many of those people are illegally present noncitizens, there are conflicting figures from the think tank Migration Policy Institute and the Center for Immigration Studies.\u00a0In a fact check, The Post rated Trump's figures \u201cTwo Pinocchios,\u201d noting that federal immigration enforcement data is \u201cnot always transparent or reliable.\u201d Trump's campaign promises \u00a0also\u00a0included fully repealing the Affordable Care Act, forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall and banning Muslims from entering the U.S. Since winning the election, Trump and his key advisers have been backing away from some of those promises , and Republican leaders who made\u00a0the Sunday political-show circuit seemed to approach the issue of mass deportations more cautiously. \u201cI think it\u2019s difficult to do,\u201d Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday earlier Sunday morning . \u201cFirst thing you have to do is secure the border, and then we\u2019ll have discussions.\u201d McCarthy also hedged on the border wall, saying Republicans were focused on \u201csecuring the southern border\u201d but with the aid of technology rather than necessarily a full-length brick-and-mortar wall. [ Bob Woodward: President-elect Donald Trump is about to learn the nation\u2019s \u2018deep secrets\u2019 ] House speaker Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told Jake Tapper on CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that securing the border was their top priority. \u201cWe are not planning on erecting a deportation force,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cDonald Trump is not planning on that.\u201d Regarding his border wall plans, Trump told Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\u201d that he would accept fencing along some of the border, as Republicans in Congress have proposed. \u201cFor certain areas, I would. But for certain areas a wall is more appropriate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI'm very good at this. It's called construction.\u201d On Thursday, former House speaker Newt Gingrich admitted that Trump would likely not focus on getting Mexico to pay for the wall, as the candidate had promised during his campaign, but that it had been \u201c a great campaign device .\u201d CBS had released on Saturday two preview clips of same \"60 Minutes\u201d segment, Trump's first televised interview since winning the election last week. Seated with his wife, Melania, and his four adult children, Trump spoke to Stahl about his seemingly shifting\u00a0position on the Affordable Care Act, saying he would try to preserve key parts of the health care act, and also praised Hillary Clinton as \u201cvery strong and very smart.\u201d Trump told Stahl that Clinton's phone call conceding the election was \u201clovely\u201d and acknowledged that making the phone call was likely \u201ctougher for her than it would have been for me,\u201d according to previews of the interview released by CBS . \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, 'Congratulations, Donald, well done,' \" Trump told Stahl. \u201cAnd I said, 'I want to thank you very much. You were a great competitor.' She is very strong and very smart.\u201d Trump's tone in the interview was in sharp contrast to his bitter attacks on the campaign trail, in which he nicknamed Clinton \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and encouraged chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at his rallies . Among other insults, Trump also referred to his competitor as \u201c the devil ,\u201d \u201c a bigot \u201d and \u2014 at the tail end of the final presidential debate \u2014 \u201c such a nasty woman .\u201d At a rally in Pueblo, Colo., Oct. 3, Republican presidential candidate accused former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of making \"a deal with the devil.\" Sanders is now supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. (The Washington Post) [ Key appointments to set tone for Trump presidency ] Trump also told Stahl that former president Bill Clinton called him the following day and \u201ccouldn't have been more gracious.\u201d \u201cHe said it was an amazing run \u2014 one of the most amazing he's ever seen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was very, very, really, very nice.\u201d During the campaign, Trump had tried to use Bill Clinton's infidelities as a way to attack and embarrass Hillary Clinton. For the second presidential debate, Trump had sought to intimidate his competitor by inviting women who had accused the former president of sexual abuse to sit in the Trump family box . Debate officials quashed the idea. In the interview with Stahl, Trump did not rule out calling both of the Clintons for advice during his term. \u201cI mean, this is a very talented family,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, I would certainly think about that.\u201d Trump also reiterated on \"60 Minutes\u201d that he may keep portions of the Affordable Care Act, something he had mentioned he might do after meeting with President Obama in the White House on Thursday. When Stahl asked whether people with preexisting conditions would still be covered after Trump repealed and replaced the health law, Trump said they would \u201cbecause it happens to be one of the strongest assets.\u201d \u201cAlso, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we\u2019re going to . . . very much try and keep that,\u201d Trump added, referring to portions of the health care act that cover children under their parents' insurance until age 26. \u201cIt adds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re going to try and keep.\u201d When Stahl questioned whether there would be a gap between the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the implementation of a new plan that could leave millions of people uninsured, Trump interrupted her. \u201cNope. We're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. It's what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe're going to repeal and replace it. And we're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you'll know. And it will be great health care for much less money.\u201d The \"60 Minutes\u201d interview will be broadcast on CBS at 7 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, Nov. 13. 1 of 22 ",

California bullet train officials seek exemption to buy foreign parts Bullet Train Mockup Associated Press A mock-up of a bullet train nose section was parked at the state Capitol in 2015 to promote the project. A mock-up of a bullet train nose section was parked at the state Capitol in 2015 to promote the project. (Associated Press) Ralph Vartabedian Contact Reporter The California bullet train agency has begun a legal effort to import a significant amount of foreign equipment for its future Los Angeles-to-San Francisco system, a move that could prove politically controversial. The Federal Railroad Administration disclosed last week that the state\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority was\u00a0seeking exemptions from the Buy American Act\u00a0on more than a dozen critical train parts including motors, gearboxes, axles, wheels, brakes, derailment mitigation devices, undercarriages and even the entire aluminum car body shells. The rail authority\u2019s 2016 business plan estimated\u00a0the trains would cost\u00a0about $3.4 billion,\u00a0making them\u00a0one of the most expensive parts of the system. While advanced bullet trains currently cannot be made in the U.S., the exemption could make it less likely that the country\u00a0ever develops such an industry, according to academic experts and trade groups. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said the train exemptions would fall into the same \u201cdynamic\u201d as California\u2019s decision to use imported Chinese steel components for the Bay Bridge \u2014\u00a0a decision that caused engineering problems, delays and cost increases. \u201cIf this waiver is granted, it virtually guarantees that there will be no chance for a domestic high-speed rail industry to take root in this country,\u201d Paul said. \u201cCalifornia could be a nationwide leader in this industry.\u201d According to the group, a collaboration of U.S. manufacturing companies and labor unions, the original intent of the federal government investing billions of dollars into the state\u2019s high-speed rail program was to develop a domestic industry in the first place. Importing something as important as the trains could further jeopardize any chance of additional federal funding, Paul said.\u00a0\u201cI find it hard to believe that the Trump administration would fund a project that would be made in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not make it here?\u201d In a Sept. 16 \u00a0letter to Sarah Feinberg, chief of the Federal Railroad Administration,\u00a0the rail authority said that\u00a0the needed train equipment was\u00a0not being manufactured in the U.S., that safety was\u00a0at issue and trying to build the components\u00a0here would increase the cost of each train. The authority asked for a separate exemption for rail car bogies, the massive undercarriages that connect the wheels and axles to the car body.\u00a0The request indicates that the rail authority plans\u00a0eventually to assemble undercarriages\u00a0in the U.S. with foreign-made parts. The exemption application for other parts does not make that explicit commitment. \u201cThe authority has always stated that this high-speed rail project and the Buy America\u00a0provision will make it worthwhile for high-speed train manufacturers to transfer knowledge and be located in the U.S., create jobs\u00a0and deliver 21st century, state-of-the-art\u00a0trainsets,\u201d spokeswoman Lisa Marie Alley said in an email. The exemption request for high-speed electric train parts was\u00a0the second one to land at the agency, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Officials granted Amtrak a waiver last year to purchase equipment to be used on its Acela line along the East Coast. The California authority cited the Amtrak exemption as a basis for its request. Amtrak had claimed setting up a domestic factory for the components would add $2 million to the cost of each train it purchased. The authority said a \u201creview of potential risks and hazards associated with an imperfect transfer of technology\u201d could result in errors, arguing that the work should be conducted at existing facilities of foreign vendors. Matthew Lehner, a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration, said a panel of experts on safety, policy and legal matters would review the request. Even if the exemption were granted,\u00a0the trains will still have to be assembled in the U.S., he said. Lehner said the waiver \u201crepresents likely less than 20%\u201d of the cost of each train. The review includes\u00a0a public comment period that closes Nov. 28, and federal officials could take months to reach a decision. That timing leaves it unclear whether the Obama administration will act on the request or leave it to the incoming Trump administration. The Bay Bridge often is held up as an example of a poor decision to use foreign suppliers for U.S. infrastructure projects. Under a carefully crafted political deal, the bridge was divided into\u00a0two separate projects \u2014\u00a0one under federal jurisdiction close to Oakland and a central span that the state would pay for. The move bypassed the Buy American Act for the central span and allowed the bridge sections to be outsourced to China. The attempt to save money backfired and contributed to a tripling of the cost to more than $6 billion. Foreign nations often are more forceful in requiring U.S. companies to share their technology in exchange for supply contracts. Many experts say the U.S. should have even greater leverage, given the size of its economy. A 2015 study led by Robert Pollin, a University of Massachusetts-Amherst economics professor, concluded that the Buy American Act could be a significant catalyst for strengthening U.S. manufacturing, including a rail car industry. \u201cOf course, we can build high-speed rail trains,\u201d Pollin said. \u201cWe have massive manufacturing capacity.\u201d Obama administration officials\u00a0have\u00a0acknowledged that too many waivers had been granted in the past and that they intended to tighten the practice, Pollin said, adding he had found little documentation to show that that was happening. In general, state and local agencies want the waivers in order to get lowball bids on projects, he said. \u201cThe law should be seen as an opportunity to\u00a0advance U.S manufacturing,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

    "text": "2.3 pts. 3.9 pts. Mrs. Clinton tended to outperform in big, liberal states with larger Hispanic populations. That was true in battlegrounds, like New Mexico and Nevada . It was also true outside the battlegrounds, in Illinois, California, New York and Washington. Over all, the two types of misses nearly canceled out in national polls. But Mr. Trump's gains among white working-class voters were far more important, because those voters are  overrepresented in the most important battleground states. Analysts are only beginning to unpack how the polls were so off in the Midwest and Northeast. It will be hard to know until voter file data \u2014 which includes information on exactly who voted \u2014 is updated. That could take months. But there are already theories. The polls\u2019 samples might have overrepresented well educated voters. The educational composition of the electorate is one of the biggest mysteries for pollsters. It\u2019s not included in the voter file and it\u2019s hard to model (it\u2019s much harder to tell how educated people are based on their names or where they live; race is easy by comparison). Or undecided, well-educated Republican voters in the suburbs around Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Grand Rapids might have broken for Mr. Trump at a higher rate than expected. The polls may have slightly overestimated black turnout as well. Was this polling miss unusual? The size and direction of the error in 2016 was big, but not totally out of the norm. This was part of the reason we had been writing about the possibility of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and cautioning that an 85 percent chance was not a 100 percent chance. (In comparing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chances of losing to the chances that an N.F.L. kicker would miss a 37-yard field goal , we tried to give an example of a low-probability event that nevertheless still happens. See also: The Cubs rallied to win the World Series.) Should we have given Mr. Trump higher odds of winning? It\u2019s possible. The history of polling errors did not suggest so, but that history now has one more election with several consequential misses. In 2012, the state and national polls were off by a similar amount, but in the other direction. 2012 The polls systematically underestimated President Obama's support across the battleground states, and nationwide. But it didn\u2019t really matter that he won many states by a few more points than state polls suggested. If the polls had been off in the other direction by the same amount, Mitt Romney would have squeaked out a win. Below, the state polling errors in the presidential elections since 1988: 2008 ",

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times PRINCETON, N.J. \u2014 Journalism may be the first draft of history. But on Friday, a group of scholars gathered here for what might be an editing session on the second. The occasion was a small conference with the uncolorful title \u201cThe Presidency of Barack Obama: A First Historical Assessment.\u201d While it had been planned more than a year ago, the election had forced more than a few participants to look at the papers they submitted in late October \u2014 some of which referred to Donald J. Trump confidently in the past tense \u2014 and shout, \u201cGet me rewrite!\u201d \u201cAfter election night, I instantly got emails from the participants, asking if we were going to have the same discussion,\u201d Julian E. Zelizer , the Princeton historian who organized the gathering, said before the proceedings. The purpose of the two-day event, which broke down the Obama presidency into topics including inequality, counterterrorism, immigration, the Supreme Court and race, was to offer what Mr. Zelizer called a historical \u201cfirst cut,\u201d by scholars who had \u201clived and felt\u201d the events of President Obama\u2019s terms in office. (The 15 papers, after revisions and editing, will be published in a book by Princeton University Press in about a year \u2014 lightning-fast by the standards of scholarly publishing.) The mood among the overwhelmingly liberal group \u2014 in contrast to how some participants recalled a similar gathering in 2008 to assess the presidency of George W. Bush , in the giddy days after President Obama\u2019s election \u2014 was decidedly grim. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The conference turned out to be \u201cgood practice for saying \u2018the Trump presidency\u2019 without the words getting stuck in your throat,\u201d Meg Jacobs , a research scholar at Princeton, said wryly. Ms. Jacobs, whose paper discussed President Obama\u2019s energy policies, noted the degree to which many policy achievements described in the papers relied on executive action, which can be easily reversed by a subsequent president, and waved her hand: gone. During the formal discussion, the nearly two dozen scholars gathered around a square table in a sunny conference room mostly stuck to the dispassionate long view, putting President Obama in the context of broad political and social forces. But occasional bulletins from the outside world underscored the feeling of being bunkered in a scholarly equivalent of the Situation Room, tracking the loss of more and more territory. \u201cNewsflash: Paul Ryan just announced that he wants to privatize Medicare,\u201d Michael Kazin , a professor at Georgetown University, interjected during a discussion of the political implications of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s policy design. \u201cSo that will be interesting.\u201d The nearly seven hours of discussion on Friday included debate on many big-picture questions: Did the Obama presidency represent as much of a sharp break with that of George W. Bush as people might assume? Are the American people as divided as the extreme polarization of the political system suggests? What was more important to Republican political dominance: gerrymandering or conservative media? Several participants said that reading all the papers made them realize that President Obama had gotten more done, policy-wise, in the face of relentless opposition than they had thought. But at the same time, many noted, his policies had often been designed in ways that failed \u2014 fatally, it seemed in retrospect \u2014 to generate political credit. Photo Prof. Gary Gerstle of the University of Cambridge at a conference at Princeton University on Friday where scholars analyzed the presidency of Barack Obama. Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times One of the most ringing cases came from the sociologist Paul Starr , whose paper argued that President Obama, contrary to widespread belief, made significant progress in reducing income inequality, once benefits like food stamps and health care were factored in. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He also offered a progressive defense of the 2009 stimulus package , citing what he called \u201ca stunning piece of data\u201d: In the absence of the stimulus and related measures, he said, the poverty rate would have gone up by 4.5 percentage points. Instead it only went up 0.5 percentage points. If his paper was guardedly optimistic, his postelection verdict was not. \u201cI\u2019m afraid all of what he did relating to reducing inequality is going to be wiped out,\u201d he said. The theme of a \u201cstealth state\u201d \u2014 which allowed President Obama to push policies in ways that avoided triggering opposition, but also prevented building support for government action \u2014 also came up in the discussions of education and environmental policy. And there was debate about President Obama\u2019s efforts, or lack thereof, to strengthen the Democratic Party itself, and about how much personality \u2014 the X factor that academic historians, unlike journalists and most popular historians of the presidency, tend to play down \u2014 mattered to events of the last eight years. After the formal discussion wrapped, Mr. Zelizer, the author of \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society,\u201d said he found himself puzzling over the paradox of President Obama\u2019s astute political intelligence on the one hand, and his lack of attention to the partisan side of politics on the other. \u201cThat\u2019s why having this conversation after Trump makes a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really see how not taking partisan political considerations seriously enough can cost the party and the country \u2014 if you\u2019re a Democrat \u2014 a huge amount.\u201d At a group dinner on Friday night at a nearby Italian restaurant, there was plenty of wine and gallows humor. Gary Gerstle , a professor at the University of Cambridge, in a toast, jokingly proposed a theme for the group\u2019s next gathering: secession. There were comparisons to Brexit, and with Europe in the 1930s. \u201cExcept now, given what\u2019s happened in the United States,\u201d Mr. Gerstle asked, \u201cwho\u2019s going to save the world this time?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cGermany!\u201d someone shouted. Jonathan Zimmerman , a historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania, said he wondered if 200 years from now, the most striking thing about President Obama to historians might not be that he was the first African-American president, but that he had a \u201cdifferent character from most people who become president.\u201d \u201cWe usually elect people who are the kind of people who want other people to really like them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t seem to be that way at all.\u201d Mr. Gerstle said he hoped the first draft of the historians\u2019 papers, all written under the shadow of a presumed Clinton victory, would be saved, to provide a lesson for future scholars about the contingency of history. \u201cWe\u2019re always teaching our students not to write Whiggish history,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s easy to get conscripted into telling the story of your nation, where you disregard the losers and champion the winners.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s election may end up being a turning point, and historians will want to tell the story as if it were destined to happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we were not totally crazy to think it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on November 14, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Historians Look at Obama\u2019s Legacy, With a Late Curveball.

Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus will serve\u00a0as his White House chief of staff, suggesting an increased willingness by Trump\u00a0to work within Washington's system\u00a0to accomplish his agenda. At the same time, however, Stephen K. Bannon, the campaign CEO who helped amplify some of Trump's most incendiary rhetoric about Muslims, immigrants and other minority groups, will serve as his chief strategist, according to a statement that called Priebus and Bannon \"equal partners.\" \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in the\u00a0statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d Priebus\u00a0 was viewed as a choice who could bring order and experience to Trump's inner circle, which consists largely of family members and advisors with little experience in Washington. He also serves as a bridge to Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\u00a0 Trump is known to value loyalty. Even as Trump's outsider candidacy split the GOP during the primaries, Priebus\u00a0was one of the first party leaders to accept and promote Trump\u00a0once it became clear he was the likely nominee. Bannon, who took leave from his job running the conservative Breitbart News site to run Trump's campaign, is a divisive figure. Breitbart, which had long promoted Trump's candidacy, has also given a platform to the so-called alt-right, a loose collective of openly racist and anti-Semitic activists. Bannon's new West Wing assignment immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. \"Be very vigilant America,\" warned John Weaver, a top operative\u00a0for Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich 's presidential campaign.\u00a0 Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has also worked in various roles in the entertainment industry , producing films and politically oriented documentaries. He also had a hand in Turner Broadcasting's purchase of Castle Rock and gained a stake in rights to a handful of television shows, including \"Seinfeld.\" 2:40 p.m.: This story was updated with details on Bannon's\u00a0Hollywood career. 1:55 p.m.: This story was updated with background on Bannon.

Wootson Jr. and Kristine Guerra November 13 at 11:59 AM Follow @CleveWootson Follow @kristine_guerra Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks during the opening day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Monday, July 18. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) Donald Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani said \u201cthere's no perfect way\u201d for the president-elect to deal with his billions in business assets, but on Sunday he encouraged Trump to put his money in a blind trust \u201cfor the good of the country.\u201d No matter what Trump does, Giuliani said, \u201cthere will be\u00a0a wall\u201d between Trump's decisions as\u00a0president and his financial interests. Trump says he's worth $8 billion, although Forbes magazine says the amount is closer to $3.7 billion.\u00a0 His business empire is\u00a0made up of more than 500\u00a0companies around the globe, including more than 250 bearing his name, according to ABC News. Critics say that makes him susceptible to conflicts of interest. [ Kellyanne Conway: It\u2019s up to Clinton, Obama to calm anti-Trump protesters ] \u201cFor the good of the country, and the fact you don't want a question coming up every time there's a decision made, he should basically take himself out of it and just be a passive participant in the sense that he has no decision-making, no involvement,\u201d Giuliani said on ABC News's \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd those decisions get made separate from him, which is the way it's done for most cabinet offices.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would turn over his business interests to his children if elected. But Jake Tapper grilled Giuliani on CNN's \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying that wasn't enough separation, especially because Trump's children were still advising him on political matters. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unrealistic to say that you're going to take the business away,\u201d Giuliani responded. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to fashion something that is very comfortable, very fair. ...\u00a0Even if he turns it over to an independent trustee, there\u2019s no perfect way to do this.\u201d [ Gov. Andrew Cuomo: New York a \u2018refuge\u2019 for minorities, immigrants ] Giuliani said Trump's wealth may be the biggest deterrent to any conflicts of interest.\u00a0\u201cThis man didn\u2019t want to run for president to try to get rich. He\u2019s rich already,\u201d the former New York mayor said. On Sunday, Giuliani also touched on Trump's immigration plan.\u00a0In December, after the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attacks, Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d But Giuliani said Trump's stance had softened during the campaign. For most countries, Giuliani said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be a ban, it would be extreme vetting.\u201d He said Muslims would be allowed into the United States if their home countries let immigration officials thoroughly examine the migrants. Giuliani told Tapper that there are six countries \u2014 Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen \u2014 with regard to which \u201cwe have to be very careful.\u201d Giuliani said that with Pakistan and Egypt \u201cwe could probably do some pretty good vetting. Yemen is a lot more volatile.\u201d Syrian refugees would face the toughest hurdles, Giuliani said, because they are difficult to vet and could be terrorist operatives. \u201cThe problem with the Syrian refugees is not just that you can\u2019t vet them . . . The problem is also that [Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi] has said that he\u2019s going to put terrorist operatives among the refugees,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cWe would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States. We are being warned that he is going to send people here to attack us.\u201d [ President-elect Donald Trump is about to learn the nation\u2019s \u2018deep secrets\u2019 ] Giuliani is the vice chairman of Trump's transition team. His name has been floated as a possible candidate for attorney general. He said an\u00a0independent counsel should be appointed if the president-elect decides to prosecute Hillary Clinton \u2014 a promise Trump had made\u00a0during the campaign. Read more: ",

The new president-elect says he'll follow through on building a wall \u2014 and deporting millions of people. Ethan Miller/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Anti-Donald Trump protesters stand in front of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Las Vegas Saturday. The new president-elect says he'll follow through on building a wall \u2014 and deporting millions of people. Ethan Miller/Getty Images Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET He'll build a border wall and he'll deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally, President-elect Donald Trump says, promising to keep his campaign pledges on immigration in his first prolonged interview since winning the White House. Saying that his administration will deport \"probably 2 million\" \u2014 and possibly 3 million \u2014 people who are in the country illegally, Trump told 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl that he wants to secure the border. Trump also seemed willing to consider the plan some of his fellow Republicans have aired, of securing some parts of the border with a fence. The interview with Trump aired on CBS Sunday night; it also includes members of his family. The interview was taped Friday at Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City. It comes after days of anti-Trump protests in more than a dozen American cities, where demonstrators have criticized the incoming president's immigration stance. On another campaign promise, Trump affirmed his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare. Article continues after sponsorship But Trump also wants to keep some parts of the plan. For instance, he told Stahl that he'll maintain coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, \"because it happens to be one of the strongest assets\" of the plan. Trump also said he wants to keep a portion of the law that covers children living with their parents for an extended period. As for how the change from one sphere of coverage to another might work, Trump promised it would be smooth, saying, \"We're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. That's what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff.\" He continued: \"We're going to repeal it and replace it. And we're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money.\" Here's what Trump told 60 Minutes when he was asked about undocumented immigrants in the U.S.: \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records \u2014 gang members, drug dealers \u2014 we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We're getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. \"After the border is secured, and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about \u2014 who are terrific people, they're terrific people. But we're going to make a determination ... but before we make that determination, Leslie, it's very important, we're going to secure our border.\" For comparison purposes, we'll note that in President Obama's first term, his administration carried out a record 1.5 million deportations \u2014 including more than 400,000 in fiscal year 2012. The figure declined to 235,413 in fiscal year 2015, and as NPR's Scott Horsley reported this summer, the Obama administration has shifted its focus to deporting criminals, people caught near the border, and those who recently came to the country without securing documents.

Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos makes a peace sign with wife Maria Clemencia Rodriguez after voting in the October referendum. That deal was rejected by voters; both sides hope the new, amended version will find success. Mario Tama/Getty Images For the second time in just six weeks, it appears that Latin America's longest-running war may finally end in peace. The Colombian government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, announced an agreement Saturday night that would end their 52-year guerrilla war \u2014 another attempt at peace after Colombian voters narrowly rejected a previous deal in an October referendum. \"We have reached a new final accord to end the armed conflict that integrates changes, precisions and proposals suggested by the most diverse sectors of society,\" both groups announced in a statement. Colombia's Rebels Are Eager To Become Civilians In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated the country and its leaders on the new deal. \"After 52 years of war, no peace agreement can satisfy everyone in every detail,\" Kerry said in the statement. \"But this agreement constitutes an important step forward on Colombia's path to a just and durable peace. The United States, in coordination with the Government of Colombia, will continue to support full implementation of the final peace agreement.\" The war between the FARC and the Colombian government began in the 1960s; since then, it has been responsible for the deaths of more than 200,000 people and the displacement of millions more. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has made peace with the rebel group a centerpiece of his time in office. He began talks with the FARC in 2012, and his government has pursued intense peace negotiations in Havana in the years that followed, reaching a tentative outline for a deal last year and final terms for it in August . Though voters rejected the first attempt in a nationwide referendum \u2014 by a margin of less than 1 percent \u2014 Santos was rewarded for his efforts with a Nobel Peace Prize last month. Article continues after sponsorship Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos Awarded Nobel Peace Prize \"I won't give up,\" Santos declared shortly after the rejection he was dealt in the referendum. \"I'll continue search for peace until the last moment of my mandate.\" Many Colombians objected to the first peace agreement for its perceived leniency toward FARC fighters. That deal, which would have allowed rebels to avoid being prosecuted for war crimes, placed an emphasis on reconciliation that drew criticism from many voters. As John Otis reported at the time : \"People want to see these FARC guerrillas in prison stripes behind bars.\" Among the changes in the new deal, FARC rebels who confess to war crimes will serve up to eight years of confinement in rural areas and will have to perform community service, John tells our newscast. President Santos declared in a speech Sunday night: \"Let's unite around this peace accord even if not everyone is happy with it,\" John adds. Reuters reports that it remains unclear whether the agreement announced Saturday will again be voted on in a referendum. ",

Wochit Musician Leon Russell speaks at a 2014 Evening With Leon Russell at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. (Photo: Duffy-Marie Arnoult, WireImage) Southern rock icon Leon Russell, famed for his flowing white hair, ever-present hats\u00a0and unpolished voice, died Sunday morning in his sleep at his Nashville home. He was 74. No cause of death was given on his official website and Facebook page , but the singer, songwriter\u00a0and musician had suffered a heart attack in July and underwent bypass surgery, forcing him off the road to recuperate. Russell, a member of the Rock and Roll and Songwriters Halls of Fame , performed, toured and recorded with a wide-ranging roster of performers over his nearly six-decade career, including Elton John, Willie Nelson, George Harrison and\u00a0Joe Cocker. Russell's\u00a0A Song for You\u00a0has been recorded by more than three dozen artists (Ray Charles won a Grammy Award for his version). His work spanned genres, and over the years several artists found chart success by recording his songs, including Cocker (Delta Lady), The Carpenters (Superstar), B.B. King (Hummingbird) and George Benson (This Masquerade). Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

He had this persona that was mysterious and just so powerful.\" Elton John remembers 'mentor, inspiration' Leon Russell Claude Russell Bridges was born in Lawton, Okla.,\u00a0on April 2, 1942. He began learning piano at the age of four; by his early teens, he was playing in Tulsa nightclubs. Following his high school graduation, Russell toured with Jerry Lee Lewis for a few months, then moved to Los Angeles and found work as a session musician. As part of the Wrecking Crew, a collective of elite studio musicians, Russell played piano on a number of hit songs. As a solo artist, Russell's most successful years came in the 1970s, beginning with his eponymous solo debut in 1970 and subsequent releases\u00a0Leon Russell and the Shelter People\u00a0and\u00a0Carney.\u00a0He also made records with his then-wife Mary Russell and country star Willie Nelson\u00a0and released the first of multiple country albums he made under the name\u00a0Hank Wilson. Russell was a captivating live performer. In 1971, he wowed crowds at the star-studded Concert for Bangladesh with a scorching medley of Jumpin' Jack Flash\u00a0and Youngblood.\u00a0Two years later, The Tennessean\u00a0wrote of one of his live shows: \u201cA Leon Russell show is inevitably more than an aural experience. The crowd provided strawberry incense, fluorescent Frisbees, and clouds of smoke, tobacco and otherwise. Excited fans standing in front of the stage bent double, (and) pounded their arms with the rhythm of the music.\u201d \"He was the guy who was always second on the bill,\" said singer/songwriter Gretchen Peters, who saw Russell perform several times in the '70s, including the time he toured with the Rolling Stones. \"He was really, really different than the (headlining) rock bands I was there to see. ... He was outlandish and had this twangy kind of delivery. There was nothing else like it.\" Though he continued to tour and record in the late 1980s, '90s and beyond, Russell's studio output didn't receive much attention outside of his dedicated fan base until he got a call from Elton John. The pop legend, a longtime fan of Russell's music, asked him to collaborate on an album that would become The Union.\u00a0\"It was one of the greatest experiences of my life, not just musically, but emotionally,\" John told USA TODAY . \"I fell in love with this guy all over again.\" Released in 2010, the album produced by T Bone Burnett hit No. 3 on Billboard album chart\u00a0and the Russell-penned opening track If It Wasn\u2019t for Bad\u00a0was nominated for a pop vocal collaboration Grammy. \"I don't know a thing about charts and that stuff, largely because I was never in it,\" Russell told USA TODAY upon the album's release, acknowledging that he was overwhelmed by the attention. \"I'm in this huge place, a place I've never been, even at the top of my success. ... They're interested in what I'm doing.\" Russell released his last solo studio album, Life Journey,\u00a0in 2014.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 13, 2016 5:00 PM EST Back in 2004, a popular arthritis drug called Vioxx was pulled off the market when studies showed daily long-term use could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and death.\u00a0 \u201cThis was one of the most important safety events really in recent medical history,\u201d Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the first researchers to link Vioxx to the life-threatening cardiovascular side effects, told CBS News.\u00a0 It also raised concerns about whether another, similar drug \u2014 celecoxib, marketed as Celebrex \u2014 might have similar risks. But today, Nissen and colleagues reported findings of a major 10-year study which found no such problems with Celebrex, offering reassurance to millions of patients and potentially changing the way doctors approach treating arthritis pain. For the study involving 24,081 heart patients and people at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, the researchers compared celecoxib with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs ,\u00a0 naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) and found celecoxib no more dangerous to the heart than the two NSAIDs, which have been prescribed for decades. Celebrex was even safer when it came to certain side effects, like serious gastrointestinal problems. The results surprised Nissen and other heart experts involved in the study, he said. \u201cCelebrex is a drug that has a very similar method of action to Vioxx and so the FDA was worried that Celebrex might share the same risk,\u201d said Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart & Vascular Institute. There was even some evidence already pointing to it, he added. CDC urges doctors to back off opioid painkiller prescriptions Given the fact that both Celebrex and Vioxx were taken by millions of Americans, Nissen said the FDA called for a clinical trial to find out whether or not Celebrex shared the same risks that led to the withdrawal of Vioxx. Celebrex is in the same class of medicines as Vioxx, called\u00a0 COX-2 inhibitors .\u00a0 \u201cAt the end of the day, we designed the trial to determine whether or not Celebrex had the same risks,\u201d he said. The trial began in 2005 and took place at more than 900 medical centers in 13 countries. \u201cIt took 10 years because in order to study these kind of safety issues, you need a lot of patients and we needed almost 1,000 sites around world to participate, and we needed 24,000 patients in order to have enough patients to actually answer the critical scientific questions,\u201d Nissen said. Participants were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib (100 milligrams twice a day), ibuprofen (600 milligrams three times a day), or naproxen (375 milligrams twice a day). On follow-up visits, patients with rheumatoid arthritis could bump up the dose of celecoxib to 200 milligrams twice a day, the dose of ibuprofen to 800 milligrams three times a day, or the dose of naproxen to 500 milligrams twice a day to help with symptoms. For patients with osteoarthritis , increases in the doses of ibuprofen and naproxen, but not Celebrex, were allowed. The patients were treated and followed up anywhere from 20 to 34 months, during which time they were monitored for gastrointestinal and kidney side effects. During the trial, almost 69 percent dropped out; 2.5 percent of the patients died. Nissen suspected there might be a mechanism that would result in Celebrex having at least a modestly higher risk of causing heart disease events compared with ibuprofen and naproxen. His aim was to discover whether or not there was enough of an increased risk to warrant stronger warnings on the pills \u2014 or even potentially removing the drug from pharmacy shelves. \u201cI thought that it would probably tilt against Celebrex. That\u2019s what most people in the world thought,\u201d he said, referring to colleagues in cardiovascular medicine. But instead the study confirmed its safety.\u00a0 \u201cEverybody was wrong\u201d \u201cEverybody was wrong, including me. In fact, the actual rate of heart disease events with Celebrex was a little bit lower than it was for these older drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen,\u201d he said. The strength of the evidence was overwhelming.\u201d The difference between the three drugs was not statistically significant but it did trend in a direction that was more favorable for Celebrex, said Nissen. Study finds certain exercises can help osteoarthritis patients Nissen said it\u2019s important for the public to understand that the researchers weren\u2019t studying the occasional use of these drugs \u2014 instead they focused on patients with\u00a0 osteoarthritis \u00a0or rheumatoid arthritis who take the drugs every day to control pain. \u201cThis was a higher dose than what people would take for, say, a headache. It was two to three times as much as people would take for a headache, joint pain or muscle aches,\u201d he explained. One of the reasons Vioxx and Celebrex were developed was to create drugs that wouldn\u2019t be as hard on the digestive system as standard pain relievers, which can lead to ulcers and to bleeding. Nissen said it was \u201cvery striking\u201d that when it came to side effects, there was about a 50 percent lower risk of having a serious gastrointestinal complication from Celebrex compared to ibuprofen or naproxen. \u201cIt was better on gastrointestinal safety and that does give us choices. It gives physicians the opportunity to give a drug that is safe for the heart and possibly more safe for the stomach,\u201d he said. The drug also had lower rates of kidney side effects compared to ibuprofen. Dr. Chip Lavie, medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and prevention at John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute and professor of medicine at Ochsner Clinical\u00a0 School-UQ School of Medicine, in New Orleans, told CBS News, \u201cCelebrex has always carried the baggage of being in the same COX-2 [class] as Vioxx, whereas many have considered the other NSAIDs to be safer. Many studies over the years have demonstrated that Celebrex and the COX-2 are safer from a GI [gastrointestinal] standpoint, even though all NSAIDs have GI side effects, and almost all studies suggest that NSAIDs have adverse renal [kidney] effects.\u201d Lavie, who was not involved in the study, said while the new research confirms Celebrex has fewer gastrointestinal and kidney side effects compared with NSAIDs, the real concern that remained was regarding potential heart risks. \u201cAlthough this large study was not with high-risk patients with advanced heart disease, and there were high drop-outs, still, the cardiac toxicity and survival seemed similar to even slightly better with Celebrex than with the other agents. Certainly, there was nothing negative with Celebrex,\u201d said Lavie, who is also associate editor and cardiovascular section editor of Mayo Clinic Proceedings. There other plusses to Celebrex when it comes to heart patients, Lavie added.\u00a0 \u201cCelebrex, unlike the other agents, does not have anti-platelet effects so is safer to combine with other blood thinners and can be taken peri-operatively \u2014 and even before the operation without increasing bleeding \u2014 to reduce post-operative pain, and also does not block the potent anti-platelet effects of aspirin, which is very important for many of my patients,\u201d said Lavie. Doses of Celebrex higher than those used in the study have been shown to cause heart risks in one previous trial, the study authors warned. Nissen also warned against turning to opioids for pain relief. The new findings will likely influence how doctors prescribe arthritis medications to their heart patients, but it may take time before formal guidelines come out, said the study author. The price of the drug has fallen dramatically since generic options became available in 2014, so it\u2019s also an affordable choice. \u00a0\u201cI do think that physicians are going to now tilt more towards using Celebrex,\u201d Nissan said.\u00a0 \u201cI must tell you I was stunned by the results. I don\u2019t think there are very many people in the world who thought this,\u201d Nissen said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling my patients to take naproxen for the last 10 years and that was wrong advice.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Police said a large crowd of juveniles were at 16th and Walnut streets, a popular spot for dining and shopping, at about 6 p.m. Saturday when some people began randomly assaulting people on the street. A 55-year-old off-duty police detective saw a 20-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman being assaulted and tried to arrest one of the offenders. He was punched from behind by several people, police said. The detective's 53-year-old wife splashed water on the offenders to try to stop them from attacking her husband, and she was punched in the face, police said. All of the offenders then fled. The four victims were taken to a nearby hospital. Immediately afterward, there was another assault by several juveniles nearby, and two 16-year-old youths were arrested, police said. In all, six people were injured. The police detective had an orbital fracture to his right eye while the others had minor injuries. One man told WPVI-TV that he feared for his safety when the large group of teens appeared, and he saw other people running into nearby stores to escape. \"It's crazy out here,\" said Dwight Magood. \"I don't know if they were trying to protest or 'flash mobbing.' But it's not the right way to do it, whatever it was.\" 0 Shares ",

Related Image Expand / Contract David Machado is wanted in the murder of a California deputy. (Vacaville Police) Multiple tactical units had been engaged in the manhunt for David Machado, 36, who is alleged to have carjacked a driver in Keyes just minutes after he murdered Stanislaus County Sheriff's Deputy Dennis Wallace on Sunday morning. \"We know the gun used in the crime was in direct contact with [Wallace's] head when the trigger was pulled twice,\" Sheriff Adam Christianson said during a news conference. \"This was a direct execution.\" Machado was already wanted on a felony warrant for unspecified criminal activity when Wallace, in his uniform and driving a marked police vehicle, entered the Fox Grove Recreation and Fishing Access park at 8:24 a.m. Wallace spotted a suspicious vehicle and, after a dispatcher told Wallace the vehicle was stolen, he requested backup. Moments later, Wallace was dead. By the time backup arrived, the suspect was gone. The subsequent carjacking of a Kia Rio occurred at 8:40 a.m. local time. The carjacking victim identified Machado as the man who stole the car, police said. Machado later abandoned the stolen van and carjacked an escape vehicle in the nearby city of Keyes, according to the sheriff's department. He\u00a0was arrested hours later 150 miles south of Hughson in the town of Lindsay after he tried to steal a woman's purse at a convenience store, Christianson said. The woman fought Machado and called Lindsay police, prompting him to run from the scene. Officers chased after him on foot and took him into custody without incident, Christianson said. Lindsay officers didn't initially recognize Machado as the suspect in the killing of Wallace. But once he was in custody, they identified him through tattoos and a photograph and immediately contacted the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department, Christianson said. Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department confirms deputy killed in Hughson is Dennis Wallace, a 20-year veteran of the force. pic.twitter.com/SrjnwyyU95 \u2014 The Modesto Bee (@modbee) November 13, 2016 Wallace, 53, was a 20-year veteran of the department who Christianson said was well known for his involvement in community programs such as D.A.R.E. \"Unfortunately, we do this far too often here in California and nationwide,\" Christianson said. \"You have to ask yourself the question: 'Where does it stop, where does it end?'\" Wallace is the fourth officer killed in the line of duty in SCSD history, according to the department's website. The previous death occurred in April 2012 when Deputy Sheriff Robert Paris was gunned down while serving an eviction notice. Stanislaus County is located in the Central Valley of California. The county seat is Modesto. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Ryan departed from Trump on two of the president-elect's top priorities: Establishing a \"deportation force\" to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and using tariffs to prevent companies from taking their jobs overseas. On the former, Ryan insisted, \"that is not what our focus is\" when it comes to immigration reform \u2014 rather, securing the border is. Related: Donald Trump Says Border Wall May Be Part Fence, Hints at Mass Incarcerations \"We think that's first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue we gotta know who's coming and going in this country we gotta secure the border. So we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill is really the first priority and that's what we're focused on,\" Ryan said. Speaker Paul Ryan: \"We are not planning on erecting a deportation force\" https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim #CNNSOTU https://t.co/skw76OndVK \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 13, 2016 Pressed on whether, in year three or four of his administration, Trump would focus on mass deportations, Ryan replied: \"We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.\" And on the latter, establishing tariffs to keep jobs in the U.S., Ryan said \"I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue,\" later suggesting tariffs could cause \"collateral damage on the economy.\" He pointed instead to the House GOP policy agenda that he authored \u2014 called the \"Better Way\" \u2014 agenda, which includes proposals to cut taxes on businesses that he said would be a better solution. Related: Republican Battles Won't End With Election Night Victories \"He's trying to make American more competitive. He's trying to make the American worker more competitive, he's trying to make it so American businesses stay in America and we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform which actually makes America much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy,\" he said. In this Nov. 10, 2016, photo, President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., pose for photographers after a meeting in the Speaker's office on Capitol Hill in Washington. Alex Brandon / AP But versions of both of Trump's proposals were included in then-candidate Trump's \"Contract With the American Voter,\" the outline he offered of policy priorities for his first 100 days. In the contract, he promises on his first day in office to \"begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back,\" and to begin working with Congress to pass a law that would establish tariffs to \"discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.\" And Trump recommitted to deporting those immigrants during his first post-election interview, on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Sunday night \u2014 excerpts from which were released early. Ryan's comments on CNN underscored the fact that the divisions between the two \u2014 which led to an at times fierce public conflict between the two, with Trump tweeting criticism at the speaker and Ryan refusing to say Trump's name for much of the final month of the election \u2014 remain. But Ryan seemed confident Trump would fall in line behind his proposals, and refused to acknowledge his past criticism of the president-elect when asked. \"I'm not going to re-litigate the past, I'm looking for the future,\" said Ryan.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 Trump then followed up with a tweet referring to himself in the third person and slamming the Times as \"dishonest\" for saying that he believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" Trump falsely claimed he never said that. The @nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 But in interviews with the Times , CNN and Fox News , Trump did say that more countries, including Japan and South Korea, should have nuclear weapons . Trump's Twitter account has been a source of controversy over the campaign. In September he went on a an overnight rant against former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, calling her \"disgusting\" after Machado criticized him for past comments. Play ",

(Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/Afp/Getty Images, Mary Turner / Getty Images, Andre Penner/AP, Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images) By Griff Witte , Emily Rauhala and Dom Phillips November 13 at 5:44 PM Follow @griffwitte Follow emilyrauhala Follow @domphillips LONDON \u2014\u00a0Not long before Americans shocked the world by selecting Donald Trump to be their next president, a wealthy Brazilian businessman who played a reality-star boss on television became mayor of South America\u2019s largest city.\u00a0 On the other side of the globe, in Southeast Asia, a gun-slinging vigilante who vowed to kill all criminals and dump their bodies until the \u201cfish will grow fat\u201d was elected to lead a nation of 100 million. And in Britain, voters with a centuries-long streak of moderation and pragmatism opted to ignore the overwhelming advice of experts by leaping into the abyss of life outside the European Union. The populist wave of 2016 that carried Trump to the pinnacle of international power and influence didn\u2019t start in the United States. And it certainly won\u2019t end there.\u00a0 Instead, the biggest prize yet for a global movement built on a seemingly bottomless reserve of political, economic and cultural grievance is likely to be an accelerant to even more victories for people and causes bent on upending the existing world order.\u00a0 \u201cSuccess breeds success,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cRight now, everyone is susceptible to it. The drivers seem to be universal.\u201d\u00a0 [ Can Trump\u2019s win boost France\u2019s far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen? ] And unless something dramatic changes to curb the populist appeal, a scattering of surprise victories this year could soon turn into a worldwide rout \u2014 the triumph of those who preach strong action over rule of law, unilateralism instead of cooperation and the interests of the majority above the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. \u201cTheir world is collapsing,\u201d tweeted a jubilant Florian Philippot, senior adviser to French far-right leader Marine le Pen, following Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cOurs is being built.\u201d With French presidential elections due next spring, Le Pen is well-placed to add Paris to the list of world capitals that have fallen to the populist tide. She is seen as a lock to make it to the final round of voting, and although her chances have long been discounted among political prognosticators in France, that\u00a0 changed after Trump\u2019s victory . Well before France votes, Austria could become the first country to elect a far-right head of state in Western Europe since 1945 when it picks a president next month. On the same day, Dec. 4, Italians will vote in a constitutional referendum that could bring down the center-left government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi \u2014 while boosting the fortunes of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. Although the exact causes of the populist surge vary from country to country, the broad outlines are similar across national boundaries.\u00a0 Anxiety over economic gains that accrue to the few and leave the rest stagnant or sinking. Unease with the cultural implications of an increasingly interconnected world. And alienation from a self-serving political class that aligns with the wealthy at the expense of the working class. That the populist leaders are often\u00a0wealthy sons of privilege who bear little relation to the masses they claim to speak for doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cPeople feel they need a powerful champion to blow the establishment to smithereens,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWhether the leaders are the same as the people they represent matters less than the fact that they have the intent to disrupt.\u201d\u00a0 That was certainly the case with Trump, an Ivy League-educated billionaire urbanite who won biggest in rural areas and among less-educated voters. It was true, as well, when Britain voted in June to get out of the E.U. The voters who backed that cause were predominantly from England\u2019s small towns and struggling, postindustrial cities \u2014 well outside the booming, cosmopolitan metropolis of London. Voters who wanted to jettison the Brussels bureaucracy ranked immigration atop their list of concerns, and tended to be less educated than those who wanted Britain to maintain its ties across the English Channel.\u00a0 Yet the movement was led by well-to-do politicians with pedigree from the nation\u2019s fanciest schools. Together, they championed a once-fringe idea and, by urging voters to \u201cTake Back Control\u201d of their own affairs, turned it into a cause that a majority of the country\u2019s voters could back. One of them, former commodities trader Nigel Farage, later became Trump\u2019s most outspoken overseas backer \u2014 appearing with him at campaign stops and urging the New York businessman to follow the Brexit model to victory.\u00a0 Trump did just that, promising \u201c Brexit times five \u201d \u2014 and delivering.\u00a0 Farage has pledged to help replicate the electoral success of Brexit and Trump across the West. The longtime leader of the anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party on Saturday became the first British politician to meet with the president-elect, spending an hour with him at Trump Tower and later\u00a0 posting to Twitter a photo of the two men smiling broadly in front of a set of gilded doors. \u201cPlease don\u2019t for a minute think that the change ends here,\u201d Farage\u00a0wrote Friday in Britain\u2019s mass-circulation Sun tabloid. \u201cVoters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives. Further political shocks in Europe and beyond are coming.\u201d Those sorts of shocks are a new feature of the post-World War II order in the democracies that ring the North Atlantic. They\u2019re more familiar in the developing world. But there, as well, the populist tide is resurgent \u2014 and for some of the same reasons that it is rising in the more affluent West. [ Philippines\u2019 Duterte says he and Trump are \u2018alike\u2019 \u2014 at least in their coarse language ] In May, Filipinos elected as their president Rodrigo Duterte, a man who spent 20 years running a city in the southern Philippines as a mob boss runs a block. Duterte, once nicknamed \u201cthe death squad mayor,\u201d was famous for patrolling the streets on a motorbike, weapon at the ready. He bragged about taking justice into his own hands.\u00a0 As a presidential candidate, Duterte promised violence. He vowed to rid the nation of crime in a matter of months with a vividly apocalyptic vision that involved eliminating \u201call\u201d suspected criminals. Thousands of people identified as drug dealers and users have since been killed.\u00a0 As the first president from the southern island of Mindanao, he said, he would challenge Manila\u2019s political class, end politics-as-usual and protect the poor. \u00a0That vision resonated among Filipinos who were fed up with the crass corruption of the country\u2019s feudalistic ruling families and outraged by ineffectual police and courts. Duterte, the son of a governor, cast himself as their street-smart savior. He talked like the overconfident older kid on the block, joking about rape, threatening to shoot people and\u00a0 salting his speeches with curse terms , such as \u201cson of a whore.\u201d The bloodshed and tough talk are fueled, in part, by nostalgic nationalism. When Duterte rails against U.S. colonialism, he appeals to a wounded patriotism, promising to make the country more independent \u2014 to make the Philippines great again. Anti-establishment political upheaval has also been a prominent feature of Brazilian politics in recent months \u2014 most dramatically in the\u00a0 controversial August impeachment of leftist president Dilma Rousseff, whose Workers\u2019 Party had run Brazil for 13 years before her ouster.\u00a0 Stained by accusations over corruption and its economic mismanagement that many blamed for Brazil\u2019s recession, the Workers\u2019 Party took a hammering in last month\u2019s municipal elections. Unconventional politicians were in many cases the beneficiaries. In Rio, an evangelical bishop was elected mayor. In Sao Paulo, Jo\u00e3o Doria, a millionaire businessman campaigning as a nonpolitician, won South America\u2019s biggest city and its economic powerhouse. Cementing the comparisons to Trump, Doria had starred in Brazil\u2019s version of the reality TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d The morning after Trump\u2019s victory, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker with presidential ambitions, took to Twitter to congratulate him and promise a similar upset in Brazil\u2019s 2018 elections. #Bolsonaro2018 began trending on Twitter. Oscar Vidarte, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, said Trump resembles a classic Latin American type of populist, the\u00a0caudillo, \u00a0a Spanish term that translates roughly to \u201cstrongman\u201d or a leader with authoritarian tendencies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTrump fits the bill,\u201d Vidarte said. \u201cBut in Latin America, the rise of\u00a0caudillos is enabled by weak institutions. In the U.S., you have to look for different reasons.\u201d\u00a0 Although outsiders continue to be elected in Latin America \u2014 a TV comedian, James Morales, recently won the presidency in Guatemala \u2014 longtime strongmen have struggled.\u00a0 If anything, there is now a backlash against them. Argentina last year voted for an end to a decade of governance by N\u00e9stor and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. A referendum in Bolivia blocked the reelection of President Evo Morales and Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0Chavismo , \u00a0after 17 years in power, appears to be on its last legs.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, the most effective way to defeat the populist wave, said Leonard, is often to let them govern. \u201cThey don\u2019t do very well,\u201d he said.\u00a0 [ Reaction to a Hitler exhibit shows how nervous Germans still are about the Nazis ] The most extreme example, of course, is Germany, where the country\u2019s election of a charismatic populist proved catastrophic for the world. Because of the country\u2019s Nazi history, its postwar political system has been designed to defend minority rights and prevent a majoritarian takeover. But terrorist attacks by Islamist radicals and a record wave of Middle Eastern migrants are now testing the national will. The fast-growing Alternative for Germany party, founded in 2013, has galvanized the anti-Islam ranks. The AfD unveiled a scathing denunciation of the faith this year, warning against \u201cthe expansion and presence of a growing number of Muslims\u201d on German soil. Adding fuel to the party\u2019s campaign, German authorities have arrested more than a dozen suspected extremists, many of whom entered Germany by masquerading as migrants.\u00a0 \u00a0With national elections next year, the party is now supported by nearly 1 in 6 voters and has staged startling gains this year in local elections.\u00a0\u00a0 J\u00fcrgen Falter, a political scientist and expert on the far-right, described the party\u2019s leadership as \u201cnot real neo-Nazis, but rather close.\u201d Its voter base, however, is larger \u2014 an amalgamation of Germans fearing everything from foreigners to globalization.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey managed to get some more moderate and less moderate people supporting them who feel threatened by modernization, by refugees, by Islam,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we are talking about some Trump voters, as well.\u201d Even in Germany, the political unthinkable can no longer be so easily discounted.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Nov 13, 2016 6:29 PM EST WELLINGTON, New Zealand - A deadly magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck near Christchurch, New Zealand, leading to tsunami activity, officials said Sunday.\u00a0 The quake caused damage to buildings and prompted emergency services to warn people along the coast to move to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said Sunday at least two people were killed by the disaster. Police said one person died in the small coastal town of Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Fissures run along a road by the Centre Port in Wellington, Monday, November 14, 2016, after a major earthquake struck New Zealand\u2019s south island early Monday. Close Ross Setford/SNPA via AP The scope of damage and size of the tsunami waves are not yet clear. The first tsunami wave struck several hours after the temblor. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a delayed tsunami warning after the earthquake, asking people in coastal areas of New Zealand\u2019s South Island to move inland. The New Zealand Civil Defence Ministry warned that the first tsunami waves may not be the worst, and that tsunami activity could continue for several hours. The quake knocked out New Zealand\u2019s emergency call number, 111, for about 10 minutes, police reported. It caused items to fall from shelves and windows to break in Wellington, and forced hundreds of tourists onto the streets as hotels were evacuated. New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management reported that a tsunami wave struck at about 1:50 a.m. The magnitude-7.8 quake struck just after midnight Sunday and was centered 57 miles northeast of Christchurch, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was at a relatively shallow depth of 6 miles. Although Monday\u2019s quake was stronger than the deadly 2011 tremor, its epicenter was much farther from any major urban areas. Earthquakes tend to be more strongly felt on the surface when they\u2019re shallow. People evacuated from the Quest On the Terrace Hotel gather outside the hotel in Wellington after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake based around Cheviot in the South island shook the capital, New Zealand, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016.\u00a0 Close Ross Setford/SNPA via AP U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan that all U.S. personnel in the capital Wellington have been accounted for in the wake of the earthquake. Sec. John Kerry had left the country before it struck, and just landed in Singapore on  his way to Oman when news of the quake was reported. The quake completely cut off road access to Kaikoura, said resident Terry Thompson, who added that electricity and most phones were also down in the town of 2,000, a popular destination for tourists taking part in whale-watching expeditions. Thompson was out of town but managed to reach his wife by cellphone during the night before her phone died. \u201cShe said the glass exploded right out of the double ranch-slider,\u201d he said. \u201cThe neighbor\u2019s chimney was gone, there were breakages and things smashed everywhere.\u201d His wife helped a 93-year-old neighbor and a tourist into her car and drove to higher ground, he said. \u201cThey stayed in the car all night but couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re all very, very tired and concerned about the state of their property.\u201d As Monday\u2019s quake hit, Christchurch resident Hannah Gin had just sat down in her living room to watch a replay of this weekend\u2019s All Blacks versus Italy rugby match when her house started shaking. Upstairs, her mother let out a scream. Gin, a 24-year-old lifelong Christchurch resident, is accustomed to quakes, so she said she sat calmly and waited, figuring the rumbling would stop in a few seconds. Instead, the shaking just went on and on - for at least three minutes, according to the clock on her phone, she said by phone. The quake was far less violent than the one that struck her city in 2011, Gin said, adding that there was no jarring up and down or side to side, just a long, rolling sensation. But it went on for much longer than the typical quakes that strike the area, she said. She was less concerned about running for cover than she was about vomiting from the motion sickness, she said with a chuckle. \u201cI could hear the sliding door sliding back and forth and we\u2019ve got washing hanging up and I could see the washing moving,\u201d Gin said. \u201cIt just kept going and going.\u201d Her house, which was damaged in the 2011 quake, did not appear to have sustained any new damage from Monday\u2019s quake, she said. She said she had heard from many of her friends who live in the city, and all were safe. \u201cAs far as I know, everyone\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all just really shaken.\u201d New Zealand is part of a geologically active region that\u2019s often called the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In 2014, a magnitude-6.7 earthquake struck off the New Zealand coast and rattled much of the country but resulted in few damages or injuries. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "AP November 13, 2016, 8:23 AM U.S. to resettle Australia's refugees languishing on Pacific islands Suspected asylum seekers arrive at to Flying Fish Cove, Christmas Island, after being intercepted and escorted in by the Australian Navy, on August 3, 2013 near Christmas Island, Indian Ocean Territories, Australia. Scott Fisher/Getty Images Email CANBERRA, Australia - The United States has agreed to resettle an unspecified number of refugees languishing in Pacific island camps in a deal that is expected to inspire more asylum seekers to attempt to reach Australia by boat, officials said on Sunday. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would not say whether he had discussed the deal with President-elect Donald Trump during their telephone conversation on Thursday. The Obama administration had agreed to resettle refugees among almost 1,300 asylum seekers held at Australia\u2019s expense on the island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea . Another 370 who came to Australia for medical treatment then refused to return to the islands would also be eligible. \u201cWe deal with one administration at a time and there is only one president of the United States at a time,\u201d Turnbull told reporters. Trump has called for a moratorium or tight restrictions on Muslim immigration . Most of the asylum seekers are Muslims from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed that the United States had \u201cagreed to consider referrals\u201d from the United Nations refugee agency on Australia\u2019s refugees. \u201cWe are going to work to protect vulnerable refugees around the world, and we\u2019ll share that responsibility with our friends in the regions that are most affected by this challenge,\u201d Kerry told reporters in New Zealand. Australia refuses to resettle any refugee who has arrived by boat since the date the tough policy was announced on July 19, 2013. Australia pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house boat arrivals and has been searching for countries that will resettle them. Few refugees have accepted offers to resettle in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia because most hope that Australia will eventually take them in. Any refugee who refuses to go to the U.S. would be given a 20-year visa to stay on Nauru, a tiny impoverished atoll with a population of 10,000 people, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said. The Refugee Council of Australia, an advocacy group, welcomed the deal as a vital first step in ending the indefinite detention of asylum seekers on the islands. London-based rights group Amnesty International accused Australia of taking \u201can extreme step in shirking responsibility.\u201d U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials are expected in Australia this week to begin assessing refugees. Turnbull would not say how many refugees the United States might take, but said the most vulnerable would be given priority. \u201cOur priority is the resettlement of woman, children and families,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThis will be an orderly process. It will take time. It will not be rushed.\u201d Refugees who arrive in the future would not be sent to the United States, he said. \u201cWe anticipate that people smugglers will seek to use this agreement as a marketing opportunity to tempt vulnerable people onto these perilous sea journeys,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cWe have put in place the largest and most capable maritime surveillance and response fleet Australia has ever deployed.\u201d Australian Border Force Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg said ships had been positioned to turn boats back to Indonesia if asylum seekers attempt to reach Australia in the hope of being sent to the U.S. No people smuggling operation has successfully delivered asylum seekers to Australia by boat since July 2014. Turnbull announced at Obama\u2019s Leaders\u2019 Summit on Refugees in September that Australia would participate in the U.S.-led program to resettle Central American refugees from a camp in Costa Rica. Australia would also increase its refugee intake by 5,000 to 18,750 a year. Turnbull said at the time that the agreement to resettle Hondurans and El Salvadoreans was \u201cnot linked to any other resettlement discussions\u201d involving Australia\u2019s refugees getting to the U.S. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said some refugees on Nauru were \u201chopeful\u201d of resettlement in the United States, but were frustrated by the lack of detail. There seemed no short-term hope for asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island, a male-only camp holding 873 men. \u201cThere are some people who if the United States is offered to them, certainly they will take it,\u201d Rintoul said, adding that several would prefer Australia where they had family. Rights groups have been scathing about conditions on the island immigration camps. Two asylum seekers set themselves on fire on Nauru this year and two local men have been convicted of murdering an Iranian asylum seeker during a 2004 riot at the Manus Island camp. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

(Nov. 10) AP Donald Trump is pledging no long vacations and no presidential salary during his time in the White House. \"There's\u00a0just so much to be done,\" Trump told CBS' 60 Minutes in an interview broadcast Sunday. \"So I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.\" As for the president's $400,000-a-year pay, the New York businessman said: \"No, I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it.\" Republicans have regularly criticized President Obama for his fondness for playing golf and his family vacations in Hawaii.

    "text": "By Reena Flores CBS News November 13, 2016, 10:21 AM After promises to restrain Twitter use, Donald Trump tweets rant on New York Times Email Last Updated Nov 13, 2016 1:14 PM EST After promises last week to curb his sometimes controversial use of Twitter , President-elect Donald Trump went on another of his infamous tweetstorms early Sunday, targeting the New York Times for their \u201cBAD coverage\u201d of his presidential campaign. Here are Trump\u2019s critical tweets about the Times, in which he claims the newspaper had sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their election reporting: Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"Trump phenomena\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 Trump was likely referring to a letter to readers sent from the paper\u2019s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and their executive editor, Dean Baquet, on Friday. But the tweet from the president-elect mischaracterizes what Sulzberger and Baquet wrote in their message, which contained no apology and maintained that the Times covered the election \u201cwith agility and creativity.\u201d \u201cWe believe we reported on both candidates fairly during the presidential campaign,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cYou can rely on The New York Times to bring the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence to our coverage of the new president and his team.\u201d Here\u2019s the full text of the letter, from a media reporter at the Times: Letter to NYT readers from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet pic.twitter.com/jORqzx3BA9 \u2014 Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 11, 2016 Later on Sunday, The Times\u2019 communications team responded to Trump\u2019s charge that the paper was \u201closing thousands of subscribers\u201d in a tweet of their own. @realDonaldTrump @nytimes fact: surge in new subscriptions, print & digital, with trends, stops & starts, 4 X better than normal. \u2014 NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016 Trump blasted the paper once more later in the day about their reporting on his stance of nuclear weapons: The @nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 Trump, however, is wrong about his past stance on more countries acquiring nuclear capabilities. At a televised town hall in March, Trump said this: \u201cYou have so many countries already -- China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia -- you have so many countries right now that have them,\u201d he said in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \u201cNow, wouldn\u2019t you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\u201d In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d scheduled to air Sunday, Trump said he would be \u201cvery restrained\u201d with his use of Twitter in the Oval Office. In the days leading up to the election, Trump\u2019s team had deemed that social media account so damaging to his presidential chances that aides actually wrested control of his tweets from him. Since that interview, taped Friday, Trump has teed off on protesters and the press on the social media platform. Minutes after his attack on the Times, Trump also paid compliments to another vocal critic of his campaign, former GOP nominee Mitt Romney:\u00a0 Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Provided by Kelsey Hutto) INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 St. David's Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom was vandalized sometime Saturday night. Vandals painted tags on the walls,\u00a0depicting a swastika, an anti-gay slur\u00a0and \"Heil Trump.\" And in Silver Spring, Md., a\u00a0sign advertising the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour's Spanish-language service also was vandalized Saturday night, according to the communications team at the church. Trump not 'very restrained' against NYT in tweets Sunday The sign was cut in several different places and the words \u201cTrump nation. Whites only.\u201d were written on the back and on the wall of the parish\u2019s memorial garden. Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of Episcopal\u00a0Diocese of Washington gathered with church members and priests to stand in solidarity at the church in the wake of this incident. In Indiana, the Rev. Kelsey Hutto, priest in charge at\u00a0St. David's Episcopal Church, said she was disheartened after finding the graffiti on the walls of the church Sunday morning. But her next thought was more positive. A Facebook post by the Episocopal Diocese of Washington describes the vandalism of a sign on Nov. 13, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Episcopal Diocese of Washington) \"Well, we must be doing something right,\" Hutto said she thought. \"We stated one time that doing the right thing was not always the popular thing. We were targeted for a reason, and in our mind it was for a good reason.\" As Christians, Hutto said they need to respond to hateful acts with love and joy. That's what God calls on them to do, no matter what color people are, where they came from or who they love. They just need to respect the differences of every human being, she said. Since Election Day, there have been more than 200 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation across the country, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. And the rise in\u00a0hate crimes since the election appears to be worse than what happened after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. The vandalism at the church, about 25 miles south of Indianapolis, comes days after students in vice president-elect Mike Pence's hometown taunted other students by chanting \"build that wall.\" Protests enter fifth straight day denouncing Donald Trump as president Hutto said there is no doubt the atmosphere in the country has changed since President-elect Donald Trump and his running mate, Pence, were elected on Tuesday. \"But what we really need to focus on is not the election, but rather the fact that love conquers all hate,\" Hutto said. \"Anytime hate is presented, love needs to be our response. That's how we're responding.\" On Facebook, Hutto expressed the same sentiments, saying they wouldn't let the actions of a few people damper their love of Christ and the world. \"We will continue to live out our beliefs and acceptance of all people and respecting the dignity of every human being. We pray for the perpetrators as well as those who the derogatory marks were directed at,\" Hutto said in her post. \"This act was an act of separation. Separation of us from each other and a separation from God which is the definition of a sin. We pray for unification with God, with God's people and with ourselves. This is only one image of a worldwide phenomenon in which we are dividing ourselves and the world from God. We hope and pray that as the days and weeks continue we find a way to bridge this division from God and each other and ourselves.\" Contributing: WUSA-TV, Washington.

    "text": "By Scott Clement November 13 at 7:00 AM Follow @sfcpoll A strong majority of Americans accept Donald Trump as the winner of the presidential election last week, but a significant minority of Hillary Clinton supporters say his victory was illegitimate, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll . The survey was conducted immediately after Election Day as anti-Trump protests sprang up across major cities, at the end of an acidic campaign in which Trump himself said he may not accept election results if Clinton prevailed. The Post-ABC poll finds 74 percent of all Americans say they accept the election of Trump as legitimate while 18 percent do not. That result parallels a Post-ABC Tracking Poll \u00a0just before the election, which found 79 percent of likely voters saying they were prepared to accept the outcome of the election regardless of who they support. But while Trump supporters were more reluctant about accepting results before Tuesday \u2014 22 percent said they were not prepared to do so \u2014 an even larger share of Clinton supporters now say they do not view Trump's election as legitimate. \u00a0 [ Read full poll results ] A 58 percent majority of Clinton supporters say they accept Trump\u2019s election, while 33 percent do not. Questions about Trump\u2019s victory are passionate \u2014 27 percent of Clinton supporters feel \u201cstrongly\u201d he did not win legitimately. There are sharp racial and gender differences in Clinton supporters\u2019 acceptance of the results. Only 18 percent of whites who supported Clinton say Trump is not the legitimate winner, identical to the public overall, but fully 51 percent of black, Hispanic and other nonwhite Clinton supporters say Trump\u2019s victory was illegitimate. Women who supported Clinton are twice as likely as men to question the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s victory, 42 vs. 21 percent. A Gallup poll released Friday \u00a0asking a slightly different question found\u00a0a smaller 23 percent of Clinton supporters saying they would not accept Trump as the legitimate president when he is inaugurated in January. In the Post-ABC poll, nearly all of Trump\u2019s supporters say he was elected legitimately, 99 percent, also marking a turnabout in confidence from one week ago when only 69 percent said they were prepared to accept the results of the election. While voters\u2019 intensely negative views of the major candidate they opposed may explain their willingness to question the overall result, another factor may be the unexpected nature of Trump\u2019s win and a split between which candidate won the electoral college and popular vote. [ How much did polls miss the mark - and why? ] Polls largely showed Clinton with a small lead in the popular vote nationally as well as\u00a0an edge in swing states, and several election forecasters giving Clinton at least an 85 percent chance of winning.\u00a0Trump won by a margin of 290 to 228 electoral votes \u00a0(with New Hampshire and Michigan still yet to be called), while\u00a0Clinton holds a 47.8 percent to 47.3 percent margin in the current popular vote count. This Washington Post-ABC News poll by telephone November 9-11, 2016 among a random national sample of 865 adults, including users of both conventional and cellular phones. The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Media, Pa.

(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) Mike Evans became the latest NFL player to kneel during the national anthem, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver isn't doing it for the same reason as San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and many of his peers. Evans said he the act prior to Sunday's 36-10 win against the Bears was a form of\u00a0protest against Donald Trump becoming President-elect. \u201cIf this happens, then America\u2019s not right right now,\u201d Evans told reporters after the game . \u201cI said this a long time ago. When [Donald Trump] ran, I thought it was a joke, and the joke continues. I\u2019m not a political person that much, but I got common sense. And I know when something\u2019s not right.\u201d Evans said he had not informed the team of his plans, adding that he did not want his intentions to be misconstrued. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, you know, disrespect the veterans or anything,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThe men and women who serve this country, I\u2019m forever indebted to them. But the things that\u2019s been going on in America lately, I\u2019m not going to stand for that. When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says we\u2019ve been punked, then I\u2019ll stand again. But I won\u2019t stand anymore.\u201d Evans added his protest would continue\u00a0\"as long as (Trump is)\u00a0the president-elect.\" Packers stand fully exposed after rout by Titans Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in the preseason to protest police brutality and racial injustices. He said he did not vote in the election and that the outcome \"didn't really matter\" to him. Evans had four catches for 66 yards on Sunday, giving him 811 yards on the season so far.

    "text": "Donald Trump Appears to Soften Stance on Immigration, but Not on Abortion By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS Continue reading the main story Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump during a meeting with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, last week on Capitol Hill. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump appeared to soften some of his hardest-line campaign positions on immigration on Sunday, but he also restated his pledge to roll back abortion rights and used Twitter to lash out at his critics, leaving open the possibility that he would continue using social media in the Oval Office and radically change the way presidents speak to Americans. In his first prime-time television interview since his upset victory on Tuesday , Mr. Trump repeated his promise to name a Supreme Court justice who opposed abortion rights and would help overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized them, returning the issue to the states. Asked where that would leave women seeking abortions, Mr. Trump said on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d \u201cWell, they\u2019ll perhaps have to go \u2014 they\u2019ll have to go to another state.\u201d On immigration, he said the wall that he has been promising to build on the nation\u2019s southern border might end up being a fence in places. But he said his priority was to deport two million to three million immigrants he characterized as dangerous or as having criminal records, a change from his original position that he would deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. President Obama has deported more than two million undocumented immigrants during his time in office. Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump said that undocumented immigrants who are not criminals are \u201cterrific people,\u201d and that he would decide how to handle them after the border is secure. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan , echoed the president-elect, saying on Sunday that there would be no deportation force, something Mr. Trump had promised to create early in his campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Mr. Trump also said he considered the Supreme Court decision last year that validated same-sex marriages as settled, and that he was \u201cfine with that.\u201d He endorsed popular aspects of President Obama\u2019s health insurance law, including a provision that requires coverage of people with pre-existing medical conditions and one that allows young people to remain on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26. But even as he appeared to inch toward the political center, Mr. Trump used a series of postings on Twitter to argue that The New York Times\u2019s coverage of him has been \u201cBAD\u201d and \u201cvery poor and highly inaccurate.\u201d He falsely stated that The Times had issued an apology to readers, an apparent reference to a letter to readers from The Times\u2019s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and its executive editor, Dean Baquet. The letter noted the unpredictable nature of the election and said The Times aimed to \u201crededicate\u201d itself to \u201cthe fundamental mission of Times journalism.\u201d In the letter, The Times posed a series of what it called inevitable questions, including, \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d Mr. Trump also claimed that the newspaper had been losing thousands of subscribers over its campaign coverage. In a Twitter message in reply to Mr. Trump, The Times said it had seen a \u201csurge\u201d in new subscriptions since the election \u2014 four times the pre-election rate. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our election coverage & we will continue to \u2018hold power to account,\u2019\u201d The Times said . Mr. Trump, in another Twitter post , said The Times had falsely reported that he believed additional nations should acquire nuclear arms. However, in an interview in March with The Times, Mr. Trump, asked about the North Korean threat to its neighbors, said he thought America\u2019s allies might need their own nuclear deterrent. \u201cIf Japan had that nuclear threat, I\u2019m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,\u201d he said. Later, he added, \u201cThe bottom line is, I think that frankly, as long as North Korea\u2019s there, I think that Japan having a capability is something that maybe is going to happen whether we like it or not.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story His posts on Twitter were a striking public display from a man who, after winning the election, had worked to project an air of seriousness and self-discipline, first in a victory speech early Wednesday and then in an Oval Office meeting the next day with Mr. Obama, whom he called a \u201cgood man\u201d for whom he had \u201cgreat respect.\u201d Photo Kellyanne Conway, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition leadership team, arrived on Sunday at Trump Tower in New York. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times But by Thursday evening, Mr. Trump was using Twitter to complain about demonstrations against his victory , saying they were being mounted by \u201cprofessional protesters, incited by the media,\u201d and branding them as \u201cvery unfair!\u201d The social media sniping \u2014 unparalleled in the history of presidential communication \u2014 suggested that Mr. Trump plans to bring his confrontational style of speaking to Americans to the White House, working to undercut news outlets that do not comport with his views, silence his critics and elevate his own standing. On Sunday, he selected Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a site known for its nationalist, racially charged and conspiracy-laden coverage, to be his chief strategist and senior counselor. It was only one indication of the extraordinary nature of the president-elect\u2019s tactics and those of his inner circle.

    "text": "Change this Bears team now, and start with Jay Cutler Photos of the Bears-Buccaneers game at Raymond James Stadium on Nov. 13, 2016. After their surprising \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019\u2019 win over the Vikings , Bears players and coaches commented on how emotional and passionate and great Jay Cutler was. Many of them offered thoughts on the leadership he provided as well as his excellent execution. I know Bears coaches and his teammates meant well, but all they did was expose Cutler. I mean, eight seasons into his reign as Bears starting quarterback is a little embarrassing to have people finally and loudly saying that. Embarrassing and late. And worthless. What else is there to think after the big-talking 2-6 Bears spit up a winnable game to a miserable Buccaneers team that is at least as bad as the Bears, if not worse. And the guy spitting up the most in the 36-10 humiliation? You betcha. Cutler. Mr. Leadership. Mr. Career Revival. Mr Passionate Speech. Forget the talk of the Bears ' close-knit locker room and the togetherness with which they promised to attack the stretch run. Pay no mind to the confidence the team believed it gathered in a 20-10 upset of the Vikings on Halloween night. In the grand analysis, that all means so little. And any... Forget the talk of the Bears ' close-knit locker room and the togetherness with which they promised to attack the stretch run. Pay no mind to the confidence the team believed it gathered in a 20-10 upset of the Vikings on Halloween night. In the grand analysis, that all means so little. And any... Yep, Cutler was that guy again. Cutler always reverts to that guy. But this was not just any pick-six, people. No, this was a Chris Conte pick-six. Yes, that Chris Conte, the one who always seemed to fall down in the Bears secondary. He took advantage of a pathetic Cutler decision deep in Bears territory to waltz into the end zone. When Conte stings you for a pick-six, you have no choice but to burn the charter, fold the franchise and say thanks for the time as the NFL\u2019s heritage team. But wait. That wasn\u2019t Cutler\u2019s only disaster. The pick-six was his second straight interception. Two plays, two passes, two picks. Nice time to play like Mr. Efficient. Then after the pick-six, he dragged out the house special: the strip-sack turnover. But wait. This wasn\u2019t just any strip-sack. No, this was a strip-sack on a play that began at the Bucs\u2019 4-yard line. Forget all the talk about the Bears not bringing back Cutler next season. He shouldn\u2019t have been brought back for the next series. The Cutler-John Fox axis screams for someone to create a player-coach metric that measures bad squared times stupid squared. Brad Biggs, Dan Wiederer on Bears' 36-10 loss to Buccaneers Tribune writers Brad Biggs and Dan Wiederer react to the Bears' 36-10 loss to the Buccaneers.\u00a0 Tribune writers Brad Biggs and Dan Wiederer react to the Bears' 36-10 loss to the Buccaneers.\u00a0 And remember, this came against one of the worst defenses in the league. And remember, this came after a week off. And remember, the aforementioned Cutler horribleness came in the first half alone. The second half didn\u2019t matter, although Cutler walked into another strip-sack that went for a safety in the third quarter, his fourth turnover of a game in which the coach refused to make a change because, I guess, he hates his players or the McCaskeys or is trying to get fired and paid off because this is a joke. And so, here\u2019s the question that continues to lack a sane answer: Where are you going with Cutler? Besides into the toilet, I mean. That has been the question for a while, and every time it gets asked, general manager Ryan Pace gets pantsed. ",

Deputy Dennis Wallace, a 20-year department veteran, was shot twice in the head shortly after coming across a stolen van\u00a0in Fox Grove Park, just outside the city of Hughson, Stanislaus County Sheriff\u00a0Adam Christianson told reporters at a news conference. \u201cWe know for a fact that the gun used in this crime was in direct contact with his head when the trigger was pulled -- twice,\u201d Christianson said, according to a\u00a0 video posted by news station KCR3. \u201cThis was an execution.\u201d The suspect, identified as David Machado Jr., 36, fled before carjacking a 2009 white Kia Rio in the nearby community of Keyes, Christianson said. The van was abandoned nearby. (Richard Winton) While on the run, Machado traveled at least 150 miles before committing\u00a0an armed robbery at a convenience store in Lindsay, about 15 miles east of the City of Tulare in the Central Valley, Christianson said during another\u00a0news conference announcing the suspect\u2019s arrest. Then, shortly after noon, Machado\u00a0tried to steal a purse from a woman, who fought back and called police, he said. Police officers who responded to her report chased Machado on foot and took him into custody, the sheriff said. \u201cHe surrendered to those peace officers who were chasing him,\u201d Christianson said.\u00a0 He said Machado\u00a0was identified through his tattoos and a photograph that\u00a0had been released to other law enforcement agencies. Christianson said authorities\u00a0have recovered a van Machado used to flee from Fox Grove Park as well as the Kia Rio he carjacked later. \u201cThere\u2019s still much work to be done,\u201d Christianson said. \u201cWe will be bringing Mr. Machado back here to Stanislaus County to stand trial and we will seek justice, and justice will be done in this case.\u201d\u00a0 Christianson said the events that led to the shooting began about 8:24 a.m. when Wallace called in and was told by dispatch that a car he saw at the Fox Grove Fishing Access\u00a0was stolen. Wallace asked for another unit but never responded to additional messages from dispatchers, Christianson said. A second deputy discovered Wallace when he arrived. The gunman had fled, Christianson said. The carjacking in Keyes occurred about 8:40 a.m., the sheriff said.\u00a0 Machado, he said, had an outstanding warrant in connection with another felony, but the sheriff did not elaborate. \u201cHe is a known criminal,\u201d Christianson said. Wallace, he said, was well-known for working on anti-drug and early intervention programs. He was married with a family, the sheriff said. The killing was the second in four years for the Stanislaus County Sheriff\u2019s Department. In 2012,\u00a0Deputy\u00a0Robert Paris, a 16-year department veteran,\u00a0was killed\u00a0along with a civilian when a gunman opened fire as authorities tried to serve an eviction notice at an apartment complex in Modesto. Last month, four law enforcement officers were slain in California in a two-week period.\u00a0 On Oct. 6, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Steve Owen was shot as he responded to a burglary report in Lancaster. Authorities said Trenton Trevon Lovell, 27, shot Owen and then stood over the wounded lawman and pumped an additional four rounds into his\u00a0body. Lovell, 27,\u00a0has been charged with murdering Owen, attempted murder of a second sheriff\u2019s deputy and other charges. Days later, Palm Springs police Officers Lesley Zerebny, 27, and Jose \u201cGil\u201d Vega, 63, were shot and killed in what officials said was a planned attack. The Riverside County district attorney said John Hernandez Felix, 26, set a trap for officers and ambushed them\u00a0as they stood outside his door. Authorities also said\u00a0Felix used an assault rifle with an extended magazine and wore\u00a0body armor during the shooting that he\u00a0was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms because he was a convicted felon. And on Oct. 19, Modoc County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Jack Hopkins was gunned down \u00a0while responding to a disturbance call. Modoc officials said Hopkins was killed as he entered a property about eight miles south of Alturas when he was confronted and shot by Jack Lee Breiner. The deputy\u00a0was killed instantly. As he fled,\u00a0Breiner, 47, engaged another deputy in a gunbattle and was shot and wounded, authorities said. He has been charged with murder and other crimes in connection with the killing. On Sunday, Christianson decried having to face reporters again to announce the slaying of one of his deputies and called for a show of unity for law enforcement nationwide. \u201cUnfortunately, we do this far too often here in California and nationwide,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to ask yourself the question: Where does it stop? Where does it end?\u201d A vigil for Wallace was planned for Sunday evening in Hughson, some two miles from where the deputy was fatally shot. People were asked to wear blue and bring a candle to the event. Meanwhile, others showed their support for the department by delivering flowers. Law enforcement agencies throughout the state also sent their condolences through social media. \u201cThe killing of Deputy Dennis Wallace has had a tremendous negative effect on all of the organization,\u201d Christianson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost someone who is special to us.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

    "text": "Four Americans Killed in Afghanistan During Veteran\u2019s Day Run By James Gordon Meek Nov 13, 2016, 12:57 PM ET 0 Shares Star Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images Afghan security personnel keep watch near the largest US military base in Bagram, north of Kabul, after an explosion, Nov. 12, 2016. 0 Shares Email Four Americans were killed and 17 troops and contractors were wounded while participating in a Veterans Day 5K run when an apparent lone attacker managed to detonate a deadly bomb inside the sprawling Bagram military base in Afghanistan yesterday, counterterrorism officials told ABC News today. The U.S. military's Operation Resolute Support provided few details beyond confirming that a blast inside the base had left two U.S. service members and two American contractors dead along with 16 American troops and a Polish trooper wounded. Bagram Airfield is home to nearly 14,000 military forces and contractors. But officials in Washington and various U.S. military commands have been told that the victims were participating in a 5K run celebrating Veterans Day, two counterterrorism officials told ABC News. A coalition official later told ABC News that the attacker used a belt or vest bomb in the attack. The attacker was a former Taliban militant who had joined the peace process in 2008 and had since taken a job at the base, Bagram District Governor Haji Abdul Shokor Qudosi told ABC News on Sunday. Neither the exact nature of the attacker\u2019s work on the base, nor when he began working there is known. It is common for local residents to take jobs like day laborers, cleaners and cook assistants at the facility. The district governor told ABC News that Afghan security forces had raided the attacker\u2019s residence in the Laghmani village and had detained two of his relatives for further investigation. Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy in Kabul was closed \"for routine services\" on Sunday in wake of the attacks on Bagram Airfiled and an earlier attack on a German Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, according to a communique from the State Department. The State Department said that the embassy \u201ccontinues to receive reports of militants planning unspecified attacks in Kabul City and elsewhere in Afghanistan against locations and individuals with potential American connections.\u201d As part of standard operating procedure, outside communications at the military base are temporarily shut off after deadly attacks. The Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility in a statement today, claiming much higher casualties. \"I am deeply saddened to learn that an explosion early this morning at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan has resulted in U.S. casualties. An apparent suicide bomber has taken the lives of two U.S. service members and two U.S. contractors working on the base,\"\u00a0Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement today. \"For those who carried out this attack, my message is simple. We will not be deterred in our mission to protect our homeland and help Afghanistan secure its own future,\" Carter said.\u00a0 \"To the family and friends of those who lost their lives today, we share your loss and our thoughts are with you. We offer you our deepest condolences. For the family and\u00a0friends of those wounded in today\u2019s attack, let me assure you they are receiving the\u00a0best care possible, and we will keep them in our\u00a0thoughts today,\u201d said Army General John W.\u00a0Nicholson, Commander of Resolute Support. \"To those who target Coalition forces, ANDSF, and Afghan civilians, Resolute Support and USFOR-A will continue to pursue our Train, Advise, and Assist mission to help our partners create a better Afghanistan.\u201d The deadly bombing appears to be unprecedented in the 15-year Afghan War. Past attacks on various gates and checkpoints at Bagram, an hour's drive north of the capital Kabul, have never succeeded in penetrating the many layers of security. In 2007, a suicide bomber killed 22 civilians and Army Pfc. Daniel Zizumbo during a coincidental visit by then-Vice President Richard Cheney. After a stop by President Obama to visit with troops at Bagram Airfield in 2010, the Taliban lobbed rockets at the base.\u00a0 In both cases, the Afghan Taliban claimed falsely that Cheney and Obama had been the targets, which American officials denied. The most serious breach of security at Bagram known to have occurred was in July 2005 when four senior al-Qaeda operatives succeeded in escaping a prison located on the flight line. ABC News\u2019 Lucien Bruggeman contributed reporting. Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the fact that the Taliban lobbed rockets at the base after President Obama visited in 2010. A previous version of this story said a mortar attack occurred in early 2013. 0 Shares ",

You get humiliated by a bad football team in a stadium where the visiting team almost always has the upper hand. Tampa was bustling with Bears backers all weekend and fans were decked out in navy and orange in every corner of Raymond James Stadium. They came, it turns out, to see a throwback effort to the Marc Trestman era. That's how abysmal the 36-10 loss Sunday to the Buccaneers was. It was the first victory at home for Tampa coach Dirk Koetter and improved the Bucs to 4-17 in their last 21 games at the pirate ship. Coach John Fox gave his Bears players a week off after a rousing victory against the Vikings on Halloween and when they returned you heard the most confident bunch of players you can imagine. They should believe in themselves, but on Sunday you have to show up and play. Jay Cutler turned the ball over four times for the first time since a 40-32 loss to the Lions in Week 4 of the 2013 season. That loss ended the last three-game winning streak the Bears (2-7) have had. Given a chance to win back-to-back games Sunday, they were hideous. Paid well to prevent losses as embarrassing as Sunday's, which painted the Bears as unprepared for the Buccaneers as they were overwhelmed, coach John Fox offered honesty that indicts everybody. \"I didn't see it coming,'' Fox said after a 36-10 defeat at Raymond James Stadium that was as incomprehensible... Paid well to prevent losses as embarrassing as Sunday's, which painted the Bears as unprepared for the Buccaneers as they were overwhelmed, coach John Fox offered honesty that indicts everybody. \"I didn't see it coming,'' Fox said after a 36-10 defeat at Raymond James Stadium that was as incomprehensible... (David Haugh) Cutler, reminding general manager Ryan Pace why he worried about the quarterback when he was hired 22 months ago, was intercepted twice with former Bears safety Chris Conte taking one for a pick-six. Add in a fumble by rookie running back Jordan Howard, who did reach 100 yards, and it was a five-turnover experience. Cutler, an 11th-year veteran, remains oblivious to back-side pressure. Forget the idea of having eyes in the back of his helmet. He has a blindfold. It's no wonder the coaching staff wanted to stick with Brian Hoyer until he suffered a broken left arm and they tried to explain away that Cutler was their guy all along. Uh-huh, sure. On third-and-goal from the 4-yard line and with a chance to take the lead early in the second quarter, Cutler was stripped from behind by rookie Noah Spence. The same thing happened in his own end zone with Robert Ayers getting him from behind. Conte's touchdown, a giveaway in the red zone and a safety add up to a minimum of a 12-point swing, maybe more, and we've already established this is a roster with no room for error. The Bears were as healthy as they had been since training camp and they came in feeling good about their upset of the first-place Vikings. Cameron Meredith caught a tipped pass on a Hail Mary on the final play of the first half, and miraculously the deficit was only 17-10 despite four giveaways. They ran for 102 yards in the first half against a wretched Bucs defense. They just couldn't hold on to the damn ball. Photos of the Bears-Buccaneers game at Raymond James Stadium on Nov. 13, 2016. \"That outcome wasn't even close to being in our mind,\" tight end Zach Miller said. \"I mean, four turnovers in the first half? We're still so in that game. We sucked. Offensively we were terrible.\" Is overconfident a fair charge? \"Who knows?\" Miller said. \"We didn't feel like we were a 2-6 football team. I know that is what our record was. Today proved it, but I don't think we were overconfident. We didn't execute well especially in the red zone.\" The Bucs (4-5) iced the game with a 17-play drive that consumed 9 minutes, 56 seconds. They converted five third downs along the way, imposing their will. Bucs right tackle Demar Dotson said Bears defenders were yapping all day despite the lopsided score. \"They just like to talk,\" he said. \"They're a good defensive group. ... But I think at some point you need to just look at the score and shut up.\" ",

He was 74. An email from Leon Russell Records to The Associated Press says Russell died in Nashville on Saturday night. The email cites Russell\u2019s wife as the source of the information. Russell had heart bypass surgery in July and was recovering from that at the time of his death. He had been planning on resuming touring in January, the email said. Besides his music, Russell was known for his striking appearance: wispy white hair halfway down his back and that covered much of his face. He wrote Joe Cocker\u2019s \u201cDelta Lady\u201d and in 1969 put together Cocker\u2019s \u201cMad Dogs and Englishmen\u201d tour, which spawned a documentary film and a hit double album. As a musician, primarily a pianist, he played on The Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and Jan and Dean\u2019s \u201cSurf City.\u201d He also played guitar and bass. Russell produced and played on recording sessions for Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Ike and Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones and many others. He recorded hit songs himself like \u201cTight Rope\u201d and \u201cLady Blue\u201d and participated in \u201cThe Concert for Bangladesh.\u201d John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison played on his first album, \u201cLeon Russell.\u201d His concerts often ended with a rousing version of \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash.\u201d In 1973, Billboard Magazine listed Russell as the top concert attraction in the world. About this time, he was the headline act on billings that included Elton John and at other times Willie Nelson. In a 1992 interview with The Associated Press, Russell said music doesn\u2019t really change much. \u201cIt\u2019s cyclical, like fashion. You keep your old clothes and they\u2019ll be in style again sooner or later. \u201cThere are new things, like rap. But that\u2019s a rebirth of poetry. It\u2019s brought poetry to the public consciousness.\u201d He and Elton John released \u201cThe Union,\u201d a critically received duo album in 2010. Russell, born in Lawton, Oklahoma, began as a night club piano player in Oklahoma at the age of 14, also backing touring artists when they came to town. Jerry Lee Lewis was so impressed with Russell that he hired Russell and his band for two years of tours. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1959, where he became known as a top musician, and later to Nashville. In the early 2000s he began his own record label, Leon Russell Records. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Fearing it's becoming more divided, too, survivors and victims' families marked Sunday's anniversary of the violence by pleading for national unity instead. Tourism is hurting, armed forces roam streets and France is still under a state of emergency that rights groups call abusive and ineffective \u2014 and that the prime minister now says may be extended yet again. \"We always have this fear that weighs heavily in our hearts. We always try to be careful. And every time we pass by here, we think of them,\" said Sabrina Nedjadi, paying respects Sunday at two cafes in her diverse eastern Paris neighborhood targeted in the attacks. The Associated Press French President Francois Hollande speaks with a victim after unveiling a commemorative plaque outside the Stade de France stadium, in Saint-Denis, near Paris, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016, during a ceremony held for the victims of last year's Paris attacks. At midday, hundreds of balloons were released to honor the memories of the victims; at dusk, paper lanterns were released into the Canal Saint Martin , bearing red, white and blue lights representing the French tricolor. Onlookers, including many families with children, lined the canal and surrounding bridges, watching silently as the lanterns drifted. Some fear that France itself is adrift, its government unable to defeat the amorphous extremist enemy even as authorities encroach on liberties the French hold dear. While French warplanes are targeting IS strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the state of emergency at home allows broadened police powers to search homes and monitor communications. But it could not prevent further attacks on France over the past year, including a truck rampage in Nice by a man claiming allegiance to IS. \"Yes, terrorism will strike us again,\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned this weekend The Associated Press A commemorative plaque unveiled by French President Francois Hollande and Saint-Denis Mayor Didier Paillard is seen outside the Stade de France stadium, in Saint-Denis, near Paris, Nov. 13, 2016, during a ceremony held for the victims of the Paris attacks The International Federation for Human Rights warned in a recent report: \"France is now in a situation where an 'exceptional' regime is becoming permanent, in the name of combating terrorism. But there is little evidence that this approach is working and it comes at a cost to fundamental rights.\" As silence descended Sunday on Paris for a series of commemorations, the son of the first victim of the attacks spoke out for tolerance in the face of hate. Manuel Dias, an immigrant from Portugal, was killed by a suicide bomber outside the national stadium during an international match Nov. 13, 2015.

Under heavy security, President Francois Hollande unveiled a plaque in his memory Sunday near the Stade de France. Dias' son Michael said his father was \"living proof that integration is possible, necessary\" to end such violence. Learning to live again after extremists killed his father was \"a personal challenge, but it concerns us all,\" Dias said. \"Long live tolerance, long live intelligence, long live France.\" Some people cried, others simply lit candles or laid flowers at ceremonies Sunday near the six bars and eateries where gunmen opened fire on unsuspecting crowds enjoying an unusually mild November Friday night. Notre Dame Cathedral held a special commemorative Mass on Sunday evening. Across the Seine River, mourners, tourists and residents streamed to the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 people were killed by three attackers who also took hostages. The concert hall reopened Saturday night with an emotional concert by Sting. The Associated Press British musician Sting performs on stage at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, France, Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016. Jesse Hughes of Eagles of Death Metal, the California band whose concert that night ended in a bloodbath, paid respects at the Bataclan ceremony, placing his hand on his heart as he departed. Nine people remain hospitalized from the attacks; others are paralyzed. Hundreds are still receiving psychological treatment. \"After this November 13th we lost part of our insouciance. The state of emergency has also contributed to set in a climate of fear,\" said Daniel Psenny, a Le Monde journalist who is still recovering from a shot in the arm while trying to rescue a Bataclan victim. But while some are moving out of his neighborhood, he refuses to cede to fear and remains proud of its diversity \u2014 a reflection of an increasingly heterogenous France. \"We must live. We are the ones who enshrine the spirit of this district, the way we live, the way we work, the way we get together. We perpetuate that. If we abandon (this area), that means terrorism has won,\" he said. The coordinated attacks were a wake-up call for France and for Europe. They followed the January 2015 newsroom massacre at the satiric newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris and a Kosher grocery store that left 17 dead. But the complex planning behind the Nov. 13 attacks and the high number of deaths revealed a degree of French vulnerability not previously suspected by authorities. Neighboring Belgium, the starting point of the attacks in Paris, was hit on March 22 with attacks on its airport and a metro station that killed 32 people. Yet a sign scrawled and posted near the Bataclan, \"Love for all, hate for no one,\" captures the sense of defiance shared by many. Since the Charlie Hebdo attacks, \"even if there is still worry in the minds of all French people, fear, there is a bit more love ... to the reverse of what you might think, it gives us a desire to be together,\" said Gregory Reibenberg, whose wife Djamila died in his arms in his cafe, La Belle Equipe, along with 18 other friends, colleagues and patrons. \"It unifies us more than the other way around,\" he said. \"Even if it affects us all deeply, forever.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Jeffrey Schaeffer, Masha Macpherson, Oleg Cetinic and Milos Krivokapic contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Where are they now? Is there a plot or a plan?\" At the end of October, as the first anniversary of the deadly Paris terror attacks neared, NYPD intelligence officers from 13 locations around the world met in London with some of their foreign counterparts to discuss the latest intelligence and how to improve cooperation. Among those attending the London meeting was Antwerp's intelligence chief Karl Hareen. He said the two police departments \"not only share information but we share best practices, to share expertise. So we try to reach out to partners who can help us ... and of course who better to choose than the NYPD.\" As an example, he pointed out how his department asked the NYPD to help conduct and review Antwerp's marathon security measures after the Boston marathon bombings to see if improvements were needed. Jonathan Dienst of NBC News (left) outside the Bataclan nightclub in Paris, which is reopening a year after a deadly terror attack, with neighborhood resident Anne Sophie de Chaisemartin. She helped many of the attack victims before first responders arrived. Chief Thomas Galati, who helps run the NYPD's overseas intelligence program, said learning from other cities firsthand about the plots and threats they face helps the NYPD improve. After getting briefings from French officials, Galati said NYPD exercises mirroring recent attacks in France showed the NYPD needed more counterterror teams trained and in place in case of a multipronged attack. \"We drilled it ourselves in a tabletop [exercise] and we ran out of emergency service personnel after a certain amount of time. So we needed to bolster up our response.\" The NYPD detectives in-country agreed to be interviewed but asked their names not be used given the ongoing plots by ISIS terrorists to target Western police officials. The NYPD London liaison who works most days inside Scotland Yard said the threat from returning ISIS fighters to Europe is growing - including inside Britain. That threat is a growing concern for New York too. \"The Atlantic is no longer the barrier it once was,\" the detective said. \"By working together, we have a much better chance of mitigating the threat.\" Soldiers and security forces are now a bigger presence in Paris a year after the terror attacks. NBC News In Paris, the NYPD liaison officer speaks the language and works closely with intelligence officers at Paris police headquarters. \"They share information on their investigations. And anything that would be of interest to New York City, I would relay that information back to my counterparts in New York.\" This weekend marked the one-year anniversary of the attacks in Paris that killed 130 and injured more than 360. Some of the attackers in that plot had possible ties to New York. Information was immediately shared and NYPD officials worked to track if there was any additional threat inside the U.S. In Paris, 15 terror suspects have been arrested in just the last three months. And France has seen more than 1700 of its citizens travel to Syria, while thousands more inside France are believed to be radicalized. A second NYPD detective in France assigned to Interpol gets updates on those most dangerous of travelers and helps relay information back to 1 Police Plaza.

The NYPD also hosts foreign officers in New York. Jordanian security officials are currently training with NYPD emergency services teams. And in Amman, NYPD intelligence officers are working alongside Jordanian police in drills and tabletops to try to improve information flow. Lieutenant John Miedreich served in the Jordanian post before becoming the day-to-day coordinator of the NYPD's 13 overseas posts. He says those 13 officers \u2014 while based in specific cities \u2014 cover numerous countries and have relationships with numerous agencies. While the FBI and CIA play a critical role in gathering threat information, Miedreich said there is something about the \"cop to cop\" relationship that gets important information back to New York fast. Related: Paris Terror Files Reveal Missed Opportunities to Stop Attacks \"The intelligence needs of a municipal police department are vastly different than that of a federal agency,\" Miedreich said. \"Actionable intelligence or let's say a lesson learned in the way of tactics, techniques or procedures of a terrorist ... Analyzing these things allows us to implement policies and procedures that can better help protect the city.\" John Miller points to a recent attack at a museum in Tunisia as an example of critical lessons learned. He said an NYPD liaison got a full briefing and all the surveillance camera footage from that attack. As a result, the NYPD put together a detailed tactical report and gave a presentation to all New York-area museums. \"And we said what can you learn from this?\" recounted Miller. \"Are you able to close off parts of the museum by shutting down gates or access that can protect people? Are you able to monitor through your video control centers all of the movements of the terrorists?\" The NYPD program began under former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. His successor, Commissioner Bill Bratton, and current Commissioner Jimmy O'Neill have worked to expand it. Talks are underway with Chinese officials and additional Mideast countries to host and share information directly with NYPD personnel. Play ",

Frazer Harrison/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Leon Russell died in his sleep last night, his family says. The singer and songwriter had been planning to resume touring in January; he's seen here in 2011. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Leon Russell has died in Nashville at the age of 74. His wife, Jan, said through an intermediary that the legendary musician and songwriter had died Sunday in his sleep in Nashville. Russell \"had heart bypass surgery in July and was recovering from that,\" his record company tells NPR in confirming Russell's death. The musician had been hoping to resume touring in January. A native of Oklahoma, Russell's talents \u2014 and his unique ability to span country and gospel, blues and rock \u2014 led him to collaborate with many of the finest musicians of the past 50 years, from Joe Cocker and B.B. King to Elton John and Willie Nelson. Russell was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2011, and the range of people who recorded his music reflected the breadth of his ability. His hit songs include \"This Masquerade\" \u2014 which was recorded by both George Benson and The Carpenters \u2014 and \"Superstar,\" written with Bonnie Bramlett. Others included \"Tight Rope,\" \"Delta Lady\" and \"A Song For You\" \u2014 which was recorded by both Andy Williams and Ray Charles. Back in 2010, Russell embarked on a tour with Elton John, after the pair put out an album together titled The Union. They had first met in 1970, when Russell saw John play his first U.S. concerts. Forty years later, NPR recorded them playing together at The Beacon Theatre in New York City. Elton John And Leon Russell Live from the Beacon Theatre 2:34:04 Embed Embed \"He is my idol,\" John said of Russell at the time. Article continues after sponsorship As NPR reported of that concert : \"The evening began with Russell performing six of his classics, beginning with his biggest hit, \"Tight Rope.\" Then, about 26 minutes in, the duo ran through The Union, hitting a high note with the rowdy 'Hey Ahab.' John capped the evening with an hour of his signature hits, which begin around the 1 hour, 33 minute mark after a rousing ovation from the Beacon audience.\" It was another live tour and album \u2014 Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen \u2014 that Russell used as a breakthrough in his career. In addition to contributing the songs \"Delta Lady\" and \"Superstar\" to the album, Russell led the band on the road, wearing a tophat, long hair and a beard and showing a deep-rooted mastery of soulful music. YouTube Russell's career spanned from Frank Sinatra \u2014 who kept armed guards \"at every door,\" he once told NPR \u2014 to Sonic Youth, who covered his song \"Superstar.\" Last year, the pianist and songwriter told PRI's Studio 360 that he thought he wouldn't have become the same person if he hadn't sustained an injury at birth, which left the right side of his body slightly paralyzed. \"It gave me a very strong sense of duality,\" Russell said. \"It gave me an outlook into this plane that we live on and if I hadn't had that, I'd probably be selling cars in Paris, Texas.\" ",

Rich Campbell Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chris Conte extended his arms wide as he sprinted toward the goal line with Jay Cutler 's pass in the first quarter Sunday. The fireworks inside him were exploding. Conte, the former Bears safety, still carries with him the hate spewed his way on social media by countless Bears fans during his four years with the team from 2011-14. He still resents the daggers fired at him in newsprint and on sports talk radio in Chicago. So after his 20-yard interception return for a touchdown propelled the Buccaneers to a 36-10 romp of the hapless Bears, he had a message for the Bears fan base. \"I hate to make it personal, but for me it is personal,\" he said. \"It feels great. I don't want to say, '(Expletive) you, Chicago.' But, I want to say, '(Expletive) you, Chicago.'\" Conte had the football from his first career touchdown tucked into a bag inside his locker. To say he was satisfied that he added to the Bears' misery would be a major understatement. And his pick-six was only part of the Bears' disastrous performance coming off their open date. Chris Conte Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune Buccaneers strong safety Chris Conte celebrates after scoring during the first half against the Bears at Raymond James Stadium on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016, in Tampa, Fla. Buccaneers strong safety Chris Conte celebrates after scoring during the first half against the Bears at Raymond James Stadium on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016, in Tampa, Fla. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Cutler turned the ball over four times \u2014 two interceptions and two lost fumbles \u2014 against the NFL's 28th-ranked defense. For as good as he was against the Vikings on Halloween returning from a six-game absence, he was at least that bad against the Buccaneers. Cutler's passer rating of 55.1 was his worst in the last 57 games he has finished. And that rating was inflated by a 50-yard Hail Mary touchdown to Cameron Meredith as the first half expired. Cutler was pressured consistently, but he misfired on several passes for which the pocket was clean and he had time. Both of Cutler's fumbles occurred on sacks on which he was chased down from behind. Buccaneers defensive ends Noah Spence and Robert Ayers each made him pay for holding the ball too long and not recognizing the threat behind him. Ayers' strip-sack in the third quarter was at the Bears' goal line, and the ball rolled out of the end zone for a safety. ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Republican National Committee Chair Reince Preibus will be President-Elect Donald Trump's chief of staff. (Photo: Michael Reynolds, EPA) NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump on Sunday\u00a0tapped Reince Priebus \u2014 the Republican Party chairman who helped engineer his stunning presidential victory last week \u2014 as his White House chief of staff. Trump also considered campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon for the slot, but announced that the former Breitbart News executive would serve chief strategist and senior counselor for the administration that takes office in little more than two months. \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cSteve and Reince\u00a0are highly qualified leaders who\u00a0worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both\u00a0with me\u00a0in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d In thanking Trump for the appointment, Priebus said he would strive to \"create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\" Bannon, who joined Trump's team in August, said that \"we had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory. We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201d Priebus, a lawyer and political operative who became Republican Party chairman in 2011, developed the get-out-the-vote operation that Trump's campaign rode to a come-from-behind victory over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. While critical of some of Trump's comments at times, Priebus became one of the GOP establishment's most vocal proponents of Trump after the New York businessman won the party nomination. The new White House chief of staff is also a close ally of a frequent Trump critic, House Speaker Paul Ryan. As a news executive, Bannon helped turned Breitbart into a leading voice of conservatism and a champion\u00a0of Trump's candidacy. But Ryan has been one of the news site's top targets. beyond personnel announcements, the president-elect began sketching out policy priorities this weekend and appeared to temper some of his campaign rhetoric. His proposed\u00a0wall along the U.S.-Mexican border may include some fencing instead, Trump said, \u00a0and his initial deportation plan will focus on \"criminals\" who are in the country illegally. In \"certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\" but \"there could be some fencing,\" Trump said\u00a0in an interview with CBS\u2019 Sunday newsmagazine 60 Minutes. While pledging more deportations, Trump said he would emphasize criminals before deciding what to do about law-abiding families who are in the country illegally. \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\" Trump told CBS,\u00a0later adding: \"After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people.\" Trump put the number of deportable criminals at two to three million,\u00a0but immigration experts say it is much lower. Trump said on 60 Minutes that if Americans are afraid of how he might run the government, it is \u201conly because they don't know me.\u201d For instance, reporter Lesley Stalh suggested that gays and lesbians may fear Trump would roll back marriage equality for same-sex couples. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been a supporter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And I'm fine with that.\u201d Trump railed against lobbyists and special interest on the campaign trail, but acknowledged that he has numerous lobbyists on his transition team, because \"That's the only people you have down there\". \"They know the system right now,\" Trump said, \"but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\" In addition to the 60 Minutes interview, the president-elect and aides holed up high in Trump Tower throughout the weekend as they pursued staffing decisions and policy planning for an administration that takes office in little more than two months.

Trump pledged to be\u00a0\"very restrained\" with social media during his presidency, but told 60 Minutes that \"the\u00a0fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.\" Social media, Trump said, \"has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\" Trump also seemed to extend olive branches to his critics over the weekend, including possible compromises on his plan to repeal President Obama's health care law. Trump spoke in terms of keeping provisions that forbid insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Trump has also said his priorities include a program of road-and-bridge projects (\"infrastructure\"), de-regulation of financial institutions, and beefing up border against drugs and illegal immigration. While the Trump campaign has provided little information, foreign governments have confirmed that their leaders spoke with the president-elect. The government of France, for example, said President Francois Hollande spoke with Trump for some 10 minutes Friday about terrorism and Syria. A Japanese official said Prime Minister\u00a0Shinzo Abe will be in New York on Thursday to meet with the incoming U.S. President. As Trump and his team huddled upstairs in his Manhattan tower, thousands of demonstrators\u00a0massed outside on Fifth Avenue throughout the weekend, protesting what they\u00a0called his racist\u00a0and sexist behavior throughout the campaign. Many protesters pointed out that Clinton will likely win the popular vote over Trump. In a weekend interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he wants to bring the country together after a rancorous campaign. Asked if he regretted his own aggressive rhetoric, Trump told the Journal: \"No, I won.\" 4376 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 347 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fPomdA ",

Annie Schmidt had been hiking, apparently along Munra Point , an area in John B. Yeon State Scenic Corridor, one of Oregon's National Parks when she disappeared. Jon Schmidt, Annie's father, who is a member of The Piano Guys, a group that gained popularity on YouTube , on Friday announced in a Facebook group dedicated to finding his daughter that remains believed to be his daughter's had been found. \"Today the dog teams found human remains at the bottom of a cliff in the area below Munra Point. The area is so far off trail and dense with vegetation that it required SAR to pretty much crawl uphill to get there,\" Schmidt said in his post, referring to search and rescue teams. \"Conclusive identification of the remains is impossible. The medical examiner will have conclusive identity verification by Monday or Tuesday. There is comfort in knowing from the circumstances that there would have been no suffering.\" He followed this with a post Saturday: \"We just received word from the medical examiner that the remains found yesterday have been positively identified as Annie. The cause was determined accidental. You have lived this trial with us and we pray that this may bring a greater level of resolution and peace for all of us. Much love, The Schmidts Annie Schmidt had recently moved to Oregon from Utah and had been missing since Oct. 21. The website OregonHikers.org describes Munra Point as a \"non-maintained trail,\" and warns that hikers \"have been seriously injured\" by falling from the summit ridges there. Jon Schmidt thanked those who offered the family support after his daughter went missing. \"There is no way to thank our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ for the support we have felt through you. You have searched with us, prayed with us, hoped with us, fasted with us, supported us and sacrificed for us. We thank you from the very bottom of our hearts!!!!,\" he wrote. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, which had been investigating her disappearance, did not immediately return a request for comment from ABC News. 0 Shares ",

Officer Michael Peters' suspension was announced Sunday by Traverse City police Chief Jeff O'Brien, who earlier said an internal investigation will start Monday to see whether Peters broke any departmental rules. \"He is not working as a police officer,\" O'Brien told the Traverse City Record-Eagle ( http://bit.ly/2euIuE5 ). \"I do not condone his actions.\" O'Brien confirmed that Peters was in a photo taken from Friday's rally. The newspaper could not reach Peters for comment, and The Associated Press was unable to find a telephone number for Peters. The Confederate battle flag is seen by many people as a symbol of hatred and intimidation of African-Americans following the U.S. Civil War and the freeing of blacks from slavery. The flag was flown from the rear bed of a pickup near a \"Love Trumps Hate\" rally in the city. The truck was then parked near the rally where the driver was seen drinking a beer. O'Brien said the behavior was intimidating and not a reflection of the police department's mission, according to the newspaper. \"We will get through this,\" O'Brien said. \"The community will get through this.\" There have been numerous reports of threats, intimidation and racially charged violence around the country since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's presidential election . \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: Traverse City Record-Eagle, http://www.record-eagle.com 0 Shares ",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, delivers a speech as Republican President-elect Donald Trump looks on during his election night event in New York City. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Less than a week after his election, Donald Trump has begun to fill out the team he plans to bring with him to the White House. The president-elect announced Sunday that he has selected Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to serve as chief of staff in his incoming administration. In the same announcement, Priebus' appointment shared top billing with the news that Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. Steve Bannon exits an elevator in the lobby of Trump Tower on Friday. He has been newly named the chief strategist of the Trump White House. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Steve Bannon exits an elevator in the lobby of Trump Tower on Friday. He has been newly named the chief strategist of the Trump White House. Drew Angerer/Getty Images \"I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\" said Trump said in the emailed statement. \"Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\" The dual selections are likely to send two separate signals to those closely watching Trump's transition into power. The choice of Priebus, who has served as party chairman since 2011, suggests conciliation toward the establishment Republicans with whom Trump has often shared a strained relationship. A veteran GOP operative, Priebus is well accustomed to the capital's corridors of power. As NPR's Eyder Peralta reports for our NewsCast unit, \"In Priebus, Trump finds a Washington insider\" \u2014 and one who stayed loyal to Trump during a frequently rocky campaign. \"I am very grateful to the President-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism,\" Priebus said in the statement. Article continues after sponsorship FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's First 100 Days Action Plan Meanwhile, the inclusion of Bannon, the former head of the far-right outlet Breitbart News, suggests another direction entirely. Rumored to be have been considered for chief of staff himself, Bannon \"would have been the insurgent choice\" for the top aide job, Eyder says. He is \"known for his no-holds-barred approach to politics and his popularity among the alt-right ,\" as NPR's Sarah McCammon reported last week . NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro has more on the man who helped steer Trump's campaign during its final months: \"Unquestionably, [Bannon] is a take-no-prisoners operative. A former Hollywood producer, a Goldman Sachs managing director, as well, he ran the Breitbart website, which has become synonymous with the alt-right. And he's certainly no fan of the establishment Republicans.\" The statement did not clarify the distribution of duties between the two men, but said they will work \"as equal partners to transform the federal government.\" ",

Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s CEO and former head of Breitbart news, will also be on the White House leadership team as the chief strategist. \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager and now a senior adviser to the presidential transition team, hinted at Priebus\u2019 appointment on Saturday. \u201cI think chairman Priebus has expressed an interest in the position,\u201d she told reporters Saturday at Trump Tower , adding that there were \u201cseveral people being considered.\u201d One of the other possible candidates, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported last week, included Bannon.\u00a0 Bannon thanked Trump in a statement for his role with the new White House, going on to comment on his future relationship with Priebus as chief of staff. \u00a0 \u201cWe had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201d Bannon, who holds anti-establishment views, has drawn repeated heat over the course of the election for his connections to Breitbart News, the conservative website that heralded the rise of alt-right ideologies this campaign cycle.\u00a0 But Trump picking  Priebus, whose tenure as party chair puts him squarely within Washington insider circles, as chief of staff also signals the president-elect\u2019s willingness to make nice with the Republican establishment. Priebus called it \u201can honor\u201d to join Trump at the White House.\u00a0 \u201cI am very grateful to the President-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHe will be a great President for all Americans.\u201d Trump has heaped praise on the RNC chair for his leadership within the Republican party throughout the contentious primary and general election fight.\u00a0 Back in July, Trump took to Twitter to call Priebus \u201cthe tough one and the smart one,\u201d especially compared to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.\u00a0 Even dating back to 2012, Trump complimented Priebus for \u201cdoing a fantastic job,\u201d saying he hoped \u201che gets the credit he deserves.\u201d\u00a0 . @reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2012 Despite several prominent Republican party members calling for the GOP to denounce Trump throughout the past year and a half, Priebus has remained fiercely loyal to the nominee throughout the businessman\u2019s presidential campaign. In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d earlier this year, Priebus even urged any holdouts among Trump\u2019s former primary challengers to fall in line behind him -- or face the consequences.\u00a0 \u201cThose people need to get on board,\u201d Priebus said in September. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going to run again someday, I think that we\u2019re going to evaluate the process \u2013 of the nomination process and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy for them.\u201d Priebus has weathered some rocky moments in his relationship with the president-elect. Before Trump became the party\u2019s nominee, he leveled continuous attacks against the RNC and the party\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d primary system.\u00a0 But even after getting battered by Trump\u2019s criticisms, the RNC chair remained resilient, telling \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in April that he didn\u2019t take the attacks to heart.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, because I kind of just rest in the truth,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt matters when something is right and something is wrong to me.\u201d CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi contributed to this report. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Trump also announced that campaign CEO Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, will be his chief strategist and senior counselor.\u00a0 Trump said that Priebus and Bannon will work as \u201cequal partners\" -- as they did in the campaign -- to make the federal government \u201cmuch more efficient, effective and productive.\u201d \u201cSteve and Reince\u00a0are highly qualified leaders who\u00a0worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow I will have them both\u00a0with me\u00a0in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d The appointments\u00a0suggest Trump appealing to traditional Republican circles and the party's anti-establishment wing, which helped fuel the businessman's political rise. Bannon thanked Trump for the job, saying he and Priebus will extend their partnership in Washington to \u201chelp President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201d Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Priebus said Trump will be a \u201cgreat president for all Americans\u201d and expressed his gratitude for the being able to serve the president elect and the rest of the country in helping \u201ccreate an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace ObamaCare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Priebus was one of Trump\u2019s most loyal lieutenants during the real estate mogul's up-and-down campaign that resulted in many Republicans, particularly GOP candidates seeking reelection, distancing themselves from Trump.\u00a0 In Trump\u2019s victory speech after his upset win over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, he notably praised Preibus\u2019 efforts and loyalty. Reaction to Trump\u2019s picks from both parties was quick. \u201cChoice of @Reince as COS over Bannon seems like a strong signal that @realDonaldTrump is taking a more conventional, conservative path,\u201d tweeted David Axelrod, a top campaign and White House adviser to President Obama. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was vanquished by Trump in the Republican presidential primaries and did not support his campaign, tweeted, \u201cCongrats to @realDonaldTrump for outstanding choice @Reince to be Chief of Staff. This shows me he is serious about governing.\u201d However, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff tweeted: \u201cSelection of Steve Bannon for senior WH role unsurprising but alarming. His alt-right, anti-Semitic, misogynistic views don't belong in WH.\u201d And John Weaver, a Republican strategist who worked for Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign, tweeted, \"The racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office. Be very vigilant, America.\" Priebus, an attorney, is a former RNC general counsel and chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party. He was elected RNC chairman in 2011 and has deep ties to GOP congressional leaders, particularly House Speaker and fellow Wisconsinite Paul Ryan. Under Bannon's tenure, the Breitbart News site pushed a nationalist, anti-establishment agenda and became one of the leading outlets of the so-called alt-right -- a movement often associated with white supremacy and a defense of \"Western values.\" Bannon, who became campaign CEO in August, pushed Trump to adopt more populist rhetoric and paint rival Hillary Clinton as part of a global conspiracy made up of the political, financial and media elite, bankers bent on oppressing the country's working people -- a message that carried Trump to the White House but to some, carried anti-Semitic undertones. An ex-wife of Bannon said he expressed fear of Jews when the two battled over sending their daughters to private school nearly a decade ago, according to court papers reviewed this summer by The Associated Press. In a sworn court declaration following their divorce, Mary Louise Piccard said her ex-husband had objected to sending their twin daughters to an elite Los Angeles academy because he \"didn't want the girls going to school with Jews.\" A spokeswoman for Bannon denied he made those statements. Neither Priebus nor Bannon bring significant policy experience to their new White House roles. Bannon was notably given top billing in the press release announcing the appointments, a curious arrangement giving that White House chief of staff is typically considered the most powerful West Wing job. Chiefs of staff in particular play a significant role in policy making, serving as a liaison to Cabinet agencies and deciding what information makes it to the president's desk. They're often one of the last people in the room with the president as major decisions are made. Fox News' Carl Cameron, Danny Jativa and Joseph Weber and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Trump's transition team confirmed the appointment Sunday afternoon, but sources said that the decision was finalized Saturday night The Republican, who is serving his third term with the RNC, was reported to be at the top of Trump's shortlist for the key White House position in the days following the election. That list also reportedly included Steve Bannon, Trump's controversial campaign CEO whose website, Breitbart News, has espoused anti-Semitic and nationalist views. Instead, Bannon will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president, Trump's transition team announced Sunday. Under Bannon, Breitbart.com has embraced racist conspiracy theories and become what Bannon termed \"a platform for the alt-right.\" Related: 'Drain the Swamp'? Trump's Potential Cabinet Fills Out With Washington Insiders The choice of Priebus is certain to comfort establishment Republicans wary that the unpredictable candidate Trump will make a reappearance in the White House \u2014 but one that could fuel resentment among the grassroots. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus speaks during the final day of the 2016 Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 21, 2016. MICHAEL REYNOLDS / EPA Priebus earned respect from Republicans over the course of his six-year tenure as head of the RNC, proving to be a powerful fundraising force who deftly navigated the party through the internal squabbling sparked by the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement following the 2010 election. Priebus, once Wisconsin's GOP Chairman, has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, also a Wisconsin Republican, and could serve as a liaison to Capitol Hill who's trusted by both sides. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch member of the #NeverTrump movement, tweeted his own congratulations to Trump for selecting Priebus, but made no mention of Bannon. Congrats to @realDonaldTrump for outstanding choice of @Reince to be Chief of Staff. This shows me he is serious about governing. (1/2) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 13, 2016 Bannon's new role could in fact cause tension in many corners of the GOP. In an internal Breitbart email leaked to The Hill in early October, Bannon said that \"the 'long game' for his news site was for Ryan to be 'gone' by the spring.\" Ryan congratulated Priebus on Twitter, but made no mention of Bannon. I'm very proud and excited for my friend @Reince . Congrats! \u2014 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) November 13, 2016 Earlier Sunday, Ryan told CNN that he has never met Bannon, and was not concerned about the Breitbart chairman's potential role in a Trump White House. \"I don't know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns. I trust Donald's judgment,\" Ryan said of the man whose website claimed in late October that Ryan was working to elect Democrat Hillary Clinton. While establishment Republicans applaud Trump's choice of Priebus, his appointment is likely to fuel concerns among grassroots conservatives who believe Priebus moved too aggressively to consolidate power among the GOP establishment during his tenure as RNC chairman. In fact, former Trump adviser Roger Stone tweeted this weekend the pick \"would cause a rebellion in Trump's base.\" The selection of @reince for COS in a @realDonaldTrump WH would cause a rebellion in Trump's base. #RyansBoy \u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) November 12, 2016 Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund co-founder Jenny Beth Martin also warned in a statement that naming Priebus, a \"Washington insider,\" as chief of staff \"would make it more difficult, not less, for President Trump to achieve the change the people voted for.\" A campaign source with knowledge of the decision said, \"Instead of draining the swamp, we just put in the head alligator.\" Related: Policy Divisions Between Trump and GOP Persist After Election Indeed, the pick of Priebus marks a remarkable turnaround in their once-fraught relationship that reflects Priebus' careful and persistent efforts to gain Trump's respect and confidence over the course of the general election campaign. During the primary fight, Trump railed against Priebus and the GOP for party rules concerning selection of the nominee that Trump insisted were unfair. \"It's a disgrace for the party. And Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself,\" Trump said of the rules in April. At the time, Priebus tweeted in response: \"Nomination process known for a year + beyond. It's the responsibility of the campaigns to understand it. Complaints now? Give us all a break.\" But since Trump won his party's nomination, Priebus became one of the candidate's closest advisers and was seen as one of the forces that helped reign Trump in and keep him on-message \u2014 one of the small group of advisers dubbed the \"Trump Whisperers.\" The pick opens up the RNC chairmanship, but Trump is expected to have significant influence over who is eventually chosen by RNC membership as chair. Senior Trump adviser Dave Bossie, who was recently elected Republican National Committeeman from Maryland, is seen as a potential pick, and is said to be privately jockeying for the chairmanship.

On Saturday at the annual Governors Awards, the Chinese actor and martial arts star finally received his little gold statuette, an honorary Oscar for his decades of work in film. \"After 56 years in the film industry, making more than 200 films, after so many bones, finally,\" Chan, 62, quipped at the star-studded gala dinner while holding his Oscar. Honoree Jackie Chan poses with his award onstage. Chris Pizzello / AP The actor recalled watching the ceremony with his parents and his father always asking him why he didn't have Hollywood's top accolade despite having made so many movies. He praised his hometown Hong Kong for making him \"proud to be Chinese,\" and thanked his fans, saying they were the reason \"I continue to make movies, jumping through windows, kicking and punching, breaking my bones.\" The actor was introduced by his \"Rush Hour\" co-star Chris Tucker, actress Michelle Yeoh and Tom Hanks, who referred to him as \"Jackie 'Chantastic' Chan.\" Hanks said it was especially gratifying to be able to acknowledge Chan's work because martial arts and action comedy films were two genres often overlooked during awards season. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, hosts of the annual ceremony, also bestowed honorary Oscars on British film editor Anne V. Coates, casting director Lynn Stalmaster and prolific documentarian Frederick Wiseman. ",

Lisa Moore of Glendale buys a health plan through Covered California for her son Joe, who sees multiple doctors to treat his clinical depression and schizophrenia. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Soumya Karlamangla Contact Reporter California led the way with Obamacare, signing up more people for health insurance\u00a0than any other state.\u00a0 Now with a possibility that President-elect Donald Trump will repeal the law , as he has promised, the stakes are higher here than anywhere else.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve basically cut the number of uninsured in a little bit more than half, which is enormous progress,\u201d said Dr. Gerald Kominski, head of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research . But California\u2019s huge gains also mean that if the Affordable Care Act is undone, \u201cwe have the most to lose.\u201d GOP leaders have said they\u2019ll quickly repeal and replace President Obama \u2019s signature healthcare law after Trump takes office in January. But experts say it\u2019s unlikely the entire law would be immediately overturned,\u00a0in part because that would leave more than 20 million Americans without health insurance. Instead, lawmakers will probably opt to dismantle the law piece by piece while a replacement is devised, experts say. But it\u2019s unclear which provisions will end up\u00a0on the chopping block and what alternative GOP proposals would be. \u201cUntil those conversations start, it\u2019s really hard to predict what will happen,\u201d said California state Sen. Ed Hernandez , who chairs that chamber\u2019s \u00a0 health committee . \u201cThere are so many, so many outstanding questions.\u201d That uncertainty has many Californians on edge. Lisa Moore of Glendale\u00a0worries that she won\u2019t be able to afford coverage for her son, Joe, if Obamacare is repealed. She pays $350 a month for his health plan through Covered California, the insurance exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act. Joe, 26, sees multiple doctors a week to treat his schizophrenia and severe depression. Moore said that without constant medical care he wouldn\u2019t be able to function, and without insurance she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford his care. His medical bills typically total $1,000 a week. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him,\u201d said Moore, 63. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible situation, I\u2019m terrified.\u201d Currently, 4.6\u00a0million Californians\u2019 health coverage is funded by Obamacare. They\u00a0either buy insurance plans through Covered California, or were able to join Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s low-income health program, when the health law provided money to\u00a0the state to expand the program in 2014.\u00a0 Those Californians could face \u201clife-or-death consequences\u201d if funding for Obamacare dries up, said Anthony Wright, head of the consumer advocacy group Health Access California .\u00a0 The state would lose $20 billion in federal funding if Congress votes to undo the exchanges and the Medicaid expansions, according to state data. Officials\u00a0in the heavily Democratic state say they will fight to keep the programs alive, but agree that the shortfall is far too great for the state to overcome on its own. \u201cCalifornia has a long and good tradition of going it alone, but there\u2019s a limit to what California can do without federal framework and funding,\u201d Wright said.\u00a0 The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, has been highly controversial, and Trump\u00a0repeatedly promised during his campaign to overturn it. Many have said that\u00a0the\u00a0health plans people are mandated to buy under the law aren\u2019t affordable and that the law is an unsustainable expense\u00a0for federal and state governments.\u00a0 California, however, wholeheartedly embraced the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe ACA has not been perfect, there have been challenges,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette , a senior research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms . But \u201cif there was one state where it was really working well ... it was California.\u201d\u00a0 The state enrolled millions in Medi-Cal, and 13.6 million people \u2014\u00a0one in every three state residents \u2014\u00a0is covered by the program.\u00a0Insurance premiums have not increased here as much as they have elsewhere, and the exchange still offers many options so consumers can\u00a0shop around. The percentage of uninsured working-age adults in California had dropped by more than half to 11% last year, according to federal data. Beyond signing up large numbers for coverage, state officials had also started improving the way medical care is delivered to patients,\u00a0Corlette said. When considering\u00a0what the Affordable Care Act could accomplish, she said, \u201cCalifornia was held up as the gold standard.\u201d\u00a0 Trump told the Wall Street Journal \u00a0on Friday that he might keep several provisions of Obamacare, such as barring insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. He also said he likes a provision in the law that allows young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 health plans until they are 26. But the rest is up in the air.\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Iraqi Troops Enter Town of Famed Ancient Ruins Near Mosul By susannah george and brian rohan, associated press MOSUL, Iraq \u0097 Nov 13, 2016, 1:08 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, file photo, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters gather near a frontline during fighting with Islamic State militants in Bashiqa, east of Mosul, Iraq. Human Rights Watch is accusing the security forces of Iraq's regional Kurdish government of destroying Arab homes and even some villages in areas retaken from the Islamic State group. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File) 0 Shares Email Iraqi troops entered a town south of Mosul on Sunday where Islamic State militants destroyed artefacts at a nearby ancient Assyrian archaeological site, while special forces fended off suicide bombers during a cautious advance into the northern city. The push into Nimrud was the most significant gain in several days for government forces, potentially opening up the area for teams to assess the damage done to the famed ruins just outside the town. Troops are converging from several fronts on Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the biggest urban area under IS control, as part of an offensive launched last month. The special forces have advanced the farthest so far, and hold a handful of districts on the city's eastern edge, but their progress has slowed in the face of fierce resistance in dense urban neighborhoods full of civilians. The operation's commander said troops took Nimrud, some 19 miles (30 kilometers) south of Mosul, after heavy fighting. It was unclear if they had liberated the nearby 13th-century B.C. archaeological site, which IS destroyed with explosives according to videos they released. \"The 9th division of the Iraqi army has liberated the town of Nimrud completely and raised the Iraqi flag over its buildings after the enemy suffered heavy casualties,\" Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Raheed Yar Allah said in a statement. The late 1980s discovery of treasures in Nimrud's royal tombs was one of the 20th century's most significant archaeological finds. The government said militants, who captured the site in June 2014, destroyed it the following year using heavy military vehicles. Video footage released by the jihadis at the time showed bearded men hammering, bulldozing and ultimately blowing up parts of the ancient Iraqi treasure, ripping down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. They claim the artefacts promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led forces operating the air campaign assisting the operation against IS, said few airstrikes were used near Nimrud, and the advancing Iraqi troops had moved in carefully. \"It's an important gain,\" he said, but warned that IS often leaves behind some combatants. \"As Iraqi forces get closer to Mosul, everything becomes more difficult as they like to leave behind a few fighters to spoil the advance.\" In Mosul itself, the special forces said they have cleared the Qadisiya and Zahra neighborhoods, and are planning to advance farther in the coming hours. Over the past week they have inched forward slowly, trying to avoid casualties among their troops and civilians as suicide bombers in armor-plated vehicles charge at them from hideouts in densely populated areas. \"The only weapons they have left are car bombs and explosives,\" said Iraqi special forces Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi as he radioed with commanders in the field. \"There are so many civilian cars and any one of them could be a bomb,\" he said. Troops were building berms and road blocks to prevent car bombs from breaching the front lines. Since last week's quick advance into Mosul proper, they have struggled to hold territory under heavy IS counterattacks. Several suicide car bombers attacked the advancing special forces on Saturday, wounding around a dozen troops, three civilians, and killing a child, officers said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to brief reporters. The Iraqi armed forces do not release official casualty figures, but field medics have noted dozens of killed and wounded since the operation to liberate the city began on Oct. 17. Civilians are paying a heavy toll in the battle for Mosul, with nearly 50,000 forced from their homes, most living in displaced persons camps. The Norwegian Refugee Council said Sunday that conditions were worsening for non-combatants, especially over the past week. \"Civilians have told us of horrific stories from inside Mosul,\" said Wolfgang Gressmann, the group's Iraq director. \"They have given terrifying accounts of IS moving them from neighborhood to neighborhood, and from house to house, in tactics identical with being used as human shields.\" Meanwhile, a leading U.S.-based rights group released a report alleging that security forces of Iraq's regional Kurdish government had routinely destroyed Arab homes and even some whole villages in areas retaken from the Islamic State group over the past two years. The Human Rights Watch report said that between September 2014 and May 2016, Kurdish forces advancing against IS destroyed Arab homes in disputed areas of Kirkuk and Ninevah provinces, while Kurdish homes were left intact. It says the demolitions took place in disputed areas in northern Iraq which the Kurds want to incorporate into their autonomous region over the objections of the central government. Sunni Arab politicians have previously accused the Kurds of seeking to recast the demographics of mixed areas in northern Iraq. The struggle is particularly intense in the oil-rich Kirkuk region. \"In village after village in Kirkuk and Ninevah, (Kurdish Regional Government) security forces destroyed Arab homes \u2014 but not those belonging to Kurds \u2014 for no legitimate military purpose,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"KRG leaders' political goals don't justify demolishing homes illegally.\" All sides fighting in the battle for Mosul have been accused of human rights abuses, with the worst allegations attributed to IS. Kurdish forces have been accused of destroying Arab homes before, with a report last year by Amnesty International alleging that the peshmerga carried out the attacks in retaliation for what they said was the Arab communities' support for IS. Kurdish authorities say they abide by human rights laws and deny having any strategy to destroy homes. But they say some villages in which the population fought alongside IS have suffered extensive destruction because of the ferocity of the battles. \"There was a large presence of IEDs placed in these areas,\" said Kurdish official Dindar Zebari, referring to Sunday's report. \"I have to say this was a huge cause of the destruction following the liberation process.\" Also Sunday, a wave of attacks in and around Baghdad killed at least 23 people and wounded 70 others, inflaming already combustive sectarian tensions in the country. Police and health officials said many of the attacks struck Shiites on their way to an annual pilgrimage, with the deadliest bombing taking place in Baghdad's northern Shaab neighborhood. There, an explosives-laden car parked near a checkpoint killed a policeman and two civilians, and wounded 12 others. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information. The capital has seen near-daily bombings since the Mosul operation began, but no large-scale attacks. Militants frequently target security forces and the Shiite majority as part of its campaign to destabilize the country. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Rohan reported from Baghdad. Associated Press writers Sinan Salaheddin in Baghdad, and Fay Abuelgasim in Irbil, Iraq, contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

The areas surrounding the president-elect\u2019s Midtown home has become like a fortress, with the Secret Service and NYPD going to extremes to protect the future president, CBS New York reported . Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s most reliable surrogates, said protesters around the nation are exaggerating the fear of a Trump presidency. The former New York City mayor said he wishes that Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee, and President Barack Obama would say something to the protesters. \u201cI just hope it calms down,\u201d Giuliani said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Giuliani said the protesters should respect the democratic process and calls them \u201ckind of like professional protesters.\u201d Mostly, the demonstrations were peaceful. However, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shot and wounded Saturday morning during a confrontation. Police arrested two teenagers. Police in Portland say they arrested a total of 71 people late Saturday and early Sunday during the anti-Donald Trump protests downtown. In a news release Sunday, the Portland Police Bureau said the protesters failed to obey numerous lawful orders to vacate city streets. Most were cited for disorderly conduct and failing to obey an officer. The bureau called in a public transit bus to transport the arrested to the central police precinct for processing. Police said protesters repeatedly threw road flares and bottles at officers and that a police sport-utility vehicle was tagged with graffiti. Several hundred protesters Sunday marched around Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall and then down Market Street to Independence Mall, carrying signs and chanting \u201cDonald Trump has got to go!\u201d and \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d In Los Angeles, a few hundred people gathered outside CNN\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters, and in San Francisco, hundreds of people, including many families with children, marched from Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach chanting \u201cLove trumps hate!\u201d On Saturday, an estimated 8,000 marched through downtown.\u00a0 Donald Trump's message to protesters On Sunday, about 800 people marched through the state capital of Sacramento and hundreds others formed a human chain around the nearly 3.5-mile perimeter of Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Rallies in Oakland have at times become unruly, but those who came to the lake held hands and chanted, \u201cWe reject the president-elect.\u201d\u00a0 Demonstrations also took place internationally. On Saturday, a group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \u201cunrest\u201d that\u2019s already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump\u2019s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Time People evacuated from the Quest Hotel stand outside in Wellington, New Zealand after an earthquake based around Cheviot in the South island shook the capital, early Nov. 14, 2016. According to reports, a 7.4. earthquake has hit New Zealand overnight, triggering a tsunami warning for the east coast of the country. (Photo: Ross Setford, European Pressphoto Agency) A powerful earthquake rocked New Zealand early Monday local time, killing at least two people, damaging buildings and triggering a tsunami that forced thousands to flee coastal areas. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-7.8 quake was centered less than 60 miles northeast of Christchurch, scene of a devastating 2011 quake. Buildings shook and damage was reported Monday in the capital of Wellington, 130 miles from the epicenter. Waves up to 6\u00a0feet high soon rolled\u00a0in near\u00a0Kaikoura, a popular tourism area about 50 miles from the quake's epicenter.\u00a0New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defense urged coastal residents to move inland. \"The first wave may not be the largest. Waves might\u00a0continue for several hours,\" the agency warned. It urged residents to stay out of the water and off beaches \u2014 and to resist the temptation to go \"sightseeing.\" Prime Minister John Key said the worst damage appeared to be in the Kaikoura area. Power and phones were knocked out, and damage to roads\u00a0slowed the emergency response, he said. Military helicopters were being used to aid in assessing damage. Explainer: What is an aftershock? Key said he was awakened by \"the most significant shock I've felt in Wellington.\"\u00a0His nation's tsunami warning was downgraded to a warning of coastal flooding hours after the quake, Key said. \"I hope everyone is safe after the earthquake tonight,\" Key tweeted immediately after the quake. Later he said that at least two people had died. One person died of a heart attack while another died on a Kaikoura homestead, the\u00a0New Zealand Herald\u00a0reported. New Zealand, an\u00a0island nation of less than 5 million people, is about 1,200 miles east of Australia and\u00a04,600 miles southwest of Hawaii. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said a Pacific-wide impact was not expected\u00a0and that Hawaii was not threatened. New Zealand sits in the \"Ring of Fire,\" an area in the Pacific Basin battered by frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\u00a0The quake was a terrifying reminder of the deadly\u00a0magnitude-6.3\u00a0temblor that struck six miles southeast of Christchurch in February 2011, killing almost 200 people and destroying infrastructure. I hope everyone is safe after the earthquake tonight. @NZcivildefence is looking into the impact of the quake. Follow them to stay updated. \u2014 John Key (@johnkeypm) November 13, 2016 Monday's quake struck shortly after midnight local time, which was Sunday morning in the United States. \"It was massive and really long,\" Tamsin Edensor, a mother of two in Christchurch, told Agence France-Presse.\u00a0\"We were asleep and woken to the house shaking, it kept going and going and felt like it was going to build up.\" Marie Black, deputy mayor of New Zealand's Hurunui District near Christchurch, told the Herald there were reports of damage throughout the region. \"It was a significant shake,\" she said. \"I have felt several aftershocks, and it is very unnerving.\" Several aftershocks shook the region, some registering more than magnitude 5.0. Jesus more tremors just as I decided to return to my hotel room on level 7 plus this pic.twitter.com/eCF5pqpS8M \u2014 Steve Braunias (@SteveBraunias) November 13, 2016 The geological survey said the quake emerged from the relatively shallow depth of less than 15 miles. Shallow quakes tend to be felt more broadly than those that are centered well below the earth's surface. Steve Braunias, a staff writer for the Herald, said he was asleep in his seventh-floor hotel room in Wellington when the quake hit. He took cover under a piece of furniture, saying he waited more than a minute for the swaying to subside.\" \"It began very slowly. ... The bed seemed to be twitching and it very quickly built,\" he said. \"It was terrifying. I thought I was going to die.\" A handout shakemap released on Nov. 13, 2016 by the US Geological Survey (USGS) shows the location (C, marked with star) of a 7.4 magnitude earthquake that struck New Zealand's South Island, 95km from Christchurch. \u00a0(Photo: USGS /HANDOUT, European Pressphoto Agency) ",

    "text": "By Amy B Wang November 13 at 11:23 AM Follow @amybwang Members of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team as well as Democratic officials on Nov. 13 responded to protesters marching in several cities against Trump's election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's former campaign manager, said it is incumbent upon Hillary Clinton, President Obama\u00a0and other Democratic leaders to calm their supporters and encourage a peaceful transition of power amid anti-Trump demonstrations that have swept U.S. cities since Election Day. Trump is \u201cthere for them. And he is going to be a president that listens and takes the counsel of many different people, including those from the other side of the aisle,\u201d Conway told Chuck Todd on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \" . . . It's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters, 'This man is our president.'\u201d Both Clinton and Obama made speeches urging exactly that last week. In her concession speech to Trump , Clinton said, \u201cWe owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\u201d In a similar vein,\u00a0 Obama met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and has said that his priority is to ensure a smooth transition so that Trump's presidency is successful. Conway on Sunday also accused Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) of \u201cacting like some garden-variety political pundit\u201d and \u201cegging people on\u201d to protest Trump's coming presidency. [ Demonstrators square off against opponents and police as Anti-Trump protests spread ] Speaking to host Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Conway also\u00a0suggested that professional, paid protesters were behind the anti-Trump demonstrations across the country. Nationwide protests continued for a second night, turning destructive in some cities as thousands marched against Donald Trump's election. Trump tweeted to condemn \"professional protesters, incited by the media.\" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Wallace had asked Conway what Trump would do to reach out to those scared of what his presidency would bring, then read a portion of a statement Reid issued Friday \u00a0charging Trump with assuaging the fears that he said the Republican's campaign had stoked. \u201cIf this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs: at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate,\u201d Reid's statement read in part. \u201cWinning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans. Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try.\u201d Conway cited Trump's victory speech as evidence that he was \u201coff to a great start\u201d in unifying the country, then turned her anger on Reid. \u201cTalk about not wanting my children to listen to somebody,\u201d Conway said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m calling for responsibility and maturity and decency. I hope President Obama calls Harry M. Reid today and says, 'Cut it out.'\u201d If Trump wants to roll back the tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately. \u2014 Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) November 11, 2016 Conway also told Wallace that the Trump administration still would be one \u201cfor\u00a0the forgotten man and the forgotten woman\u201d\u00a0\u2014 despite\u00a0his transition-team picks being filled with Washington insiders. Throughout his campaign, Trump played up his lack of political experience as a positive trait, saying he was an outsider who would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of D.C. politics. His transition team now includes\u00a0former federal bureaucrats, think-tank academics, corporate lawyers and special-interest lobbyists. \u201cThese are people who are talented and who have done this before,\u201d Conway told host Chris Wallace, defending Trump's transition-team choices. \u201cYou can\u2019t just appoint novices. You have to have people who know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Conway had previously said Trump's pick for White House chief of staff was \u201c imminent .\u201d It is widely expected that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon are on the shortlist for that position , and Trump's choice could signal the direction of his presidency. Conway told Wallace that both men would have \u201cvery important roles\u201d in the administration. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without Preibus or Bannon,\u201d she said, referring to winning the election. . @KellyannePolls on #FNS : We can't just appoint novices. This is an administration that is going to be run very differently. \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) November 13, 2016 On the issue of Obamacare, Conway said that she didn't know whether Trump would amend portions of the health-care law or repeal and replace it completely but that Trump would act quickly, perhaps even\u00a0convening a special session right after the January inauguration to address the law. \u201cAs you know, the House and Senate under Republican control have repealed Obamacare dozens of times, but they\u2019ve never had a Republican president go to the next step,\u201d Conway said. \" . . .\u00a0that excuse has been removed, and I think you're going to see some significant action.\u201d A full repeal of the Affordable Care Act had been central to Trump's campaign. Over the past week, however, Trump said he would be open to keeping portions of the law, such as ensuring that\u00a0people with preexisting conditions are covered and allowing children to stay on their parents' health plans through age 26. When Wallace asked whether Obama had changed Trump's mind about a full repeal, Conway brushed it off as Trump being polite. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it that far,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that President-elect Trump is being properly respectful to President Obama. This is obviously his signature domestic legislative achievement, to hear Obama say it.\u201d 1 of 93 ",

    "text": "Election day was a sweepstakes for schools across California Construction at Mission College Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times A view of the bond-funded Media Arts Building, under construction in 2012, at Mission College in Sylmar. A view of the bond-funded Media Arts Building, under construction in 2012, at Mission College in Sylmar. (Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times) Conventional political wisdom may have been upended in the race for the White House,\u00a0but when it came to funding for school construction, a little-known strategy worked like a charm: Presidential elections are a good time to pass school bonds. In fact, it was hard last week to find a school\u00a0or education funding plan that California voters on the state or\u00a0local level weren\u2019t willing to pay for. In liberal Los Angeles County, voters approved 28 of 29 school-funding measures.\u00a0Kern County, a conservative bastion that voted 56% for Republican President-elect Donald Trump, approved 11 of 12 school bonds. On the statewide ballot, voters passed Proposition 51, which will provide\u00a0$9 billion in school bonds to be used across California. Voters also approved Proposition 55, which called for extending\u00a0a tax on the state\u2019s wealthiest residents to provide\u00a0an estimated $4 billion per year for schools and, to a lesser extent, healthcare. \u201cVoters said they want to invest in their schools,\u201d said\u00a0Dennis Meyers, assistant\u00a0executive director of the California School Boards Assn. \u201cThey want new schools.\u00a0They want modernized schools.\u00a0They want technology. And most of those local bonds are tied to a\u00a0match from the state school bonds.\u201d The electorate is particularly inclined to spend in a presidential election, which draws less frequent and more liberal voters, officials and consultants said. \u201cWhenever you have a presidential election, that\u2019s when you\u2019re going to get the most voters out there,\u201d said Supt. Martin Galindo\u00a0of the El Rancho Unified School District, which serves the city of Pico Rivera in southeast L.A. County. In 2003 and 2010, local voters had\u00a0approved bond measures to fund the El Rancho district, costing them as much as $120 a year per $100,000 of assessed property value. Last week, Measure ER sought $200 million more in bonds, mostly for replacing the district\u2019s primary comprehensive high school. Nearly 68% of voters said yes. See how every neighborhood voted in the 2016 election Open link District enrollment, which is now about 9,000,\u00a0has declined between 150 to 250 students per year for the last 15 years.\u00a0 A new high school will offer an up-to-date\u00a0learning environment, making El Rancho more competitive with nearby districts, Galindo said.\u00a0 But a second measure \u2014\u00a0which would have taxed property owners for nine years at a rate of $99 per parcel,\u00a0bringing in about $1.4 million annually \u2014 failed.\u00a0That money could have been used for any purpose. Parcel taxes require a two-thirds majority, and the\u00a0measure fell just short, with 65% of the vote.\u00a0 \u201cWe came really close,\u201d Galindo said. In the nine-campus Los Angeles Community College District,\u00a0voters approved funding despite problems with past allocations. While money from a measure\u00a0passed in 2008\u00a0delivered new buildings and needed repairs, the funds also paid for a video biography of the man in charge of construction. And officials had to spend\u00a0$157,000 to fix\u00a0a poorly built\u00a0decorative clock tower. An additional $3.4 million was squandered renovating a theater that then was demolished because officials wanted a brand new one instead. The list of problems goes on. Still, three in four voters agreed in this election to provide another $3.3 billion. \u201cFrom fiber optics to\u00a0air conditioning, things that most people think are basic to a learning environment, we haven\u2019t always had that,\u201d said Joanne Waddell, president of\u00a0Local 1521 of the American Federation of Teachers, which\u00a0represents 5,000 district faculty members. \u201cWe\u2019ve been transforming our campuses, and this will take us to the next step,\u201d Waddell said. The total of bonds approved for schools across Los Angeles County exceeded $8.2 billion. L.A. Unified, however, chose not to join\u00a0the election day sweepstakes because, officials said, it has $6 billion in\u00a0voter-approved funds still available. The district also will derive some benefit from the new state money. But with an estimated $40 billion in construction needs, \u201cwe will need more in the future,\u201d said Tom Rubin, a consultant to the committee that oversees local bond spending. In rural Kern County, the new school funding will surpass\u00a0$1.35 billion.\u00a0But the $110 million that\u00a0 McFarland Unified had sought to build a new high school isn\u2019t included. The current campus was\u00a0built more than 80 years ago\u00a0to accommodate 600 students, but must house 900. And the school system is continuing\u00a0to grow. Local critics labeled the measure \u201cthe most expensive in California\u201d because the annual\u00a0tax rate would have been $240 per $100,000 of assessed property value for 30 years in the\u00a0low-income community.\u00a0 The high\u00a0debt burden required a two-thirds majority rather than the 55% of a typical bond. In the end, 53% voted yes. \u201cWe knew it was an uphill battle,\u201d Supt. Victor Hopper said. Now\u00a0he\u2019s developing a less expensive\u00a0back-up plan \u2014\u00a0to build\u00a0a new middle school and convert\u00a0the existing one into a high school.\u00a0\u00a0 The district should qualify for some of the new state bonds\u00a0to cover part of the cost of his Plan B. But Hopper still\u00a0would have to turn to voters for more money.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 13, 2016, 1:42 PM Southerners donning masks as suspected arsons lead to dozens of wildfires Smoke from wildfires buring in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia is seen on satellite images from NOAA on Nov. 8, 2106. NOAA Email ATLANTA - Wildfires near the Georgia-North Carolina line are spewing smoke so thick that residents are being urged to wear special masks if they must do outdoor activities. The fires - many of them suspected arsons - have prompted evacuations in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee in recent days. The largest of dozens of ongoing wildfires in the South has now burned 13,300 acres, more than a third of the vast Cohutta Wilderness area, in the north Georgia mountains just south of the Tennessee line. Fire managers said Saturday that the blaze, believed to have ignited from a lightning strike in mid-October, was only 20 percent contained. CBS Augusta affiliate WRDW-TV reports officials are beginning to worry about air quality and people\u2019s health in the area. While the best option may be to stay indoors to avoid what could become the largest wildfire in Georgia history, sometimes that\u2019s just not feasible. In Macon County, North Carolina, special health masks were being made available Saturday. Emergency Management Director Warren Cabe said they\u2019re distributing N95-rated masks as regular surgical masks don\u2019t provide adequate protection from smoke particles. And yet, the drifting smoke that prompted air quality authorities to declare a Code Orange on Friday in Charlotte, North Carolina, cleared enough for Saturday\u2019s Charlotte Marathon to be run as planned under crisp blue skies. CBS Raleigh affiliate WNCN reports evacuations were ordered in a sixth North Carolina mountain county on Saturday and masks are being handed out while at least 20 wildfires continue to burn. More than 1,000 firefighters are now battling the wildfires that have burned more than 23,000 acres in western North Carolina, officials said Saturday afternoon. Kristen Butterfield, who works at a local shop in Chimney Rock, North Carolina told the Asheville Citizen-Times that around noon Friday authorities began ordering people to evacuate. Then she saw a structure catch fire. \u201cWe had to get out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told us at noon and we were out by 2 p.m. at the latest. We took everything we could.\u201d Her friend Andre Whilden, who lives behind Chimney Rock village, said she and her husband hardly got any notice. \u201cWe got everything packed that we could,\u201d she said, which included seven animals. Whilden said on Wednesday she saw one firetruck after another speed past her house and she knew the fire was getting worse. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be evacuated,\u201d she said. \u201cI expected it to stay up on the mountain, but on Wednesday I knew something wasn\u2019t right so I went down to the visitor\u2019s center, looked to my left and the whole mountain was on fire.\u201d Smoke has settled over Clayton, Georgia and surrounding Rabun County, where fires including a 2,000-acre blaze has forced people from their homes. That fire is a suspected arson blaze, and the sheriff has asked residents to be on the lookout for a dark blue SUV seen in the area where the fire started on Wednesday. In Tennessee, 42 of the 58 active wildfires in the state are suspected arsons - or about 72 percent of them - the Tennessee Department of Agriculture reported Saturday in its wildfire situation update. In North Carolina\u2019s Nantahala National Forest, more than 20 wildfires have burned more than 17,000 acres and all of them are \u201cbeing investigated for suspected arson,\u201d federal forestry officials have said. The federal government has approved a request for money to fight the blazes in western North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory said. A grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will now pay 75 percent of the emergency protective measures taken in fighting the fires, McCrory said in a news release Saturday. In South Carolina, the Easley Fire Department is asking residents to donate water, Gatorade and other drinks to help firefighters battling a wildfire on Pinnacle Mountain. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Time Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. (Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images) BERLIN \u2014 As Western Europe gears up for a string of elections over the next year, right-wing\u00a0parties are\u00a0seizing\u00a0on Donald Trump's\u00a0victory as proof that a strong nationalistic\u00a0stance against\u00a0trade and\u00a0immigration will propel\u00a0them into power. A wave of populism already has spread to Eastern Europe, where countries that\u00a0include Croatia,\u00a0Hungary, Poland\u00a0and Slovenia have rightest governments. Farther west, Austria next month could elect Europe's first far-right head of state since World War II. Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party narrowly lost a race for the largely ceremonial post in April, but a new election was ordered because of alleged irregularities in counting mailed-in ballots. Dutch far-right Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders. \u00a0(Photo: AFP/Getty Images) France, Germany and the Netherlands, which hold general elections in 2017,\u00a0also have seen a U.S.-style\u00a0shift in support from mainstream parties to anti-establishment\u00a0nationalists. The trend comes amid growing anxiety\u00a0over weak job prospects\u00a0tied to\u00a0globalization, as well as a\u00a0migrant crisis seen\u00a0as\u00a0a threat to\u00a0security and a drain\u00a0on social welfare benefits. Many Europeans blame the problems on decades of membership in the\u00a0European Union, which they feel is oblivious to their concerns about the free flow of labor and migration within the 28-nation bloc. \"People are sick and tired of politicians who refused to listen to their worries about rising immigration, the loss of law and order, taxes being spent abroad while domestic needs are rising, trade agreements that harm employment at home,\" said Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker and leader of the Netherlands'\u00a0far-right Party for Freedom. \"We are witnessing a Patriotic Spring, in America as well as in Europe,\" he told USA TODAY. \"Our people have the same worries as the American people. The Trump victory proves that change is possible. There is no doubt this will encourage the Dutch people to vote for change as well.\" Wouter Dol\u00a0of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a group that helps young democracies organize elections, said Wilders paints himself as a political outsider like Trump despite being a seasoned politician with more than a decade of lawmaking experience. Netherlands Wilders\u00a0is expected to mount\u00a0a serious challenge to Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in March\u00a0elections. \"The traditional parties have not been sensing the temperature of society very well,\" said Dol. Trump's backers identify\u00a0with his vow to reject the political elite and take back control of American institutions and policy that he claims\u00a0have\u00a0been undermined by years of corrupt and inefficient government. \"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\" Trump declared in his victory speech\u00a0early Wednesday. Similar themes fueled the frustration that led to Brexit\u00a0in June, when British voters defied nearly all the\u00a0polls and expert predictions by\u00a0rejecting\u00a0more than 40 years of EU membership. Indeed, when Trump visited the United Kingdom\u00a0the day after the vote to open a new golf course in Scotland, he said: \"They took their country back, just like\u00a0we will take America back.\" In August, he joked of calling himself \"Mr. Brexit.\" In October, Trump\u00a0said he would\u00a0deliver \"Brexit times five.\" \"This is part of a worldwide phenomenon. It's in the U.S., Europe, but also\u00a0in\u00a0Russia, Turkey, China,\" said Michael Wohlgemuth,\u00a0director of the Berlin office of Open Europe, a research organization. \"There's pretty much a similar pattern everywhere you look, and a lot of it is about identity politics,\" he added. Europe's nationalists and far-right leaders were among\u00a0the first to congratulate President-elect Trump on his upset victory over heavily favored Hillary Clinton. \"What great news. Democracy is still alive,\" Hungarian Prime Minister\u00a0Viktor Orb\u00e1n wrote on his Facebook page. In Italy, the\u00a0head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement party, Beppe Grillo, said in a blog post that the result showed many people who opposed Trump were \"anchored to a world that no longer exists.\" Grillo is a former comedian-turned-populist who has piled pressure\u00a0on the center-left\u00a0government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi ahead of a December referendum on constitutional reform. \"Voters across the Western world want nation-state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives,\" said Nigel Farage, the interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of the architects of Brexit.\u00a0\"Prepare for further political shocks in the years to come.\" Parallels run strong with shocking Trump U.S. victory and Brexit France One of those shocks could come in France next\u00a0spring. Polls in French media show Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right\u00a0National Front,\u00a0will comfortably sail into the second round of a presidential election for the first time, although she might not\u00a0emerge the ultimate winner. \"Nothing is immutable,\" Le Pen said after\u00a0Trump's win. Her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, said on Twitter: \"Today, the United States, tomorrow France.\" Approval ratings for France's current president, socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, are abysmal in the wake of a string of terror attacks. Emilia Palonen, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki whose research\u00a0focuses on European nationalism, said that while the continent's\u00a0far-right groups have reacted with glee to a Trump administration, they won't necessarily\u00a0benefit from it. She said there's always the chance that backlash against Trump\u00a0could weaken U.S. and European ties, especially if he makes good on his promise to withdraw support for NATO if the military alliance's members don't meet their funding obligations. \"It's not all one-way,\" she added.\u00a0\"Trump has learned a lot about populism from his European colleagues.\" She mentioned\u00a0Orb\u00e1n's decision to build a razor-wire wall along Hungary's borders to deter migrants, a heavily criticized move that echoes the president-elect's desire to construct a \"great,\u00a0great wall\" along the southern U.S. border and make\u00a0Mexico pay for it. Germany In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel must call an election before October,\u00a0Wohlgemuth from Open Europe said that despite recent gains in state and local elections by the right-wing and anti-EU\u00a0Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\u00a0party (AfD), Germans are\u00a0unlikely to vote to \"pull up the draw-bridge\"\u00a0next year. \"Nationalism and Germany in a post-World War II world do not go together very well,\" he said.\u00a0\"You won't see AfD as part of any government.\u00a0We believe in principles and values and not emotional rhetoric.\" Ronald Gl\u00e4ser, a recently elected AfD lawmaker in Berlin, said his party shares\u00a0some \"convictions\" with Trump, such as\u00a0its belief that \"the global warming ideology is a dangerous religion.\" Gl\u00e4ser said he hoped Trump would make good on a proposal to reduce\u00a0U.S. forces from around the world and make America more isolationist. \"Germans don't want to be spied on by the National Security Agency, and\u00a0we don't appreciate American wars overseas.\" ",

    "text": "Travesty in Tampa confirms Bears one of NFL's worst; nobody should feel safe Photos of the Bears-Buccaneers game at Raymond James Stadium on Nov. 13, 2016. David Haugh Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Paid well to prevent losses as embarrassing as Sunday's, which painted the Bears as unprepared for the Buccaneers as they were overwhelmed, coach John Fox offered honesty that indicts everybody. \"I didn't see it coming,'' Fox said after a 36-10 defeat at Raymond James Stadium that was as incomprehensible as any he has endured with the Bears. The eyes can be the first thing to go for a football coach. But worse than Fox not seeing the Bears' abysmal effort coming, nothing that happened in the three-hour snoozefest suggested he knew how to stop it. Chicago constantly wants to debate quarterback Jay Cutler's future \u2014 at this point, it only will be surprising if he remains a Bear in 2017 \u2014 but things have deteriorated enough to start discussing Fox's too. And general manager Ryan Pace's. And team President Ted Phillips ', given that Phillips sits in a chair best occupied by a football executive. A team so maddeningly inconsistent 22 months into a regime requires a thorough evaluation, from the person who signs the checks to the guy who carries Fox's sideline cord. The Bears responded to their vacation week by taking another Sunday off, showing no evidence of coaching. Whether getting flagged for false starts or catching punts at the 5, the Bears too often lacked intelligence and intensity. That's on the 53 professionals on the roster but, in the NFL , getting them ready falls on the head coach and his staff. Vikings , Bears players and coaches commented on how emotional and passionate and great Jay Cutler was. Many of them offered thoughts on the leadership he provided as well as his excellent execution. I know Bears coaches and his teammates... After their surprising \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019\u2019 win over the Vikings , Bears players and coaches commented on how emotional and passionate and great Jay Cutler was. Many of them offered thoughts on the leadership he provided as well as his excellent execution. I know Bears coaches and his teammates... (Steve Rosenbloom) It matters not one iota how average the rest of the NFC North has become; the Bears remain one of the NFL's worst teams. Sunday's travesty in Tampa confirmed it. No longer do the Bears have the Cubs as cover to distract our city's sports attention. In their first game since baseball season ended, the Bears only inspired apathy that often precedes irrelevance. The easier the Bears become to ignore, the harder it will be for the McCaskeys to justify doing nothing. The Bears entered the game as healthy as they have been yet made their fans feel sick after an outbreak of ineptness. All over the Buccaneers home stadium, seats were filled with loud and loyal people in orange-and-blue T-shirts and jerseys who wasted their money to see the Bears lose a winnable game. In retrospect, maybe rewarding a two-win team with an entire week off won't go down as one of Fox's brightest ideas. And while we're second-guessing, once Brian Hoyer broke his arm against the Packers on Oct. 20, were there no available veteran alternatives better than Matt Barkley ? Cutler deserved to be pulled after his third turnover Sunday, but no legitimate option existed. \"Our whole team was off today,\" Fox said. \"I don't think you can put it on one guy.'' Brad Biggs, Dan Wiederer on Bears' 36-10 loss to Buccaneers Tribune writers Brad Biggs and Dan Wiederer react to the Bears' 36-10 loss to the Buccaneers.\u00a0 Tribune writers Brad Biggs and Dan Wiederer react to the Bears' 36-10 loss to the Buccaneers.\u00a0 See more videos If this Buccaneers defense included Warren Sapp, Derrick Brooks and John Lynch, Cutler looking so lousy would have been understandable. But for an 11th-year veteran facing a bottom-five defense, the mistakes were unacceptable. Five Bucs opponents have scored 27 or more points, but the Bears' lone touchdown came on a fluke of a 50-yard Hail Mary pass. \"I didn't play well,'' Cutler acknowledged. Truth is, seldom has Cutler suffered through a worse stretch. Days after making national headlines by declaring himself a Donald Trump supporter, Cutler's play was deplorable. You might say Cutler made Bears opponents feel great again with familiar poor judgment. Only Hillary Clinton suffered a more disappointing performance in Florida this month. The same experienced quarterback who displayed such urgency against the Vikings showed a rookie's awareness. On Cutler's first interception, he stared down Alshon Jeffery and threw the slant pass even after cornerback Brent Grimes assumed inside position. On the second one, he floated a play-action, throwback pass that former Bears safety Chris Conte returned 20 yards for a touchdown before giving Chicago the proverbial middle finger. Cutler's two strip-sack fumbles \u2014 one in the red zone and the other in the end zone \u2014 reminded everybody how confounding Cutler remains. How many times has he fumbled on similar plays?

Trump's promises to build a wall \"and make Mexico pay for it\" were rallying cries throughout his march to the White House, but in the new \"60 Minutes\" interview, the president-elect said he would accept building a fence instead of a wall \"in certain areas.\" Workers continue work raising a taller fence in the Mexico-US border area separating the towns of Anapra, Mexico and Sunland Park, New Mexico, Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016. Christian Torres / AP \"For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\" he said. \"I'm very good at this, it's called construction.\" Trump also suggested that incarceration could be an alternative to a mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"We are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,\" he said. \"After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people, but we are going make a determination.\" Related: Trump Says He'll Be 'Restrained' on Twitter, Then Slams NYT Shares in the two largest private prison stocks in the U.S. jumped sharply after Trump was elected. In an interview with CNN's \"State of The Union\" Sunday, House Speaker Paul Ryan stressed that border security will be the top priority of both the Republican Party and the Trump administration. Ryan said his party is not focused on deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. \"We believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill is really the first priority and that's what we're focused on,\" he said. \"We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.\". Chelsea Bailey ",

    "text": "By Nick Anderson November 13 at 11:00 AM Follow @wpnick Protesters express their frustration and anger marching on Elm Street in New Haven, Conn., on Nov. 10. Unhappy with the election of Donald Trump, several hundred joined the rally near Yale University. ( Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post) NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 Among America\u2019s demoralized Democrats, none were more stunned at Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory than those at the nation\u2019s left-leaning college campuses who had expected to rejoice at the rise of the first female president. Here at Yale University, a deep-blue bastion in a solid blue state, Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat led some mournful partisans to gather outdoors on election night for a primal scream. A funereal funk then settled over the Ivy League campus as many students expressed fear at what the coming Trump administration will mean for Muslims, Mexican immigrants and other groups subject to the Republican\u2019s slashing campaign rhetoric. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had really prepared myself for the abject, utter loss,\u201d said Theo Torres, 23, a law student from Denton, Tex. Timothy Pepler, 29, a divinity student from Windsor Locks, about an hour\u2019s drive north of campus, called it \u201ca level of despair I have never felt in my entire life.\u201d Torres and Pepler joined several hundred students and others in a march through New Haven on Thursday night to show solidarity with immigrants and others who might feel threatened under Trump policies. [ Yale professor: My students aren\u2019t snowflakes, and they don\u2019t melt ] Their gloom was echoed at other colleges across the country where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where even some conservatives have voiced reservations about the president-elect and the direction he is taking the GOP. Spontaneous election-night protests on some campuses morphed into days of rallies and gatherings that included flag-burning, anti-Trump chants and tense confrontations between epithet-hurling students on both sides. [ Mobs of tearful students protesting Trump victory swarm college campuses ] Republican students here who openly backed Trump were few in number and discreet in their revelry. Emily Reinwald, 21, of Stafford, Va., co-president of Yale College Republicans, said she and another Trump supporter shook a bottle of champagne and popped the cork early Wednesday outside their campus residence. But they were careful not to gloat in front of housemates, most of whom had voted for Clinton. Reinwald acknowledged slightly mixed feelings. Her heart this year was with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative Republican whom Trump defeated in the GOP primaries. \u201cI celebrated Hillary Clinton not winning,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe more than I celebrated Trump winning.\u201d Emily Reinwald, 21, of Stafford, Va., is a Yale University student and co-president of Yale College Republicans. (Nick Anderson/The Washington Post) The Yale College Republicans offer a telling view on the tensions Trump\u2019s candidacy generated among conservatives, especially in the climate of a largely liberal campus that has been through a year of discussion and debate about tolerance and inclusion. Although the group officially endorsed Trump this year \u2014 unlike its counterparts at Harvard \u2014 that decision divided its members. Some opposed to the Republican nominee fled to start what they call the Yale New Republicans. [ U-Va. College Republicans rescind support for Trump ] \u201cTrump hijacked our party,\u201d said Benjamin Rasmussen, 20, a junior from Novato, Calif., who pushed for the breakaway group. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think Trump is fit to lead.\u201d Rasmussen declined to say for whom he cast his ballot, but he said it was not for the Republican. Josh Altman, 21, a senior from Armonk, N.Y., described himself as fiscally conservative and socially liberal. He is president of the Buckley Program at Yale, an organization named for the late conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. that promotes intellectual diversity on campus through forums and other events. Altman said he doesn\u2019t know which party speaks for him, but he said he voted for Clinton. \u201cI\u2019d much rather be critiquing Hillary Clinton for four years than having to defend Donald Trump,\u201d he said. In this file photo from Nov. 9, 2015, Yale University students and supporters participate in a march across campus to demonstrate against what they see as racial insensitivity at the Ivy League school. (Ryan Flynn/AP) Yale, a 315-year-old school with 12,400 students and a world-class faculty, has deep connections to national politics. Despite its liberal leanings, Yale\u2019s history also reflects a strong current of conservatism that produced generations of New England Republicans. Presidents William Howard Taft, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush graduated from its college, and President Gerald Ford from its law school. Democratic President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, also are famous Yale law grads. The latest presidential campaign occurred during an exhausting year for Yale. In fall 2015, racial tensions rose on campus after students claimed that a fraternity barred black women from a party and a university instructor issued an email critique of warnings against Halloween costumes deemed culturally insensitive. In February, the university expelled a former captain of the men\u2019s basketball team, Jack Montague, after investigating an allegation against him of sexual misconduct. Montague denied wrongdoing and later sued the university, claiming a breach of contract. In April, Yale President Peter Salovey announced that the university would not change the name of Calhoun College , a residential unit named for a 19th century U.S. vice president, John C. Calhoun, who was a staunch advocate of slavery. That decision provoked another uproar. In August, Salovey formed a committee to examine \u201cprinciples on renaming\u201d and indicated that he could be open to reconsidering the Calhoun name decision. [ A year after protests at Yale, here\u2019s what has changed ] Now the presidential election outcome has left many students distraught. On election night, some emailed an economics professor, Steven Berry, to ask if he could postpone a midterm exam scheduled the next morning. He agreed to make the exam optional \u2014 with additional stakes put onto the final exam for anyone who wanted to skip the midterm. Most ended up taking the test Wednesday. University officials said academic work must go on. They said they would not issue exemptions, known as \u201cdean\u2019s excuses,\u201d granting students a temporary reprieve from testing requirements because of postelection trauma. \u201cDean\u2019s excuses are not designed to respond to reactions, howsoever deeply felt or unsettling, to an event such as a national election,\u201d the dean of academic affairs, Mark Schenker, told the Yale Daily News. Instead, Schenker said, students who need help could turn to the university\u2019s mental health and counseling services. Some found solace in other ways. On Wednesday, they grabbed colored chalk and scrawled messages on a plaza in front of Sterling Memorial Library. One read: \u201c#stillwithher and her and her and her and all the capable, powerful women OUT HERE.\u201d Others papered bulletin boards anew with fliers declaring \u201cLove Will Trump Hate,\u201d and other slogans, as if in hope that the campaign could resume. \u201cA lot of my friends have been crying,\u201d said Rita Wang, 19, a sophomore from Edison, N.J. But she has not shed any tears even though she went to the Democratic National Convention and spent hours phone-banking for Clinton. Describing her politics as \u201csuper left,\u201d Wang said sometimes losing goes with the territory. Protesters near City Hall on Church Street in New Haven, Conn. on Nov. 10. ( Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post) Rita Wang, 19, a Yale University sophomore from Edison, N.J. who describes her politics as \u201csuper left.\u201d (Nick Anderson/The Washington Post) She is thinking ahead to how she will respond when Trump takes office in January. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to build student power with my classmates to oppose his legislative decisions,\u201d she said. If Trump and the Republican Congress repeal President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, the Affordable Care Act, Wang said, \u201cthen I\u2019m probably going to cry.\u201d Maxwell Ulin, 21, a senior from Santa Monica, Calif., who is president of the Yale College Democrats, said Trump critics are talking about how to mobilize. \u201cPeople are committed to doing something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t just mourning, grieving, being sad.\u201d Some Clinton supporters here said the election exposed a blind spot at Yale. As an elite institution, they said, it is not sufficiently attuned to the concerns of the massive bloc of white, working-class voters in small towns and rural areas who powered Trump\u2019s election. \u201cA lot of people here are out of touch with what\u2019s going on in communities that don\u2019t look like their communities,\u201d said Isis Davis-Marks, 19, a sophomore from New York City. \u201cThis election made me realize how much of a liberal bubble Yale students live in,\u201d said Zachary Cohen, 20, a junior from New York City who edits a political journal here. That isolation left the campus largely unaware of anger and resentment elsewhere, he said. \u201cI definitely had to come terms with the fact that there was this other half of America I had hardly seen.\u201d Harkness Tower on the campus of Yale University.

    "text": "Trump Names Reince Priebus as Chief of Staff, Steve Bannon as Senior Adviser By JOHN SANTUCCI Nov 13, 2016, 4:59 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump's Chief of Staff Pick Could be Crucial 0 Shares Email Donald Trump has named Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff to his new administration and former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. This weekend Priebus and Bannon emerged as the top contenders for the chief of staff position, with the two seen as offering two sharply different paths for Trump to take in his first major hire as president-elect. Priebus has fostered close relationships over time with lawmakers from all factions of the party, while remaining steadfastly loyal to Trump once it became clear he had secured the party's nomination. Bannon on the other hand is a firebrand of the far right, whose website has in the past targeted many GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan , deriding them as \"establishment\" figures. A press release announcing the appointments said both will work \"as equal partners to transform the federal government\" and to assist Vice President-elect Mike Pence in his new role as transition chairman. \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d Presidents-elect typically name a chief of staff as one of their first and most crucial appointments because the person in this role can help determine a president's style of governing. But if precedent is any indication, the naming of Bannon as both Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor will provide him just as much access to the Oval Office.

(Photo: Danny Damiani, USA TODAY Network) The Green Bay Packers and Tennessee Titans' offenses provided plenty of fireworks on Sunday, but the biggest outburst might have come in a third-quarter brawl. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers scampered 20 yards into the end zone on a\u00a0touchdown run, but he was hit by Titans cornerback Perrish Cox after crossing the goal line. That drew the ire of Packers wide receiver Davante Adams, who shoved Cox. At that point, several Packers and Titans players joined in the shoving match in the end zone. \uf3c3\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8\uf4a8 Cox was flagged for the late hit, and the penalty was assessed on the ensuing kickoff. Trailing 35-22, the Packers attempted an onside kick, but the attempt went out of bounds. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 10 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
