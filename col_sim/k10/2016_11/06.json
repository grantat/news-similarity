    "text": "Melania Trump Had Modeling Jobs in US Before Work Visa By alicia a. caldwell, chad day and jake pearson, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Nov 5, 2016, 6:37 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Attacks Clinton Over Emails, Melania Trump Addresses Bully Culture 0 Shares Email Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States that occurred before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. The details of Mrs. Trump's early paid modeling work in the U.S. emerged in the final days of a bitter presidential campaign in which her husband, Donald Trump , has taken a hard line on immigration laws and those who violate them. Trump has proposed broader use of the government's E-verify system allowing employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work. He has noted that federal law prohibits illegally paying immigrants. Mrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. During the presidential campaign, she has cited her story to defend her husband's hard line on immigration. The wife of the GOP presidential nominee, who sometimes worked as a model under just her first name, has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. The documents obtained by the AP show she was compensated for the modeling jobs that she worked between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15 of that year, altogether worth $20,056. During this time, her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work, but not perform paid work. The documents consist of detailed accounting ledgers, her contract and related papers. It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes. The disclosures about the payments come as Mrs. Trump takes on a more substantial role advocating for her husband's candidacy. She made her first speech in months Thursday, in which she spoke of her time working as a model in Europe and her decision to come to the U.S. \"As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here,\" she said. \"Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.\" The documents obtained by the AP included a management agreement signed by Mrs. Trump from Metropolitan International Management that covered parts of 1996 and 1997. The AP obtained the files this week after seeking copies since August from employees of the now-defunct modeling firm, after Mrs. Trump made comments earlier this summer that appeared inconsistent with U.S. immigration rules. A New York immigration lawyer whom Mrs. Trump asked to review her immigration documents, Michael J. Wildes, also reviewed some of the ledgers at AP's request. Wildes said in a brief statement that \"these documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps.\" He did not elaborate or answer additional questions asking for clarification. Wildes appeared to be referring to Mrs. Trump's arrival in the United States on Aug. 27, 1996, one day after the ledgers list a charge for car service to pick up Mrs. Trump from the airport. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also did not answer additional written questions from the AP. Since questions arose earlier this year, Mrs. Trump has declined to publicly release her immigration records. Wildes, the immigration lawyer, released a letter in September that laid out the details of what he said Mrs. Trump's immigration records show, including a seven-week window in which Mrs. Trump was in the U.S. before her work visa was issued. During that seven-week period, the ledgers list modeling work for clients that included Fitness magazine and Bergdorf Goodman department store. The management agreement, which said it was not an employment agreement, included a handwritten date of Aug. 27, 1996. The top of the document said it was \"made and entered into as of this 4th day of September 1996.\" Many of the documents were part of a legal dispute related to the dissolution of the firm in the late 1990s and found recently in storage. The accounting ledgers for the firm's models were listed on hundreds of pages of continuously fed paper that appeared yellowed with age. They were authenticated by a former employee who worked at the firm at the time. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because this person feared retaliation and threats from Trump's presidential campaign. Exhibit markings with the records were also consistent with documents filed in New York state court, including a deposition of one former partner that referred to the same exhibit number. The sworn testimony describing the exhibit's content matches the documents obtained by the AP. A former partner, Paolo Zampolli, who previously told the AP that he recruited Mrs. Trump to come to the U.S. as a model, confirmed that the contract language was used by his firm and his signature appeared on the document. Mrs. Trump's signature on the contract resembled her signature on her marriage license recorded in 2005. Asked about the two dates on the document, Zampolli said he usually vacationed in Europe each August and likely arranged for the contract to be formally executed when he returned to New York after Labor Day , even though Mrs. Trump had signed it eight days earlier. Zampolli previously told the AP that Mrs. Trump obtained a work visa before she modeled professionally in the United States. He said the ledgers for Mrs. Trump were consistent with printouts used by his firm at the time, but he would not personally vouch for them because he said money matters were handled by the company's chief financial officer, who has since died. Zampolli said he did not recall Mrs. Trump working without legal permission. \"Honestly, I don't know. It's like 20 years ago,\" he said. \"The contract looks (like) a real one and the standard one.\" Foreigners are not allowed to use a visitor visa to work for pay in the U.S. for American companies. Doing so would violate the terms of that visa and could prohibit a foreigner from later changing his or her immigration status in the U.S. or bar the foreigner from the United States again without special permission to come back. The E-verify system started in 1997\u2014 after Mrs. Trump came to the country\u2014 and was dramatically expanded after 2007. Some ledgers obtained by the AP identify Mrs. Trump by her professional name and detail her involvement with the modeling agency from July 18, 1996, through Sept. 26, 1997. Other documents from the same accounting ledgers identify Mrs. Trump as Melanija Knaus and list $20,526 in gross earnings for the period before she was granted her work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. The documents also show the modeling company paid for her rent, lent her money and paid for her pager. Some ledgers were first made available to True.Ink, an online lifestyle publication, then independently obtained and verified by the AP. Metropolitan International Management managed the careers of about 65 women in 1996 and 1997, according to court records. It paid the women as independent contractors, collecting a 20 percent commission and deducting expenses. The ledger shows that the firm also deducted federal taxes from the models' gross earnings, including Mrs. Trump's. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Pearson reported from New York. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH All the Other Elections Happening Nov. 8 0 Shares Email The Democratic Party's fault lines have been overshadowed by the near civil war within the GOP. But Democrats will face their own divisions after Election Day, and the battle over the party's heart, soul and future may well play out on the floor of the Senate, under direction of a new Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer . It's a challenge the canny, 65-year-old New Yorker has been eyeing for years. When Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced his retirement, Schumer managed to leapfrog Reid's No. 2, Dick Durbin of Illinois, and sew up the necessary support from fellow Democrats to claim the job. Tuesday's election will determine whether Schumer leads a Democratic majority in the Senate, or a minority if Republicans manage to defend their 54-46 seat advantage. If the GOP does keep Senate control, it will be despite Schumer's constant maneuvering and more than $8 million in campaign money he raised or donated to Democrats. And whether it's Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump who is elected president, Schumer will have a fellow New Yorker in the White House . With Clinton, they could resume the partnership they forged while serving together as senators. Regardless of those outcomes it may be the dynamics within Schumer's own Democratic caucus that occupy him the most. The party's resurgent liberal wing, exemplified by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, will be ready for a fight. But a group of Democratic senators representing red states, including Indiana, West Virginia, Montana and North Dakota, will be up for re-election in 2018, potentially exerting pressure from the opposite direction. All that could leave Schumer in the position of key deal-maker in what's likely to be a new era of divided government in Washington. \"I tell our caucus we need a strong progressive wing and we need a strong moderate wing to succeed,\" Schumer said in an interview. \"We have a moral imperative to work together and get things done,\" he said. \"I have told my caucus I don't want to simply put bills on the floor that our side votes for and their side votes against, or their side votes for and our side votes against, and we accomplish nothing.\" Such sentiments are likely to be welcomed by lawmakers in both parties frustrated with gridlock, which has been exacerbated by frosty relations between Reid and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. In their most recent legislative session, lawmakers spent weeks tied in knots over a straightforward spending bill to keep the lights on in government past Election Day. That's nothing compared to what awaits next year, when the Senate will have to contend with monumental tasks including confirming a Supreme Court nominee and raising the government's borrowing limit. Schumer can count supporters in both parties who say his practical tendencies will serve him well navigating those issues and working with McConnell. \"They're both pragmatists. They're both partisan, but they respect the Senate as an institution,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. Talkative and publicity-prone, forever working his flip phone, Schumer is almost as well-known for his ability to attract media attention as he is for his stewardship of home-state interests. As head of a committee involved with inaugural planning, Schumer used a solo limo ride with President Barack Obama on his second inauguration to bend the president's ear about projects that needed doing in New York State, according to someone who heard the anecdote. He is known for setting up his aides on dates and marriages, and singing the joys of parenthood. Yet Schumer is also seen as overly self-serving at times, with some accusing him of putting his own political interests first. There's been grousing from Democrats this year that Schumer spent millions on his own re-election campaign in New York, including to film an ad with a cow, even though he faces mostly token opposition and the money could have gone to support Senate Democratic candidate Rep. Patrick Murphy in Florida. \"The lesson to politicians is if the Democratic Party tells you they got your back, they don't,\" said John Morgan, a Democratic donor in Florida who blames Schumer for Murphy's likely loss to incumbent GOP Sen. Marco Rubio. Democrats have defended their decision-making on Florida, pointing to the expense of running ads in the state compared to potential opportunities elsewhere. Schumer was a lead player in negotiating the bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House. During that process he talked occasionally to Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who was working behind the scenes on the issue. The prospect of action on immigration is exceedingly unlikely if Republicans remain in control of the House. But Schumer struck an optimistic note about working with Ryan, now the House speaker. \"He's far more conservative than I am, but he wants to get things done, as I do,\" Schumer said. If Democrats take the Senate majority, Schumer may face an early test on the Supreme Court. He won't say if he favors unilateral action, pushed by liberals, to eliminate the ability of Republicans to use endless delaying tactics to block a nominee. \"I'm not going to talk about that 'til after the election,\" Schumer said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Growing Up In Protected Americana, Hillary Clinton Looked Outside The Cocoon It was clear that was the general election challenge Clinton and her team were anticipating when she gave the big speech at her official campaign kickoff event on Roosevelt Island in New York. \"Now there may some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song,\" Clinton told a crowd estimated at 5,000. \"A song called, 'Yesterday.' You know the one. All our troubles look as though they're here to stay. And we need a place to hide away. They believe in yesterday. And you're lucky I didn't try singing that, I'll tell you.\" According to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, behind the scenes, senior advisers were especially concerned about Rubio, the Florida senator. \"I'm beginning to worry more about Rubio than the others,\" Joel Benenson, the campaign's pollster and chief strategist wrote in February 2015. \"He has stronger right wing cred than Jeb and he's finding a way to the middle enough for now and he will be the most exciting choice to Republicans. Could pose a real threat with Latinos etc.\" But in the end, Trump outlasted the entire Republican field, leaving Clinton to face an opponent with well-known shortcomings and an opposition research file bigger than Trump Tower. Hillary Clinton won the opponent lottery. Not just in the primary, when Warren and Biden stayed out, but in the general election as well. There were certainly risks in facing Trump: his ability to dominate news coverage, the difficulty in pinning him down on policy. Trump's taxes, business dealings, treatment of women and tendency to say and tweet things that hurt him with voters were a constant throughout the general election campaign. But many Republicans and even some Democrats believe, with a more disciplined opponent, Clinton would easily have been facing defeat on Election Day. A Team Of (Former) Rivals For the first time in at least 100 years, a sitting U.S. president has campaigned vigorously for his chosen successor. In the closing weeks of the campaign, President Barack Obama has been a regular fixture on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton, pitching her to voters more effectively than she could pitch herself.

Steve Pope/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Steve Pope/Getty Images Hillary and Bill Clinton attend the 37th Harkin Steak Fry on Sept. 14, 2014, in Indianola, Iowa. Steve Pope/Getty Images With an approval rating solidly above 50 percent and his natural ease on the stump, Obama essentially doubled Clinton's firepower in swing states. But he wasn't the only one. First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders campaigned hard for Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine. Clinton won Sanders over by agreeing to modify her debt-free public college proposal to more closely track with Sanders' free college plan. He started slowly, but by the end of the race Sanders was traversing the country trying to convince his young supporters to go to the polls and not vote for a third-party candidate or Trump. The ally Clinton always had making the case on her behalf was her husband, former President Bill Clinton. By contrast, Trump's surrogate operation was thin. There were no former presidents or even former Republican presidential nominees, save Bob Dole, who appeared at the Republican National Convention. Mitt Romney actively opposed Trump and relatives said both former presidents Bush would likely vote for Clinton. Clinton's 'Damn Emails' (And Wall Street Speeches) From before Hillary Clinton even entered the race for president, her campaign faced headwinds of her own making. There was the private email server she used for official business while secretary of state and there were the lucrative speaking engagements during the time after she left the State Department and before her campaign officially began. Enlarge this image Hillary Clinton speaks to the media after keynoting a Women's Empowerment Event at the United Nations March 10, 2015 in New York City, just days after it was revealed she used a private email server while secretary of state. Yana Paskova/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Yana Paskova/Getty Images Hillary Clinton speaks to the media after keynoting a Women's Empowerment Event at the United Nations March 10, 2015 in New York City, just days after it was revealed she used a private email server while secretary of state. Yana Paskova/Getty Images When the news of Clinton's server broke, top officials in the campaign were seemingly blindsided. In hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, campaign chairman-in-waiting John Podesta emailed campaign manager-in-waiting Robby Mook asking if he knew the extent of the email issue in advance. \"Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of,\" Mook wrote at the time. Clinton's campaign has refused to verify the authenticity of emails released by WikiLeaks and has also avoided commenting on any of the content. Clinton's campaign says the release of emails hacked from Podesta's personal Gmail account is part of a Russian effort to interfere with the U.S. election. In one chain, Podesta and Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton ally, complain about the email story coming out so late in the game. \"Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,\" she asked. In a later email, Tanden answered her own question: \"They wanted to get away with it.\" Bernie Sanders gave Clinton a gift when he took the email server off the table as an issue in the Democratic primary during the first debate. \"Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,\" said Sanders. Clinton jumped in, \"Thank you, thank you,\" she said. \"Me, too!\" Right after that came the 11-hour hearing of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Clinton maintained a calm, somber demeanor throughout and left with House Republicans revealing no new bombshells.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22, 2015. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images That October was one of the best months of her campaign. But Clinton's email troubles were far from over. Just as she was launching into the general election, only hours before Clinton was to campaign with President Obama for the first time, FBI Director James Comey held a press conference. On the face of it, his announcement was good news. The FBI had been investigating whether Clinton's use of a private email server violated the law, whether she and her aides had improperly handled classified material. He said no reasonable prosecutor would pursue the case and he was recommending against charging Clinton or her aides with a crime. \"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" Comey said. His statement raised more questions than it answered and brought the email saga back into focus for voters. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, delegates began chanting \"lock her up!\" That chant became a regular feature of Trump rallies. ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist November 5 at 3:59 PM Follow @sulliview In the tabloid business, the practice is called \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d That phrase was circulating on Saturday after the Wall Street Journal\u2019s solidly reported story that the National Enquirer \u2014 no stranger to checkbook journalism \u2014 had laid out $150,000 in August to a former Playboy magazine Playmate, who says she had a lengthy adulterous affair with Donald Trump a decade ago. The paper paid for exclusive rights to Karen McDougal\u2019s story but never published it, the Journal reported. Thus: catch and kill, otherwise known as trapping a story to keep it out of the public eye, for one reason or another . The tabloid, run by Trump pal David Pecker, is one of a tiny handful of papers to endorse Trump for president. (The Enquirer\u2019s parent company claims that it paid McDougal not only for rights to an unspecified personal story, but also to write a fitness column.) Trump, through a spokeswoman, has denied the affair. And of course, such a story would not have revealed anything new about Trump\u2019s character, nor would it have been disqualifying to his candidacy. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron and Post reporter David Fahrenthold tell Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan how the revelation of Donald Trump\u2019s 2005 lewd comments about women came about. (The Washington Post) The Enquirer, which Trump has repeatedly said deserves to win a Pulitzer Prize for its revealing of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards\u2019s \u201clove child,\u201d also published an evidence-free story on Saturday that Hillary Clinton is addicted to narcotics. Combine this with the debunked reporting by Fox News of a likely Clinton indictment after the election, and then add in the much-tweeted photo of CNN\u2019s paid pundit Corey Lewandowski shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump\u2019s campaign brass, labeled \u201cteamwork,\u201d and the conclusion is obvious: We\u2019re ending this campaign deep in the journalistic gutter. The worst of the media is on full display, as if someone had set out to show just how terrible we hacks could look in these last moments before Election Day. To be sure, some great journalism has been published over the course of the campaign. But it largely has been drowned out by the unsavory. \u201cYes, there has been terrific reporting by The Washington Post and others, but it\u2019s been like one of those beautiful houses that survives in a blighted neighborhood,\u201d Micheline Maynard, a business journalist and educator, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe big picture is that the neighborhood is blighted,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get people to move back in.\u201d She\u2019s right. The media, never well loved, is less trusted than ever. It\u2019s under attack \u2014 often for valid reasons, but not always. And the good actors, an ever-smaller core, get drowned out by the bad. Consider: Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier had to apologize last week after reporting that an indictment could be expected to result from an FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation. [Fox News apologizes for falsely reporting that Clinton faces indictment] But the indictment stories, based on next to nothing, had already been blasted out into the political ecosystem \u2014 exaggerated beyond recognition and taken as duly reported fact. Over at CNN, head honcho Jeff Zucker has been in high dudgeon about Donna Brazile\u2019s ethical blunder, which caused her to be summarily (and properly) dismissed as a network pundit, after she leaked a debate question to the Clinton campaign. But he has expressed no qualms about Lewandowski\u2019s continued presence on the network, even as Twitter featured the compromising photo from Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway: Lewandowski, herself and spokeswoman Hope Hicks, showing them all working together toward the same end. Lewandowski\u2019s hiring at CNN after leaving the Trump campaign is one of the worst embarrassments in a campaign season in which the competition for such a dubious prize is fierce indeed. Not only had Lewandowski carried out Trump\u2019s blacklisting of news organizations, including The Post, but he also had signed a nondisclosure agreement, which meant his on-air commentary was by definition tainted. Meanwhile, fake news is everywhere. The Drudge Report, in one of the most bizarre examples, has been promoting a story about Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta drinking bodily fluids at a secret Satanist dinner. Though absurdly false, the tale had plenty of believers, inspiring hundreds of thousands of related tweets and plenty of \u201cnews stories\u201d on right-wing sites. You could chalk a lot of this up to the \u201csilly season\u201d that always precedes a big election. And you could hope the hysteria and disinformation dies along with the weirdest campaign in memory. But even as the worst of media grows exponentially, the best is deeply threatened. The Wall Street Journal \u2014 whose journalistic standards are historically top-notch \u2014 is laying off reporters this month to reduce costs. And as print advertising revenue slips into something perilously close to free fall, much more of that is sure to come. In this case, the Journal let us know what the Enquirer had done. That takes time, money, skill and reporting talent. When those wither, journalism will be in worse trouble. Yes, that\u2019s possible.

By Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz November 6 at 1:39 AM Follow @ktumulty Follow @danbalz In this Nov. 4, 2016, photo, voters wait in line to cast ballots at an early polling site in San Antonio. Your parents were right: Math really does matter. After all of the tumult and tedium of a long, ugly presidential campaign, Election Day is all about which candidate can win enough states to get to 270 electoral votes.(AP Photo/Eric Gay) (Eric Gay/AP) With hours until Election Day, the wildest U.S. presidential race in memory has grown more competitive in most of the battleground states, although Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton continues to hold a broader path to victory than Republican Donald Trump. The political map suggests that Clinton can lose several key states long assumed to be in her column and still reach the 270 electoral votes she needs to win. Trump, meanwhile, has a new reason for optimism, as a growing number of states appear potentially within his grasp . But to win, he would have to take nearly all of them. The 11th-hour fluidity of the race had the two campaigns scrambling the travel plans of the candidates and their top surrogates. In Trump\u2019s case, it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line; in Clinton\u2019s, as insurance against surprises Tuesday in territory she has considered hers. Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win View Graphic Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win Trump said Saturday that he and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will hold campaign events in Minnesota , a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972. A Trump campaign official insisted that the move was not a feint and that internal polling showed the Republican only three points behind Clinton there. In a sign that Democrats are suddenly anxious about Michigan , on Monday, Clinton will be in Grand Rapids and President Obama will campaign in Ann Arbor. Trump and Pence will also be in Michigan in the next two days. At a rally Saturday in Tampa, which is a bellwether of crucial Florida , Trump said his campaign is moving aggressively to seize upon openings it sees across the country. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined what he sees as his path to victory, predicting wins in big swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida, during a campaign rally on Nov. 5 in Reno, Nev. (The Washington Post) \u201cWe\u2019re going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds where we are now tied or leading,\u201d the billionaire real estate developer said. He predicted that he will win Florida and Pennsylvania \u2014 which both voted for Obama in the past two elections \u2014 and said that he is \u201cdoing phenomenally well in North Carolina ,\u201d where both candidates have invested significant time and resources over the past few weeks. Later Saturday evening, Trump was rushed off the stage by security officials at a rally in Reno, Nev., as some kind of disturbance was taking place in the front of the room where he was speaking. People in the crowd scattered as U.S. Secret Service and uniformed officers jumped the barricades to apprehend an unidentified man and lead him out of the room. Local reports said the man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident. Trump later concluded his rally without further incident. The Secret Service said in a statement that no weapon was found. Crites said he was holding \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d sign when he was tackled by people around him. Clinton held a rally in south Florida that was cut short by rain. She was set to hold an event Saturday night in Philadelphia that would feature a performance by pop star Katy Perry, whose song \u201cRoar\u201d is featured in Clinton\u2019s closing ad running in 11 battleground states. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay\u00a0Z headlined a concert for Clinton on Friday night in Cleveland. View Graphic Also on the line Tuesday is control of the Senate , where Republicans are defending 24 seats, compared with 10 for the Democrats. Trump\u2019s performance at the top of the ticket could determine whether Democrats pick up the five seats they need to regain the majority \u2014 or four, if Clinton wins and her vice president, Tim Kaine, has a tiebreaking vote. \u201cThe tightening of the race in many of these battleground states is providing a little bit of lift to our Senate races, and in some of these cases, it is going to be decisive,\u201d said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u201cI think we\u2019re really on the razor\u2019s edge,\u201d Law said of his party\u2019s prospects of holding the Senate. \u201cTrump\u2019s final position in all of this is uncertain. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s close enough to the pin yet to lift most of these races into the win column.\u201d On Thursday, the Cook Political Report predicted that Democrats will pick up four to six Senate seats, enough to gain control if Clinton is elected, but less than its earlier forecast of a five- to seven-seat gain. Republicans also are bracing to lose seats in the House, which would diminish the largest majority they have held there since 1928. Neither side, however, expects a wave large enough to restore control to Democrats, who lost it in the 2010 midterm elections. Clinton began the final weekend of campaigning with a narrow lead over Trump in the ongoing Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. Through Friday night, the rolling survey showed Clinton at 48\u00a0percent and Trump at 43\u00a0percent, among likely voters. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson was at 4 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein was at 2 percent. That\u2019s the largest margin between the two major-party candidates this past week \u2014 and a sign that Clinton may be starting to recover from a fresh round of attention to her use of a private email account and server while she was secretary of state. Clinton\u2019s decision to ignore a directive that official business be conducted where possible on a government email account has dogged her since it became public last year. It reinforced the public\u2019s long-standing doubts about her honesty and judgment, and sparked an FBI investigation of whether national security might have been compromised. A new chapter in that saga opened on Oct. 28, when FBI Director James B. Comey informed Congress that new emails , possibly pertaining to the investigation of Clinton\u2019s private account, had surfaced during a separate inquiry involving disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Before that development, Clinton appeared in control of enough states to put her well over the 270 electoral-vote mark. The tightening of the polls since then has left enough states in doubt this weekend to force a modification of those earlier predictions. A quartet of battlegrounds has dominated the Clinton campaign\u2019s calculation throughout the fall campaign: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012. Until recently, it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clinton\u2019s and the Democrats\u2019 electoral-map advantage. But as the race has tightened, Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column, and other states outside those four have potentially come into play. The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin to make up a potential deficit, should he not win Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. One force that is factoring into both sides\u2019 assessments is that more Americans are voting before Election Day, either by mail or in person. Upward of 37 million voters have already cast ballots. In key states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina, it is likely that over half the electorate will have done so before Tuesday. Those votes have not been counted, but strategists from both parties are poring over the data about who has voted and to get a preview of the contours of the 2016 electorate. The figures also give them a sense of possible trouble spots. In past years, more Democrats have participated in early voting. This year, however, it appears as though Republicans are closing the early-voting gap in many key states . But it is not clear whether this reflects greater enthusiasm and better organization on their part, or just a shift in the behavior of people who would have shown up anyway on Tuesday. Polling and early-voting data suggest a number of electoral cross currents as the race heads into its final two days. Clinton has struggled to reassemble some version of the coalition that twice elected Obama, the combination of African Americans, Hispanics, single women and young voters. Hispanic turnout appears strong, based on early-voting data. That is a major reason Democrats think Nevada will be an easy win for Clinton , although the polls are close and Trump scheduled a stop there Saturday. Clinton also has a double-digit advantage among female voters, who in 2012 accounted for 53\u00a0percent of the electorate. But the Clinton campaign is worried about turnout among African Americans. The Democratic nominee and her top surrogates have made repeated visits to major cities in an effort to stoke enthusiasm among those voters, and she will end her campaign with a big rally in Philadelphia. \u201cBased on early vote returns, we know that strong get-out-the-vote efforts in the African American communities in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and North Carolina will be needed to win on Tuesday,\u201d AFL-CIO political director Michael Podhorzer said. For Trump, one challenge is a socioeconomic split in the white vote. He has strong support among white voters without college degrees, but has seen an erosion in the traditional support for Republican nominees among white voters with college degrees. This has been a central dynamic of the campaign, and Clinton campaign officials view it as a potentially decisive factor in an electoral map that has shifted since the last election. In less than a week, the United States will have a new president-elect. These are the pivotal points in Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns that led to this moment. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The split between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters has moved states such as Colorado and Virginia toward the Democrats, while giving Trump more hope of capturing industrial states in the Midwest such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where there is a higher concentration of non-college-educated voters. Democrats remain skeptical that Trump, who boasts of his ability to bring new Republican voters to the polls, can crack what in recent cycles has been a \u201cblue wall\u201d in the upper Midwest. \u201cTrump is making a last bet on white, non-college-educated men in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d Podhorzer said. \u201cThat\u2019s been tried by Republican candidates before, and it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d Entering the final days of campaigning, Clinton maintains her advantage over Trump in voters\u2019 perceptions of their qualifications and readiness to serve as president. By 55 percent to 36 percent, likely voters say she is more qualified, and by 58 percent to 32 percent they say she has a better temperament and personality to serve as president. Clinton also is considered the candidate who better understands \u201cthe problems of people like you\u201d and has \u201cthe stronger moral character.\u201d In both cases, her advantage over Trump is in the single digits. However, on the question of who is more honest and trustworthy, voters are more evenly divided, with 44\u00a0percent citing Trump and 40\u00a0percent naming Clinton. Perceptions of Clinton\u2019s honesty have deteriorated in the final 10 days of the campaign, particularly when there was intense focus on renewed attention to her email problems.

The Republican presidential candidate was making a campaign speech at a Reno convention center when there was some kind of scuffle in the crowd in front of the podium and two Secret Service agents came and quickly brought Trump offstage. A man in a blue sweater was tackled before being escorted out by law enforcement before being held in a bathroom inside the venue. Evan Vucci/AP Photo A man, at center with blue sweater, is escorted by law enforcement officers moments after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was rushed offstage by Secret Service agents during a campaign rally in Reno, Nev., on Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. When Trump returned to the stage, he thanked the Secret Service. \"Nobody said it was going to be easy for us. But we will never be stopped. Never ever be stopped. I want to thank the secret service. These guys are fantastic. They don\u2019t get enough credit,\" Trump said. The Secret Service released a statement saying that the commotion started when someone in the rally shouted \"Gun,\" but said that no gun was found. \"Immediately in front of the stage, an unidentified individual shouted 'gun.' Secret Service agents and Reno Police Officers immediately apprehended the subject. Upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found,\" the statement said. The Secret Service and the Reno Police Department were investigating the incident, the statement said. When contacted by ABC News, Reno Police Department said that they had little detail, only that they had initially been informed that there was a \"medical incident\" that precipitated the commotion. In a statement, Trump said, \"\"I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response. I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us - we will make America great again!\" Trump now heads to Denver, Colorado, where he was scheduled to host his fourth rally of the day.

Here are four final takeaways to help you cast your vote California ballot Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press Heather Tilson deposits her ballot at the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters office on Oct. 24. Heather Tilson deposits her ballot at the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters office on Oct. 24. (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press) Here are some final mumblings before this distressing election is mercifully concluded. Yes, practically everything to be said already has been repeatedly. But not quite everything. 1. Gov. Jerry Brown has been out there in TV ads, robo-calls and campaign appearances fibbing about a ballot measure that has him panicked. It\u2019s Proposition 53, which would require statewide voter approval of any government project financed with more than $2 billion in state revenue bonds. They\u2019re bonds repaid by a project\u2019s users, such as water bill payers in the case of Brown\u2019s proposed monster twin tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. That\u2019s a $15.5-billion project. Brown is worried that Proposition 53 would collapse the water tunnels and also his sorely underfunded, $64-billion Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train project. It\u2019s tens of millions of dollars short and a potential revenue bond is the only savior in sight. So what\u2019s the fib? Brown has been telling voters \u201c53 takes away local control\u201d and also \u201cincreases the cost of roads, bridges and hospitals.\u201d The \u201clocal control\u201d pitch is just bunkum. There never has been much, if any, local control over such a massive project. Local projects just aren\u2019t that expensive. Anyway, Proposition 53 is about state \u2014 not local \u2014 bonds. The measure defines the affected projects as those \u201cfinanced, owned, operated or managed by the state.\u201d \u201c\u2018State\u2019 means the State of California,\u201d the measure spells out plainly, although the state could partner with a local entity. State,\u00a0the proposal\u2019s text continues, \u201cdoes not include a city, county \u2026 school district, community college district or special district.\u201d The University of California also isn\u2019t affected. In the Brown-financed opposition TV ads, there\u2019s a guy dressed in a firefighter\u2019s uniform. What\u2019s that about? Nobody\u2019s going to need a statewide vote to douse a brush or house fire. When there\u2019s a major natural disaster, repairs are mostly paid for by the federal government. Highway construction? It\u2019s usually funded through general obligation bonds \u2014 which long have required voter approval \u2014 and are repaid with gasoline taxes. Updates from Sacramento \u00bb When Brown warns about 53 jacking up the tab for roads, bridges and hospitals,\u00a0it\u2019s hyperbole. The state doesn\u2019t even build hospitals, except for prisons. One more thing: Brown must be listening to Donald Trump too much. Last week he told a high-powered San Francisco breakfast crowd that his corgi dog had told him to \u201cpee on 53.\u201d Cute. At least the governor is getting off Latin. 2. Just as I was about to vote against Proposition 61, which would lower the state\u2019s cost for prescription drugs, I noticed that pharmaceutical companies were spending an astronomical $109 million fighting it. If the drug companies are spending this much money, that indicates they\u2019re very worried about their future profits. And that means Proposition 61 could ultimately help us consumers. The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is being heavily outgunned. The \u201cyes\u201d campaign has spent about $17 million. Proposition 61 would forbid state agencies from paying more for a drug than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which traditionally gets the best deals. The state buys pharmaceuticals for current and retired state employees, for prisons and for poor people. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is a big booster of 61. Opponents, including many veterans, contend the drug companies would merely make up for their state revenue loss by boosting prices for everyone else. They\u2019d undoubtedly try. But that argument is reminiscent of businesses always claiming that any tax increases on them would just be passed on to consumers. The truth is it\u2019s not that easy. That\u2019s why there are hordes of lobbyists in Sacramento and Washington fighting business tax hikes. Proposition 61 might just be a tool to start forcing down prescription drug prices for everyone. And that\u2019s why the pharmaceutical companies are spending obscenely to scuttle it. 3. It seems counterintuitive and cockeyed that Californians are on the verge of discouraging cigarette smoking by dramatically raising the tobacco tax while encouraging pot smoking by legalizing it. Proposition 56 would raise the cigarette tax by $2 per pack in an effort to make smoking unaffordable for the poorest. Smoking does cause cancer. Proposition 64 would legalize marijuana just for getting high and set off a stampede of weed marketers. Studies have shown that too much pot is bad for brain cells, especially among young people. Don\u2019t bother reminding me that you\u2019d have to be 21 to legally buy cannabis. More and more kids are going to toke up. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper made sense last week when he advised other states to \u201cgo slowly and probably wait a couple of years\u201d to see how legalization goes in his state. Find out, he urged, whether there\u2019s a dramatic rise in teen toking and stoned driving. 4. It was eye-opening to read a Field poll last week on the presidential race in California. Hillary Clinton led by a whopping 20 points. But Donald Trump was favored by 16 points among born-again Christians. What? Trump\u2019s demeanor is far from the Christian-like behavior I was taught in Sunday school. Actually, Trump has been reminding me of fictional gubernatorial candidate Willie Stark \u2014 a Louisiana Huey Long knockoff \u2014 in the novel and movie \u201cAll the King\u2019s Men.\u201d Demagogue Stark pledges to do this to his political enemies once elected: \u201cNail \u2019em up.\u201d Trump vows to arrest Clinton, drawing chants from supporters of\u00a0\u201cLock her up.\u201d But Stark was right about this: \u201cIf ya don\u2019t vote, ya don\u2019t matter.\u201d` Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty.

The market, an early voting site, stayed open until 10 p.m. Friday night, with many of the mostly Latino voters there waiting in line two hours to vote. By the time the grocery store closed, over 57,000 people had cast ballots in Clark County, a record-breaking turnout for single-day early voting in the county, according to ABC affiliate KTNV . Polling hours extended to accommodate massive turnout at Cardenas Market on Nevada's last day of early voting: https://t.co/Uxu0rJSolp pic.twitter.com/zxXKouOs4z \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 The big turnout of early voters in Nevada from communities with large Latino populations could bode well for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , whose Republican rival Donald Trump may have alienated many voters of Hispanic origin with his comments about immigrants and plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. More than 30 percent of Clark County residents are Hispanic, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau . \"Looks like Trump got his wall after all. A wall of beautiful voters,\" Yvanna Cancela, political director of the Culinary Union in Las Vegas, wrote on Twitter . . @ClarkCountyNV early voting update for Friday: 57,097 as of 10 p.m. https://t.co/bltkpBNaah pic.twitter.com/IJAPbbNRww \u2014 Tim Hogan (@timjhogan) November 5, 2016 Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign event in downtown Reno on Saturday night, but KTNV political analyst Jon Ralston said the Republican \u201calmost certainly lost Nevada on Friday.\u201d According to Ralston, Clinton has essentially locked up the state thanks to Hispanic voters . \u201cTrump has almost no path to the presidency without Nevada. He can say whatever he wants in Reno on Saturday and boost rural turnout a lot, but he made his own bed when he announced his candidacy,\u201d Ralston wrote in an article on Saturday, referring to remarks Trump made about Mexican immigrants being rapists and criminals when announcing his presidential bid in June last year. They just extended voting hours at a Mexican supermarket to 10 PM. Close to 1,000 voters in line. If you have a panic button GOP, find it. \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) November 5, 2016 El voto latino esta presente en Nevada #NVPresente #NVtogether pic.twitter.com/hnz6bKgTqk \u2014 Jorge Neri (@Jneri312) November 5, 2016 Ralston, citing an \u201con-the-ground activist,\u201d reported that a total of 1,904 people showed up to vote early at Cardenas Market. Sixty-six percent were Democrats, 9 percent Republican and 25 percent had no party affiliation. \"So Cardenas was responsible for adding 1,000 to the Democratic lead,\" Ralston wrote. Cardenas Market did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. John Locher/AP Photo Casino workers vote at an early voting site in Las Vegas, Oct. 26, 2016. Clinton's Nevada state director Jorge Neri , tweeted that 29,597 Democrats voted early in Clark County on Friday, compared to 15,434 Republicans, In Nevada's first week of early voting ending Oct. 28, 151,020 Democrats voted, compared to 121,651 Republicans and 66,728 people with no party affiliation, according to data from the Nevada Secretary of State's Office , which was updated on Tuesday. Clark County alone had 112,708 Democrats vote early in the first week, compared to 73,927 Republicans and 47,004 people who had no party affiliation.

    "text": "Updated Nov. 6, 2016Sun., Nov.  6 at 1:01 AM ET Mr. Trump also stopped on Saturday in North Carolina, and took advantage of the time-zone differences by flying west for evening rallies in Colorado and Nevada. In Reno, Nev., he was rushed offstage by Secret Service agents after someone shouted that a member of the crowd had a gun, a reminder of the charged atmosphere at many of his events. No weapon was found, and Mr. Trump returned to finish his speech after a few minutes. By holding events in those four increasingly diverse states, he was signaling a refusal to concede any ground to Mrs. Clinton and rejecting the strategy of past presidential candidates who have fought within the confines of a narrower electoral map in the campaign\u2019s final hours. He even announced Saturday morning that he planned to add a stop in Minnesota, long a Democratic bulwark and a state he had not been even contesting. But the evidence from polling and the early voting turnout seemed to indicate he was facing the possibility of sweeping losses in states with sizable Hispanic populations, most likely affected by the racially tinged language he has used since beginning his campaign over 16 months ago, when he claimed the ranks of Mexican migrants were filled with rapists and drug dealers. Photo A crowd listened to Hillary Clinton at a rally in Tempe, Ariz., on Wednesday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times \u201cThe story of this election may be the mobilization of the Hispanic vote,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an anti-Trump Republican who has pleaded with his party to do more to win over Latinos. \u201cSo Trump deserves the award for Hispanic turnout. He did more to get them out than any Democrat has ever done.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The question for Republicans, just 12 years after President George W. Bush carried at least a third of the Hispanic vote, is how long the Trump-inflicted damage with Latinos will haunt them. Raising the specter of how difficult it has been for California Republicans since former Gov. Pete Wilson\u2019s hard line toward illegal immigrants there, Mr. Graham said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t come to grips with the demographic challenges we have with Hispanics in presidential politics, we\u2019ll never right the ship.\u201d In Florida, at least 200,000 more Hispanics had voted early as of Friday than did during the entire early voting period four years ago, according to an analysis by Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who helped run President Obama\u2019s two campaigns here. The turnout has been particularly explosive in South Florida and Central Florida, where thousands from Puerto Rico and other regions of Latin America have migrated in recent years. And 24 percent of the Hispanics casting early ballots were first-time voters, the analysis showed. Graphic: Voting Early, and in Droves: Over 22 Million Ballots Are Already In \u201cIt\u2019s the demographics that are bailing her out,\u201d Mr. Schale said. In Orlando, voters waited up to 90 minutes on Saturday at one early voting location at a library, some spending the time taking pictures of one another in front of candidates\u2019 signs. Parking lots for a quarter-mile surrounding the area were packed. Mrs. Clinton clearly carried the day there. Jon-Carlos Perez, 30, an independent voter and a concrete laborer originally from Puerto Rico, said he cast his vote for Mrs. Clinton in part because \u201cshe\u2019s not an idiot like Trump.\u201d Alyssa Perez, 23, a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida who voted at another busy location in Orlando, said she considered Mr. Trump to be \u201canti-women, anti-Hispanic, anti-Muslim\u201d and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where there is a president who has those kinds of views.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Canvassing on Saturday morning in North Miami, Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, and a handful of local members focused on households, many of them Haitian or Hispanic, with an infrequent voting history. But nearly every resident who answered their door assured her they had already voted. \u201cThe word is out,\u201d said Ms. Henry, as roosters scooted between yards. But it was not just Florida where Hispanics were poised to send a powerful message. In Nevada, which has the fastest-growing Latino population in the West, Democrats appeared to have built a fearsome advantage in Las Vegas\u2019s Clark County at the end of early voting Friday, largely because of a surge of votes from Mexican-Americans. The early voting period was extended until 10 p.m. at one Hispanic grocery store in Las Vegas, where the images of hundreds of voters waiting in line ricocheted across the internet. (On Saturday, Mr. Trump claimed, without any evidence, that the hours had been extended so Democrats could be bused in.) ",

By Griff Witte November 5 at 3:39 PM Follow @griffwitte LONDON \u2014 In the seaside cafes of Beirut, the whole thing looks \u201clike a bad joke.\u201d To persecuted journalists in Burundi, it amounts to \u201ca total loss of dignity.\u201d The government-scripted press of Beijing diagnoses \u201can empire moving downhill.\u201d And the spin doctors of the Kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight. The U.S. presidential election \u2014 America\u2019s quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on Earth \u2014 has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope. Debates devoid of issues and deep in the gutter of personal insult. Interference from foreign intelligence services. Endless leaked emails, and FBI investigations that could extend long beyond Tuesday. Americans may cringe watching their own election at close range. But the world\u2019s reaction has been, in a sense, even more poignant and foreboding. People in small and distant countries who count on the United States to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see the essential components \u2014 a free press, the rule of law, respect for the outcome of elections \u2014 trammeled. What do everyday people around the world think of the U.S. presidential election and the Democratic and Republican front-runners? We wanted to know, so seven reporters from Washington Post foreign bureaus asked a random selection of people on the street what they thought of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) Long-standing allies have been left to wonder whether the essential American character has changed, and whether the United States can be relied on when it counts. Adversaries have looked on with glee, surprised at how easily the country that casts itself as the greatest can be knocked off kilter. And even though the campaign still has days to go \u2014 with the outcome very much in doubt \u2014 the damage to American moral standing may already be done. \u201cI heard the election is being controlled by Russia. Is it true?\u201d asked Anas al-Abed, 27, a Beirut cafe worker who said he has been following the campaign closely ever since he read that the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, had bragged about assaulting women. \u201cAmerica always spoke to Arab countries as if they had so much to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we see their own democracy involves choosing between a woman from a dynasty and a man who says the system is manipulated. If that\u2019s democracy, then we don\u2019t want it.\u201d [ Will Trump be \u2018Brexit times five\u2019? He may need to be if he wants to win. ] This is not the first time that America\u2019s international reputation has been dealt a grievous blow. In recent years, the Iraq War brought global perceptions of the United States tumbling, only to be revived by the election of President Obama \u2014 who remains broadly popular overseas. But political analysts worldwide said that never before have they seen a presidential campaign do so much to directly undermine America\u2019s core credibility. \u201cIt\u2019s very shocking and disturbing to see this happening on such a scale in the richest country on Earth,\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a political-science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. It is not, of course, happening in a vacuum. Democracies from Southeast Asia to Western Europe are under pressure from within as populism and xenophobia surge. Autocrats from Moscow to the Middle East, meanwhile, are feeling emboldened. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just about this election,\u201d said Jacob Parakilas, deputy head of the U.S. and Americas program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cIt fits into a broader framework of rising nationalism and the destruction of existing political norms.\u201d But with the breakdown of those norms happening so vividly in America \u2014 a nation that proselytizes the virtues of democracy more aggressively than any other \u2014 the global swing toward less free and open societies could accelerate no matter who wins Tuesday. \u201cThis campaign makes the implicit argument that the U.S. model of liberal democracy isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be,\u201d Parakilas said. [ Across Europe, revulsion at Trump but little idea of what to do about him ] America\u2019s top diplomat has acknowledged as much. Speaking to students in London on Monday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry called the campaign \u201cdownright embarrassing\u201d and said that it has already damaged American influence. Thanks to the election, he said, he is greeted with skeptical looks \u2014 or worse \u2014 when he sits down \u201cwith some foreign minister in another country or with the president or prime minister of another country and you say, \u2018Hey, we really want you to move more authoritatively towards democracy.\u2019 \u201d In the state-controlled media of America\u2019s nondemocratic rivals and adversaries, the campaign has only exposed what they long knew the country to be \u2014 a declining and morally bankrupt power. \u201cWe are seeing the failure of U.S. democracy,\u201d wrote Zhang Zhixin, an expert on American politics at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. The message is not only that America is floundering but also that China, prosperous and stable, is growing strong in its place. With Philippine President \u00adRodrigo Duterte\u00a0 promising to \u201cseparate\u201d from the United States and realign with China\u2019s \u201cideological flow,\u201d Communist Party-approved writers seem to see an opening for more shifts in China\u2019s favor. A recent piece in Xinhua, the state-controlled news wire, cited work by Li Wen, an academic at the Chinese Academy for Social Sciences, who argued that instability in the United States shows the \u201ctwisted mentality of an empire moving downhill.\u201d In Russia, the campaign has not exactly reshaped perceptions of the United States. But it has reshaped Russians\u2019 perception of what their country is capable of doing to the United States. Russian observers barely hide their joy at the notion that Americans think that\u00a0 Moscow has the power to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election. \u201cWhen we hear that we are sitting here in Moscow and interfering in America\u2019s life, that makes us all happy,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who served at the Kremlin between 1996 and 2011. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to do anything; we can just sit here and organize elections in the United States.\u201d Like most Russians, Pavlovsky is unwilling to acknowledge the U.S. administration\u2019s accusation that Kremlin-sponsored hackers have been meddling in the campaign. But in a country where people feel the United States has overplayed its hand as the world\u2019s sole superpower, American officials\u2019 consternation over Russia\u2019s suspected role is seen as payback \u2014 and a possible political advantage. \u201cThe feeling is that the chaos, the turbulence that all this is causing in the American electoral process is good for Russia,\u201d said Alexei Venediktov, editor in chief of Ekho Moskvy radio. \u201cWhoever wins will have to deal with domestic upheaval and internal problems, rather than paying attention to Russia, and that is a good thing.\u201d [ After Clinton, Trump\u2019s real enemy is \u2018globalism\u2019 ] To U.S. allies, however, it is potentially disastrous. Trump has struck fear into the hearts of European leaders with suggestions that he may not come to the aid of fellow NATO members if they are attacked. Several have\u00a0 broken with protocol \u2014 which calls for strict neutrality \u2014 and denounced the Republican nominee, while praising his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. But Europe is confronting its own backlash against international cooperation. Across the continent, anti-immigration politicians who want to pull their nations out of the European Union have exulted in Trump\u2019s success. \u201cUntil about a year ago, when I would meet American counterparts, they\u2019d ask, \u2018What is happening in Europe?\u2019 \u201d said \u00adMarietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament. She listed far-right leaders and parties that no longer seem so alien in America. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shared challenge arising: challenges to the open economy and open democracies,\u201d she said. Among some American allies, the U.S. campaign has even been a strange source of comfort because their own politics no longer look so bad. Israel, known for its bare-knuckles brand of political jousting and for corruption cases that have snared presidents and prime ministers, has been unusually fixated on this year\u2019s race. \u201cOur politicians are perhaps not as crooked or corrupt as yours,\u201d said Jonathan Rynhold, a political scientist at Israel\u2019s Bar-Ilan University. \u201cOurs are fairly mild by comparison.\u201d In India, too, the effect of such an ugly contest has been surprisingly validating. \u201cFor many middle-class Indians, the U.S. is a model for democracy. But watching the election campaign there now makes Indians feel slightly superior,\u201d said Shiv Visvanathan, a government professor at O.P. Jindal Global University. It has also been deeply disquieting. \u201cHow can such a trigger-happy nation be part of the great nuclear club, and take global decisions?\u201d he asked. [ What is the long-term effect of Donald Trump? ] Many in the Arab world are asking similar questions and are particularly unnerved\u00a0by the rise of Trump, said H.A. Hellyer, a political analyst and author of a book on the 2011 Egyptian uprising.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact he\u2019s a genuine contender has damaged American standing almost everywhere \u2014 not least within the Arab world and the wider region,\u201d Hellyer said. \u201cHis discourse, which\u00a0 has attacked Muslims . . . is not marginal. It is now mainstream, and that\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201d The worry has also been especially acute in Mexico, where opinions toward Trump are overwhelmingly negative \u2014 no surprise given that his signature issue is building\u00a0 a border wall . He also launched his campaign by calling Mexican migrants \u201crapists.\u201d Mexicans accustomed to feeling indifferent toward the U.S. presidential campaign have found themselves actively rooting for Trump to lose. \u201cFor the first time there is a distinction: There\u2019s an American good guy and an American bad guy,\u201d said Il\u00e1n Semo, history professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. \u201cIt was never like this in Mexico.\u201d The angst over Trump is so deeply felt that the peso plunges every time his poll numbers rise, and there could be an immediate recession in Mexico if he comes to power, said Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City. Anxiety about the presidential contest extends far south of any potential future border wall. Latin America has been shifting back toward the political center in recent years after a long period dominated by left-wing populism. But the new crop of pro-business leaders has found that no one in the presidential race is willing to stick up for the principles of free trade and open markets that the United States has been pushing in the region for years. Political whiplash is happening in Africa, too. For many on the continent, Obama\u2019s election had been a triumph, evidence that American democracy could be a model of liberalism and tolerance. Now, eight years later, Trump\u2019s threats to jail his political opponent mimics the behavior of some of the continent\u2019s own less-than-democratic leaders. Among them is President Pierre Nkurunziza of the small central African nation of Burundi. He was sworn in for a third term in August 2015, and exiled activists have been lobbying the United States to help halt the extrajudicial killings and repression that have\u00a0 characterized his new term . The campaign, however, has offered little cause for optimism in a country such as Burundi, far from America\u2019s geopolitical priorities but in dire need of help from a superpower.\u00a0 Elvis Banyankiye, a 28-year-old Burundian who is now studying in France, said he had once hoped the Americans would do more to pressure his government to stop human rights violations. Watching the U.S. presidential campaign stagger from one new low to the next, his expectations sank. \u201cThe U.S. has been a model for how to conduct elections. We used to see tolerance in the debates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are losing confidence in that.\u201d David Filipov in Moscow; David Agren in Mexico City; Rama Lakshmi in New Delhi; Nick Miroff in Havana; Karla Adam in London; Emily Rauhala and Congcong Zhang in Beijing; Ruth Eglash in Jerusalem; Carol Morello in Washington; Anna Fifield in Tokyo; Kevin Sieff in Kigali, Rwanda; Rael Ombuor in Nairobi; Michael Birnbaum in Brussels; Heba Mahfouz in Cairo; and Louisa Loveluck in Beirut contributed to this report.

    "text": "US Supreme Court Reinstates Arizona Ballot Collection Ban By bob christie, associated press PHOENIX \u0097 Nov 5, 2016, 8:04 PM ET 0 Shares Email The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, stepping into a contentious political issue days before the presidential election and dealing a blow to Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts. The unsigned order from the nation's highest court overturns an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law and drew celebration from Democrats. Groups immediately launched renewed efforts to help voters deliver their ballots to the polls, then stopped after the high-court ruling. The Supreme Court decision called into question what happens to ballots that were legally collected from voters in the 20 hours that the law was blocked. Arizona filed an emergency appeal hours after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the law Friday. Justice Anthony Kennedy referred the case to the entire Supreme Court, and the court issued a brief order overturning the appeals court. The 9th Circuit will now consider the law in a January session that it set when it blocked the law. The high court decision is unusual because it takes at least five votes to issue such an order and the court is split 4-4 along conservative-liberal lines after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia this year. That means at least one of the court's liberals agreed to allow the law to go back into effect, and no dissents were noted in the order. The case is one of a slew of election-related challenges filed by Democrats across the nation in the lead-up to Tuesday's election. Democrats in six states asked federal judges to block what they alleged were voter intimidation tactics planned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, his backers or the state and national GOP. A judge in Ohio issued an injunction blocking the tactics Friday, but judges in Arizona and Nevada refused to do so. Lawsuits in Michigan and Pennsylvania are awaiting hearings, while a federal judge in New Jersey refused to sanction the Republican National Committee for violating terms of a more than three-decade old agreement blocking voter intimidation there. Republicans deny the allegations. In Arizona, Democratic efforts to extend voter registration by a day because the deadline fell on a holiday were rejected this week. And an effort to force ballots cast by voters in the wrong precinct to be counted was denied by the 9th Circuit. Regarding ballots collected during the time the law was blocked, the Arizona Secretary of State's office urged groups to turn them in Monday. County elections officials have said they lack authority to enforce the law and any valid ballot they receive through any means would be counted. \"All of those ballots, regardless of whether or not they were collected as a part of a lot of ballots, they were all going to be counted anyway. There was never any danger to voters,\" said Matt Roberts, spokesman for Secretary of State Michele Reagan. But state Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham said the Democratic groups should return the ballots to voters. The party has trained poll watchers to observe people who return multiple ballots and report them to election officials. \"Because now it's up to the voter to bring it into the polling place\" Graham said. He also criticized Democrats for rushing to collect ballots knowing the Supreme Court was poised to act. Democratic state Rep. Martin Quezada, who represents a heavily minority metro-Phoenix district, said there should be no legal liability for collecting during the window when the law was blocked. Backers of his campaign collected some ballots after the 9th Circuit ruling. \"We made a concerted effort to ensure that we documented the time when we collected these ballots, so there's proof that we collected them during that time,\" Quezada said. \"Now we just have to go turn them in first thing Monday morning and we don't expect there to be any problems with that.\" The Arizona Attorney General's Office said it would review all elections-based complaints on a case-by-case basis and declined further comment. Collecting early ballots is especially effective in minority communities, and Democrats alleged the law hurts minorities' ability to vote. The last week before an election is the most critical time for their get-out-the-vote efforts, because it is too late to mail back an early ballot. They must be dropped off at an election office if they are to be counted. Arizona has more than 3.5 million registered voters, and 2.3 million of them signed up to get a mail-in ballot. As of Friday, the Secretary of State said 1.56 million ballots have already been returned. It's the remaining early ballots that parties target in the final week before an election. The decision comes just days ahead of a presidential election that has Arizona Democrats hoping Hillary Clinton will win the traditionally Republican state. Arizona's majority Republican lawmakers approved the law earlier this year over the objection of Democrats. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey called it a common-sense effort to protect the integrity of elections and eliminate voter fraud. A split 9th U.S. Circuit panel had said that by blocking the law it was preserving the status quo for Tuesday's election, which could come down to the wire in Arizona as Democrats spend heavily to get out the vote from Latinos and others angered by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's anti-immigrant comments. Both parties have used ballot collection to boost turnout during elections by going door-to-door and asking voters if they have completed their mail-in ballots. Voters who have not are urged to do so, and the volunteers offer to take the ballots to election offices. Democrats, however, use it more effectively. The law does not prevent voters' family members or caregivers from turning in ballots. 0 Shares ",

Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \"Dream Big.\" Mr. Cub wrote those words on an autographed photo of him and Anthony Rizzo , who attached it to the wall of his locker in the spring of 2015. Ernie Banks , the Cubs icon, and Rizzo, the young first baseman, had bonded after Rizzo's arrival from the Padres in 2012. After Banks died in January 2015, Rizzo paid tribute to his friend by posting the photo in his locker, a daily affirmation from a man synonymous with sunshine. It wasn't one of the catchy slogans the Cubs would make famous in 2016 \u2014 \"Embrace the Target\" or \"Try Not to Suck\" \u2014 and it wasn't particularly poetic. Just a friendly reminder from someone who never made it to a World Series that it all starts with a dream. Now Rizzo and the Cubs finally had made it to the World Series, ending a 71-year wait that spawned the \"lovable losers\" epithet and made the franchise a late-night TV punchline from Johnny Carson to Stephen Colbert. All they needed to do was beat the Indians to end the 107-year championship drought and kick off the party of the century in Chicago. Rizzo and Travis Wood were the last of the 2012 Cubs that lost 101 games in the first year of The Plan. On the eve of Game 1 of the Series, Rizzo reminisced about the winter of 2014, when Joe Maddon arrived and Jon Lester signed. At last, the dream finally began to look real. The Weight: Paul Sullivan chronicles the Cubs' 2016 season Read more stories \"It was a turning point,\" Rizzo said. \"I remember saying to my parents 'I should be on a contending team the rest of my career.' The first four years of it weren't like that. It's a good feeling to come in knowing we're going to play this game and next year we're going to go into spring training expecting to win the World Series again, just like we did this year, expecting to win the World Series. \"It's exciting stuff.\" It was, and the Cubs not only were ready, they had an October Surprise in their back pocket \u2014 the return of Kyle Schwarber, who had missed more than six months rehabbing from knee surgery after an outfield collision with Dexter Fowler in the third game of the season. A couple of days earlier, Schwarber had been playing in front of 100 people in an Arizona Fall League game, preparing to launch a made-for-\"30-for-30\"-style comeback. Now he was on baseball's biggest stage, trying to help end an epic drought, with millions of Cubs fans dreaming big. The weight of the past was heavier than ever, but the time had arrived. Here they were. Now they were here. Caption Theo Epstein ahead of Game 1 of the World Series Theo Epstein ahead of Game 1 of the World Series.

Burke Masters, a Cubs chaplain, celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in the Wrigley Field stands before Game 5 of the World Series, as the participants hoped to restore faith that had been shattered in the blink of an eye. After Indians ace Corey Kluber shut down the Cubs in a 6-0 victory in Game 1, Schwarber's Hollywood comeback and Jake Arrieta 's dominance led them to a 5-1 triumph in Game 2 that knotted the Series for the much-anticipated return to Chicago. The pregame scene for the first World Series game at Wrigley Field since 1945 resembled a Norman Rockwell painting, warm and fuzzy and visually perfect. But the game itself was Stephen King-like, a horrific 1-0 Cubs loss that gave the Indians home-field advantage again. John Lackey, who ripped the Chicago media for pointing out the Cubs' postseason swings during the National League Championship Series , saying \"you guys dramatize everything,\" was overdramatic during a Game 4 meltdown.

(Paul Sullivan) The Cubs' high hopes of ending the drought seemingly were dashed, and the only thing left for the Indians to do to clinch their first championship in 68 years was to win one of three games, starting with beating Lester in Game 5. That was not happening. Lester struck out the side in the first to keep hope alive but served up a home run to Jose Ramirez in the second to quiet the home crowd. The Cubs were in the midst of another offensive funk, just like the one in the NLCS, and couldn't find an escape hatch. Bryant had been 1-for-15 in the Series, making his decision to film a commercial with a billy goat for an energy drink look ominous. Damn, that old goat had won again. But the kid with the never-ending grin stepped to the plate to start the bottom of the fourth inning and calmly cranked a home run into the left-field bleachers, tying the game and starting the Sigh Heard 'Round Chicago. The situation: With the crowd at Wrigley Field subdued after Jose Ramirez's second-inning home run gave the Indians a 1-0 lead, the Cubs were in need of a spark with their season on the line.

(Chris Kuc) Rizzo then doubled off the ivy in right, and suddenly the ballpark was alive again. Addison Russell's infield hit brought in the go-ahead run, and David Ross' sacrifice fly made it 3-1. Lester was not going to give up this lead. No chance. But he told Maddon after six innings and 90 pitches that he was done, turning the season over to the Cubs' shaky bullpen. Carl Edwards Jr. came on with a one-run lead in the seventh, but after a single and flyout, Maddon had an October Surprise of his own. Edwards was yanked for closer Aroldis Chapman , who was being asked to do the unthinkable \u2014 get the final eight outs and get the Cubs to Game 6. Chapman delivered \u2014 but only after scaring the daylights out of Cubs Nation, neglecting to cover first on Rajai Davis ' infield hit to Rizzo with one out in the eighth. Would the lack of hustle with the season on the line ultimately turn Chapman into the goat of the century? Chapman let Davis steal second and third with ease, greasing the skids for his demise, before Francisco Lindor was called out on strikes to end the suspense. Crisis averted. Photos from Game 5 of the World Series at Wrigley Field on Oct. 30, 2016. After the Game 5 victory, Maddon gave the players a timeout for Halloween instead of having them fly to Cleveland for the off day. This was the genius of Maddon, the reason he had been able to get the most of his players. Let them be dads first and Cubs employees second. There was no way to quantify its affect, but the players appreciated the chance to breathe. Lester and Ross took their kids trick-or-treating, getting their first taste of a Wrigleyville Halloween. \"It was a little nuts,\" Ross said. \"Some lady, had to be about 60, was something. She was sprinting down the street because she didn't answer the door and then saw it was me and Jon Lester walking around. It was crazy, but fun crazy. People were excited.\" Another mood swing in the city that couldn't sleep was well underway. Bryant's home run got them off the mat, the tag-team performance of Lester and Chapman saved the season and they had Arrieta and Kyle Hendricks going in Games 6 and 7, respectively. \"What could go wrong?\" fans said to themselves, knowing perfectly well what could \u2014 and perhaps would.

(Chris Kuc/Chicago Tribune) Cubs catcher David Ross reacts to playing his final game at Wrigley Field, a 3-2 win over the Indians in Game 5 of the World Series. (Chris Kuc/Chicago Tribune) Rolling the dice The real curse of the Cubs was not the billy goat or the black cat or the foul ball. It was having to flash back to an awful moment or poor decision-making at a crucial juncture of a potential history-changing game. In 1984, it was manager Jim Frey going with Scott Sanderson in Game 4 of the NLCS in San Diego with a 2-1 series lead over the Padres. Rick Sutcliffe, the major leagues' best pitcher, was ready to go, and Game 2 winner Steve Trout was ready for Game 5 if necessary. Thirty-two years later, it still rankled the '84 Cubs. \"We've visited that area many times,\" said Ron Cey, the team's third baseman known as 'the Penguin' for his inimitable waddle. \"Yeah, it kind of grinds at me once in a while. I didn't discuss it with (Frey), but I discussed it with a lot of people.\" Cubs managers, even the most successful ones, had contributed to the weight. ",

Businesses that once marketed their jeans and fleece jackets internationally as tiny pieces of the American dream are being advised to revamp their ad campaigns. Advertisement Continue reading the main story United States diplomats more accustomed to mediating other countries\u2019 disputes are now being called on to defend American democracy in the face of allegations that the election is \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cI think it has affected the way that people see us,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a veteran diplomat who was under secretary of state for political affairs under President George W. Bush. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect that from the United States. We are the people who go and monitor other people\u2019s elections.\u201d Across the planet, people are contemplating the possibility that the United States might not be so exceptional after all. \u201cMuch of the world is no longer in awe of you,\u201d said Lyall Mercer, managing director of a public relations company in Australia. Mr. Mercer noted that state lawmakers in Sydney had recently adopted a resolution by unanimous accord that described Mr. Trump as a \u201crevolting slug.\u201d \u201cOf course I understand this is about the candidate and not the country,\u201d Mr. Mercer said. \u201cBut the very fact that they were willing to do this, with not one M.P. speaking against it \u2014 despite knowing they were ridiculing someone who could be the next president of our most important ally \u2014 I think speaks to the diminishing awe, or even respect.\u201d In Lebanon, where the United States\u2019 image had already been battered \u2014 first by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, then by President Obama \u2019s disengagement from the region \u2014 its staunchest defenders have been quieted. \u201cEven during the worst days of anti-Americanism in the Middle East, there were always pockets of people who had studied in the U.S. who still looked up to the United States,\u201d said Hisham Melhem , a correspondent for An-Nahar, Lebanon\u2019s leading daily newspaper. \u201cNow, many of them have given up on the United States as a beacon of progress and enlightenment.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Arabs skeptical of the United States\u2019 efforts to promote democracy in the region have eaten up allegations of sexual misconduct and embarrassing email leaks in the campaign, Mr. Melhem said: \u201cThey are mocking the American democratic process in ways that I\u2019ve never seen before, and I\u2019ve been covering elections since the early 1980s.\u201d In Africa, where political contests combining ethnic divisions, violence and the possibility of a challenge to the election\u2019s result are not unfamiliar, some have made snarky suggestions that the African Union broker a \u201cunity government\u201d in the United States, using the Twitter hashtag #Nov8AfricaEdition. The United States\u2019 image abroad has fallen so much that trusty Canadians have begun their own campaign of reassurance: #TellAmericaItsGreat. \u201cThe French fry is an American invention,\u201d read one cheerful post. \u201cThanks America!\u201d Adversaries are also at work, trying to magnify the impression that American democracy is a sham. In Russia, which is accused of hacking into the emails that have dogged Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, newscasters portray the United States as under the control of dark, secretive forces. Vesti, a nightly news program in Moscow, reported that the firebombing of a Trump campaign office in North Carolina was an example of \u201cattempts to kill those who have different views.\u201d Then there is Europe, where 85 percent of people in a recent Pew Research Center poll reported having no confidence in Mr. Trump to \u201cdo the right thing regarding world affairs.\u201d There, his very popularity has tarnished America\u2019s image.

Although Europeans have been troubled by their own right-wing populists, \u201cthey expect the United States to be a rock of stability, a safety net they can rely on,\u201d he said. And the scorn does not fall solely on Mr. Trump. K. Riva Levinson, who leads a boutique international consulting firm in Washington, said that during a recent trip to Ghana, people expressed disillusionment with what they saw as the unfairness of the Democratic primary contest between Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

    "text": "In final weekend, Clinton focuses on her 'firewall' while Trump hits battleground states Donald Trump Campaigns In Key States During Weekend Ahead Of General Presidential Election Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Donald and Melania Trump arrive for a campaign rally at Wilmington International Airport Donald and Melania Trump arrive for a campaign rally at Wilmington International Airport (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Noah Bierman , Chris Megerian and Michael Finnegan Contact Reporters Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump distilled the campaign styles they\u2019ve showcased for more than a year into a final blitz of intense campaigning as they wrapped up\u00a0their pitches for the White House . Clinton, true\u00a0to type, chose a tightly disciplined path, holding rallies and events in Florida and Pennsylvania on Saturday\u00a0in hopes of building a traditional electoral firewall by appealing to women, minorities and millennials. Trump, who made it this far largely\u00a0on improvisation, zigzagged across the country, including a few states where he trails, part of his campaign\u2019s plan to reshape the political map\u00a0with a come-from-behind victory. \u201cWe're going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds,\u201d Trump said in Tampa, Fla., beginning a day that also took him to\u00a0North Carolina, Nevada and Colorado. Trump vowed he would also go to Minnesota, a state he added to a frenetic Sunday schedule that \u00a0already includes stops in Iowa, Michigan,\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0and Virginia. Polls show him\u00a0trailing by about five percentage points\u00a0in Minnesota, a state that has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1972, a longer streak\u00a0than any other state. But Trump, whose path to victory is more narrow than Clinton\u2019s, has shown a willingness to upend conventional thinking throughout the campaign \u2014\u00a0to the frustration of mainstream Republican strategists and the delight of his enthusiastic supporters. His communications director, Jason Miller, told reporters in a conference\u00a0call Saturday that internal polls show many states, including Michigan, Minnesota\u00a0and New Mexico, are closer than public polls suggest, thanks to a late surge of excitement combined with tough headlines for Clinton related to the\u00a0ongoing FBI email investigation. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, insisted that scheduled visits from Clinton and President Obama to Michigan in the campaign\u2019s final days are not a sign of concern that Democrats are losing ground in the traditionally blue state. Instead, he told reporters, it\u2019s a matter of ending in states where voters cast more of their ballots on election day, rather than early voting.\u00a0 \u201cTrump is basically going everywhere,\u201d Mook told reporters. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the more time he spends in Minnesota and Nevada the better. We have tried to calibrate our schedule to be in states at the peak time for voting.\u201d\u00a0 Clinton, hoarse yet energetic, rallied supporters Saturday in\u00a0Pembroke Pines, Fla., one of the most important Democratic strongholds in the country, as a downpour cut short her first big speech of the day. She stopped at Miami\u2019s Haitian and Cuban American neighborhoods, hoping to boost crucial minority turnout, and she publicized a phone call with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , trying to close the sale with liberal and millennial holdouts.\u00a0 \"Let's make it happen,\" she told supporters at a field office in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti. \u00a0 \"Knock on doors!\" people chanted. She continued to rely on the large stable of celebrities on her side, including\u00a0a planned concert with pop star Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Saturday night, the day after appearing\u00a0in Cleveland with\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. Wins in Florida and Pennsylvania, where Clinton holds narrow leads in polls, would make a Trump victory nearly impossible.\u00a0 Unlike Florida, where nearly 6 million voters\u00a0had already cast ballots by Saturday morning, Pennsylvania does not have early voting, so Clinton is focusing more attention there in the closing days of the campaign. Democrats, who trailed Republicans in mail-in\u00a0balloting in Florida, made up ground with in-person early voting, holding an overall\u00a0lead among early voters of about 7,000 by early Saturday. That was less than their lead of about 100,000 votes at the same point \u00a0in 2012, indicating the state remains up for grabs. Veteran Nevada journalist Jon Ralston reported Saturday that a surge of early voting by Democrats in Clark County has all but killed Trump\u2019s chances in the state. But\u00a0 Bill Dunn , director of early and absentee voting for the Republican National Committee, said Trump can make up ground in rural counties and with strong turnout from Republicans on election day. As polls have tightened, Trump has tried to minimize the risk of any last-minute mistakes by sticking to scripted remarks on blocking Syrian refugees from entering the U.S., building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and other staples of his campaign, including scathing rhetorical assaults on Clinton\u2019s integrity. \u201cIf she ever got into the Oval Office, Hillary and her special interests would rob this country blind,\u201d he said in North Carolina. But he veered off script\u00a0a bit more at his Tampa rally, where he\u00a0could not resist cracking a lewd joke as he reveled in the FBI\u2019s search of a \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of new emails\u00a0for links to Clinton's private server, messages that were found on the computer of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner . \u201cAnthony Weiner has probably every classified email ever sent,\u201d Trump told a few thousand supporters in Tampa. \u201cAnd knowing this guy, he probably studied every single one, in between using his machine for other purposes.\u201d Trump also took a shot at profanity used by Jay Z at\u00a0the\u00a0Clinton concert. \u201cI actually like Jay Z, but you know the language last night \u2013 oooooohhhh. Oooooohhhhh,\u201d said Trump, whose own foul language is featured in Clinton\u2019s advertising. \u201cCan you imagine if I said that? He used every word in the book.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never said what he said in my life, but that shows you the phoniness of politicians, and the phoniness of the whole system,\u201d Trump said, connecting the riff with his core anti-establishment message. Clinton has had the luxury of a much larger cast of high-powered campaign surrogates on her side, including\u00a0her husband Bill, who spoke in Florida on Saturday; Sanders, who was in Iowa and Colorado, and\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden in Pennsylvania with his wife, Jill. Obama spoke in North Carolina on Friday. Trump has tried to counter with his family. Melania Trump made another rare appearance on the trail Saturday, standing beside her husband in North Carolina, two days after she gave her first solo speech of the general election in Pennsylvania. The appearance came a day after the\u00a0Associated Press, citing newly obtained documents, reported that Melania Trump, who was born in Slovenia,\u00a0earned $20,056\u00a0for\u00a010 U.S. modeling jobs\u00a0before she obtained a work visa. Melania\u00a0Trump moved to New York in 1996, obtaining a work visa about seven weeks after her arrival according to the AP,\u00a0and became a citizen in 2006. Trump would not allow it to interfere with his immigration message.\u00a0When the the crowd chanted, \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d Trump goaded them on. \u201cYou know what? The harder they fight us, the higher it goes,\u201d he responded.\u00a0 Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty. Gen.

Saturday's order from the Supreme Court overturns an appeals court decision a day earlier that blocked the Arizona law. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) 711 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 52 COMMENTEMAILMORE PHOENIX \u2014 The Supreme Court reinstated a new Arizona law Saturday that makes it a felony to collect early\u00a0ballots . The order from the nation's highest court overturns a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0decision a day earlier that blocked the law from being enforced. The decision is a blow to Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts and groups that in wake of the appeals-court decision had geared up to help early voters deliver their ballots to the polls. Democrats allege the law hurts minorities' ability to vote. The high court's order adds to a flurry of legal decisions affecting Tuesday's election\u00a0and ended an 18-hour period during which ballot collection was once again legal in Arizona. President Trump or President Clinton? These key groups offer clues to Tuesday's outcome \"What a whirlwind!\" said Tim LaSota, lawyer for the Arizona Republican Party. The state GOP has been a strong proponent of the law and, through the Republican Lawyers Association, has trained watchers to look out for people returning multiple ballots to the polls Tuesday. State GOP Chairman Robert Graham called the court's order \"a victory for the voters of Arizona.\" \u201c(The high court's order is) a victory for the voters of Arizona.\u201d Robert Graham, Arizona Republican Party The Arizona Democratic Party disagreed. \"Although we are disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision, we will respect their decision. In the final three days of this election, the Arizona Democratic Party will continue to follow state law in our voter outreach practices,\" Alexis Tameron, Arizona Democratic Party chairwoman said in a statement. \"Our fight has always been about having more people participate and making the voting process easier for Arizonans, and we will continue this fight not only this election but always.\" The lingering question is what to do with the ballots, if any, that were collected Friday while the law was on hold. Matt Roberts, a spokesman for the Arizona Secretary of State Office, said anyone who gathered ballots Friday should take them to county elections offices. \"I'm sure if anyone dropped them off Monday, there'd be no problem,\" Roberts said. Elections officials want those votes counted. Early voters not swayed by late campaign events Republicans took a different tack. \"The ethical thing would be to return them to the voter,\" Graham said. It's too late to drop ballots in the mail\u00a0since it's highly unlikely they would get to county elections offices in time. \u201cOur fight has always been about having more people participate and making the voting process easier for Arizonans, and we will continue this fight.\u201d Alexis Tameron, Arizona Democratic Party B. Loewe of the Bazta Arpaio campaign said his group is still reviewing the court's order. The group is opposing Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's bid for another term. Bazta Arpaio quickly jumped into action after the 9th Circuit issued an injunction Friday to block the law. It urged voters to text them so someone could collect their ballots and turn them in. On Saturday, Loewe said the group had not yet decided on guidance for volunteers, nor what to do with the ballots collected Friday. He said he did not have an estimate of how many, if any, were collected. It took Republicans three years to get the ballot-collection bill through the Legislature. The law makes it a felony for anyone to return another voter's ballot to the polls. The law has exceptions for members of the same household, caregivers, the postal worker and family members. Supporters argued that the law was needed to protect against fraud, claiming collectors were \"harvesting\" the ballots by opening them or otherwise divining how they were marked, and tossing ones that did not align with the collector's political views. Supporters had anecdotal accounts, but no proof this had occurred. Opponents argued the practice was helpful, especially for new voters or those who waited too long to get their early ballot in the mail. Community groups, especially those working with Latinos, used ballot collection in past elections. Trump: Go vote again, this time for me The high court's order apparently was a unanimous decision. There were no dissents filed from the eight-member court. Although the court did not offer any reasoning for its decision, LaSota said he suspects it was because of the decision in another case involving Arizona, Purcell v. Gonzales. That case determined courts should not inject themselves into elections when Election Day is imminent. \"It is very likely that the Supreme Court issued a stay in such short order, reversing the 9th Circuit, to preserve this principle,\" he said. Who thought up 'I Voted' stickers? The battle over the bill is not over. The order\u00a0from Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\u00a0states that the stay is in place until the full appeals court can consider the case, which was state and national Democrats filed in April. Although the 9th Circuit initially upheld the ballot-collection law, a wider panel of that same court blocked it Friday. It will schedule a hearing on the issue later.

It\u2019s only by God\u2019s grace we found that little girl alive.\u201d Wright says registered sex offender Todd Kohlhepp, 45, was arrested at his home in Moore Thursday morning in connection to the case. He was charged with kidnapping. More charges are possible, Wright said.\u00a0 CBS affiliate WSPA reports he is listed as the owner of the Woodruff property. The woman also told investigators there may be four bodies on the property, but Wright says investigators aren\u2019t sure whether that\u2019s true. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t have a serial killer on our hands,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt very possibly could be what we have.\u201d The woman said she had been fed during her time in captivity, Wright said.

He wouldn\u2019t discuss whether the woman told them any details about Carver\u2019s whereabouts. The woman and her boyfriend were last heard from in late August, WSPA reports. The missing case gained national attention after\u00a0 suspicious posts appeared on Carver\u2019s Facebook page that his family suspected were posted by someone else. The page was later taken down. On Thursday, Wright said \u201cit\u2019s super possible [Kohlhepp] was doing that to try and get people off his trail, but that\u2019s just a thought, I don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d The national sex offender registry lists a kidnapping count for Kohlhepp in Arizona in 1987.

I\u2019m here tonight because respect matters. Respect matters to me.\u201d Jay Z didn\u2019t name the Republican nominee during the rally, but he alluded to the dangers of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u00a0 \u201cThis other guy -- I don\u2019t have any ill will towards him,\u201d the rapper said. \u201cBut his conversation is divisive and that\u2019s not an evolved soul to me. So he cannot be my president, he cannot be our president. Once you divide us you weaken us. We\u2019re stronger together.\u201d At his own rally, Trump continued to hold up Jay Z\u2019s profanity as an example of political hypocrisy, even mentioning Beyonce in his criticism. \u201cAnd Beyonce. And I like them both. But he used language last night that was so bad,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd then Hillary said, \u2018I don\u2019t like Donald Trump\u2019s lewd language.\u2019 My lewd language! Tell you what. I\u2019ve never said what he said in my life. But that shows you the phoniness of politicians and the phoniness of the whole system, folks.\u201d Trump has been criticized for his own use of explicit language, especially after a 2005 tape recording from unaired \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d footage showed Trump bragging about his sexually aggressive behavior toward women and saying that he would sometimes \u201cgrab [women] by the p----.\u201d The GOP nominee has defended his language, calling it \u201clocker room talk.\u201d And though Trump has not been heard using the n-word this election cycle, he has also had a celebrity surrogate use that language at his campaign rallies. In September, boxing promoter and Trump surrogate Don King, who was once convicted of manslaughter, gave a controversial speech at an Ohio church where he invoked the n-word in his introduction to Trump . \u201cAmerica needs Donald Trump. We need Donald Trump, especially black people,\u201d said King, as a smiling Trump sat directly behind him during the pastors event. \u201cBecause you have to understand, brothers and sisters -- they tried to tell me you have to emulate and imitate the white man and then you can be successful. So we tried that.\u201d \u201cI told Michael Jackson -- I said, if you poor, you are a poor negro,\u201d King, who was pardoned for his manslaughter conviction by the Ohio governor in 1983, went on. \u00a0\u201cI would use the n-word. But if you rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are an intellectual negro.\u201d King continued -- and seemed to slip in his language. \u201cIf you are dancing and sliding and gliding n-----,\u201d he said. He laughed, before adding, \u201cI mean, I mean, negro. You are dancing and sliding and gliding negro. So dare not alienate because you cannot assimilate. So you know, you going to be a negro till you die.\u201d At the time, Trump, who has prided himself on his no-holds-barred rhetoric while on the campaign trail, continued smiling. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

An Istanbul court has ordered nine of the paper's journalists to be held in prison pending trial. Basin Foto Ajansi/LightRocket via Getty Images It's one of Turkey's oldest and most-respected newspapers \u2014 and that description comes from a rival. But on Saturday, the editor-in-chief, a cartoonist, and seven board members of daily newspaper Cumhuriyet were sent to prison pending trial. Prosecutors initially ordered the nine journalists detained on Monday, as part of an anti-terrorism investigation linked to a failed coup attempt in Turkey earlier this year. Four others with ties to the newspaper, including two columnists, were released on bail Saturday. From Istanbul, journalist Dalia Mortada reports for our Newscast unit: \"The daily is one of the last remaining independent voices that is critical of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the government. Since the failed coup, the government has shut down more than 150 media outlets and reclaimed its place as the world's leading jailer of journalists. \"This is not the first time Cumhurriyet has been targeted by prosecutors. In May, the paper's former editor-in-chief was sentenced to five years in jail for espionage after he published evidence of Turkish intelligence trucks delivering weapons into Syria. \" Article continues after sponsorship State-run Anadolu Agency lists the arrested journalists as editor-in-chief Murat Sabuncu and cartoonist Haci Musa Kart, along with board members Ahmet Kadri Gursel, Guray Tekin Oz, Mustafa Kemal Gungor, Turhan Gunay, Hakan Karasinir, Onder Celik and Bulent Utku. According to Anadolu, an Istanbul court ordered the nine remanded in custody pending trial after prosecutors accused them of being linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and the Fetullah Terrorist Organization. These are complicated times in Turkey. Consider that the Hurriyet Daily News \u2014 which today called Cumhuriyet \"one of Turkey's oldest and most-respected newspapers\" \u2014 is reporting that \"the original prosecutor of the investigation is currently under trial over links to the G\u00fclen movement [FET\u00d6], widely believed to be behind July 15 coup attempt.\" ",

The nearest WiFi is at the Prairie Knights Casino 10 miles south of Cannon Ball. But connectivity issues haven't stopped the thousands of Native Americans, environmentalists and others who pass through the camp from broadcasting their fight against the construction of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline live to the world on social media. Ojibwe actor Tinsel Korey posts an update about the Dakota Access Pipeline protests to her social media followers on October 30, 2016. Chiara Sottile / NBC News \"It's just been escalating to that point where we have to use our phones to just show our side of our story,\" said E'sha Hoferer, 27, squinting into the mid-day sun on one of the season's dwindling warm days. \"I was just another protector with a camera, my video camera and my smart phone. And technology has been very vital in our fight here,\" said Hoferer, a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe who has discovered that his mission is documenting the struggle. His work and that of many others is being beamed and streamed into homes around the world. Videos recording violent clashes between police and protesters have attracted upwards of 4 million views on Facebook alone, and Hoferer says he's receiving support from across the globe.

Like many others, Hoferer refers to himself as a water protector, reflecting his goal of halting construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline which would cut across the Missouri River. The Missouri is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, among others, and serves tens of millions in cities downstream. Hoferer and other protesters are calling on elected officials to halt the construction of the nearly completed, $3.8 billion pipeline that is meant to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Hoferer was broadcasting live on Facebook on Oct. 27 when the Morton County Sheriff's Department forcibly removed hundreds of demonstrators from their camp in the track of the pipeline's construction. Standing as close as he could to the \"frontline\" without losing signal, Hoferer's Facebook Live carried an audience of more than 30,000 people then and has been watched more than 200,000 times by Saturday morning. Post by NBC News . His viewers watched as police in riot gear forced demonstrators down onto the ground in handcuffs, and as Hoferer's fellow water protectors refusing to give up their camp. \"We have our cameras and our prayers, that's all we have,\" he shouts at one point in the video in response to a claim that a protester fired a weapon. \"No child in America should feel like they don't matter, and so because of social media, this message is being spread across the world.\" Later he warns: \"The world is watching.\" Hoferer has now created a media collective called '1N' or '1NTV' with other young, camera-savvy colleagues, and they regularly broadcast live on Facebook when protests or actions are planned, or when there's an update from camp. \"We're all in part of this media team that collectively we all want the same thing,\" said Hoferer. \"Get this media out and hopefully stop the black snake,\" he said, referring to the oil pipeline. Another member of this team is known as Twenny. \"The truth needs to be told,\" said Twenny, who identifies as Purepecha and hails from Los Angeles. \"If it doesn't come from us, then no one is ever going to know the story for what it really is.\" His Facebook Live videos garner tens of thousands of viewers who have told him how emotional it is to watch the movement play out live from home. The Facebook Live tool launched to most users in January of this year. In just those several months, it has allowed people to share their most personal and sometimes harrowing, live experiences. The company is well aware of how powerful the platform is in events that unfold live. The flags of more than half the federally recognized tribes in the U.S. whip in the wind down \"flag row\" in what is known as the Oceti Sakowin \"water protector\" camp just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. Tribes from around the country sent or brought flags to show solidarity with the protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline under construction just a half mile away. Chiara Sottile / NBC News In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, \"While some of what we've seen broadcast can be heart-wrenching and difficult to watch, we're also really humbled by the fact that Live is being used to give people a voice and to shine a light on key issues in our society.\" Marilyn Fox, 18, who is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, relies on platforms like Facebook to \"set the record\" about the movement. \"For the most part correcting that information is a lot easier because you can just share, share, share,\" she said in an interview with NBC News, standing atop what's known as \"Facebook Hill\" or \"Media Hill\" because it's one of the few places in camp with reception. \"Any social media platform that's popular, we are using it to get the message out, to provide our own narrative, to tell our own stories,\" said Simon Moya-Smith at the Oceti Sakowin Camp, as it is known by the water protectors camping there. \"Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, anything we can to get the message out there,\" said Moya-Smith, an editor at Indian Country Today. Unlit candles line the road to the Backwater Bridge on North Dakota Highway 1806, the site of multiple fires in the ongoing Dakota Access Pipeline protest. Chiara Sottile / NBC News \"People are wondering why these are big issues now,\" he added, referring to the concerns that the oil pipeline would desecrate sacred sites and burial grounds, as well as threaten drinking water. \"They've been big issues. The only thing that's new is the technology, is social media.\" Tinsel Korey, 36, is an Ojibwe actor, best known for her role in the Twilight series. She used her huge social media following \u2014 she has nearly 90,000 followers on Twitter alone \u2014 to spread the word about the \"#NoDAPL\" movement. Korey says sharing from within the movement is vital, because of what she sees as a lack of mainstream media coverage. \"I spoke to a youth and she said, 'They don't care about us,'\" said Korey. \"That's sad. Our children shouldn't feel like that. No child in America should feel like they don't matter, and so because of social media, this message is being spread across the world.\" Play ",

I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country, and know that her possibilities are limitless.\" Play African American voter turnout down this election 3:57 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161106013919if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/801923139828\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> There's no doubt about which party is favored among black voters, who made up about 13 percent of the electorate in 2012. They have consistently voted close to 90 percent or higher for Democratic presidential candidates, and Donald Trump's rhetoric may only increase that margin. But margins don't matter, votes do. And the question is whether the same number of African-American votes will be cast as there were for Barack Obama, who re-engineered the way Democrats win the White House by juicing turnout among friendly demographics. After some discouraging initial early-vote numbers, Democrats are somewhat relieved by newer data out of Florida and North Carolina, two states where the black vote is critical. But they are pulling out all the stops to get black voters to the polls. And while Clinton may not be Obama, it has helped to have him in her corner . The Democratic National Committee is spending seven figures on TV and radio programming that draws minority audiences, like one launched Friday, which features audio of Obama saying he needs black people to vote in order to \"give me a good send off.\" Play Beyonce on stage for Clinton in Cleveland: 'I'm with her' 3:22 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161106013919if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/801637955963\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \"After we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult if this community fails to activate itself in this election,\" Obama says, as images flicker of him being inaugurated and marching in Selma, Alabama . It's similar to the message Obama has been delivering on the stump in areas with large black populations in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio over the past week. \"I'm not on this ballot. But everything we've done these last eight years is on the ballot,\" he said in Jacksonville, Florida. It was at a historically black college in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where Obama urged his supporters in the crowd to respect a pro-Trump protester. And the campaign selected a heavily African-American part of North Carolina for where Clinton and Michelle Obama would make their joint debut on the campaign trail last week, timed to coincide with the expansion of the number of early voting sites. Meanwhile, Clinton herself has visited several historically black colleges and universities in the past week, including bringing along singer Pharrell Williams to North Carolina Central University during a campaign swing last week. President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at Florida International University on Nov. 3, 2016, in Miami. Lynne Sladky / AP And earlier in the week, Clinton visited a soul food restaurant with Rep. Marcia Fudge in Cleveland \u2014 a city she'll return to with NBA star LeBron James for a rally. The Obamas will join Clinton and former President Bill Clinton on Monday for a big election-eve rally in Philadelphia, where Democrats are counting on racking up a large number of black voters to compensate for the whiter, more conservative bulk of Pennsylvania. Stevie Wonder gave a free show for Clinton in Philadelphia on Friday night, while Obama will join the singer in central Florida on Sunday night. Ne-Yo and Pusha T have also been performing for Clinton. The concerts are not just about getting attention or building enthusiasm. The campaign distributes the free tickets at strategic locations near early voting sites, and they've found many voters take the opportunity to cast their ballot. Play ",

    "text": "A sheriff in South Carolina is trying to determine if a missing woman found alive could be linked to other disappearances. Suspect Todd Kohlhepp ... Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said they were pinging Brown\u2019s phone 2 days after she was reported missing. He says it pinged on the property where Brown was found. The Phone went dead after two days. Two weeks before they were able to get a search warrant for the property the sheriff\u2019s office flew over the property and saw it was extensive and need to get on the ground. Anderson Police say from early on they had no indication there was foul play, even with the cell phone pings. Brown left the hospital late Thursday and is staying with family, Herren said. The property includes grassy areas, some covered in waist-high weeds, as well as stands of trees. Most or all of it is surrounded by a chain-link fence 6 to 7 feet tall. In the middle was the cargo container, which measured about 30 feet by 15 feet. It was next to a two-car garage that had a living space on top, Barnette said. During Friday\u2019s search efforts, officers using all-terrain vehicles and a backhoe came and went while a law enforcement helicopter circled overhead. Investigators began excavating after cadaver dogs signaled the possible presence of remains. Acting on a tip, deputies found Brown after hearing her banging inside the container, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said computer and cellphone records led authorities to the property near Woodruff, 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia, because it was the last place that a cellphone pinged. Records indicate Kohlhepp is a licensed real estate agent and licensed pilot. As a teenager, he was convicted and sentenced to prison in Arizona for kidnapping and dangerous crimes against children. Guns and a large amount of ammunition were seized from Kohlhepp, the prosecutor said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much he had,\u201d he said. South Carolina\u2019s sex offender registry lists a 1986 kidnapping as the reason Kohlhepp is in the database of sex offenders. Matching online prison records from Arizona show that Kohlhepp served about 14 years for the felony and was released in 2001. In court Friday, Barnette said the Arizona case occurred when Kohlhepp kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, took her to his house and raped her after binding her with duct tape. A real estate agent who worked at a firm run by Kohlhepp said she had known him for 10 years after they met at a university in the Spartanburg area and were study partners in a statistics class. She said she was in disbelief. \u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of person to do something like this,\u201d Cherry Laurens said by phone. \u201cWorking with him he was an excellent boss. He stood up for us whenever we needed him.\u201d She said it was widely known that he was registered as a sex offender, but he told people that it was based on trumped-up charges after he \u201chad gone joyriding with a girl\u201d and upset her father, who was a prominent local official. Kohlhepp also had a house in Moore, on the outskirts of Spartanburg, about 15 minutes from the rural property where Brown was chained. His neighbor there, 76-year-old Ron Owen, said Kohlhepp was private but pleasant. \u201cTodd was --in my opinion -- a likable guy,\u201d Owen said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

There were fresh indications that other residents were being held back by the militants to be used as human shields . Iraqi troops have reached Mosul, but the battle for Iraq's second-largest city is far from over. More bloodshed is expected as vicious house-to-h... The seesawing battle highlights the challenges ahead for Iraqi forces as they press into more densely populated neighborhoods of the country\u2019s second largest city, where they will not be able to rely as much on airstrikes because of the risk of killing civilians. \u201cDaesh is in the city center and we must be very careful as our forces advance,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. The special forces entered the Gogjali district, on the eastern edge of Mosul, on Tuesday, marking their first major foray into the city itself after more than two weeks of fighting in its rural outskirts. ISIS fought back Saturday, pushing the special forces from the southern edge of the neighborhood. Both sides fired mortar rounds and automatic weapons, while the Iraqi troops also responded with artillery. Snipers dueled from rooftops in residential areas, where most buildings are just two stories high. Dozens of civilians emerged from their homes over the course of the day, some carrying white flags. Many civilians traveling with children and elderly relatives said they had to walk more than 6 miles to reach a camp for the displaced. Just a few miles from the clashes, Iraqi officers coordinating airstrikes with the U.S.-led coalition watched live drone footage showing a team of ISIS fighters regrouping near the front line. \u201cThey\u2019re moving in front of the mosque,\u201d an Iraqi soldier said as he called in an airstrike, which moments later flattened a small building. Civilians moved into the area soon thereafter, and the soldiers said the militants appeared to have corralled them there to prevent further strikes. ",

Beck Starr/FilmMagic hide caption toggle caption Beck Starr/FilmMagic Dani Mathers, seen here being honored as Playboy's \"2015 Playmate Of The Year,\" was widely criticized after she posted an image of a naked woman in a gym's shower area. Beck Starr/FilmMagic Months after she was roundly criticized for mocking a 70-year-old woman by posting a nude image to social media, model Dani Mathers, Playboy's 2015 Playmate of the Year, is now facing criminal charges that could result in up to six months in jail. Mathers, 29, posted the image to Snapchat back in July, captioning her secretly taken photo of a woman in the shower area of an LA Fitness health club with the message, \"If I can't unsee this then you can't either.\" On the same day she posted the image, Mathers apologized, saying she had meant to send the image in a private conversation on Snapchat rather than to a broad audience. \"That was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do. I know that body-shaming is wrong,\" she said, as member station KPCC reported . \"That is not the type of person I am.\" Mathers now faces a criminal invasion-of-privacy charge. Announcing his decision to move ahead with the case Friday, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said: \"Body shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences. It mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of 'perfect.' What really matters is our character and humanity. While body-shaming, in itself, is not a crime, there are circumstances in which invading one's privacy to accomplish it can be. And we shouldn't tolerate that.\" Article continues after sponsorship Mathers is scheduled to be arraigned on November 28; if convicted on the invasion of privacy charge, she could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. In addition to the criticism she faced over the surreptitiously taken photo \u2014 which was posted along with an image of herself laughing \u2014 Mathers was fired from Los Angeles radio station KLOS, where she had been a contributor to a morning show. She was also banned from using facilities run by LA Fitness, which at the time said via Twitter , \"It's not just our rule, it's common decency.\" ",

Reynolds Razorback Stadium. (Photo: Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports) Another SEC national title hopeful saw its chances get severely damaged Saturday. Arkansas knocked off No. 9 Florida 31-10 to deal the Gators their second loss off the season. Rawleigh Williams III ran for 148 yards and two touchdowns and Austin Allen threw for 243 yards to lead\u00a0the Razorbacks offense. The\u00a0defense did its part, too, allowing just 241 yards one week after giving up 543 yards on the ground and 56 points in a loss to Auburn. Florida managed just just 12 yards on 14 carries, and the offense out of the end zone. The lone touchdown by the Gators came on a Duke Dawson\u00a0interception return. \u201cTo come out of that game and realize we couldn\u2019t stop the run, I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t care what we do, we\u2019re going to stop the run on defense,\u2019\u201d Arkansas coach Bret Bielema said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if we played with 11 guys or had to play with 12. I\u2019ll take the penalty; we ain\u2019t going to have someone run the ball on us.\u201d Previously Saturday, No. 7 Texas A&M fell at Mississippi State 35-28, leaving unbeaten Alabama as the only conference team with less than two losses on the season. Florida remains in control of its fate in the SEC East. But now they'll likely have to run the table and win at Florida State in its regular-season finale to have any hope of making the College Football Playoff with a victory in the SEC championship game. That seems unlikely with the state of its offense. With no ground attack to support him, quarterback Luke Del Rio struggled to move the Gators through the air.\u00a0He finished 19-of-37 for 229 yards. Much of the yardage came in the fourth quarter with Arkansas comfortably ahead. \u201cFirst and foremost for the guys who made the trip down here, I apologize you had to sit through that,\u201d Florida coach Jim McElwain said. \u201c\u2026 I feel horrible for Gator Nation and the way everything kind of played out.\u201d PHOTOS FROM WEEK 10 IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL Posted!

The anti-establishment protest is organized annually by the hacktivist  group Anonymous. (Photo: Ben Pruchnie, Getty Images) England's Guy Fawkes Night, an annual event that includes protest marches, bonfires and fireworks, acknowledged its former American colonies this year by burning\u00a0Donald Trump in effigy. A rendering of the Republican presidential candidate standing more than 30 feet high went up in flames Saturday in Edenbridge as part of the annual event, which also is called Bonfire Night, according to\u00a0 an ITV news report . Trump effigies also were scheduled to be torched in Lewes, another English town, The (London) Daily Mail reported. In London, thousands\u00a0of protesters flooded the central part of the city for the annual \"Million Mask March,\" which is held on Guy Fawkes Night. Man near White House with firearm prompts lockdown London police imposed tighter restrictions this year, including a three-hour time limit, after the 2015 event led to violent confrontations and resulted in more than 50 arrests. By late evening local time, police had reported 47\u00a0arrests\u00a0in connection with the march,\u00a0 The (London) Telegraph reported .\u00a0Scotland Yard told The Telegraph that the\u00a0arrests\u00a0included three\u00a0for possession of an offensive weapon,\u00a014\u00a0for drugs and two for the non-removal of a face mask. Fireworks were\u00a0set off in the crowd near the Houses of Parliament and bottles were thrown. The worldwide protest event, which falls on the annual Guy Fawkes Night, is organized by the hacktivist collective Anonymous UK.\u00a0Protests were also planned for New York, Los Angeles, Edinburgh and Brussels. Police warn of violence at London Million Mask March In Edenbridge, the Trump effigy, which features the Republican presidential nominee holding the head of Democratic contender Hillary Clinton,\u00a0beat out other contenders for the ritual burning. \"We are literally helping Trump to live out his own catchphrase, 'Burn it down,' by exploding the effigy as the opening act for our fireworks display,\" Jeni Fox of the Edenbridge Bonfire Society tells ITV.\u00a0\"It only seemed fair that Hillary Clinton took some of the limelight.\" Guy Fawkes Night falls on Nov. 5 and marks the foiling of a plot by a group of Catholics\u00a0to kill\u00a0King James I, a Protestant, in 1605. The plan was to blow\u00a0up the Houses of Parliament\u00a0during its\u00a0state opening. British town will burn 36-foot Donald Trump statue Fawkes, an explosives expert, was found\u00a0beneath\u00a0the building with 36 barrels of gunpowder\u00a0and was sent to the\u00a0Tower of London\u00a0where he was tortured and later died.\u00a0An effigy representing\u00a0him is burned on bonfires around the country on the night of Nov. 5\u00a0to mark\u00a0the events. The \"mask\" refers to the Fawkes mask that many protesters wear that features a goateed figure\u00a0with a moustache, large eyebrows and an upturned smile. On the eve of the event in London,\u00a0Metropolitan police commander B.J. Harrington made it clear authorities would not allow the march to get out of hand this year. Q&A: Remember, remember the fifth of November. Who is Guy Fawkes anyway? \"We saw participants causing criminal damage to public property, smashing the windows of businesses and attacking police officers all whilst harassing and intimidating families as they visited theaters, dined out or shopped in the West End,\" Harrington said of last year's march. \"As we look ahead to this weekend, my message is simple: If you want to protest peacefully, that is your right and we want to work with you,\" he said. \"If you commit criminal acts \u2014 that is not peaceful protest \u2014 and you are liable to be arrested.\" In a sign of the tenor of the planned protest, organizers warned on their\u00a0 Facebook page \u00a0for the event that\u00a0the police \"are not your friends.\" Thousands turn out for Million Mask protest in London \"Keep an eye out for your comrades and police tactics that will limit movement. The hive mind should stay vigilant,\" they said. In a rallying cry, the protest group pointed to what it\u00a0said was government overreach and the violation\u00a0of individual\u00a0rights. \"We have seen the pushes to make the Internet yet another part of the surveillance state. We have seen the government's disregard for migrants, for the poor, the elderly and the disabled. We have seen the capital, profit and greed of the few put before the well-being of the many and we say enough is enough,\" the statement from Anonymous UK said. Contributing: Bill Keveney, USA TODAY.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 5, 2016, 4:05 PM Details about Todd Kohlhepp emerge after captive woman's rescue Email SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- The man accused of chaining a woman in a storage container for weeks had a violent past and was \u201cpreoccupied with sexual content\u201d from a young age, according to details emerging as investigators continued Saturday to search his rural property for bodies. Teams digging on the property found one body Friday and feared there could be more. Todd Kohlhepp Spartanburg County Sheriff Prosecutor Barry Barnette said Kala Brown saw her captor shoot and kill her boyfriend, who went with her for a cleaning job on the suspect\u2019s property. The body discovered Friday was not immediately identified, and Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger said he isn\u2019t sure when that might happen. Brown\u2019s boyfriend was identified as 32-year-old Charles Carver. Police vehicles continued to crisscross the property of Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, a 45-year-old registered sex offender. \u201cThis is a very, very dangerous individual,\u201d the prosecutor said. Kohlhepp, who has a previous kidnapping conviction in Arizona, appeared Friday at a bond hearing in Spartanburg on a kidnapping charge. More charges are expected. The judge did not set bond and instead referred the matter to circuit court. The suspect didn\u2019t appear to have an attorney. Barnette said that in the Arizona case, Kohlhepp kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, bound her and raped her in 1986. Online prison records show he served about 14 years for the felony. He was released in 2001. Records from the Arizona case obtained by WHNS-TV in South Carolina show that a judge decided in 1987 to transfer the case to adult court partly because of Kohlhepp\u2019s aggressive nature. CBS Spartanburg affiliate WSPA-TV reports that in his ruling the judge stated that before Kohlhepp was 9 he was \u201cexplosive\u201d and \u201cpreoccupied with sexual content.\u201d \u201cHe has not changed,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe has been unabatedly aggressive to others and destructive of property since nursery school.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cTwenty-five months of the most intensive and expensive professional intervention, short of God\u2019s, will provide no protection for the public and no rehabilitation of this juvenile.\u201d Kala Brown WSPA In the South Carolina case, the couple disappeared about Aug. 31 when they went to do the work on the suspect\u2019s nearly 100-acre property near Woodruff, said Daniel Herren, a friend who sat with Brown in her hospital room after she was rescued Thursday. \u201cThey were going to do some work, help cleaning up the property. And he pulled out a gun and took them hostage,\u201d Herren said, adding that the abduction happened quickly. Herren said he did not ask Brown if she was sexually assaulted. But she did describe to him the details of her captivity, telling him she was in the container nearly the entire time except for when she was taken out for occasional walks. \u201cHe never took the chain off of her, but he was taking her around, let her get, not so much exercise, but let her walk around some,\u201d Herren said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like it was every day. It was kind of sporadic.\u201d She left the hospital late Thursday and is staying with family, Herren said. The property includes grassy areas, some covered in waist-high weeds, as well as stands of trees. Most or all of it is surrounded by a chain-link fence 6 to 7 feet tall. In the middle was the cargo container, which measured about 30 feet by 15 feet. It was next to a two-car garage that had a living space on top, Barnette said. Guns and a large amount of ammunition were seized from Kohlhepp, the prosecutor said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much he had,\u201d he said, adding that Kohlhepp frequently took target practice in an area near the storage container. Records show Kohlhepp received his South Carolina real-estate license in 2006 before a state law went into effect requiring background checks. A real estate agent who worked at the firm run by Kohlhepp said she had known him for 10 years after they met at a university in the Spartanburg area and were study partners. She said she was in disbelief. \u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of person to do something like this,\u201d Cherry Laurens said by phone. \u201cWorking with him, he was an excellent boss. He stood up for us whenever we needed him.\u201d She said it was widely known that he was registered as a sex offender, but he told people that it was based on trumped-up charges after he \u201chad gone joyriding with a girl\u201d and upset her father. Kohlhepp made frequent online posts about moving around rocks and trimming trees at the rural property, according to the Facebook page that Laurens confirmed was his. He wrote a post about news reports on missing people: \u201creading the news.. this person missing, that person missing, another person missing.. oh wait.. that person just went to beach with friend, other person found with her parole violation boyfriend... in the event I become missing, please note no one would take me. I eat too much and I am crabby...\u201d The post was written about two weeks after the couple disappeared in August. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania needs to do more to show courage than taking one right vote on legislation to expand background checks on firearms purchases. Obama responded Saturday to Toomey's campaign airing a TV ad that shows Obama speaking outside the White House in 2013 and thanking Toomey for his courage, despite the bill's failure. The ad is running in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In a statement to The Associated Press, Obama says courage is telling voters \"where you stand on the tough issues.\" Obama also criticized Toomey for refusing to say whether he'll vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Toomey is working to win over moderate voters in his too-close-to-call race against Democrat Katie McGinty in Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania. \u00a0 See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections.

Parrish and Kirk Brown, Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail 11:46 p.m. EDT November 5, 2016 x Share Todd Kohlhepp, a Moore, South Carolina, resident was arrested on Thursday, after a woman was found chained inside a large storage container on his property in Woodruff, South Carolina. (Nov. 4) AP Law enforcement excavate Todd Christopher Kohlhepp's property Nov. 4. (Photo: Bart Boatwright,) WOODRUFF, S.C. \u2014\u00a0A day after a body was found in a shallow grave on property owned by a local real-estate agent, investigators determined that the remains\u00a0 were the boyfriend of a woman found chained inside a metal storage shed there. The woman, Kala Brown, 30, of Anderson, S.C., had told investigators that she watched Todd Kohlhepp, 45, of Moore, S.C., shoot her boyfriend, Charles David Carver, 32, of Anderson.\u00a0Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger said Saturday night that he's working with an anthropologist to determine how long Carver had been buried. \"We certainly wanted a different outcome than this,\" Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. He declined to go into detail about the ongoing investigation but said more information would be released later. The cause of death, ruled a homicide,\u00a0was multiple gunshot wounds to the upper extremities, Clevenger said. As teen in rape case, newly accused S.C. man described as 'devil on a chain' Earlier Saturday, Carver's mother held out hope that he would be found alive as had his girlfriend of the past few months. \u201cUntil I see a body, I can\u2019t give up,\u201d Joanne Shiflet said. \u201cFor this to be over, I have to see him.\u201d \u201cWe certainly wanted a different outcome than this.\u201d Chuck Wright, Spartanburg County (S.C.) sheriff Solicitor Bary Barnette of South Carolina's 7th Circuit Court said it is likely that Kohlhepp, who is in Spartanburg County Jail on a kidnapping charge and being held without bond, will face at least one murder charge. On Saturday afternoon for about an hour, authorities brought Kohlhepp to the 95-acre tract where Brown was found Thursday chained around her neck and ankles inside a storage shed. It was not immediately known whether Kohlhepp was cooperating with investigators. In 1986, Kohlhepp was charged\u00a0as an adult in the\u00a0rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tempe, Ariz., when he was 15.\u00a0As part of the plea bargain, Kohlhepp's record would reflect he pleaded guilty to kidnapping, and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\u00a0Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender. One neighbor in a 1987 pre-sentencing\u00a0report described him as \u201ca devil on a chain.\u201d Court records state he\u00a0once threatened to kill his mother, used a hammer to destroy his newly remodeled bedroom, poured bleach into a goldfish bowl and locked a boy in a dog cage and rolled him around. On the land near Woodruff, authorities have assembled equipment and vehicles near the back of a clearing on the property to continue their investigation. They fear\u00a0they are dealing with the work of a serial killer. Body found near site where woman was 'chained up like a dog' Wright said they would continue the painstaking process of searching the property for as long as it necessary to find\u00a0answers. A search of 30% to 40% of the site has been completed since Brown was discovered Thursday. Officers have found found numerous weapons and ammunition, and Wright said Brown told them that as many as four bodies could be buried there. Friends and family had reported Brown and Carver missing in early September. Woman \u2014 missing since August \u2014 found alive, chained At the time, the pair had driven from Anderson to the Woodruff site to talk to Kohlhepp about clearing some of the property for him, said Shiflet, Carver's mom. Kohlhepp already employed Brown to clean houses that he readied for sale in his real-estate business. Near the center of the property now are several holes where an excavator had dug up the earth Friday. A beige two-story garage stood nearby. Barnette said investigators found a bed with chains around it in the living space above the garage. Contributing: Anna Lee, The Greenville (S.C.) News. Follow Frances K.

Got it A man was led away by security personnel after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was rushed offstage at a rally on Nov. 5 in Reno, Nev. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) By Jose A. DelReal , Anne Gearan and Ed O'Keefe November 6 at 1:30 AM Follow jdelreal Follow @agearan Follow @edatpost RENO \u2014 Donald Trump was rushed off stage Saturday night during a campaign rally here as security officials swarmed, but the candidate emerged back on stage after a few minutes and finished his speech. The U.S. Secret Service later said in a statement that it took action after \u201can unidentified individual shouted \u2018gun\u2019\u201d in front of the stage. Agents apprehended the person, but found no gun, the statement said, adding that an investigation into the incident continues. The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident, according to reports. He said he was holding a \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d sign. \u201cWhen I pulled out the sign, people around me were trying to grab the sign,\u201d Crites told reporters, according to reports on the local Fox and NBC affiliate websites. \u201cAnd so all that was occurring was booing, of course. That\u2019s what you would expect.\u201d People from the surrounding crowd tackled him, Crites said. They started \u201ckicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me,\u201d Crites said. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Trump concluded his rally without further incident. The GOP presidential nominee later released a statement thanking the Secret Service and local law enforcement for their \u201cfast and professional response,\u201d adding that \u201cnothing will stop us \u2014 we will make America great again!\u201d Meanwhile, a press bus carrying reporters covering Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen Tim Kaine\u2019s stops in Florida was hit at high speed, according to reporters traveling with the senator. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus, according to reporters in his motorcade. Earlier in the day, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign announced she will campaign in Michigan on Monday, as polls show her once-comfortable lead in the state eroding and as Trump eyes it as a potential way to come from behind in the hunt for electoral votes. That announcement from the Clinton campaign came as Trump also rejiggered his itinerary, making plans for last-minute stops in Virginia, where Clinton has led but Republicans are catching up. The GOP nominee spent Saturday hopscotching the country, rallying with supporters in North Carolina , as well as Florida , Colorado and Nevada \u2014 and he announced plans to visit Minnesota , a traditionally Democratic state where polls showing him trailing by about five points. In his speech in Nevada late Saturday, Trump attacked elections officials for allowing a predominantly Hispanic early voting site in the Las Vegas area to stay open for \u201chours and hours.\u201d President Obama will also campaign in Michigan on Monday, suggesting that Democrats see danger signs there. Clinton will be in Grand Rapids, Obama in Ann Arbor. Former president Bill Clinton will make a stop in Lansing on Sunday. [ Clinton maintains narrow four-point edge, pushing past concerns about honesty ] \u201cThere are just three days left in this most consequential election,\u201d Clinton told a cheering crowd of about 10,000 an open-air rally and concert in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Clinton noted the millions of people of have voted early and urged Pennsylvania voters to help \u201csend a message\u201d about American values and ideals. \u201cI believe they are standing up for a hopeful, inclusive vision of America and I\u2019m asking you to stand up for that same vision,\u201d Clinton said. Over the last two weeks much of Clinton\u2019s focus has been on Florida and North Carolina, as well as Nevada, where early voting is now winding down. But her campaign manager Robby Mook, conceded to reporters on Saturday that \u201cwe have seen tightening in the Midwest generally this cycle, and we are taking that seriously.\u201d Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters Saturday that in addition to a previously announced stop in Manchester, N.H., on Sunday night, Clinton will add a rally in Cleveland earlier Sunday. On Monday in addition to Michigan, Clinton will add a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Another large evening rally had also been announced for Philadelphia that night. Palmieri said that Khizr Khan will speak at the New Hampshire rally. Khan is the father of fallen soldier Humayun Khan, whose challenge to Trump over the Republican\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration was among the most memorable moments of the Democratic convention. Trump\u2019s focus on Saturday night was Nevada, where polls show the race tied. Campaigning in Reno, Trump denounced a decision by elections officials to keep open an early voting site \u201cfor hours and hours.\u201d Early voting totals in Clark County, Nev. , which encompasses Las Vegas, topped 57,000, according to local officials. A supermarket doubling as an early-voting site in the county was allowed to stay open for two additional hours on Friday night as thousands of people remained in line to vote. It is customary for state elections officials across the country to authorize keeping a polling site open later if there are long lines at closing time. Regardless, Trump claimed that officials allowed Clinton supporters to \u201cbus and bring Democratic voters in. Folks, it\u2019s a rigged system. It\u2019s a rigged system and we\u2019re going to beat it. We\u2019re going to beat it. I\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s a rigged system.\u201d [ An early sign Trump is being out-organized: A big Democratic advantage in Nevada voting ] Trump continued his emphasis on Clinton\u2019s emails controversy throughout the day Saturday, citing the FBI\u2019s announcement last week that it would revive an inquiry into her use of a private email server at the State Department. In Reno, he said that if Clinton were elected, her presidency would lead to \u201can unprecedented constitutional crisis.\u201d \u201cWe could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt, of course that\u2019s what we have right now under Obama anyway,\u201d he told the crowd in Reno. \u201cWe need a government that can work, and work well from day one for the American people. That would be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a far-reaching criminal investigation.\u201d In the aftermath of the event\u2019s disruption, when security officers removed Trump from the stage and later said they found no weapon, Trump campaign aides and the candidate\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted a supporter who credited Trump for returning to the stage after an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d and noted that Clinton had cut an event short earlier Saturday in Florida because of rain. Trump, Pence and key campaign surrogates also will swing through Virginia this weekend and into Monday. Trump will hold a 10 p.m. rally Sunday at a fairgrounds in the Northern Virginia swing territory of Loudoun County, his campaign announced on Saturday. Pence was scheduled to appear at a suburban Richmond Saturday afternoon and at a rally at George Mason University at 8 p.m. Saturday. Two of Trump\u2019s children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump \u2014 are planning stops in Northern Virginia on Sunday and Monday, respectively. In the closing days of the campaign, polling averages compiled by The Washington Post continue to show a close contest in several battleground states. In Michigan, Clinton now holds just a two-point edge over Trump, 43 to 41 percent. She also holds a slim lead in New Hampshire (43-41), which accounts for the renewed attention there in the closing days. In Colorado, Clinton is up 43 percent to 41 percent. In Arizona, Trump leads by three points (46-43). Clinton is ahead by six points in New Mexico (40-34) and five points in North Carolina (48-43), Pennsylvania (47-42) and Wisconsin (45-40). She\u2019s up by four points in Virginia (45-41). Trump holds a five-point lead in Ohio (46-41), where Clinton held a star-studded campaign rally on Friday night with rapper Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, his wife. The race remains tick-tock tight in Nevada, where the candidates are tied at 44 percent each. In Florida, Clinton has a one-point, 47 to 46 percent advantage. Trump leads in Georgia (47-45); Iowa (46-41); and Utah (35-28) where third-party candidate Evan McMullin has been polling well. Poll averages calculated by The Washington Post for Clinton and Trump reflect recent polls that also include McMullin, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein where they are on the ballot and where results are available. As the race enters its final stretch, the Clinton campaign continues to push back aggressively against the FBI\u2019s decision to revive the inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email. Campaigning in Florida on Saturday, Kaine (D-Va.), the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, sharply criticized the FBI and its director, James Comey, for the development. In an interview with the Fusion television network, Kaine faulted Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election. Comey\u2019s decision to alert Congress about his review of the Clinton case \u201csuggests that it\u2019s probably more likely explained that [Comey] knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve but there were people within the FBI actively working \u2014 actively working \u2014 to try to help the Trump campaign,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cThis just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of [the FBI].\u201d John Wagner, Katie Zezima, Robert Barnes, Sarah Parnass and Sean Sullivan in Washington and Laura Vozzella in Richmond contributed to this report.

    "text": "Democratic Presidential Elector Says He Won't Vote For Hillary Clinton By RYAN STRUYK Nov 4, 2016, 11:30 PM ET 0 Shares Star JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during a Democratic party \"Women Win\" early vote rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Oct. 28, 2016. 0 Shares Email A Democratic presidential elector in Washington state says he will not vote for Hillary Clinton . Former Bernie Sanders delegate Robert Satiacum told ABC News Friday night that the Democratic presidential candidate 's stance on the environment clashed with his Native American heritage. \"I will not vote for Hillary Clinton,\" he told ABC News. \"I will not write her name. I will not. I will not.\" The member of the Puyallup Tribe in the Evergreen State says he believes Clinton lied about using a private email server , calling it a \"heinous act of stupidity.\" \"She has done nothing remarkable as Secretary of State or as the senator of New York,\" he continued. \"She's bought and paid for ... I just can't get behind her. There's no character there.\" He added, \"Maybe I'll vote Mickey Mouse. In all seriousness, maybe I should vote for Bozo the Clown.\" How Much Could This Matter? Satiacum's defection would matter only if Clinton landed at exactly 270 electoral votes on election night -- and Satiacum still went rogue in the face of immense pressure and weeks of unprecedented litigation. This means Clinton would need to win 271 electoral votes -- not the usual 270-vote threshold -- on election night in order to ensure she would formally win the presidency two months later. The news was first reported by the Associated Press. How Does The Electoral College Work? This potential defection prompts technical questions about the obscure process of the Electoral College. When states are projected and electoral votes from each state are assigned on Election Night, the process is not automatic. Actual people called \"electors\" meet nationwide on Dec. 19 to cast ballots for president. The ballots are counted in the Capitol on Jan. 6 -- thus formally and officially electing the president. Electors who do not vote for their state's winner -- dubbed \"faithless electors\" -- are rare, but they do happen. The last faithless elector was in 2004, when an elector voted for John Edwards for president over John Kerry . A faithless elector has never tipped the balance of a U.S. election, and any faithless elector who tried to do so would certainly face immense pressure and litigation. Aren't There Rules That Could Stop A Faithless Elector? It's unclear whether the Washington State Democratic Party has a way to replace Satiacum or stop him from casting a rogue vote. State law requires electors to sign and \"execute\" a pledge that they will vote for their nominee and threatens them with a $1,000 civil fine if they don't. Party rules say party leaders have the authority to fill vacancies caused by \"disqualification.\" Representatives of the Washington State Democratic Party did not respond to requests for comment on Friday night. The electors were chosen at the state party's convention in June. States must settle all disputes over electors by Dec. 13. 0 Shares ",

Steve Helber/AP hide caption toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely (left) and Rolling Stone Deputy Managing Editor Sean Woods (far right) walk with their legal team as they head into federal court Tuesday in Charlottesville, Va. Steve Helber/AP A federal jury has found that Rolling Stone, a reporter and the magazine's publisher are liable in a defamation lawsuit over a retracted article about an alleged rape at the University of Virginia. The trial centered on a November 2014 piece by reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely that told the story of a student, identified as \"Jackie,\" who said she was brutally gang raped at a fraternity party in 2012. The shocking article quickly went viral and opened a national debate about how colleges handle allegations of rape. A U.Va. administrator sued Erdely, the magazine and publisher Wenner Media for $7.85 million over how she was portrayed in the piece. She later reduced that amount to $7.5 million. Shortly after its November 2014 publication, it became apparent that there were significant issues with the story, titled \"A Rape on Campus.\" \"Several outlets, including The Washington Post, identified major inconsistencies in the reporting,\" as The Two-Way has reported . Rolling Stone retracted the piece the following April, \"saying the magazine had relied too much on 'Jackie's' account and did not adequately work to confirm her story.\" Article continues after sponsorship An independent report commissioned by Rolling Stone found \"repeated, fundamental errors in the magazine's reporting and editing process,\" NPR's David Folkenflik reported . \"The thing that most struck us was how avoidable it was and how there were several paths not taken \u2014 paths that you would associate with basic tradecraft, and any one of which might have caused Rolling Stone to pause and go the other way,\" Steve Coll, the author of the 12,000-word report, told David. Nicole Eramo, the former associate dean of students who filed the defamation lawsuit, \"said the article painted her as the 'chief villain' of the story, full of indifference toward a sexual assault allegation,\" as we reported. The trial lasted just over two weeks, and the jury came to its verdict on the third day of deliberations. The jury was asked to assess a series of statements upon which Eramo based her defamation claim \u2014 some from the text of the magazine article and others in comments to journalists after the story was published. For all three defendants, the jury found instances in which the statements were \"actionable\" as defamation and also where they were made \"with actual malice.\" Damages have yet to be assessed, and according to Charlottesville's Daily Progress , the jury will return on Monday to begin that process. After the verdict, Rolling Stone released a statement apologizing to Eramo, the Daily Progress reported: \"In our desire to present this complicated issue from the perspective of a survivor, we overlooked reporting paths and made journalistic mistakes that we are committed to never making again. ... It is our deep hope that our failings do not deflect from the pervasive issues discussed in the piece, and that reporting on sexual assault cases ultimately results in campus policies that better protect our students.\" In addition to Eramo's lawsuit, three U.Va. graduates who belonged to the fraternity cited in the 2014 article also sued for defamation. A judge dismissed that suit because they weren't named in the story. Rolling Stone still faces another defamation suit filed by the fraternity where the alleged rape was said to have taken place.

Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright and county Coroner Rusty Clevenger announced that the body found Friday was Charlie Carver. Clevenger said the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds. Brown, 30, was found chained inside a metal container on property belonging to Todd Kohlhepp, 45, who has been charged with kidnapping and faces a possible murder charge. Brown told investigators that there were as many as four bodies buried on the property and said she witnessed her captor shoot and kill Carver, her boyfriend who went missing with her in August, local prosecutor Barry Barnette said at a bond hearing Friday. Kala Brown and Charlie Carver Finding Kala and Charlie Facebook Page Law enforcement officers were investigating the area on a tip about a sex crime when Brown was found. Wright has warned that the disturbing case may involve the \"work of a serial killer.\" Court records obtained by NBC affiliate WYFF reveal Kohlhepp has a history of abduction and violent behavior Related: Freed Captive Told Police She Witnessed Captor Shoot Boyfriend In 1986, Kohlhepp was 15 when he was sent to prison in Arizona on kidnapping charges after holding a handgun to the head of a 14-year-old girl. Police said he threatened to kill her, tied her up with rope and duct-taped her mouth, and forced her into his home before raping her. Kohlhepp told the victim that if she mentioned the assault to anyone, he would kill her siblings, officials said. Play ",

Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 24 x Share The FBI and NYPD are assessing the credibility of a terror threat against the U.S. on the eve of Election Day. Officials said Friday that they are reviewing the information that mentioned New York, Texas and Virginia as potential targets. (Nov. 4) AP In this Oct. 22, 2016, file photo, a volunteer hands out stickers during early voting in Las Vegas. (Photo: AP Photo/John Locher) 8550 CONNECT TWEET 53 LINKEDIN 24 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Law enforcement officials,\u00a0government\u00a0workers and cyber-security professionals are preparing to swoop in, track and hopefully block anyone attempting a cyberattack aimed at\u00a0destabilizing the U.S. presidential election. The possibility is slight, with risks lessened by the fractured, mostly non-digital  nature of the national voting apparatus. Still, fears that hackers \u2014 perhaps from Russia \u2014 \u00a0could instill\u00a0doubts about the voting process\u00a0via attacks on the Internet infrastructure have put the cyber-security community on guard. In a way, they are girding for\u00a0war,\u00a0but\u00a0the fronts are multiple and\u00a0decentralized. Although many are keeping low profiles, we know about some. \u2022 The Department of Homeland Security has been conducting cyber audits of state and local election systems since August, responding to requests from\u00a046 states and 32 local election officials. \u2022 Indiana is setting up an election cyber-war room. \u2022 In Washington, D.C., and on the ground in 26 states, the non-partisan Election Protection coalition will staff hotlines for voters and have an election geek squad ready for questions from jurisdictions. \u2022 The Election Verification Network has assembled an elite\u00a0\"A-Team\" of cryptographers, analysts and security experts who will make themselves available to any jurisdictions needing help on Election Day and in the vote counts that follow. Not surprisingly, many details of these \"SWAT\"\u00a0teams' plans are kept under wraps. \u201cBest practices for cyber security means we don\u2019t tell people what they are,\u201d said the Pennsylvania secretary of State's press secretary, Wanda Murren. 'Getting twitchy': election threats have cyber experts worried HEIGHTENED CONCERN Federal authorities say the\u00a0decentralized and antiquated nature of the country\u2019s vote tabulation systems would be difficult to penetrate. The worry, instead, is focused on other disruptions. Two federal officials told USA TODAY there is concern systems unrelated to the country's vote-tabulation system\u00a0could be targeted to raise anxiety as voters go to the polls Tuesday. The officials, who are not authorized to comment publicly, said breaches could take the form of what are\u00a0known as distributed\u00a0denial of service (DDoS) attacks, similar to last month\u2019s rolling operation that knocked a number of popular websites offline for hours. There was no specific or credible information, however, that such operations are being planned to disrupt the election. Could the U.S. election be hacked? \"We have these concerns around every election, but I have to say that I think there is more of a concern this time than I've seen in the past,\" California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN. Of the cyber threat posed by Russia, Schiff said that the Russian government had \u201cprepared the field if they wanted to escalate.\" PREPARING FOR THE WORST, HOPING FOR THE BEST It's those concerns that have created an unprecedented level of preparation, both by government and civil society groups. The Department of Homeland Security is working with state and local election officials to protect against cyber vulnerabilities, Secretary of Homeland Security\u00a0Jeh Johnson\u00a0said in a recent interview. The cyber scans found some vulnerabilities, \u201can open door here or there, which are being addressed after doing these assessments,\u201d he said. Some states have received a more in-depth, on-site assessment from Homeland Security. \"There are fewer states that have gone to that extent. And I would expect and hope and expect that after the election more would do the same thing,\" Johnson said. Pennsylvania is one of the states that took advantage of the federal security check, which found its safety security measures were working well. In Indiana, a public-private partnership of\u00a0cyber-security\u00a0experts from local universities, the state\u2019s cyber-security firms and state government and law enforcement\u00a0has come together to support the state should anything occur. A\u00a0\u201cwar room\u201d will be set up at the security operations center of Rook Security in Indianapolis, where the group\u2019s 30 or so members will spend Election Day, said Rook CEO J.J. Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019ll be available in real time, so the fastest possible remediation can take place,\u201d he said. Doug Rapp,\u00a0an adviser\u00a0for cybersecurity and national security initiatives for the Indiana Secretary of Commerce, will be among those in the war room on Tuesday. The level of collaboration between the public and private sector on this issue is something that stands out about Indiana, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a collective risk that requires a collective response,\u201d he said. CRYPTOGRAPHERS AND HACKERS If all else fails, a\u00a0rapid-response team\u00a0composed of some of the best-known names in cyber security, cryptography and computer network security will stand at the\u00a0ready beginning on Tuesday to assist authorities if cyber issues arise during or after the election. The group is spread out across the country and represents multiple disciplines and some of the top names in the admittedly obscure field of election cyber verification and security. Among others, the group includes Andrew Appel, a Princeton University computer scientist known for his work on how voting machines can be hacked; Josh Benoloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft\u00a0Research;\u00a0\u00a0Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer scientist for whom the \"Hursti Hack\" of voting machines was named; Walter Mebane, a University of Michigan\u00a0\u00a0expert on detecting electoral fraud;\u00a0and Ron Rivest, an MIT professor\u00a0and the R in RSA, a ground-breaking cryptographic algorithm. INFORMATION OUTREACH Reaching out to voters, Election Protection , a non-partisan coalition with more than 100 local, state and national partners, will staff a multilingual hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE, beginning Monday night to track issues and aid voters. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re likely to hear very quickly if a cyber problem occurs\u00a0because we\u2019ll be getting calls from around the country,\u201d said Marcia Johnson-Blanco,\u00a0co-director of the Lawyers' Committee's Voting Rights Project, a member of the coalition. The group will alert officials if calls begin to come from any one area that could potentially indicate a problem. Should Internet access go down making it hard for voters to find their polling places, its hotline will be a source available with information nationally\u00a0in English, Spanish, multiple Asian languages and Arabic. 8550 CONNECT TWEET 53 LINKEDIN 24 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f4OPFy ",

Hern\u00e1ndez , Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Marc Fisher November 5 at 2:57 PM Follow @arelisrhdz Follow @myhlee Follow @mffisher A flag hangs at the Chizvachon Restaurant, where many politicians stop, a day before the New Hampshire primary in Manchester, N.H., in early February. In the final hours before the vote, Americans remain bullish about their prospects. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) At long last, Americans get to decide. More than usual, most people don\u2019t like their choices. More than usual, many Americans believe that people who don\u2019t agree with them are not only wrong but are also best avoided. On the eve of the election, America is afraid. People talk about buying guns to protect themselves from troubles to come. They talk about places they steer clear of and people they don\u2019t talk to anymore. Casual conversations have blown up into hurtful arguments. Friends vanish from Facebook feeds. People who used to put up yard signs don\u2019t for fear of what their neighbors might do. And people who thought things were improving, in their own lives and in their communities, wonder whether they missed the real story, a darker tale of division and despair. But America is also what it\u2019s always been, a green field of possibility, a place where people relish rogues and truth-tellers, and a place where being appalled by politicians is part of the deal, something that can even bring people together. Only eight years after millions of Americans poured into the streets in spontaneous, joyful celebration of the election of the nation\u2019s first black president, optimism seems to have been sucked out of the country\u2019s marrow, replaced by a heavy anxiety, a sense that things aren\u2019t right and can\u2019t easily be fixed. The candidates for president have made it harder to be optimistic, many Americans say. One candidate said things were so bad that only he could make America great again. The other asked people to consider that the country would be stronger together. But neither captured the hearts or hopes of any broad cross-section of the people. Neither offered any grand idea for a more secure, happier future. There was no New Deal, no Great Society, no Thousand Points of Light. Yet in the final hours before the vote, Americans remain bullish about their prospects, eager to keep plugging, for themselves and their children. In interviews across the country, whether they\u2019re voting for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, anyone but them or no one at all, Americans almost uniformly say that the politicians are clueless but that the people will eventually do what needs getting done. *** On the eve of the election, America is deeply polarized, heavy with anxiety and distrustful of the other side. And although many are appalled by today\u2019s dark politics, they are taking comfort in a bedrock of American exceptionalism: its people. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Melinda Powers opens the heavy door of the industrial oven and carefully removes a fragrant, steaming apple crisp. She inspects it meticulously. At 19, she dreams of opening a bakery. She worries that this election is her obstacle. To get from the culinary studies program at Newbury College in Brookline, Mass., to a business of her own, Powers expects she\u2019ll need her parents\u2019 help. But they\u2019re fighting over politics right now, and it\u2019s bad enough that Powers could see them breaking up, which would probably nix her bakery plan. Powers\u2019s parents met at Winchester Repeating Arms \u2014 an Irish American guy who produced gun parts and an immigrant woman from Cape Verde who inspected guns. They fell in love on the shop floor. But the election has driven a wedge between them. He\u2019s for Trump; she\u2019s for Clinton. \u201cMy dad jokingly brings it up all the time,\u201d Powers said, \u201cbut my mom doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny at all. Trump offends everything she\u2019s ever worked for.\u201d Powers\u2019s mother is so disturbed by the racism and anti-immigrant sentiment she\u2019s seen this year that she sometimes threatens to move back to Cape Verde if Trump wins. \u201cMy dad obviously doesn\u2019t want to leave his Harley-Davidson buddies behind and move to a foreign country where he doesn\u2019t speak the language,\u201d his daughter said. The campaign has also divided Powers from her old friends from Blue Hill Regional Technical High School in Randolph. Most of those friends are white, and all but one support Trump. \u201cMy white friends think they can say racial stuff more than they used to,\u201d Powers said. \u201cThey use the n-word a lot more now. . . . There is more hate directed toward other races and toward immigrants.\u201d Powers is still an optimist; no matter who wins, she will work hard to achieve her dreams. She says she still believes America is the greatest country. But she\u2019d thought the battles over racism \u201cwere fought for me long ago,\u201d and now she sees a hate that masquerades as humor. \u201cWe can be driving somewhere,\u201d she said, \u201cand they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Melinda, sit in the back.\u2019 Then they\u2019ll laugh. After a while, you do feel slightly left out, because at the end of the day, we are not all the same. I am the different one.\u201d *** In interviews across the country, Americans almost uniformly say the politicians are clueless but the people will eventually do what needs to be done. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Optimism, perhaps the most exceptional of American traits, is down. A Washington Post-ABC News poll found earlier in the fall campaign that 42\u00a0percent of Americans were bullish about the next year, the lowest number since 2004, the first national election after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Yet here was Sheila Rushing, 67, knocking on doors, even on doors of houses that looked empty, with boards slanting over the windows. Rushing had avoided politics for years, a job requirement: The work that got her through divorce, at the Detroit museum of African American history, was a nonprofit, limiting her political activity. But when she retired, she canvassed for the first black president and now for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d she said. \u201cGlad and blessed. Glad that the Lord woke me up.\u201d Rushing, like many Detroiters, was offended when Trump declared that black Americans were living in \u201chell.\u201d The past eight years were no hell. She had raised her grandson, Armando, after his father died when the boy was 14. He turned 26 on Halloween, and Rushing had helped him through high school and on to Wayne State University to get his degree in criminal justice. And now he\u2019s working. Rushing took pride in her own ability to pay off her home note, and she thanked Obama for the bigger Pell grants that got Armando through school. Rushing learned this fall not to broach the subject of politics with some friends. It was too raw. Still, she knocked on another door. The home was empty but not abandoned. She left a flier with a picture of Clinton and Obama deep in conversation in the Oval Office. \u201cProtect his legacy,\u201d it read. *** Passions are running sky high in this high-stakes election. Friendships have been lost. Marriages have been tested. Facebook friends unfriended. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton has captured the hearts or hopes of any broad cross-section of the people. Neither offered any grand idea for a more secure, happier future. There was no New Deal, no Great Society, no Thousand Points of Light. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Nearly half of Americans \u2014 45\u00a0percent in a Post-ABC poll in September \u2014 believe the United States is \u201cless great\u201d than it has been in the past; 37\u00a0percent said it is about the same; and 16\u00a0percent said it is greater. The idea that the country has grown less great is much more common among Trump supporters (77\u00a0percent) than among Clinton backers (21\u00a0percent). Through the years, pessimism about the country\u2019s direction has been stronger among supporters of the party that\u2019s out of power. In 2008, as the economy weakened and the war in Iraq dragged on, an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that 77\u00a0percent of Obama supporters said the nation was in a \u201cstate of decline,\u201d compared with 57\u00a0percent of those backing the Republican, John McCain. Tony Kadlcek first came to the United States from Czechoslovakia in 1990, soon after the revolution against his country\u2019s communist regime. His uncle invited him to visit, and while in Chicago, Kadlcek met the woman who would become his wife. The next year, Kadlcek legally migrated to the United States to be with her. He got a job with the commercial HVAC business that his wife\u2019s family owned. He still works there. But 12 years ago, the couple moved farther from Chicago, to Lisle, a suburb to the city\u2019s southwest, because of corruption and crime, he said. Now he drives through Chicago, sees dilapidated buildings and worries about crime. \u201cThere were 17\u00a0murders\u201d over one October weekend, he said. \u201cObama promised to be a uniter, but it seems like he divided us. People hate cops; blacks and whites seem more separate now.\u201d Kadlcek, 47, likes his life; he has four kids, makes a good living and owns his own home as well as a six-apartment building that he rents out. But the building\u2019s value has not recovered since the economic crisis, and he partly blames Obama. He and his wife, a legal secretary, are fed up with high taxes, debt, corruption and illegal immigration. When their kids go to college, they might move to Wisconsin or Indiana. Frustrated about what\u2019s happened to the country, he worries about a crackdown on guns; he recently bought an \u00ad\u201cexpensive rifle, so that if Hillary wins I\u2019ll be grandfathered in.\u201d He likes Trump\u2019s slogan, Make America Great Again, because it admits the country has gone downhill. But Kadlcek isn\u2019t advertising his support for Trump. In years past, he put bumper stickers on his Cutlass Supreme, going back to Dole-Kemp in 1996. Not this time: \u201cPeople are afraid if you have a Trump sticker on your car or a Hillary sticker, someone will key it.\u201d *** Food carts can be seen in every part of New York City. The mobile carts are a common way that some new immigrants get their start in business in the United States. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Most folks put aside their differences of race attitudes and political leanings to root for the home team during the Friday night football games. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Mae and Daniel Harrison are riveted to the campaign news \u2014 well, she is. He can take only so much. Both of them have seen the campaign eat away at relationships. They\u2019ve argued with fellow shoppers in grocery lines. They avoid Trump supporters. And for the first time in many years, they\u2019ve felt unwelcome in some places. \u201cWe are fearful of going too far away from home because of what we see,\u201d Mae said. The campaign is all the 74-year-old retired United Methodist pastor talks about these days. When her girlfriends call, she can\u2019t help but get into the emails. After a pastor friend from Texas phoned and declared she\u2019d be voting for Trump, Harrison held her tongue. She hasn\u2019t called back. Not until after the election. The Harrisons, who live in Fort Washington in Prince George\u2019s County, Md., read the paper, then have the TV on much of the day, CNN and MSNBC mostly. It\u2019s Trump and Clinton, and Trump, and Trump. Mae listens as she flits about the house. Daniel sometimes rebels. \u201cCut that off, Mae,\u201d he tells his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of his voice.\u201d Watch Netflix instead, he says. Sometimes, she does. But come 6\u00a0p.m., the temptation is too much, and she puts the news back on. Daniel gives up and goes upstairs to the computer or to watch a game show. Daniel, 78, a retired microbiologist, grew up in Louisiana. Mae, a former teacher, came from North Carolina. For two accomplished African Americans from the South, Trump has unearthed a past they thought they had left behind when they moved to a prosperous, majority-black county in the shadow of Washington. Now, the name-calling and bullying of the campaign has them wondering whether the old hatreds had only gone dormant. At a restaurant in Virginia, a group of bikers stared them down. At the supermarket, Daniel argued with a man who couldn\u2019t see how Trump was bringing out hatred. At a church event, Mae sat well away from a black woman who said supportive things about Trump. She can\u2019t stop thinking, even if Clinton wins, what will the backlash look like? How long does this last? When does the healing begin? *** A crowd in Ohio listens to Hillary Clinton in Columbus, Ohio, in late July. In interviews across the country, underneath all our divisiveness lies a dogged faith in the unique excellence of the American people, which \u2014 despite our disappointment in politics \u2014 nourishes hope for the healing to come. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Healing is normally the last thing Brent Beaupre thinks about around the family campfire in Kennebunk, Maine. On sweet summer nights, with three generations gathered, all should be copacetic. But one night this summer, Beaupre\u2019s grandmother turned to him and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to vote for her, are you?\u201d \u201cOh, but I am,\u201d Beaupre said. He tried to explain himself. And then his grandmother turned to him again and said, \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to vote for her, are you?\u201d They went at it. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how crazy he is?\u201d Beaupre said. \u201cYeah, but she\u2019s the biggest criminal ever,\u201d his grandmother replied. \u201cIt\u2019s like talking to a wall,\u201d Beaupre said. \u201cI love these people to death, but there\u2019s nothing that permeates.\u201d He\u2019s 21, and this will be his first vote, and what he sees is utter alienation of each side from the other. \u201cWith the Romney-Obama cycle, you had two incredible intellects who very much knew their subjects,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about the defense of our country. It was about the national deficit \u2014 real topics. I feel in this election cycle it\u2019s about sensationalism, whatever grabs the media.\u201d With his stylish leather shoes and blue Oxford shirt, Beaupre moves with professional efficiency through the sea of denim and sweatshirts on the campus of Suffolk University in Boston. An honors student with a major in finance and a minor in big data, he has been offered a job upon graduation with a major bank. \u201cI\u2019m a gay man who wants to work in financial services who comes from a conservative household and now lives in a very liberal city,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant back and forth.\u201d The first in his family to attend college, he\u2019s nonetheless worried about the future. \u201cMy friends entering the industry have been told point-blank that we should be wary of the economic situation we\u2019re in,\u201d Beaupre said. \u201cIf the economy doesn\u2019t do well, our jobs are going to disappear. Everybody\u2019s waiting for this election; everything is on hold.\u201d *** A coal train runs parallel to the road in the heart of coal country. Coal mine jobs are down in West Virginia and many local miners are not fans of Hillary Clinton as they perceive her to be anti-coal industry. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) A sign in front of a local bar reminds people to vote or give up the right to complain. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Business is good for Ryan Snyder. Life is good, too, even if good does mean 12-hour workdays, seven days a week. Snyder, 33, puts those hours into a little country breakfast-and-lunch spot in Goochland, Va. He bought Satterwhite\u2019s Restaurant from his father in January. The place sits at a rural crossroads that\u2019s unlikely to stay rural. Four miles away, the Richmond suburbs stretch out \u2014 a Whole Foods, a glitzy mall, and, if electric car guru Elon Musk gets his way with state officials, soon a showroom for six-figure Teslas. For now, Satterwhite\u2019s sticks to what it has always been. The menu sticks to old favorites, such as salt herring with biscuits or toast for $7.85. Snyder thinks about adding a few items. Nothing fancy. \u201cIf it\u2019s not broke,\u201d he figures, \u201cdon\u2019t fix it.\u201d He does think Washington is broken. Congress can\u2019t get anything done, and the federal government \u201cgets too involved in a lot of things.\u201d And now this unacceptable choice. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard anyone say, \u2018I like Hillary\u2019 or \u2018I like Trump,\u2019 \u201d Snyder said. He \u201ccan\u2019t stand Hillary. I think she\u2019s a liar,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Trump is Trump. You can\u2019t go to world leaders and just run your mouth.\u201d He won\u2019t vote for Clinton. Maybe Trump or Gary Johnson, though he knows the Libertarian Party nominee has no chance. Snyder and his wife have stopped talking about the election; Brittany thinks Trump is a misogynist. Ryan doesn\u2019t disagree; he just mistrusts Clinton more. He expects little from whoever wins. But he remains upbeat about his own prospects. He and Brittany expect their first child in February. In September, they bought their first house, a brick rancher near a big dairy farm, 10\u00a0minutes from work. Things look good outside the restaurant, too. New shopping centers, office parks and housing have gobbled up farmland and attracted more diverse residents. A Hindu cultural center and temple popped up about a mile away. Some Satterwhite\u2019s regulars grumble about the new development, but Snyder likes it fine: \u201cIt\u2019ll do nothing but increase my business.\u201d New development means new people, some of them new to America. Snyder is concerned about terrorists, but he doesn\u2019t think it makes sense morally or economically to turn everyone away. He figures the people at the new Hindu center are \u201ceducated and ready to work,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you turn that away? We\u2019re all immigrants in this country, so you can\u2019t shut the borders down.\u201d *** For many Americans, this election is about our very way of life and who we are as a people. Many Clinton supporters are disturbed by what they see as racism and anti-immigrant sentiment from Trump, and many Trump supporters view Clinton as \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cconniving.\u201d Nearly half of Americans \u2014 45\u00a0percent in a Washington Post poll in September \u2014 believe the United States is \u201cless great\u201d than it\u2019s been in the past. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) For many immigrants, there is a special urgency to this election, because of Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric about keeping out Mexicans and Muslims, and because there have been so many deportations, with the prospect of many more. As the sun set Wednesday night, Rosa Rosales walked the bridge from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso eating from a cup of corn and chilis. She paid her 50\u00a0cents to reenter the United States, and she was home, where she is a citizen. She had gone across the border to get her medicine. The politicians fight forever about immigration, and Rosales walks the bridge. They fight forever about health care, and Rosales walks the bridge. A home care nurse, she has no use for Trump or Clinton. She voted early, writing in her senator, Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), mostly because he agreed with her that Obamacare is no good. Too expensive, and it\u2019s wrong to punish people who lack insurance, she said. She supported Obama eight years ago, but when she needs simple care, she crosses the border. If she has something big, like the kidney stone that bedeviled her a few years back, she stays in Texas. She fears Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a racist; he\u2019s rude,\u201d Rosales said. \u201cHe has a lack of respect for women. I\u2019m a Mexican, and I think he will do something against Mexican people.\u201d Rosales crossed the marker between the United States and Mexico and let out a little cheer. She had her dinner and her medicine, and she was okay. Halfway across the southern edge of the country, Rafael Marin is secretly obsessed with the election. Patrons come into his downtown Miami shop, Richard\u2019s Fruit Center, for fresh fruit and smoothies. Marin, 59, plays \u201980s pop on the radio \u2014 no political talk shows. He likes to keep the vibe cheerful and positive. In the city\u2019s busy working-class hub, people hang out drinking Cuban coffee, arguing about the election. But in Marin\u2019s shop, he tries to keep things peaceful. He hears \u201cUgh, those emails?\u201d and he pivots to \u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d The rest of the country could learn a lot from downtown Miami, he said: \u201cWe all live together, and our language is a mixed language \u2014 Spanish, English, all used together . . . a beautiful thing.\u201d Son of a Puerto Rican father and a Jewish mother, Marin lives in a city where nearly everyone is an immigrant of some sort, coming here from somewhere else. So Marin doesn\u2019t get Trump, doesn\u2019t want America to be seen as unwelcoming. Marin likes Clinton, marvels at her ability to withstand attacks and investigations. Whatever happens, he said: \u201cAmerica will be fine; it rises and it falls like the waves. We owe some money, so what? Our credit is good, and we get to live here, in America.\u201d A customer asks in Spanish whether raspberries, pineapple and ginger make a good smoothie. Marin nods in approval. Any blend is a good blend. A thousand miles to the north, in Barstow, Va., Lynda Trinh Frank recalled the night four decades ago when her family left Saigon and piled into a lifeboat. Frank\u2019s mother lined up her six kids and told them they could each take one bag. Frank packed her toothbrush, pajamas and Smurf comic books. Six years later, after time in a refu\u00adgee camp in Arkansas, her family was naturalized and living in Richmond, and Frank renamed herself after Lynda Carter, TV\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Now 50, Frank wonders whether her five half-Vietnamese, half-Caucasian children \u201cwill have the same country that we hoped to live in when we came here.\u201d She left her job as a telecom consultant with a six-figure salary to be a full-time mom. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said. \u201cI help shape my children.\u201d Her kitchen is decorated with children\u2019s artwork, Bible verses, and portraits of saints and Jesus. Frank has instilled antiabortion values in her children from early on. Her youngest daughter, staying home from parochial school with a broken arm, whines; her arm itches and she\u2019s bored. \u201cCould you offer your suffering for the babies?\u201d Frank asks. \u201cSo they won\u2019t get killed, Mom?\u201d the 7-year-old replies. \u201cExactly,\u201d Frank says. She wants leaders who will reject abortion and lower taxes. She has helped put up Trump-Pence signs. She likes Trump\u2019s hard stance against illegal immigration and applauds his evolution into antiabortion beliefs. She worries that America no longer reflects her family\u2019s values. \u201cThe last eight years, instead of empowering people, it\u2019s \u2018gimme, gimme, gimme,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cEverything is a race issue. Look, I\u2019m an Asian. I\u2019m ethnic. I\u2019m a minority. I don\u2019t say, \u2018You need to give me a job because I\u2019m Asian and a woman.\u2019 No.\u201d *** A barber ship displays a sign in support of Donald Trump. Some Americans worry that the country no longer reflects their values. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Carol Blaser sits in her Ford Mustang in the lot outside the hair salon where she works in Ann Arbor, Mich. She downs a \u00adMcDonald\u2019s cheeseburger, worrying not about the election, but about her son, about his illness \u2014 one that, as she said, \u201cnobody runs a 5k for.\u201d Her adult son is mentally ill, in and out of the justice system, 31 now, doing better with good medication. But she frets about him when her clients go on like the talking heads on cable news, yammering about \u201clow-information voters\u201d and \u201cthe Paul Ryan effect.\u201d Earlier that day, while cutting the hair of a homebound customer at his townhouse, the man\u2019s wife came into the living room to demonstrate their lifelong Democratic support by showing off a vintage 1990s T-shirt that read, \u201cSupport Hillary\u2019s Husband.\u201d \u201cI wish I was that sure,\u201d Blaser, 58, said later. \u201cOne day I wake up and think I\u2019m going to vote one way; one day I wake up and think I\u2019m going to vote another.\u201d Blaser hasn\u2019t spent the past year glued to the TV and Facebook following the twists and turns. She\u2019s been too busy with life. Two of her kids got married. Her daughter came out as a lesbian. Her 30-year-old\u2019s three kids had birthdays in October. And she\u2019s leaving Delia\u2019s Salon, where she has rented a chair for 16\u00a0years, because Delia raised the rent by $30, to $230 a week. Her neighborhood is dotted with Trump-Pence yard signs, and she considers herself conservative, but she voted for Obama twice after going for Republicans Bob Dole and George W. Bush. From what she can glean, Trump is an \u201cidiot about a lot of things,\u201d but Clinton is \u201ca conniving little b---h.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m leaning towards Hillary just because she\u2019s the least evil, but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s evil or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know! Do any of us really know what goes on, what they go through?\u201d Her absentee ballot sits on her counter, \u201cand I keep walking by it and looking at it. I want to fill it out and get it away from me, but I don\u2019t know what to do. This damn election.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez reported from Prince George\u2019s County, Md.

It is a woman who never asked for this platform using it to say what she thinks.\u201d Photo 2007: Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, formally announces that he will run for president in 2008. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Mrs. Obama, 52, is no stranger to speaking her mind. A Princeton- and Harvard-educated lawyer who was forced to give up her career as a hospital executive with a $250,000-plus salary when Mr. Obama won the presidency, she nevertheless set about conforming to the traditional job of first lady. As the first black woman in the role, she was well aware from the start that there would be little margin for error. She declared herself the \u201c mom in chief .\u201d She took on unassailable causes like healthy eating, exercise and military families. Despite the couture she wore to state dinners and the glamorous White House parties she threw with guests like Beyonc\u00e9, Mrs. Obama cultivated an unpretentious image by dispensing hugs rather than handshakes and kicking off her shoes to dance with local children on official trips abroad. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inside the White House, the image is different: Mrs. Obama has come to be adored but feared in the East Wing as a tough and exacting boss who has little patience for mistakes, improvisation and wasted time. But her discipline and intensity have paid off in her success as first lady, staff members say. The discipline extends to her daughters, who have been required to play a sport of their mother\u2019s choosing in addition to one of their own and are barred from television or computer entertainment on school nights. Mrs. Obama has worked only two to three days a week to allow her to spend time with them and only participates in activities she regards as \u201cvalue added.\u201d She rarely grants an interview unless she thinks there is a compelling reason, such as a link to one of her initiatives. She declined to be interviewed for this article. \u201cWe should do things that matter to us and matter to the country, but we don\u2019t have to do everything,\u201d Mrs. Obama told her staff shortly after her husband\u2019s election. That rarely included campaign politics. Until now. \u201cShe\u2019s gained confidence,\u201d said Melissa Winter, her deputy chief of staff, who joined Mrs. Obama\u2019s team in 2007. \u201cI think she ultimately enjoys it more than she thought she might.\u201d When in 2003, State Senator Barack Obama of Illinois announced his campaign for the United States Senate at a news conference in a Chicago hotel, Mrs. Obama did not attend. When he weighed a run for the White House four years later, she resisted. Once she finally gave her consent, she was parsimonious in her time on the campaign trail. Ms. Winter, who had just gone to work for Mrs. Obama, remembers it well. \u201cWhen I first started, she said, \u2018I\u2019ll campaign two days a week, and I\u2019m not going to work on the weekends, because I\u2019ll be with the kids,\u2019\u201d Ms. Winter said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I moved to Chicago for this?\u2019 Politics is not her thing.\u201d Her daughters, Malia, 17, and Sasha, 15, who were in elementary school when their father won the White House, were only part of the reason. \u201cMichelle once explained to me, \u2018I try to organize my life not to have a lot of mess around, and politics is just a big mess,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said last month on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night comedy show. Continue reading the main story Photo 2009: The Obamas walk the parade route down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times But this election, aides say, forced a decision by Mrs. Obama to wade into the muck. In September, while Mr. Trump was in a fight with a former Miss Universe he called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and an \u201ceating machine,\u201d Mrs. Obama sat down with her staff and began writing a campaign speech focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe more we talked about it, she felt that the debate had become so base that, when it\u2019s time to cover your kids\u2019 ears, it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d Ms. Winter said. \u201cIt was time to speak out.\u201d As Mrs. Obama was putting the finishing touches on the speech, an 11-year-old tape surfaced in which Mr. Trump boasted of grabbing women by their genitals without consent. The result was a takedown of Mr. Trump that Mrs. Obama delivered in October in New Hampshire, where her voice trembled with emotion as she confided that the misogynistic tenor of the presidential race had \u201cshaken me to my core.\u201d \u201cNow is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has got to stop. Right now.\u201d The following week, charged up in her new role, Mrs. Obama drew a crowd of 7,000 in Phoenix. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m asking,\u201d she said , imploring. \u201cDon\u2019t just tweet about my speech last week. If you liked that speech, then go vote. If you want to stand up for yourself and your fellow Americans, then go vote. If you want to get Hillary elected, vote. Vote early! Vote right now!\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s political advisers have long regarded his wife as a potent weapon. Their nickname for her in his 2008 campaign was \u201cthe closer.\u201d Back then, with Mr. Obama engaged in a bitter Democratic primary against Mrs. Clinton, his aides noticed that Mrs. Obama\u2019s so-called conversion rate \u2014 the ratio of voters who registered or signed up to volunteer or otherwise help the campaign after she made an appeal \u2014 was exceptionally high. In part, that is because Mrs. Obama makes a point of telling voters what she expects them to do, like a mother ordering her children to do their homework. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass me, y\u2019all,\u201d she told voters in Charlotte, N.C., in early October, warning them that she demands the statistics after each campaign stop on how many people registered to vote or signed up to volunteer. Still, Mrs. Obama knows all too well the darker side of putting herself out in the political arena. In 2008, she was criticized as angry and unpatriotic after a comment at a rally in Wisconsin about the unexpected success of her husband\u2019s campaign. \u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d she said, in remarks that haunted her throughout the campaign. \u201cFor the first time in my adult lifetime, I\u2019m really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change.\u201d Photo 2016: The first lady has emerged this fall as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most popular surrogate. Credit Jim Cole/Associated Press Conservatives who had been pushing racially tinged criticism of Mr. Obama, suggesting that he had been born in Kenya and portraying him as a radical liberal, turned their fire on his wife. A worried Mrs. Obama, who was furious about the racist rumors of her husband, told aides that she might be hurting her husband\u2019s chances, and wondered whether she had been wrong to swallow her misgivings and plunge into the campaign. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t accustomed to this, and she wasn\u2019t used to the criticism, and she became a lightning rod early on in the presidential race,\u201d said David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s closest advisers at the time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like she was demanding to be out on the campaign trail. We asked her to be out there. And oftentimes, we threw her out there without adequate preparation or staffing.\u201d Mrs. Obama was livid when a New Yorker magazine cover cartoon in July 2008 pictured her wearing fatigues, combat boots and an Afro and toting a machine gun, fist-bumping with her husband, who was dressed in Middle Eastern garb and a head scarf. The couple was in the Oval Office, where an American flag burned in the fire place. First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more. Buzz60 \"Our findings support that menopause has a negative effect on sexual functioning in many women.\" (Photo: Getty Images/absolutimages) (NEWSER) \u2013 Sex is important to most middle-aged women, a fact established by a new study in the journal Menopause, which found that 75% of 1,390 middle-aged women reported sexual functioning to be moderately to extremely important. But roughly 20 months before menopause hit, these women reported a \"notable decline in sexual function\"; that decline continued for a full year after their final period and then persisted at a more gradual rate over the next five years, reports Psych Central . The same turned out to be true for women following (but not leading up to) a hysterectomy. \"There has been much debate\" on the topic of decline due to menopause and aging, the study's lead author says. \"Our findings support that menopause has a negative effect.\" It's worth noting that the study relies on self-reporting, but the researchers say they found that race/ethnicity appears to play a role. Compared to white women, African-American women noted a significantly smaller decline, while women of Japanese descent noted a much greater decline. \"This study highlights the need for health-care providers to have open conversations with their patients about their sexual issues, because there are many options for women to help maintain or improve their sexual lives as they transition to and beyond menopause,\" one expert tells HealthDay . Common issues known to accompany menopause, such as vaginal dryness, depression, and anxiety, didn't explain the impact on drive, the researchers say. ( Is menopause reversible ?) More from Newser ",

Joshua Gonzalez, left, confronts Trump supporter Jake Towe, right, outside the Anaheim Convention Center during a Trump rally. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Steve Lopez Contact Reporter Almost. We don\u2019t know what awaits us  Wednesday morning and beyond. But we know that the most hostile, vulgar, sensational, depressing, divisive, racially charged and\u00a0humiliating mud bath many of us have ever witnessed is about to leave a permanent stain on the history books. The next president of the United States of America will either be someone under a constant cloud of inquiry or someone who, during nationally televised debate spectacles, boasted about the size of his manhood and said he doesn\u2019t pay taxes because he\u2019s smart. It\u2019ll be a woman, or it\u2019ll be a man who has bragged about groping women. Civility has been hit by a truck. A child at a Trump rally yelled \u201ctake the bitch down!\u201d when Trump mentioned Clinton. In a dangerous world with complicated challenges, substantive debate has been virtually nonexistent, and constant cable coverage has illuminated nothing but our inability to look away from a spectacular wreck. And let\u2019s be fair. It\u2019s not just the presidential election that hangs over the republic like a toxic cloud. Money is poison, and there\u2019s hemlock everywhere you look, thanks in part to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s support for the unlimited corrupting influence of cash. California\u2019s billion and one ballot measures float on a rising tide of greenbacks. A crack team of muckraking L.A. Times reporters \u2014 or scum of the earth, as Trump calls journalists \u2014 has just exposed what smells like a monstrous pay-to-play operation in Los Angeles. And no one\u00a0is particularly surprised, because Chinatown is everywhere you look. In the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been clipping headlines and circling statistics that jumped out at me for one reason or another.\u00a0I\u2019d like to borrow from the Harper\u2019s magazine model and share some of them with you. Here now, my Democracy in Action index: * Amount of money spent on California ballot measures this campaign season: Nearly half a billion dollars, a record. * Amount spent by pharmaceutical companies on Proposition\u00a061, which would cap what the state pays for prescription drugs: $126 million. * Amount spent by tobacco companies to oppose Proposition\u00a056, a proposal to add a $2 tax increase to the price of a pack of cigarettes: $55 million. * Amount of National Rifle Assn.\u00a0spending on presidential and Senate races: a record $36 million, including $21 million to aid Donald Trump and $12.6 million to attack Hillary Clinton. * Number of gun violence deaths so far this year in the U.S:\u00a012,416, including 2,632 teenagers and 568 children 11 and under. * Biggest spender on California legislative races by outside (independent expenditure groups): $17 million by charter school proponents. * Annual shortfall of money needed to repair the nation\u2019s deteriorating schools: $46 billion. * Number of times Clinton and Trump were asked questions about education policy in three nationally televised debates: 0. * Dollar amount of donations between 2008 and 2013 from people with a link to the developer of a $72-million housing development near the Port of Los Angeles: More than $600,000. * Number of such donors who told Times reporters David\u00a0Zahniser and Emily Alpert Reyes they did not write checks or could not remember doing so: 11. * Percentage of voters who say this presidential election is more important than most: 71%. * Unfavorable rating for Trump in latest Gallup poll: 63%. * Unfavorable rating for Clinton in latest Gallup poll: 55%. * Melania Trump \u2019s plea for more civility online: \u201cOur culture has become too mean and too rough.\u201d * Number of people, places and things insulted by Donald Trump in Tweets, according to a New York Times tally: 282. * Number of Trump tweets calling someone a liar: 42. * Percentage of Trump statements judged half true, mostly false, false or \u201cpants on fire false\u201d by Politifact: 85%. * Percentage of Clinton statements judged half true, mostly false, false or \u201cpants on fire false\u201d by Politifact: 50%. * Number of emails deleted by Clinton from her personal server: More than 30,000 (she said they were personal or non-work-related). * Number of those emails the FBI said were indeed work-related : Thousands . * Average tax cut to the top 1%  of earners under Trump\u2019s tax plan according to Tax Policy Center: $215,000. * Average tax increase to the\u00a0top 1%  of earners under Clinton tax plan: $118,000. * Politifact analysis of Bernie Sanders\u2019 claim that the top 1% of Americans with the highest income have as much wealth as the other 99%: Mostly true. * Percentage of Trump supporters who say the economy is very important to their support for him: 90%. * Number of Nobel laureates in economics, including the World Bank \u2019s chief economist, who signed a letter lamenting Trump for \u201cfake and misleading\u201d statistics, \u201creckless threats to start trade wars,\u201d and exaggerations on the negative effects of immigration: 19. * Impact of Clinton economic plan over 10 years, according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget:\u00a0a $200-billion increase in the national debt. * Impact of Trump economic plan over 10 years, according to the same group: a $5.3-trillion increase in the national debt. * I could go on, but I\u2019m running out of space and we\u2019re running out of time. What you need to know, dear readers, is that wherever you stand, and however optimistic or frightened you might be, you\u2019re not powerless. You can scream. ",

Sky Schaudt/KJZZ hide caption toggle caption Sky Schaudt/KJZZ Democrats argued that the ban on what critics call \"ballot harvesting\" would suppress the vote, particularly among minorities. Sky Schaudt/KJZZ Reversing a one-day-old appeals court ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court says Arizona can enforce its law banning the collection of early-voting ballots by political campaigners. The ruling means that in Arizona, the practice that critics call \"ballot harvesting\" will be a felony in Tuesday's election. The law was enacted earlier this year; since then, it's been in a tug-of-war between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 as on Friday, when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 6-5 to block the law. Today's ruling changes that. Here's how member station KJZZ in Phoenix explained it Friday: \"Critics, mostly Republicans, call the practice \"ballot harvesting\" and say it invites voter fraud. Republican lawmakers tried to halt it by passing a state law that made it a felony to turn in someone else's ballot, with an exception for relatives, caregivers and roommates. \"Democrats sued, saying ballot collection is key way to get out the vote, especially from minority households. They argued the law violated the Voting Rights Act.\" The state of Arizona immediately sought a stay on the 9th Circuit's ruling that blocked the law, H.B. 2023 , Friday. Article continues after sponsorship \"The state's stay application went to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is responsible for the geographic area that includes Arizona,\" SCOTUSblog reports . The site's Amy Howe adds that Kennedy then took two steps: He told Democrats to get their response to him by 9 a.m. ET Saturday, and he referred the stay request to the entire court. The Supreme Court issued its stay on the block shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday, \"in a brief two-sentence order,\" SCOTUSblog says. It did not provide details about how individual justices viewed the case. The full 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court is slated to review Arizona's law in January; the Supreme Court says that the challenge to the law will have to wait until then. Saturday's reversal came one day after several federal courts, including the 9th Circuit, ruled in Democrats' favor Friday, in what has become a state-by-state legal battle over voting standards and rules. As Barbara Campbell wrote for the Two-Way last night , in addition to Arizona, federal judges in North Carolina, Ohio, and Kansas respectively moved to: reinstate voters whose registration had been stripped; order all parties to refrain from any voter intimidation; and block a proof-of-citizenship requirement.

Here is a look at the main developments on the 19th day of the Mosul Offensive: COUNTERATTACK Islamic State group fighters launched counterattacks in the thin strip of territory Iraqi special forces have recaptured, emerging from populated areas deeper in the city to target the troops with mortars and suicide car bombs. The extremists also attacked farther into territory Iraqi forces claim to control, pushing back some gains along the southern edge of the Gogjali district that Iraqi forces declared \"liberated\" on Wednesday. Fighting continued in the morning, with both sides firing mortars and automatic weapons on each other's positions, while the Iraqi troops also responded with artillery. Clashes were most intense in the al-Bakr neighborhood. Sniper duels played out from rooftops in the mostly residential areas, where the majority of buildings are two stories high. SOUTHERN APPROACHES FORTIFIED More evidence of the daunting fortifications emerged on Saturday, with satellite images showing that IS has set up defenses to bog down advancing forces, including rows of concrete barricades, earth berms and rubble blocking key routes leading to the center of the city. The images taken Monday and made public by Stratfor, a private intelligence firm based in Austin, Texas, also showed that IS fighters have cleared terrain and leveled buildings around Mosul airport and a nearby former military base on the west bank of the Tigris. The defenses \"will pose a substantial tactical challenge\" to advancing Iraqi troops as they make their way toward central Mosul, the firm said. NORTHWARD SLOG Advances toward Mosul have been slower from the south, with government troops still some 20 miles (35 kilometers) away, yet some advances are being made. Iraqi forces assaulted IS positions in the town of Hamam al-Alil on Saturday, which lies along the Tigris river about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the southernmost parts of Mosul. Kurdish television channel Rudaw broadcast live footage of Iraqi troops and armored vehicles amassing outside the city as an attack helicopter fired rockets into the city. Truckloads full of as many as 1,600 civilians may have been forcibly moved from Hamam al-Alil to Tal Afar earlier this week and may be transferred onward into Syria for possible use as human shields, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights warned Friday. Another 150 families from the town were moved to Mosul itself, the U.N. said. Advertisement ",

Miguel Montero reacts to his deep fly-out to right field in the fifth inning Oct. 28, 2016, in Game 3 of the World Series. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune About 23 years ago, former Braves general manager Eddie Robinson broke out in a big smile when he was asked to confirm that he once threatened to trade Dusty Baker to Cleveland following the 1974 season after the 25-year-old outfielder expressed his misery over playing in the South without many of his veteran friends who had been dealt. \"Did Dusty tell you that story?\" Robinson replied before a spring training game in Scottsdale, Ariz. \"Yes, I did tell him that.\" Baker caught a break one year after his request when he was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers , who went on to win three National League titles and the 1981 World Series during his eight seasons. The story illustrates that some are lucky to transform their fortunes, but a cautious situation awaits Joe Maddon and veteran catcher Miguel Montero , who wasn't fond of the way the Cubs ' manager handled him. Montero, 33, appearing Friday on ESPN 1000's Waddle and Silvy Show, expressed his disappointment\u00a0over his lack of playing time, an apparent miscommunication and Maddon's use of closer Aroldis Chapman. (Mark Gonzales) \"I think the toughest part for me is they never communicated with me,\" Montero said on the show. \"I'm a veteran guy. They talk about veteran leadership. I have 11 years in the game and two All-Star (appearances). \"I expected to be treated a little better. I was expected to get communication. Just let me know. Put me in the loop. That was the toughest part for me because I never understood what my role was going to be.\" Montero's emotions percolated during the course of the season, but this was his first public admission of his frustration. David Ross and Montero mentored Willson Contreras after the excitable rookie was promoted from Triple-A Iowa in mid-July. At that time, Montero, 33, was batting only .210 and was working on his throwing at Nationals Park a few days before Contreras was promoted. Thanks to a strong September and early October in which he batted .283 with three home runs, Montero provided the Cubs with a strong left-handed bat that was validated when he hit a grand slam off Joe Blanton of the Dodgers during Game 1 of the National League Championship Series and an RBI single in the 10th inning of Game 7 of the World Series. But playing time could come at a premium in 2017 with the ascent and reliance on Contreras, who took over the majority of the duties with the handling of Jake Arrieta in Games 2 and 6, and possibly the return of Kyle Schwarber behind the plate. Dexter Fowler 's brief speech Friday at Grant Park was a reminder of his success tied to the Cubs ' World Series title but a chilly message of what lurks ahead for a franchise trying to win multiple titles. \"You know what they say,\" Fowler, a free agent, said. \"You go, we go.\" \"So I'm going.\" After... Dexter Fowler 's brief speech Friday at Grant Park was a reminder of his success tied to the Cubs ' World Series title but a chilly message of what lurks ahead for a franchise trying to win multiple titles. \"You know what they say,\" Fowler, a free agent, said. \"You go, we go.\" \"So I'm going.\" After... (Mark Gonzales) With his history of lower back issues, a trade seems very unlikely unless the Cubs are willing to assume a large portion of Montero's $14 million salary in 2017. With John Lackey closer to retirement and Jake Arrieta one year away from free agency, 2017 provides a realistic shot for the Cubs to be \"all-in\" toward another Series title. At the end of the World Series, Maddon was effusive in his praise of Montero. Maddon has been used to massaging spats with the likes of Jon Lester and Jason Hammel over their displeasure with being pulled from starts sooner rather than later. Montero is well-liked by many of his pitchers, and he could be perceived as a future manager or coach if it wasn't for his disdain\u00a0of the \"organizational advocacy\" he witnessed manager Bob Melvin endure during their time with the Arizona Diamondbacks . As soon as the hoopla over the World Series title wears off (if that's possible), a face-to-face chat between Maddon and Montero (perhaps at Cubs Convention) would go a long way toward clarifying\u00a0any misconceptions.

REUTERS/Charles Mostoller Email Police are investigating the theft of Hillary Clinton campaign staffers\u2019 personal belongings from a vehicle in Philadelphia, according to the campaign. The items stolen from the three advance staffers included \u201cbackpacks and computers,\u201d Stephanie Formas, a campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement to CBS News Saturday. The theft occurred around 8 p.m. Friday, CBS Philadelphia station KYW-TV reports. The rear passenger window of the SUV was broken. \u201cAccording to the Philadelphia police commissioner, this appears to be a routine theft, and local law enforcement is handling the matter,\u201d Formas said. \u201cWe have confidence they will resolve it.\u201d The Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security have also been notified as a matter of standard procedure and are working with Philadelphia police in the investigation.

    "text": "Privacy Policy People close to Mr. Comey say his move could actually help Mrs. Clinton if she wins. Only an independent-minded F.B.I. director, one who has shown no loyalty to Mrs. Clinton and a fierce commitment to transparency, their argument goes, will have the credibility to handle what are sure to be years of accusations of Clinton wrongdoing from Republican lawmakers. Then there is the matter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s family foundation. Keeping accusations about the foundation in the news has been a key Republican strategy to weaken Mrs. Clinton, and the F.B.I. office in New York began a preliminary investigation into it over the summer . Some agents there believe strongly that there is evidence to move forward with subpoenas, a move that has been on hold as part of longstanding policy to not do anything that could influence an election \u2014 a policy officials say Mr. Comey violated. After the election, however, authorities will most likely revisit that decision. Senior F.B.I. and Justice Department officials, including Mr. Comey, have characterized the evidence \u2014 and the investigation \u2014 as weak, according to several law enforcement officials familiar with the case. They see the case as based on little more than information from \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d a book by Peter Schweizer that asserted that foreign entities gave money to former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, and in return received favors from the State Department. F.B.I. agents, like many law enforcement officers, are often conservative-leaning. And many of today\u2019s agents came up in the bureau during the 1990s, an era of special prosecutors and mutual distrust between the Clinton White House and the F.B.I. Institutionally, though, the F.B.I. prides itself on nonpartisanship. It investigates public corruption in both parties with equal zeal and has rules and traditions that protect against partisan meddling. Mr. Comey\u2019s move, and the series of news stories that followed about politically charged investigations, have led to accusations that those rules and traditions had been cast aside. When the F.B.I. last week published 15-year-old documents about, among other things, President Clinton\u2019s pardon of the financier Marc Rich, the redacted records offered little information but renewed discussion of long-ago Clinton-related controversies, F.B.I. officials said the timing was a coincidence; the requests for the documents had been filed months ago. But it seemed to confirm the suspicions among Democrats that the F.B.I. was out to hurt Mrs. Clinton, a suggestion F.B.I. agents bristle at. Mr. Comey has sought to position himself as a fiercely independent director who is willing to speak his mind on issues of race, policing and encryption, even when his views are not shared at the Justice Department or the White House. The result has been a much higher profile for Mr. Comey than that of his predecessor, Robert Mueller, as well as for his more low-key boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many current and former Justice Department officials expressed dismay that Ms. Lynch did not personally call Mr. Comey and order him, on principle, not to disclose the latest investigative steps in the email case so close to the election. There has been some speculation that Mr. Comey would feel compelled to provide details on the status of the investigation into the new cache of emails before Election Day. But that move, which would have been controversial within the F.B.I., is now unlikely. \u201cDamn the election,\u201d said James McJunkin, a former F.B.I. assistant director, echoing the feeling of other agents. \u201cHe has to conduct the investigation without the politics. That\u2019s the important piece. That is something he already knows. That\u2019s not lost on James Comey.\u201d Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 5, 2016, 12:35 PM Supreme Court OKs Arizona ballot collection ban Email Last Updated Nov 5, 2016 4:12 PM EDT PHOENIX -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, dealing a blow to Democratic get out the vote efforts just days before the presidential election. The order from the nation\u2019s highest court overturns an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law. Democratic groups had already geared up to begin helping voters deliver their ballots to the polls, and the Supreme Court decision calls into question what happens to ballots they have already legally collected from voters in the approximately 20 hours that the law was blocked. Collecting early ballots is especially effective among minority communities. Democrats allege the law hurts minorities\u2019 ability to vote. Audience members listen as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign rally at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, Nov. 2, 2016. Reuters/Brian Snyder The decision comes just days ahead of a presidential election that has Arizona Democrats hoping to win the traditionally Republican state. But polls show Republican Sen. John McCain has a solid double-digit lead over his Democratic opponent, Ann Kirkpatrick, CBS News correspondent John Blackstone reports. Even she acknowledged McCain\u2019s iconic status in the state. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Kirkpatrick told Blackstone last month. \u201cI have voted for John McCain in the past, and he\u2019s changed.\u201d Arizona filed an emergency appeal hours after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the law Friday. Justice Anthony Kennedy referred the case to the entire Supreme Court, and the court issued a brief order overturning the appeals court. The 9th Circuit will now consider the law in a January session that it set when it blocked the law. Republican lawmakers approved the law earlier this year over the objection of minority Democrats. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey called it a common-sense effort to protect the integrity of elections and eliminate voter fraud. A split 9th U.S. Circuit panel had said that by blocking the law it was preserving the status quo for Tuesday\u2019s election, which could come down to the wire in Arizona as Democrats spend heavily to get out the vote from Latinos and others angered by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant comments. Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote that the decision will not add or remove any valid votes. He said the law criminalized delivering someone else\u2019s early ballot, which would still be counted. Both parties have used ballot collection to boost turnout during elections by going door to door and asking voters if they have completed their mail-in ballots. Voters who have not are urged to do so, and the volunteers offer to take the ballots to election offices. Democrats, however, use it more effectively. The law does not prevent voters\u2019 family members or caregivers from turning in ballots. Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham called Saturday\u2019s decision a smart one since the law has been in effect since before the August primary. Leaving the 9th Circuit decision in place \u201cdoes nothing more than confuse the voters.\u201d He criticized Democratic groups for rushing to collect ballots on Friday, saying they compromised people who may trust them to deliver their vote to the polls. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Argus Leader 7:57 p.m. EDT November 5, 2016 x Share A small group of concerned citizens have established a small camping area in Shirley Gerjets' yard at her Rockwell City farm walking distance from the site of the Dakota Access pipeline.

(Photo: James MacPherson, AP) Many saw the Dakota Access Pipeline's completion as a foregone conclusion before the company applied for a single permit. In South Dakota, the company behind the project obtained voluntary easements from every landowner in its path\u00a0with even vocal opponents choosing to take the deals over what were considered fruitless and expensive eminent-domain battles. Now, with most of the work complete, many still see the pipeline\u2019s operation as a matter of when, not if. But the massive groundswell of support for the anti-pipeline efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has thrown the pipeline\u2019s future into uncertainty. President Barack Obama delayed granting the company\u2019s final easement last month and said last week that a re-route around areas sensitive to the tribe\u2019s ancestral lands is a possibility. Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman David Archambault sees a re-route as a major victory, but many protesters have vowed to continue the fight until the $3.8 billion project is shut down. Rubber bullet strikes camerawoman at Dakota pipeline protest Could that happen in any realistic scenarios? Pipeline owner Energy Transfer Partners and its backers don\u2019t think so \u2014 \u00a0four states and the Army Corps of Engineers granted permits for\u00a0the pipeline, and construction is more than 75% complete \u2014 but opponents are hopeful. Here are a few of the areas opponents are focusing on as paths to a possible shutdown. 1. Standing Rock wins in court The tribe filed a federal lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers during the summer\u00a0shortly after the agency signaled its intent to approve an easement for drilling under Lake Oahe, a more than 200-mile-long reservoir on the Missouri River that extends from South Dakota into North Dakota. The tribe asked for an immediate injunction on two grounds: That the Corps failed to adequately consult with the tribe\u00a0to identify historically significant sites along the pipeline route. That granting the easement would do irreparable harm to tribal history; parts of the Standing Rock Reservation already were flooded with the creation of the lake in the 1960s. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected both arguments Sept. 9, saying the tribe was offered the chance to consult but refused until the process neared an end, and that it had no proof the current route would cause irreparable harm. That doesn\u2019t mean the case is over. The ruling was restricted to the tribe\u2019s claims on alleged violations of the National Historic Preservation Act. Authorities dismantle N.D. pipeline protesters' bridge The underlying lawsuit also argues that the Corps\u2019 permitting process violated the Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. None of those claims has been fully litigated. Archambault said Thursday during a Facebook Live stream that while he feels \u201cthe deck is stacked\u201d against indigenous people, the tribe intends to continue battling construction in court. \u201cIf there is an easement granted, we will sue,\u201d Archambault said. \u201cIf their easement is not granted, of course they\u2019ll sue.\u201d 2. The federal government delays or stops the project President Obama\u2019s announcement that a re-route of the pipeline is on the table points to another avenue for opponents. The statement this week wasn\u2019t the first time the Obama administration has pushed back against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Sorry, your Facebook check-ins at Dakota pipeline aren't confusing police Immediately following Boasberg\u2019s ruling in September, the departments of Justice, Army and Interior issued a joint statement that said the Army would not authorize construction beneath Lake Oahe, a moved that pipeline supporters fiercely criticized. Delays and re-routes add financial strain to pipeline projects and create more openings for opposition, according to Jane Fleming Kleeb of Bold Nebraska. Kleeb\u2019s group helped push for a re-route of the Keystone XL Pipeline around Nebraska\u2019s Sandhills and the Oglala Aquifer in 2011. That forced that pipeline\u2019s owner, TransCanada, to further study environmental impacts and effects on natural resources and to negotiate with more landowners, she said. Why people are checking in to Standing Rock on Facebook \u201cWhenever a re-route happens, it re-opens all those discussions,\u201d Kleeb said. The continued delays of Keystone XL forced a review hearing at the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in 2015. Ultimately, President Barack Obama chose to deny a permit for KeystoneXL, and TransCanada has filed a lawsuit. Energy Transfer Partners told The Associated Press earlier this week that it was unaware of plans for a new route in North Dakota for the Dakota Access Pipeline and remains \u201cconfident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\u201d Dakota Access pipeline protests draw contrasts to Bundy Even if the company gets its easement, it would be subject to congressional review, and Kleeb sees the potential for elected officials like Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. and a pipeline opponent, to call for more delays. Josh Nelson, policy director for the progressive protest group Credo Action, hopes to see President Obama or the next president shutter Dakota Access altogether. More than 378,000 people have signed a petition asking the White House to take executive action and shut down construction its construction. \u201cThe only resolution that we\u2019re going to accept is shutting it down entirely,\u201d Nelson said. 3. Re-routes or delays could endanger the project\u2019s financial feasibility Delays alone could do major financial damage to Energy Transfer Partners. The company indicated as much in court filings in the Standing Rock lawsuit. In an Aug. 18 declaration to the court, Joey Mahmoud,\u00a0Dakota Access vice president, wrote that the company had committed to completing the pipeline by Jan. 1, less than two months from now. Shailene Woodley faces January trial in pipeline protest \u201cThe long-term transportation contracts give shippers a right to terminate their commitments if (Dakota Access Pipeline) is not in full service per the contract deadline,\u201d Mahmoud wrote. A delay in the start of operations would cost about $913 million, Mahmoud wrote, rising to more than $1 billion by 2018. Stopping work would cause \u201cgrave and irreparable impacts to DAPL (the Dakota Access Pipeline), its workers, the landowners, economy, both the state and federal government\u00a0and the environment.\u201d Opponents now speculate that financial harm from protest-related delays alone could be enough to stop the pipeline\u2019s completion. Shailene Woodley pleads not guilty in Dakota Access Pipeline protest \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear they\u2019re not going to have oil flowing on Jan. 1,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, research director of the nonprofit outfit Oil Change International. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen. They\u2019re going to have to renegotiate those contracts.\u201d When the project was announced in 2014, the price of oil was $70 to $80 a barrel. The long-term contracts common in the pipeline industry might be more difficult to lock in with oil at $45 a barrel, Stockman said. The embrace of natural gas and the ramp-up of U.S. energy production have played into the extended price slump, and energy analysts are concerned about long-term lows. On Tuesday, the chief financial officer of Royal Dutch Shell, Simon Henry, said the world will hit peak oil demand within five to 15 years. Wisconsin guard, tribal member Koenig joins pipeline protest \u201cThe world in which they would renegotiate those contracts is not the world in which they negotiated the original contracts,\u201d Stockman said. However, on Friday, company spokeswoman Vicki Granado said the January date would not affect shipping volumes or the project as a whole. \u201cThere is no Jan. 1 deadline,\u201d Granado wrote in email. 4. Iowa landowners win in court Most of the attention focused on the Dakota Access Pipeline is aimed at protest camps in North Dakota, where thousands have visited and hundreds have been arrested in clashes with law enforcement. But opponents have another front line in their battle against the pipeline: the corn fields and courtrooms of Iowa. Bernie Sanders, Native Americans say oil pipeline will poison drinking water The state has had its own protests and arrests as well, said a former state lawmaker and radio host\u00a0who opposes the pipeline, Ed Fallon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more people arrested in Iowa over this than we\u2019ve ever seen, even going back to the Vietnam War,\u201d Fallon said. Pipeline opponents now are using an eminent-domain law that Fallon championed in 2006 in hopes of booting Dakota Access from the state. The law says eminent domain can be used only\u00a0to take property for defined public purposes. Army Corps halts work at lake near Sioux tribe despite judge's order Water, electricity, and natural gas delivery are explicitly included in the statute. Crude oil is not. Des Moines lawyer Bill Hanigan represents 14 landowners in a half dozen Iowa counties where land was taken for pipeline construction through eminent domain. Hanigan\u2019s clients argue that both Iowa law and the U.S. Constitution bar the use of eminent domain to condemn property for a crude-oil project. Q&A: The 4-state, $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline \u201cCrude oil has no value unless it\u2019s refined. It\u2019s a raw material,\u201d Hanigan said. \u201cWe need lumber to build homes, so would we condemn farms to build someone a private highway to haul lumber?\u201d Hanigan believes the already built pipeline beneath his clients\u2019 property and every barrel of oil that flows through it are considered trespassing. Next month, Hanigan and lawyers for Dakota Access will appear before a judge. The losing side of the judge\u2019s subsequent opinion likely will\u00a0appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court, he said. ",

He has also called upon former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to hit the trail for him in the closing days of the campaign. \"We don't need Jay Z to fill up arenas. We do it the old-fashioned way. We do it the old-fashioned way, folks. We fill them up because we love what we're saying and you want to make America great again,\" Trump said during his Tampa rally, a sentiment he has reiterated. Clinton has been able to roll out a robust roster of Democratic supporters, ranging from lawmakers to celebrities. Vice President Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Chelsea Clinton all hit the trail to stump for her on Saturday. Recent polls have shown a tightening race just three days before the election. Clinton on Friday made a stop in Michigan \u2014 a state once thought to be solidly blue but surveys suggest is now a tossup state. The Democrat has largely bypassed Michigan in favor of states with early voting. Vaughn Hillyard ",

But she didn't let the water spoil the party. By REUTERS on Publish Date November 5, 2016. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed The moment lasts about 45 seconds. But in it, so much of the cautious stagecraft that surrounds and inhibits Hillary Clinton appears to break away. Mrs. Clinton, pelted by a driving rain and seemingly overcome by exhaustion, exhilaration and a swirling wind, lets loose with her hands and relinquishes her script. She skips past a critique of Donald J. Trump, flipping the page in her binder, and races to her closing lines. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to remember,\u201d she tells the crowd at a rally on Saturday in Pembroke Pines, Fla. \u201cI want to be the president for everybody: everybody who agrees with me, people who don\u2019t agree with me, people who will vote for me, people who don\u2019t vote for me.\u201d Her arms thrust skyward, one after the other, in what starts to feel like a dance. There\u2019s an unfamiliar sense of abandon and joy. The rain grows heavier. Her wet clothes turn a shade darker. She cracks a wide smile. She takes in the scene around her and laughs before she finishes her sentence. Advertisement Continue reading the main story She\u2019s drenched now, her voice hoarse. The storm is mussing her hair. It\u2019s time to leave the stage. But just before doing so, she turns and raises both arms, giving herself up to the storm and the moment \u2014 and the looming end of this adventure. ",

Photo by Chris Hibben for Fox News. AMES, Iowa \u2013 \u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders narrowly finished second this winter in the state\u2019s Democratic caucuses, then left Iowa in a February snowstorm as a contender.\u00a0He returned Saturday on a warm autumn day to Iowa State University as a surrogate, offering his young, fervent supporters a more difficult pitch -- vote for Hillary Clinton. Some of his devotees remain unconvinced, even those the Clinton campaign selected to speak at this Clinton campaign event. \u201cShe doesn't care about us. Voting for a lesser of two evils, there's no point,\u201d Kaleb Van Fosson, a sophomore and Sanders supporter, said to the small crowd. After drawing light applause, Clinton campaign staff quickly escorted Van Fosson from the stage, as he criticized Clinton for her ties to financial institutions. \u201cI got a call the other day asking me if I wanted to speak for Hillary, basically they wanted to use me like a puppet,\u201d Van Fosson told Fox News. \u201cTrump\u2019s not any better, but Hillary Clinton is still terrible.\u201d Others in attendance agreed with Van Fosson, though most in the crowd appeared supportive of the Democratic nominee. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 \"He's made it evidently clear that Hillary Clinton is the right choice and over the summer,\u201d said Devon Graham, a local\u00a0Sanders supporter.\u00a0 \u201cI went fully behind Hillary and I'm really excited for her as a candidate but also excited that Bernie is supporting her as well.\u201d Sanders used much of his speech to bring attention to his signature issues -- corporate oversight, climate change and income inequality.\u00a0In endorsing Clinton, he acknowledged those\u00a0who dislike both nominees. \u201cGet beyond personality,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cAlright, you don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton, you don\u2019t like Donald Trump fine. You like yourselves. I hope so, if that means taking a hard look at the issues the candidates stand for. We\u2019re not running here for class president of the local high school. This is not a popularity contest. We are electing the most powerful individual in the world.\u201d Yet many still see Clinton\u2019s positions as too centrist and her remarks to Wall Street firms, provided by WikiLeaks, too deferential to financial firms\u2019 interests. \u201cThis is home of rural populism and it manifests in very different ways on theft and the right,\u201d said Rachel Caufield, an associate professor of political science at Drake University in Des Moines.\u00a0 \u201cOn the left if manifests as a distrust of corporations and economic power.\u00a0And Hillary Clinton\u2019s message isn\u2019t resonating with those folks in the same way that say Barack Obama\u2019s did.\u00a0 You still have a lot of those folks who were diehard Bernie supporters who will continue to be Bernie supporters and they\u2019re not sure that Hillary Clinton embraces some of the ideological positions that they want to see in their Democratic Party.\u201d Clinton trails Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in Iowa by less than 3percentage points, according to an average of polls provided by Real Clear Politics. The latest state-provided returns show Iowa Democrats and Republicans have submitted fewer absentee ballots than they did by the same point in 2012.\u00a0Thus far, Republicans have returned a larger share of ballots, and Democrats a smaller percentage than they did in the last presidential election year.\u00a0 As of Friday, 238,029 Democrats and 196,611 Republicans had submitted ballots, according to the Iowa secretary of state.\u00a0 While the\u00a0Clinton campaign\u00a0relies on surrogates such as Sanders and the Obamas to coax their supporters to the polls, Clinton herself maintains a stead attack on her opponent. \u201cAmong most Democrats, the strongest case she\u2019s making right now is that she\u2019s not Donald Trump,\u201d Caufield said. Nor is she Sanders.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been to eight of his last 12 events, and the Bernie merchandise sells a lot better than the Hillary,\u201d said Daniel Richards, a campaign merchandise salesman from Springfield Illinois, as he unloaded a stack of Sanders T-shirts from his van.\u00a0 \u201cThis was the number one seller at the Democratic convention,\u201d Richards also said as he presented a green \u201cIt\u2019s always Bernie in Philadelphia\u201d shirt. \u00a0 Rich Edson is a Washington correspondent for Fox News Channel.

The poll found that Trump leads Clinton by 5 percentage points in the battleground state of Arizona -- 45 percent to 40 percent -- among likely voters. Nine percent support Libertarian Gary Johnson and 3 percent support Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump has the advantage among independent voters 40 percent to 33 percent. A majority of white voters, 54 percent, in Arizona support Trump compared to 34 percent for Clinton. Nearly 60 percent of Hispanic voters support Clinton and 24 percent are for Trump. Women appear to be split between the two candidates. The poll found 55 percent support incumbent Sen. John McCain\u2019s reelection compared to 39 percent who are voting for his Democratic challenger Ann Kirkpatrick. In Georgia , Trump leads Clinton by only 1 percentage point -- 45 percent to 44 percent. Eight percent said they support Johnson. Trump again edges Clinton out among independent voters 40 percent to 34 percent. A whopping 89 percent of black voters in the state support Clinton compared to only 5 percent for Trump. Trump leads Clinton in Texas by 9 percentage points -- 49 percent to 40 percent. Six percent back Johnson and 2 percent back Stein. Forty-two percent of independent support Clinton compared to 34 percent for Trump. Women are split between the two candidates. In all three states, Trump leads Clinton among white voters. As far as the president\u2019s approval rating in each state, 47 percent of adults in Arizona approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s job and 45 percent disapprove. In Georgia, half of adults approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s job compared to 43 percent who disapprove and in Texas, 49 percent approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s job and 44 percent disapprove.

    "text": "Judge: NC Counties Must Restore Voters Removed From Rolls By jonathan drew and gary d. robertson, associated press RALEIGH, N.C. \u0097 Nov 4, 2016, 8:17 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Oct. 20, 2016 file photo ,voters line up during early voting at Chavis Community Center in Raleigh, N.C. North Carolina's process for challenging voters' registration seems to harken to a bygone era when fewer safeguards were in place, a federal judge said Wednesday, Nov. 2 as she presided over a lawsuit that alleges voters are being purged unfairly. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) 0 Shares Email A federal judge ordered three North Carolina counties to restore thousands of voter registrations canceled too close to Election Day after the NAACP sued over the removals. U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs issued the preliminary injunction Friday after an emergency hearing earlier in the week on NAACP allegations that those counties \u2014 and possibly others \u2014 purged voter rolls through a process disproportionately targeting blacks. Biggs said the three counties must restore voter registrations canceled in the 90 days preceding the election because of a federal law prohibiting blanket removals that close to Election Day. She concluded that Cumberland, Beaufort and Moore counties had gone about \"systematically purging between 3,500 and 4,000 voters from registration rolls\" since August. Early voting ends Saturday in the critical swing state, which the NAACP has previously sued over other voter access issues. The voters' names were removed through challenges filed by activists, which the NAACP said was illegal because of the proximity to the election. Challengers in Moore and Cumberland counties include volunteers with the Voter Integrity Project, a group that says it aims to guard against voter fraud . But Biggs took issue with the process in her ruling. \"Voter enfranchisement cannot be sacrificed when citizens through no fault of their own have been removed from the voter rolls,\" she said. \"Moreover, electoral integrity is enhanced, not diminished, when all citizens who are eligible to vote are allowed to exercise that right free from interference and burden unnecessarily imposed by others.\" State Board of Elections spokesman Pat Gannon said the board is \"working quickly to establish the procedures necessary to fully comply with the court order.\" However, board attorney Josh Lawson said the state has not yet decided whether it will appeal facets of the ruling, potentially after the election. The Rev. William Barber, president of the state NAACP, said the judge's decision \"will help make sure not a single voter's voice is unlawfully taken away.\" The group, he added, \"will not back down and allow this suppression to continue.\" State elections officials said earlier this week that their database shows eight counties removed nearly 6,700 challenged voters statewide in the past two years. The state said Cumberland County removed the most \u2014 nearly 5,600 \u2014 and currently has about 200,000 registered voters. Moore County removed 790 of about 65,000 total voters. Beaufort removed 63 in the two-year period. In most cases cited by the lawsuit, mail to a voter has been returned as undeliverable, which county boards can accept as evidence that the voter doesn't live there. Under state law, any voter can challenge another county resident's registration, resulting in a hearing at which the challenger presents evidence, according to a state legal filing. If local officials find probable cause, the challenged voter is given notice of a subsequent hearing. A voter who doesn't rebut the evidence can be removed. During the emergency hearing Wednesday, Biggs described the process as antiquated and \"insane.\" In her ruling Friday, she noted that \"in all three counties, a few individuals submitted mailings marked undeliverable to the County Boards, sometimes in batches up to hundreds at a time.\" Biggs said she was limiting Friday's preliminary injunction to the three cited in the lawsuit because she didn't have enough evidence on the others. The State Board of Elections sent guidance to all counties late Friday noting that although the restoration of challenged voters applies only to Beaufort, Cumberland and Moore counties, no county board of elections may consider residency challenges before Election Day. Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina Executive Director Jay DeLancy said late Friday he wasn't surprised by the ruling but said \"the state did nothing wrong with following the (state) law. We did nothing wrong in following the law.\" He hopes the federal voting rules that Biggs cited in her ruling are ultimately challenged. DeLancy said the group partly wanted to draw attention to local voter rolls bloated with names of people no longer living in counties, leading to greater risk for someone to use another person's identity to vote. The NAACP lawsuit comes during a protracted battle over voter access in the state. In July, a federal court struck down much of a 2013 elections law, saying the GOP-controlled General Assembly had disproportionately targeted black voters. The ruling lengthened in-person early voting by a week and eliminated a provision requiring photo ID for in-person voting. That ruling sparked disagreements among local Democratic and Republican election officials about the number of sites and hours for early voting. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Drew at www.twitter.com/jonldrew and Robertson at www.twitter.com/garydrobertson 0 Shares ",

Attorneys Vincent Ward and Chase Strangio declined to divulge details of Manning's suicide attempt last month at a military prison at Kansas' Fort Leavenworth. Wayne Hall, an Army spokesman, said medical privacy laws barred him from discussing the matter. But Manning's attorneys cited her prison conditions \u2014 including the solitary confinement that her legal team says she received as punishment for her July suicide attempt \u2014 as contributing to their client's fragile mental state. Imprisoned U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning US Army - AFP - Getty Images Strangio, in an email to The Associated Press, called her treatment since her 2010 arrest and subsequent time serving a 35-year sentence \"demoralizing and destabilizing assaults on her health and humanity.\" \"After her July suicide attempt, I watched her begin to piece her life and spirit back together only to have that shattered by the disciplinary proceedings brought against her and then the unannounced initiation of her term of punishment last month,\" Strangio wrote. \"She has repeatedly been punished for trying to survive and now is being repeatedly punished for trying to die.\" Related: Chelsea Manning to Get Gender Reassignment Surgery Strangio added he worries about Manning's \"ability to keep fighting under these relentless abuses.\" Manning, arrested in 2010 as Bradley Manning, was convicted in 2013 in military court of leaking more than 700,000 secret military and State Department documents to WikiLeaks. Manning was an intelligence analyst in Iraq at the time. In 2014, the ACLU sued the U.S. Department of Defense over its refusal to treat Manning's gender dysphoria. Manning staged a several-day hunger strike in September until the Army agreed to get her treatment for her gender dysphoria, including surgery recommended in April by her psychologist, the ACLU said.

USA TODAY Sports Navy swarms Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer. (Photo: Matt Cashore, USA TODAY Sports) With 7:28 left in the fourth quarter, Navy\u2019s offense took possession one last time and broke Notre Dame. Ahead by a single point, the Midshipmen ran, threw, moved the chains and milked every last second off the clock to pull out a 28-27 win. Navy, now 6-2, dropped the Irish to 3-6. With three games left, Notre Dame must sweep Army, Virginia Tech and Southern California to reach bowl eligibility, and would then need to win its bowl game to avoid the program\u2019s first losing season since the Charlie Weis-coached Irish went 3-9 in 2007. Remember when Notre Dame was a trendy pick to reach the College Football Playoff? It\u2019s almost impossible to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, simply because there are too many options \u2014 with abysmal play defensively and inconsistent play offensively as the simplest conclusions. Insider: Special teams blunders hamper Irish \u2014 again Brian Kelly is in no danger of losing his job; the university has already said he\u2019ll be back in 2017. But the wolves are circling, and the chorus of discontent should reach a fever pitch after Saturday. It\u2019ll grow even louder should the Irish lose twice the rest of the way to finish 4-8. Here are the rest of this Saturday\u2019s winners and losers: WINNERS Navy. Nothing the Midshipmen achieve under Ken Niumatalolo is surprising. Beat Notre Dame? He\u2019s done so three times. Reach bowl games? Every year since he took over in 2002 but one. The work he\u2019s done at Navy is never more evident than against Notre Dame, when the Midshipmen overcome a vast gap in overall talent level by outworking, outcoaching and outplaying the Irish. Texas. Every win is worth its weight in gold for Charlie Strong, who might need to lead Texas through a perfect November to return in 2017. Well, about that: After beating Texas Tech\u00a045-37, the Longhorns may just have what it takes to beat West Virginia (at home), Kansas and TCU to go 8-4 in Strong\u2019s third season. Charlie Strong, Texas win on road, topping Texas Tech 45-37 Louisville. At No. 7 in the debut College Football Playoff rankings, Louisville knew it needed to not just win out to potentially secure a spot in the four-team field but win with style. Mission accomplished against Boston College. Lamar Jackson and the Cardinals led 38-0 at halftime and cruised to a 52-7 win, making the sort of statement that may carry weight with the Playoff selection committee at this week\u2019s meeting. Wake Forest.\u00a0The Demon Deacons (6-3, 3-2 ACC) rallied to beat Virginia \u00a027-20 and became bowl eligible for the first time since 2011. Alabama: What some called a potential upset did not happen. Though the LSU defense was strong throughout, the Crimson Tide's 10-0 win didn't really seem that close. Alabama's winning streak is now at 21 and there is some discussion as to whether this defense is Nick Saban's best ever at Alabama. Ohio State:\u00a0The Buckeyes have a loss (to Penn State) and some inconsistent performances on offense. But the Ohio\u00a0State team that rolled past No. 10 Nebraska 62-3 might have what it takes to beat Michigan and earn the Big Ten's spot in the Playoff. LOSERS Texas A&M. Give the Aggies a little bit of credit for delaying the program\u2019s annual meltdown until November. The No. 4 team in the first College Football Playoff rankings will plummet from the title mix after an ugly loss to Mississippi State, which entered Saturday\u2019s game at 3-5 and in real danger of missing bowl play. The Bulldogs revealed A&M as pretenders. No. 7 Texas A&M has playoff hopes damaged after loss to Mississippi State Baylor. Speaking of pretenders: Baylor made hay during its 6-0 start by feasting on five mediocre-to-terrible teams, with Oklahoma State the lone exception. The Bears were humiliated at home by TCU and will likely fall out of the Amway Coaches Poll. In the longer term, this sort of levels portends a poor finish to the regular season. Michigan State. One year after winning the Big Ten and reaching a national semifinal, Michigan State is sitting at 2-7, having lost six games in a row in conference play. The latest, a 31-27 decision to Illinois, is the worst loss yet. In losing, Michigan State became just the second Big Ten team to go from conference champions one year to a losing record the next, joining 2001-02 Illinois. It\u2019s been a stunning fall for the Spartans. Florida. The Gators lost at Arkansas 31-10\u00a0\u2014 the Razorbacks' first SEC win vs. Florida in nine tries\u00a0\u2014 but still control the SEC East (which says something about the SEC East).\u00a0Not that it will matter much if the Gators can't find some more offense. Kentucky: The Wildcats were outscored 11-3 in the fourth quarter to cough up a lead against Georgia in a 27-24 loss. In the process, Kentucky lost its chance to rise to the top of the admittedly awful SEC East (albeit by a half game). HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 10 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Nov 5 2016, 9:08 am ET Election Chaos Fears Have Preppers Stockpiling Survival Food by Ben Popken advertisement In case of an election night Doomsday, preppers are running up sales of emergency survival food. While sales for \"long term food\" typically see an increase around natural disasters and elections, \"this is more intense than what we saw in 2012,\" said Keith Bansemer, VP of marketing for My Patriot Supply, a manufacturer and seller of survival food. During the previous election his company saw sales double. This time it's triple. \"We have everyone we can on the phones,\" he said. \"We are overwhelmed.\" A handout image showing a one-year supply of food for four people. My Patriot Supply Purchases at other long term food supply companies are up as well. Emergency preparedness online store TheEpicenter reports a 6 percent uptick in year over year sales. Another company, Legacy Foods, predicts they'll see a 1-2 week spike in sales after the election -- if Hillary Clinton wins, said owner Phil Cox. The meals, sold by the plastic bucket or tote bin, are typically dehydrated or freeze-dried food in sealed military-grade Mylar packs. Menu items include pasta primavera, Hawaiian Style Sweet n' Sour, cheesy broccoli and rice soup, orange energy drink mix and chocolate pudding. They're sold in bundles based on how long they'll feed you. For $2,000 spent at Legacy Foods, you could eat three square meals a day for an entire year. That's 1,080 servings. TheEpicenter has a 14-day supply kit for $235 that's recently been \"selling really well,\" said owner Bryan Nelson. The most popular entry-level seller at My Patriot Supply is a 3-month supply for $497. It comes a in nondescript gray slim line totes bin designed to be easy to stack in the back of a closet or slip under your bed. Big name retailers are in on the game. Costco sells a 1-month supply of 390 servings in plastic gallon buckets for $114.99. Wal-Mart has a bucket deal, too. What's feeding this new urgency? Survivalist consumers says they're preparing for post-election unrest that could involve everything from massive riots, to power grid outages, to the total collapse of the financial system where a can of food becomes currency. And it's not just guys digging a hole on their farm and filling it with MRE's who are driving sales, companies say, but schoolteachers, moms, and successful financial planners. Nor is it limited to just rural areas. A sampling of freeze-dried foods sold by Wise. Wise \"Frederick Reddie,\" a 41-year-old \"urban prepper\" from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is stocking up on staples like rice and peanut butter and working on expanding his 6-month supply of emergency food to two years. He has to use a pseudonym to protect his supply from any future hungry neighbors, he told NBC News. Reddie predicts a Trump win that has the urban poor revolting across the nation and the imposition of martial law to quell riots and the burning of businesses. But he's also getting ready for the possibility of a Clinton victory that he says could lead to conflict with Russia and \"World War 3 in 2017.\" Either way, Freddy's ready - with both supplies and a word of advice. \"At minimum stock up your cabinets as if you knew a hurricane was coming,\" he said. \"It'll be like a hurricane that could touch every city in America.\" The companies take pains to point out that they sell food not just for the collapse of civilization but also for camping, outdoor recreation, and natural disaster preparedness, like Ebola or volcanoes. Their customers are careful, self-sufficient and pragmatic types, they say, students of history who know things like stock market bubbles and crashes go in cycles and are taking small, meaningful steps, to reassert control over a toxic election. They're always thinking ahead. Cans of food that last 25 years are \"better than money in the bank,\" said Nelson. \"If you think the value of money is going to go down, then you could convert dollars into something tangible that you can use later\" for either eating or barter. Bansemer said that his customers don't necessarily fear a specific election outcome, but change itself. \"You hear them saying, no matter who wins, I know I could take a positive step myself and secure what's important,\" he said. \"They're securing their food supply.\" Ben Popken ",

    "text": "Russian Media Backs Trump, Questions US Democracy By howard amos, associated press MOSCOW \u0097 Nov 5, 2016, 9:54 AM ET 0 Shares Email Russian state-owned media does little to hide its preferences in the U.S. presidential election . News reports about the race for the White House on Russian television devote most of their time to elaborating on Donald Trump's allegations that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and the election is rigged. \"Clinton has a choice. Either she gets the presidency or she goes behind bars,\" pro-Kremlin journalist Dmitry Kiselyov said during his flagship Sunday program on the state-controlled Vesti channel. Unlike the anti-establishment Trump, he told viewers, Clinton has the full backing of the U.S. security services, \"oligarchic\" corporations and the media. Other reports on the Kremlin-controlled TV channels that are the primary source of news for most Russians have highlighted concerns about Clinton's health, linked her to sex scandals and suggested the Democratic Party is \"panicking\" over recent polls. \"My colleagues at these channels completely back Trump and show all the bad things about Clinton,\" said Aleksei Venediktov, the editor of liberal Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly rejected claims that the Kremlin would like to see Trump win the White House. Experts, however, point to strong similarities between their positions on major foreign policy issues, including Syria and Ukraine. The Russian media is pushing Trump's candidacy \"very, very aggressively,\" according to a European Union official who monitors the Russian media and spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The presidential battle has been widely covered, though it usually appears in news bulletins after domestic news and stories about Russia's military action in Syria. Much of the focus has been on Clinton, who is portrayed as a Russophobe, a warmonger and responsible for bloodshed in the Middle East. The latest leak of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta inspired a report titled \"what's with Clinton's head?\" on the state-controlled NTV television channel. It showed footage of Clinton coughing heavily and tripping when entering a plane, along with excerpts from a Soviet cartoon comparing her to a sick grandmother. Vladimir Solovyov, a prominent presenter on NTV, said it's not that Russian media backs Trump, but rather that they dislike Clinton. \"It's rather hard to feel sympathy for a person who raises hell on your country and everyone in it,\" he said in an interview. In contrast, negative stories about Trump often get lighthearted coverage. Reporting fresh allegations of sexual abuse against Trump on Oct. 15, the Vesti channel aired a segment called \"Too many p------\" set to jaunty music that took viewers through allegations of sexual misconduct by former president Bill Clinton and some of the claims against Trump himself. In recent weeks, Russian media attention has concentrated on apparent flaws in the U.S. election process, echoing Trump's claims that the election is rigged against him. In his Sunday program, Kiselyov highlighted what he said were problems with the electoral system, which he described as \"an inter-tribal mess\" that had not changed since the 18th century. Some U.S. states still used voting machines from the 1980s, he said, which he compared to soda vending machines in the Soviet Union. Also repeated frequently are claims by Trump that the U.S. has 1.8 million dead people registered to vote. They're called \"dead souls,\" a reference to a famous 19th century Russian novel by Nikolai Gogol. Russian television channels say what Kremlin officials cannot afford to while the outcome of the election is still unknown, according to Venediktov. \"The Russian media is always one step ahead,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Ms. Ayotte has struggled mightily with the candidacy of Mr. Trump, at first giving him lukewarm support. And when asked during a debate if she saw Mr. Trump as a role model for youths , she replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She then put out a statement contradicting the remark, which became a bludgeon for Ms. Hassan. Ms. Ayotte finally dumped Mr. Trump, a dizzying ride that may have tainted her brand of independence. Ms. Hassan has had her own troubles with Mrs. Clinton. The New Hampshire race has been staggeringly expensive, with over $100 million spent on behalf of the two candidates, the majority of which has supported an all-out assault of television advertising. \u201cI should be embarrassed to have either of you as my senator,\u201d Larry Gray, a doctor in Portsmouth, groused during a Rotary Club meeting where Ms. Hassan spoke. Only the Senate race in Pennsylvania, which has nearly 10 times the population of New Hampshire, has attracted more outside money. Outside spending on Senate races nationally has passed half a billion dollars this cycle, a record. Photo Democratic prospects for regaining a majority in the Senate depend on the outcome of close races in states like New Hampshire. Credit Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist for The New York Times As in other states, there are messy battles outside the Senate contest. Representative Frank C. Guinta, Republican of New Hampshire, is embroiled in a campaign finance scandal that caused Ms. Ayotte to call for his resignation. His opponent, for the fourth time , is former Representative Carol Shea-Porter. \u201cThe Republicans are not helping themselves down ballot,\u201d said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cWhen you have a party that is not unified, it makes it difficult for them to win, especially when they are not the majority party.\u201d Ms. Hassan hopes to be aided by an elaborate turnout operation conducted by the Clinton campaign. But Ms. Ayotte is unlikely to get any corollary benefit from Mr. Trump, who Republicans complain has a limited get-out-the-vote operation. \u201cI have no confidence in the Trump ground game,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party , noting the swarms of volunteers for groups like Planned Parenthood and other Clinton supporters he has seen in the state, and the bumbling efforts of Trump volunteers, a complaint that has been echoed in many other states. \u201cThe idea that there is this team of Republicans working together is just not true.\u201d Still, Ms. Ayotte is clearly competitive in a race where both sides believe they have a slight advantage, with scant real-time proof either way. \u201cBoth candidates are both under 50 percent,\u201d said Rich Killion, a Republican strategist here. \u201cBut the weight of the stuff that has been thrown on Ayotte has not had the marginal effect Democrats want to open up the gap.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The story is largely the same in North Carolina, where the Republican incumbent, Senator Richard M. Burr, started late; and in Indiana and Missouri, where the Democratic challenger, former Senator Evan Bayh , and the Republican incumbent, Roy Blunt, have taken a beating for their lobbying ties . In Nevada, where Democrats are desperate to hold onto the seat of the retiring Harry Reid, Mr. Trump has been seen as a drag on the efforts of Representative Joe Heck to defeat the Democrat, Catherine Cortez Masto. There are also clear signs of a tightening race in Wisconsin, where the Republican incumbent, Ron Johnson, has been aided by an enormous cash infusion from outside groups in his race against former Senator Russ Feingold, who held a double-digit lead for much of the year. In Pennsylvania, Senator Patrick J. Toomey may also be vulnerable to a negative Trump effect in the race against Katie McGinty. Few know where the election is heading, even as so many are deeply invested in the outcome. \u201cI have two bumper stickers on my car,\u201d Mr. Cullen said, one for Ayotte and one for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a former Republican candidate for president, \u201cwhich is another way of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t blame me.\u2019\u201d Mr. Cullen added, \u201cI feel like I have never had an election in which I have had less confidence to say how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington.

Ahn Young-joon/AP hide caption toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Tens of thousands of protesters flood part of downtown Seoul Saturday, calling for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to step down over an explosive political scandal. Ahn Young-joon/AP One day after South Korea's President Park Geun-hye issued a new apology over one of the most bizarre political scandals in recent memory, protesters flooded the streets of downtown Seoul to call for Park to resign over her relationship with a spiritual adviser who has ties to a shamanistic cult. That adviser is Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Park's for some 40 years who was arrested this week as part of an investigation into whether Choi had improper influence over Park \u2014 and whether she used that influence to get rich. As NPR's Elise Hu has reported , \"Choi is the daughter of a mysterious religious figure, Choi Tae-min, the leader of a small cult who befriended a young Park Geun-hye in the 1970s with claims he could channel the voice of Park's dead mother.\" Here's a summary of recent developments in the scandal: Park delivered an apology Friday that was much longer than her initial remarks on the topic in late October, when she addressed the subject for only 90 seconds. \"I put too much faith in a personal relationship and didn't look carefully at what was happening,\" Park said. She also said reports that she had \"fallen into worshiping cult religions or that shamanistic rituals were held at the presidential Blue House\" were false. Also Friday, special prosecutors said they \"will sharply increase the number of investigators as allegations continue to snowball into different sectors,\" the Yonhap news agency reported. On Wednesday, Park fired the prime minister and finance chief. She had already jettisoned her top staff members last week. On the same day, prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Choi. When Choi was in Seoul for questioning on Monday, she told a throng of reporters that she was sorry for committing a \"sin I deserve to die for.\" Article continues after sponsorship As is often the case, estimates of the size of today's protests in Seoul vary widely. Organizers tell the Korea Herald that around 200,000 people came out; the police say it was around 43,000. Whatever their number, the protesters held signs and chanted for Park to step down. The group reportedly ranged from middle school students to retirees. \"Looking at young students taking to the streets, I am so ashamed and embarrassed about myself and people from our generation,\" Lee Seong-kyun, a 65-year-old retiree, tells the Korea Herald . \"We (adults) let this happen by not taking action\" It's the second Saturday in a row that thousands of demonstrators have turned out to demand Park step down; last week, her approval rating hit \"an unprecedented low of 14 percent and Park's ordered all 10 of her senior aides to resign,\" as Elise reported . By Wednesday, Park's approval rating had fallen to 9 percent. ",

    "text": "Phil Rosenthal Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A trio of Cubs playing themselves -- David Ross, Dexter Fowler and Anthony Rizzo \u2013 were exotic dancers for a dead grandmother live from New York on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d the first stop on their post-World Series tour of late-night television. Later in the program, joined by \u201cSNL\u201d alumnus and longtime Cubs fan Bill Murray, they returned in matching straw hats and Cubs sweaters to (sort of) sing the fan anthem \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d in the guise of having won a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d version of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d \u201cThis is the best thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Fowler said flatly to little studio audience response. If both bits seemed awkwardly tacked on, it\u2019s understandable \u201cSNL\u201d would run a \u201cW\u201d flag up the pole in a bid to catch a bit of the national buzz the Cubs have generated with their first World Series championship in 108 years. After all, the decisive Game 7 on Wednesday averaged 40 million viewers on Fox, 5.6 million more people than this year\u2019s Academy Awards. The \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d bit, at least, was innocuous. As for the exotic dancer sketch, well, for fans keeping score at home, what might have been a wild pitch should probably go down as an error. The premise: A grandmother (played by Aidy Bryant who\u2019s remarrying is treated to a surprise bachelorette party. The shock of the unexpected celebration kills her instantly, but this goes unnoticed by both the guests and a pair of dancers (one played by guest host Benedict Cumberbatch). The dancers rubbed up against dead grandma, sprayed her with whipped cream to be licked off her. Then they announced that, as a special reward, actual Cubs players would perform. Fowler asked who wanted a \u201cgranny slam.\u201d Ross said not to worry because\u00a0 \u201cGrampa Ross\" would \"take real good care.\u201d Rizzo said something about \u201ca triple-header.\u201d Then they (sort of) danced. Even within the pantheon of sports stars on \u201cSNL,\u201d it wasn\u2019t quite was more Derek Jeter in drag than Peyton Manning nailing a hapless kid with a bullet pass. No one will confuse any of it with Nancy Kerrigan skating with Chris Farley, O.J. Simpson as a Conehead, Joe Montana as an extremely sincere roommate or Michael Jordan plagued by self doubts and telling himself: \u201cI'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!\" The Cubs are going to get more practice in the days to come. Just to start, on Monday night, Rizzo, Fowler and Ben Zobrist reportedly are scheduled to visit Jimmy Fallon on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show,\" while Kris Bryant is penciled in for ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d But even if it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019re going to quit their day jobs. philrosenthal@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "By Rosalind S. Helderman and Mary Jordan November 5 at 11:36 AM Follow @PostRoz Follow @marycjordan Melania Trump, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and an immigrant from Slovenia, was paid for 10 modeling jobs in 1996 before she received legal authorization to work in the United States, the Associated Press reported Friday night. The AP cited detailed ledgers from Melania Trump\u2019s modeling agency, as well as a contract she signed with the firm, concluding she was paid more than $20,000 for the work over a period of seven weeks. The finding contradicts repeated statements from both Melania and Donald Trump, who have insisted that she scrupulously followed U.S. immigration law when she came to the United States as a striving model. It also creates a potential political embarrassment for the Republican nominee, who has based much of his campaign on a vow to crack down on illegal immigration \u2014 including deporting people who have violated the terms of their immigration status. The Trump campaign has said Melania Trump came to the United States in 1996 and then met and began dating Donald Trump in 1998. She received a green card that allows permanent residency in 2001, the campaign has said, and then became a U.S. citizen in 2006, the year after she and Trump were married. Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, speaking Thursday at the Main Line Sports Center in Berwyn, Pa. (Patrick Semansky/AP) \u201cI am pleased to enclose a letter from my immigration attorney which states that, with 100% certainty, I correctly went through the legal process when arriving in the USA,\u201d Melania Trump tweeted in September, when she released a lawyer\u2019s letter outlining the history. The campaign provided no documentation of the narrative at the time. [ Melania Trump shares more immigration information but no documentation ] The new information involves Melania Trump\u2019s activities in her first weeks after arriving in the United States. The Trump campaign has indicated that she arrived on Aug. 27, 1996, holding a B1/B2 visitor\u2019s visa. She then received an H-1B work permit on Oct. 18, 1996. It is illegal to perform work for money while holding a visitor\u2019s visa. However, the AP located records showing she was paid for multiple jobs during the weeks that she held the visitor\u2019s permit, including for Fitness magazine and the Bergdorf Goodman department store. During that time, she also signed what appeared to be a standard management agreement with her agency, Metropolitan International Management, that appeared to have been executed on Sept. 4, 1996. Neither a Trump campaign spokesman or Michael Wildes, the lawyer who wrote the letter outlining Trump\u2019s immigration history in September, responded Saturday to requests for comment. Wildes told the AP \u201cthese documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps,\u201d but did not answer additional questions. Melania Trump has in recent days re-emerged on the campaign trail, after a long absence following a speech she delivered at the Republican National Convention that borrowed language from Michelle Obama. Melania Trump held a rally on Thursday in Pennsylvania, where she issued a call for civility in politics. In a speech she delivered Thursday in a Philadelphia suburb, she again highlighted her legal immigration status. As she spoke of the years she spent getting her visas and green card, several Trump supporters in the audience shouted \u2014 \u201cYes! A legal immigrant! [ Very different Trump speech: A call by Melania for no more \u2018mean words\u2019 ] Experts say many immigrants to the United States perform work illegally while holding a visitor\u2019s visa, putting them \u201cout of status\u201d and potentially endangering their ability to later become U.S. citizens. It is one reason, they say, that there are so many people living in the country illegally. Trump has promised to deport people who have violated the terms of their visas. It is considered fraud to lie during the immigration process, for instance by entering the United States with a visitor\u2019s visa but intending to work and falsely a telling a border control officer otherwise. If authorities can prove a person has engaged in fraud, the consequences can be severe. Immigration authorities can retroactively seek to revoke citizenship of people found to have violated immigration law. But that process is very rare, generally only used in extreme cases, such as when a person is suspected of involvement with terrorism. Still, the new information \u201cshows a disregard for the rules,\u201d said Bruce Morrison, a former Democratic congressman and immigration expert. \u201cTechnically, it could unravel her status, if it is true.\u201d A former partner in the firm, Paolo Zampolli, confirmed to the AP that the documents appeared authentic but could not recall additional details. He has told The Washington Post that he paid for Melania to come to New York in 1996 and arranged for her H-1B work visa so she could work at his Metropolitan Models. She was 26 at the time, far older than the typical Eastern European recruit, usually 18 or 19. Metropolitan was dragged into nasty contract disputes, and court documents related to them filed in New York detailed many lavish parties its young models attended. Metropolitan, like many modeling agencies, often threw parties, and their guest list included rich and influential men. It was at one of the parties in 1998 that Zampolli said he introduced Melania to Trump. Immigration experts say questions remain about how Melania was able to obtain her green card in 2001, which allowed her to remain in the U.S. permanently. She has said she was granted the permit because of \u201cextraordinary ability,\u201d but experts say that visa category is generally reserved for people whose accomplishment is at the level of a Nobel Prize winner. It would be unusual, they say, for a model with no college degree to qualify. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 A\u00a0 man with a firearm walking Saturday afternoon near the White House led authorities to briefly lock down the property as a precaution, according to Secret Service officials. A uniformed Secret Service officer confronted the unidentified man Saturday afternoon as he walked along Pennsylvania Avenue near Madison Place\u00a0on the east side of Lafayette Park.\u00a0The man, whose name was not released, was placed under arrest after a brief struggle and turned over to District of Columbia police. He faces several charges, including carrying a firearm without a license, carrying unregistered ammunition and resisting arrest. President Barack Obama was not at the White House at the time. He was in Maryland, playing golf at Andrews Air Force Base. London police arrest 33 at masked-marcher event Earlier Saturday about three blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue, District of Columbia police arrested Eric Roberts, 27, of Florida and Danny Hamilton, 35, of Louisiana in connection with graffiti on sidewalks and buildings in the area of Saturday's Million Mask March, which organizers describe on their Facebook page as a march against government and corporate corruption. It was not immediately known whether the arrests were related. Police photographs of the morning incident appear to show the word \u201ccorrupt\u201d and images of English anti-hero Guy Fawkes spray painted at the FBI building and graffiti at the newly opened Trump International Hotel. Officers confiscated several cans of spray paint and stencils. Police warn of violence at London Million Mask March A police cruiser also\u00a0was damaged, D.C. police said.

The events come as Mrs. Clinton is trying to motivate people in Ohio to vote early. Younger voters are shunning the two major political parties on a scale not seen since Ross Perot\u2019s third-party bid for the presidency in 1992, a striking swing in public opinion that is cutting into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s thin margin for error. The rally with Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 comes at the end of a campaign in which Mrs. Clinton has carefully cultivated black support. She devoted the first speech of her campaign, nearly 18 months ago, to calling for an overhaul of the criminal justice system and ending \u201cthe era of mass incarceration\u201d that has disproportionately affected black men. She has spent many Sundays worshiping at black churches across the country. She spoke at a church in Flint, Mich., to plead for help with the city\u2019s water crisis, and she campaigned with the mothers of Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and others who have lost children to gun violence or after encounters with the police. In North Carolina, where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an \u201calmost surgical\u201d assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early voting sites, African-American turnout is down 16 percent . And in Ohio, which also cut back its early voting, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down. On board the Clinton campaign plane on Friday, John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, suggested unfavorable comparisons between Mrs. Clinton\u2019s performance among black voters with Mr. Obama\u2019s were unfair. \u201cLook, President Obama was the first African-American president, so he had a level of enthusiasm, commitment that we\u2019re trying to push toward beating, but obviously he has advantages there,\u201d Mr. Podesta said.

Pat Toomey is turning to the target of some of his toughest criticism to help him in his life-or-death re-election bid in Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania : President Barack Obama. A new Toomey campaign TV ad running Friday shows Mr. Obama praising Toomey for working with Democrats on legislation to expand background checks on firearms purchases. It shows Mr. Obama speaking outside the White House in 2013 and thanking Toomey for his courage, despite the bill\u2019s failure. The ad is running on cable in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. You can watch the ad here:\u00a0 on YouTube It\u2019s perhaps the most eye-opening way in which Toomey is working to win over moderate voters in his neck-and-neck race against Democrat Katie McGinty. A Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman calls the ad disingenuous and says Toomey is trying to make voters think he didn\u2019t help obstruct the Obama administration. President Obama also pushed back against Republican Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s use of his wods in a campaign ad for his Senate race. In a statement to The Associated Press, Mr. Obama says courage is telling voters \u201cwhere you stand on the tough issues.\u201d Mr. Obama also criticized Toomey for refusing to say whether he\u2019ll vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
