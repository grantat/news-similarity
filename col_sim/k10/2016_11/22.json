By Lisa Rein November 21 at 6:00 AM Follow @Reinlwapo The Washington Post's Lisa Rein explains President-elect Trump's plan to reform the federal workforce. (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are drawing up plans to take on the government bureaucracy they have long railed against, by eroding job protections and grinding down benefits that federal workers have received for a generation. Hiring freezes,\u00a0an end to automatic raises, a green light to fire poor performers, a ban on union business on the government\u2019s dime\u00a0and less generous pensions \u2014 these are the contours of the blueprint emerging under Republican\u00a0control of Washington in January. These changes were once unthinkable to federal employees, their unions and their supporters in Congress.\u00a0But Trump\u2019s election as an outsider promising to shake up a system he\u00a0told voters is awash in\u00a0\u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d has\u00a0conservatives\u00a0optimistic that they could do now what Republicans have been unable to do\u00a0in the 133 years since the modern civil service was created. [ Trump and the federal workforce: Five key issues ] \u201cYou have the country moving to the right and being much more anti-Washington than it was,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a leading Trump adviser who serves on the president-elect\u2019s transition team. \u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0going to have to get the country to understand how big the problem is, the human costs of it and why it\u2019s absolutely essential to reform,\u201d said Gingrich, who urged Trump to shrink big government and overhaul the \u201cjob-for-life\u201d guarantee of federal work. Gingrich predicted that Stephen K. Bannon, a former Breitbart News chief who helped steer Trump\u2019s campaign and is now one of his\u00a0most influential advisers, would lead\u00a0the effort.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a big, big project,\u201d he said. The project aligns with Bannon\u2019s long-stated warnings about the corrupting influence of government and a capital city rampant with \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d Breitbart headlines also provide a possible insight into his views, with federal employees described as overpaid, too numerous and a \u201cprivileged class.\u201d \u201cNumber of Government Employees Now Surpasses Manufacturing Jobs by 9,977,000,\u201d the website\u00a0proclaimed in November. There are 2.1 million federal civilian employees. [ The faulty logic behind Trump\u2019s plan to freeze federal hiring ] Top Republicans on Capitol Hill say their first priority will be making it easier to fire employees regarded as incompetent or who break the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to fire somebody,\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. \u201cWhen the overwhelming majority do a good job and the one bad apple is there viewing pornography, I want people to be held accountable.\u201d [ Trump plans to fire feds faster ] Chaffetz said he plans to push through wholesale changes to the generous retirement benefits that federal workers receive,\u00a0by shifting to a market-driven, 401(k)-style plan\u00a0for new employees. He said the model would be his home state, which six years ago replaced the defined benefit pensions that have disappeared at most private companies with a defined contribution plan for new state and municipal workers. \u201cWe have a Republican president\u00a0who will help us drive this to the finish line,\u201d Chaffetz said. The promises go hand in hand with Trump\u2019s promise to shrink the size and reach of government, from eliminating some agencies outright to lifting regulations and running the bureaucracy with fewer people. Gingrich said the Trump administration probably would look for guidance from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who stripped public employee unions of most of their collective-bargaining rights and forced workers to pay more into their pensions and for health care in what became a bitter\u00a0political\u00a0fight. The White House also can look for lessons from policies advocated by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. As Indiana governor, Pence battled\u00a0public employee unions and approved pay increases for state workers who receive good performance reviews, a strategy tried at the Defense Department under President George W. Bush but which was poorly managed and eventually abolished. The pay-for-performance idea is nonetheless a rebuke to the government\u2019s system of raises based on longevity. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be playing defense for at least a couple of years,\u201d acknowledged William R. Dougan, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, the third-largest federal union. \u201cThe most immediate worry is: How are we going to shrink government?\u201d Dougan said. \u201cAre we going to lay people off? Eliminate whole agencies or do it through attrition?\u201d Trump has promised that in his first 100 days in office he will freeze hiring by not replacing employees who leave. The military and employees in public health and safety roles would be exempt, according to the president-elect\u2019s Contract with the American Voter. He has pledged to eliminate two regulations for every new one passed and shut down the Education Department and parts of the Environmental Protection Agency. But he also wants a military with more ships, planes and troops. He has said he wants to triple the number of immigration enforcement agents and beef up the Border Patrol by thousands. So a selective hiring freeze may be more realistic, Trump advisers say, where agencies that Republicans dislike shrink and ones they like grow. Trump can freeze hiring without Congress\u2019s approval, with an executive order or less formal instructions\u00a0to\u00a0federal agencies. [ House tries to give Veterans Affairs more power to discipline employees ] Democrats and federal employee unions are preparing to\u00a0fight the image of government workers as a privileged class and the bureaucracy as a bloated mess. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), whose Northern Virginia district includes thousands of federal workers, said: \u201cWhat study are they citing saying there are too many federal employees? Are you going to make a bunch of exceptions, in which case your plan looks like Swiss cheese?\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the oversight committee, said in an email that he would \u201cfight any effort to roll back civil service protections\u201d \u2014 and worried that whistle blowers could lose their legal right to be immune from retaliation. Others raise the specter that Republican proposals could allow political favoritism to creep into a system\u00a0Congress created in 1883 to remove federal jobs from patronage ranks. \u201cOf course we want accountability,\u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who will enter the Senate in January, \u201cbut we also want to protect against political favoritism. It\u2019s important that we not allow the civil service to be politicized.\u201d Congressional Republicans have clamored for years for a smaller bureaucracy and a workforce that resembles the private sector. The calls quickened after a string of scandals, particularly at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where managers instructed employees to falsify patient wait times to cover up delays for medical appointments. But much of this GOP-written legislation was opposed by the Obama administration and blocked by Senate Democrats. Now, with a Trump White House eliminating a veto threat, conservatives see their vision within reach. And Democrats acknowledge that senators who are nervously looking to reelection bids in 2018 and represent red states friendly to Trump may not fall on their swords to defend federal employees, whose presence\u00a0is more diffuse outside the Washington area. Many inside and outside government agree that change to the way federal workers are hired, promoted and disciplined is long overdue. Employees under investigation for breaking the rules\u00a0can sit at home for years \u2014 collecting paychecks and benefits\u00a0\u2014 while their cases drag on. Performance rankings\u00a0are widely panned as a joke, because the vast majority of workers are rated as exceeding expectations or doing outstanding work. Federal workers are seldom\u00a0fired for poor performance \u2014 and it can take years for managers\u00a0to make a successful case for dismissal for misconduct. About 0.5 percent of the civil service\u00a0gets fired every year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [ Federal employees behind in pay by 34 percent, salary council says ] \u201cThe civil service system fails at almost everything it was designed to do,\u201d said Paul Light, a civil service expert at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s very slow at hiring, negligent in disciplining, permissive in promoting.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a private awareness among Democrats and Republicans alike that we need to do something about this,\u201d he said. Trump says he wants to freeze hiring to clean up corruption in government \u2014 but not necessarily to save money, a connection roundly dismissed by critics. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening with every agency \u2014 waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d he said on the campaign trail. \u201cWe will cut so much, your head will spin.\u201d Other presidents, including Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, have frozen hiring to shrink government \u2014 but rarely succeeded for long periods. Reagan imposed a freeze\u00a0the day he came into office in 1981 that was retroactive to Election Day, forcing managers to renege on job offers to\u00a0hundreds of people. But the government soon ballooned with active-duty military and civilians as he began a massive defense buildup. The civilian workforce is the smallest it has been since Reagan left office, after plummeting under Clinton and expanding under Bush and President Obama. Yet Republicans say a leaner government goes hand in hand with a more accountable one in which managers and rank-and-file employees who\u2019ve failed should not get to keep their jobs. These changes have taken root, with a\u00a0bipartisan law in 2014 to limit the appeal rights of senior executives at Veterans Affairs who face discipline for wrongdoing. Since then, similar restrictions for employees across government have stalled in Congress, in part because the Obama administration made little use of its new authority \u2014 and this year stopped using it altogether in the face of a court challenge alleging that it violated employees\u2019 right to due process. Other changes could result in longer probation for new employees, with the goal of making it easier for managers to let poor performers go since they would have little job protections. This has started at the Defense Department, where the current standard has doubled to two years. These changes are vigorously opposed by unions, which could be severely weakened under GOP plans to eventually wipe out what\u2019s known as \u201cofficial time,\u201d union work done by employees\u00a0who continue to receive full salary and benefits. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in an email that he will reach out to federal employee unions as his panel works to enact \u201clong-overdue reforms to our civil service.\u201d Said Johnson:\u00a0\u201cIf we start with areas of agreement, I am confident that we can make continuous improvements to the functionality of the federal workforce.\u201d Eric Yoder contributed to this report. powerpost ",

West is pictured here at a show in Chicago. Rob Grabowski/Rob Grabowski/Invision/AP There will be no more stops on Kanye West's Saint Pablo tour, according to the rap star's publicist Victor Trevino and Live Nation. They gave no reason, but it follows a series of rants from the stage in which the rap star criticized Beyonce, Jay Z, Hillary Clinton and the radio industry. The rants began on Thursday, when West told an audience in San Jose, CA, that he would have voted for Donald Trump, if he had voted. That began a weekend of backlash and criticism against the rapper as he repeated those sentiments at his show on Saturday in Sacramento. West, who has a history of outbursts and complaints about other artists and politicians, stopped during his third song to speak for 17 minutes then left the stage. Some booed, others heckled and several people cheered. But he continued: \"I ain't here to massage you with the fake truth,\" West said. \"The vibes is back.\" A number of concertgoers captured West's latest antics, including Matt Guillermo: Kanye tonight in Sacramento. No words. #SaintPabloTour pic.twitter.com/TV7fZ4YO1w \u2014 Matt G. \uf47b (@OhMattG) November 20, 2016 West addressed what he called the \"radio game,\" complaining that certain artists like Drake get played, but others like Frank Ocean do not. He talked about racism in America, and also called out DJ Khaled, Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9. Article continues after sponsorship Kanye also told Hillary Clinton to get over losing the presidency. \"It's a new world Hillary Clinton, it's a new world,\" said West. \"Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt.\" Ticket prices for a Saint Pablo concert ranged from $29 to $480, depending on the venue. Those who attended the Sacramento show will be refunded by the outlets where they purchased the tickets. The Forum in L.A confirmed that West would not be performing on Sunday just three hours before the show. West's scheduled appearance in L.A. was supposed to make up for his Nov. 3 show, which he ended early but because he lost his voice. The outbursts are just the latest for the performer who has himself expressed interest in running for president in 2020. West is known for his infamous off-the-cuff remarks on multiple platforms, including a backstage rant on Saturday Night Live earlier this year. But he's best known for interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs to protest her win. And in 2005, West went off-script during a telethon for Hurricane Katrina victims to criticize then-President George W. Bush. ",

Prosecutors say Mohamed Rafik Naji, a citizen of Yemen and legal permanent resident of the U.S., has been expressing support for ISIS on social media since September 2014. He is alleged to have traveled to Turkey and Yemen between March 22, 2015 and September 9, 2015 in an effort to join ISIS fighting in Yemen. Naji, during his travels to Yemen, reportedly repeatedly expressed his admiration for ISIS on Facebook. Mohamed Rafik Naji, a citizen of Yemen and legal permanent resident of the U.S., was arrested for allegedly trying to fight for ISIS in Yemen, according to court documents. Jane Rosenberg Prosecutors allege he repeatedly tried to enter ISIS territory to join the group while in Yemen between March and September of 2015. In an email to his girlfriend on March 25, 2016, about his trials trying to enter the terrorist group\u2019s territory, Naji allegedly wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get in I\u2019m on my 5 try its difficult mad po po military and ppl here very scared inshallah I make it m keep trying if not m have to go from somewhere else.\u201d Court docs indicate that just one month later, Naji sent a selfie to his girlfriend \u201cin which he is wearing all black clothing, including a tactical vest in which a large knife handle is visible.\u201d A short time later, Naji allegedly sent a video showing him taking gunfire. Prosecutors say Naji\u2019s girlfriend allegedly sent him money several times in Yemen. When he returned to New York City after failing to join ISIS abroad, Naji is alleged to have shared his plans for a local attack with a confidential informant similar to\u00a0 the attack in Nice, France \u00a0for Times Square.\u00a0 Speaking about a potential attack by ISIS in New York, Naji is alleged to have said: \u201cThey want an operation in Times-Square, reconnaissance group already put out a scene, the Islamic State already put up scenes of Times-Square, you understand. I said that was an indication for whoever is smart to know.\u201d Officials have long expressed fears about ISIS supporters who appear to be self-radicalized in the U.S. Arrests have been piling up since the rise of the terrorist group in 2014. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY Sports Former USMNT head coach Jurgen Klinsmann. (Photo: Joe Maiorana, USA TODAY Sports) In the end, Jurgen Klinsmann was a victim of his own optimism as his masterplan for revolutionizing American soccer came crashing down on Monday. Klinsmann came into the United States head coaching job in 2011 fueled by the promise of a bright new era. It was not all of his own making, both U.S. soccer fans and the national governing body encouraged the belief that snagging the man who had taken Germany to the 2006 World Cup semifinals would lead to a wave of unprecedented\u00a0success. Yet Klinsmann did little to temper those expectations, and when he found himself ultimately powerless to get close to them, the net closed in and hastened his demise. His\u00a0firing\u00a0on Monday\u00a0by U.S.\u00a0Soccer president Sunil Gulati was, in many ways, an admission that the bold concept of marrying a European approach with traditional American soccer values is no simple task. U.S. men's national soccer team coach Jurgen Klinsmann out To that end, Gulati is expected to go back to what he knows. On Tuesday, he is expected to name former national team coach Bruce Arena as Klinsmann's replacement, a person with knowledge of the decision told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because Arena's appointment has not been made official. Arena is a no-nonsense character whose straightforward ways could be just what the U.S. needs as it bids to get its World Cup qualifying campaign back on track\u00a0after losing the first two games in spectacular fashion this month. He inherits a U.S. soccer culture very different to the one he left behind at the end of his first\u00a0stint in 2006. Attention on the game, and especially the performances of those who represent the country, has never been greater. Sports world overjoyed with happiness after Jurgen Klinsmann was fired as USMNT coach Gone are the days when a U.S. head coach gets to operate in relative anonymity in between World Cups. Defeats in the CONCACAF region where the U.S. operates are never going to go down well and a pair of them within the space of a few days, to Mexico and Costa Rica, was enough to spell doom for Klinsmann. In many ways, bringing in Klinsmann to begin with was an experiment, an expensive throw of the dice to see if the U.S. could fast-track its way, both stylistically and practically, to the top table of world soccer by replicating European methodology. As he made way for a change of direction of Monday it was clear that the experiment had failed, and that it may not be repeated any time soon. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Carrie Fisher just happened to have hers 40 years ago while making arguably the biggest movie of all time. In her funny and frequently touching new memoir The Princess Diarist (Blue Rider Press, 272 pp., *** out of four stars), the iconic Star Wars actress and author (Postcards From the Edge) reveals the diaries she kept as a 19-year-old starring in the blockbuster sci-fi film. She writes at length\u00a0about her three-month affair with her co-star, Harrison Ford, who was 15 years older. It\u2019s an eye-opener for fans, but it also shows a gifted writer even at a young age. There\u00a0was a lot going on between Princess Leia\u2019s hair buns. Fisher\u2019s never had a problem speaking her mind, and she\u2019s extremely honest in discussing her love/hate dynamic with fan interactions, her place as a geek goddess and that slave bikini she had to wear in Return of the Jedi. From the\u00a0start, she lays bare her mind-set as a teenage actress who had a small role in Warren Beatty\u2019s 1975 comedy Shampoo\u00a0before\u00a0blasting off into a galaxy far, far away in May 1976 in London. That\u2019s where she met and worked with Mark Hamill and Ford, a laconic, handsome dude who could \u201ctake the hill, win the duel, be leader of the gluten-free world, all without breaking a sweat.\u201d When they began their affair, he was a married dad with kids. So\u00a0there seems to be\u00a0some guilt, especially as Fisher\u00a0considers the effect\u00a0adultery had on her parents (Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher). Carrie Fisher talks about her romantic affair with Harrison Ford in the new memoir 'The Princess Diarist.' \u00a0(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Those looking for a tell-all won\u2019t find one here \u2014\u00a0Fisher, now 60, keeps it pretty PG-13, so there\u2019s no discussion of, say, Han Solo\u2019s light saber. What she does instead in her signature style (with tangents and asides a-plenty) when recollecting the \u201cCarrison\u201d era is come clean about her emotions. She was\u00a0pretty much in love at the time, but Ford\u2019s unreadable,\u00a0quiet, guy\u2019s-guy persona drove her a bit crazy. Fisher called him \u201cmy Achilles heart\u201d in her angsty, stream-of-consciousness journals. In one entry she writes, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not Mark \u2014\u00a0it could\u2019ve been. It should\u2019ve been. It might\u2019ve meant something.\u201d She unleashes bits of trivia, such as the time she tried (and failed) to lose 10 pounds at a Texas \u201cfat farm\u201d before the original Star Wars began production. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in the original 'Star Wars.' \u00a0(Photo: Lucasfilm) Fisher doesn't mention her feelings filming Han and Leia's signature kiss in The Empire Strikes Back\u00a0or how she felt working with Ford on Jedi, perhaps saving those nuggets for a future tome. The best stuff here, though, is the chapters in which\u00a0Fisher talks about her and Ford\u2019s friendship now, four decades after their \u201cvery long one-night stand,\u201d as well as their and Hamill\u2019s perspectives on fame, fans and this massive franchise. She gives\u00a0one of the best lines to Ford, recalling how flying home together from London he said, \"You have the eyes of a doe and the balls of a samurai.\u201d It\u2019s so true not only of Leia, but her diarist alter-ego.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker speaks at a press conference in Madison, Wis., on\u00a0Sept. 21, 2015. (Morry Gash / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Federal judges struck down Wisconsin's Republican-drawn legislative districts as unconstitutional on Monday, marking a victory for minority Democrats that could force the Legislature to redraw the maps. The three-judge panel didn't order any immediate changes to district boundaries, instead saying they would give state attorneys and the voters who challenged the old maps 45 days to offer suggestions. State lawyers plan to appeal the 2-1 ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, but for now the decision offers hope for Democrats who have been in the minority for six years and lost more ground in this month's elections. The lawsuit focuses on Assembly districts, but since Senate districts are based on the Assembly maps the ruling invalidates both chambers' maps. \"The court has clearly indicated the map is unconstitutional and that Wisconsin citizens deserve a fair map,\" said Sachin Chheda, director of the Fair Elections Project, which organized the lawsuit. \"We're confident this is the first step in democracy being restored to the people of Wisconsin.\" Republican state Attorney General Brad Schimel, whose state Justice Department defended the boundaries, issued a statement saying the agency plans to appeal and the decision doesn't affect the results of this month's elections. A spokeswoman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald referred questions to justice department. Republican Gov. Scott Walker 's spokesman, Tom Evenson, had no immediate comment, saying only that Walker's office was reviewing the decision. But there\u2019s no question who will win most\u00a0of the state\u2019s 13 House congressional districts\u00a0in November. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually certain that Republicans will hold their\u00a010-to-3 advantage,... North Carolina may be a swing\u00a0state in presidential\u00a0politics, with polls showing Hillary Clinton now leading\u00a0 Donald Trump . But there\u2019s no question who will win most\u00a0of the state\u2019s 13 House congressional districts\u00a0in November. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually certain that Republicans will hold their\u00a010-to-3 advantage,... (David G. Savage) Assembly Republican Speaker Robin Vos said Republican victories in Wisconsin are not because of redistricting.(backslash) \" Republicans win elections because we have better candidates and a better message that continues to resonate with voters,\" he said. Republicans drew the maps in 2011 after they took full control of state government in the 2010 elections. They haven't relinquished control of either house since. Assembly Republicans didn't lose a seat and defeated a Democratic incumbent in this month's elections to gain their largest majority in the chamber since 1957. Senate Republicans also didn't lose a single seat and defeated a Democratic incumbent to gain their largest majority since 1971. A dozen voters sued in July 2015, arguing the maps unconstitutionally discriminated against Democrats by diluting their voting power. They called it the worst example of gerrymandering \u2014 a term for dividing districts to gain an unfair advantage \u2014 in modern history. One effect, plaintiff attorney Gerald Hebert argued during a trial in May, was to reduce the number of swing districts from 19 to 10. The plaintiffs also noted that under the new maps in 2012 Republicans won 60 of 99 Assembly seats even though Democrats won a majority of the statewide vote. Attorneys for the state countered Wisconsin is trending Republican and argued there's no legal way to measure gerrymandering. They added that partisanship should be expected when one party draws legislative boundaries. The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to come up with a legal standard for deciding when redistricting becomes unconstitutional gerrymandering. Plaintiff attorneys offered the judges an equation that included measuring and comparing each party's wasted votes in an election. State lawyers argued the equation lacked any constitutional basis and there was no way a court could measure gerrymandering. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Kenneth Ripple and U.S. District Judge William Griesbach heard the case. Crabb was appointed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, Griesbach by Republican President George W. Bush and Ripple by Republican President Ronald Reagan. Crabb and Ripple accepted the equation. \"We find that (the maps were) intended to burden the representational rights of Democratic voters throughout the decennial period by impeding their ability to translate their votes into legislative seats,\" Ripple wrote for the majority. \"We find that the discriminatory effect is not explained by the political geography of Wisconsin nor is it justified by a legitimate state interest.\" Griesbach wrote in dissent the Republicans' maps were politically motivated but comply with traditional redistricting principles. Republicans likely would have retained legislative control in the 2012 and 2014 elections without the new maps, he said. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca called Monday's ruling \"a historic victory.\" \"Voters,\" he said, \"should be able to choose their representatives, not the other way around.\" Associated Press ",

Richard Jackson was charged Friday in federal court with sex trafficking. A complaint filed by prosecutors says police were first alerted to Jackson after receiving a 911 call Thursday. When they arrived at Jackson\u2019s house, a woman said Jackson forced her the other victims into prostitution.\u00a0 She said Jackson had beaten her and the other victims, and purposely gotten them addicted to heroin, reports CBS Detroit . Police said they found a large black steel gate and lock on the stairs to the second floor of the home to prevent escape. The complaint says that Jackson advertised the victims on Backpage.com, a classifieds company whose CEO was arrested in October and charged by Texas authorities with sex trafficking. The complaint alleges that when he was interviewed, Jackson denied being involved with prostitution and drugs, but an examination of his cell phone found discussions about sex acts, prices and locations. Jackson appeared in federal court on Friday afternoon and was temporarily detained until his bond hearing on November 21. The FBI is currently looking for the two juvenile victims, who escaped from the house. Anyone with information about the two juveniles or about Jackson\u2019s sex trafficking operation is asked to call the FBI at 313-965-2323. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

However, a preliminary magnitude 7.3 earthquake was recorded, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Both agencies put the depth at just over 6 miles.\u00a0 The powerful earthquake off the northeast Japanese shore sent residents fleeing to higher ground and prompted worries about the Fukushima nuclear power plant destroyed by a tsunami five year ago.\u00a0 Earthquake hits off coast of Japan All tsunami warnings and advisories have been lifted in Japan, seven hours after a powerful offshore earthquake triggered a series of moderate tsunami waves. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of waves of up to 10 feet soon after the magnitude 7.4 earthquake and urged residents on sections of the Pacific coast to evacuate to higher ground. The first tsunamis were recorded about one hour later. The largest one of 4.6 feet in height reached Sendai Bay about two hours after the earthquake. The tsunami warnings were lifted first, but advisories of possible smaller tsunamis had remained in place until 12:50 p.m.\u00a0 Waves of around three feet were observed in Soma port in Fukushima, according to Japanese media. There were reports of minor injuries and damage, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. The earthquake shook buildings in Tokyo, 150 miles southwest of the epicenter. NHK also showed one person\u2019s video of water rushing up a river or canal, but well within the height of the embankment. It was eerily reminiscent of the 2011 disaster, when much larger tsunamis rushed up rivers and overflowed, wiping away entire neighborhoods. Two operators of potentially affected nuclear plants reported no initial signs of damage.\u00a0 A map showing the epicenter of an earthquake recorded off Japan on Nov. 21, 2016. The rings show the diminishing power of the tremor. Close USGS The Pacific Tusnami Warning Center said in a statement faraway places like Hawaii aren\u2019t expected to experience any tsunami affects.\u00a0 In 2011, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake in the same region triggered a massive tsunami and led to almost 16,000 deaths. The temblor and tsunami led to a nuclear disaster at the power plant in Fukushima , which is still causing problems to this day. The operator of the plant said there were no abnormalities observed at the plant, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said. Reuters reported that as a result of the 2011 disaster, all nuclear plants on the coast threatened by the tsunami are shutdown in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Only two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the southwest of the country, far away from the tsunami warning. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "By Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell November 21 at 6:30 AM Follow @mikedebonis Follow @kelsey_snell President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) pose for photographers after a meeting in the speaker\u2019s office on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0intends to\u00a0launch\u00a0a broad legislative agenda that includes cutting taxes, rolling back the Affordable Care Act, growing the military and\u00a0rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. The question is how congressional Republicans, after eight years of apocalyptic warnings about the growing national debt, will\u00a0respond to the\u00a0dire fiscal implications\u00a0of proposals\u00a0that would likely send the deficit soaring. Taken together, the Trump agenda stands to drain hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the federal balance sheet. His proposed tax cut alone, according to independent analysts , could cost the Treasury as much as $7.2 trillion over a decade. Some Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have indicated that some sacred cows might be up for slaughter. Those include federal entitlement programs such as Medicare, long considered a \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics, that Trump himself has shied away from touching. \u201cYou fix the health care problem, you are dramatically fixing the fiscal health of this country,\u201d Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday. \u201cThose are among the things that we have to do if we\u2019re going to truly nurse ourselves back to fiscal health.\u201d [ Deficits and debt are no longer at the top of the GOP agenda ] The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) In interviews with more than a dozen congressional Republicans this week \u2014 including staunch supporters of Trump and his agenda \u2014 most dismissed concerns about potential\u00a0deficits in a big-spending Trump administration. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who favored austere spending blueprints as House Budget Committee chairman and is now a candidate for a Cabinet post in the Trump administration, said it would be a matter of \u201cpriorities.\u201d \u201cIf you prioritize on the things that he and we believe are important \u2026 it can actually save money,\u201d Price said. Most Republicans on Capitol Hill, including former presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), simply dodged questions about Trump\u2019s plans: \u201cWe have a debt problem in America that needs to be addressed, but we\u2019re going to wait and see what the proposals are.\u201d Several Republican lawmakers who call themselves deficit hawks simply expressed faith that implementing GOP policies would unleash levels of economic growth the nation hasn\u2019t seen in more than 15 years,\u00a0boosting government revenue to compensate for any new spending. \u201cIf we were at 4 percent GDP growth consistently, we could afford all that,\u201d said Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), echoing the views of other House conservatives. Economists argue that those growth targets for the U.S. economy are ambitious at best. Experts on both the left and the right are projecting growth rates closer to 2 percent, and even under the most generous circumstances, most believe Trump\u2019s proposals would cost far more than the economy could recoup through economic growth alone. \u201cThe suite of policy proposals that Trump put forth would explode the debt,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which estimates Trump\u2019s plans would add $5.3 trillion to the existing $19.5 trillion national debt. \u201cA lot of times in campaigns, candidates talk about what they would do and later turn to talking about how they would pay for it,\u201d she added. \u201cBut because he walled off the major entitlement programs, there is nowhere to go to get the money to pay for things.\u201d Should Republicans support deficit spending\u00a0under a Trump administration, it would mark a 180-degree reversal in rhetoric. The current Republican majorities in the House and Senate were built on the midterm waves of 2010 and 2014, where GOP candidates preaching fiscal austerity ousted Democrats who favored deficit spending to jump-start a sluggish economy. Ryan himself warned in 2010 that federal spending would \u201cmortgage our children\u2019s future\u201d in a series of editorials he and current House Republican Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.) co-wrote for the Washington Examiner. \u201cBy acting now, a debt crisis can be averted by reforming government on our own terms,\u201d Ryan said. Trump, on the other hand, made nary a mention of budget deficits on the campaign trail. He briefly suggested renegotiating the country\u2019s debt obligations, a move that would likely decimate America\u2019s global creditworthiness. In an interview published Fr iday , Trump\u2019s designated chief White House strategist suggested that the incoming president would pay little heed to Republican orthodoxy on fiscal matters. \u201cLike [Andrew] Jackson\u2019s populism, we\u2019re going to build an entirely new political movement,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThe conservatives are going to go crazy. I\u2019m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan.\u201d Left-leaning fiscal experts, meanwhile, see new evidence in the Trump agenda that Republican attacks on President Obama\u2019s fiscal policy were driven less by conviction and more by a political desire to undermine a Democratic administration. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible pathway that gets you from a huge trickle-down tax cut to a doubling of the growth rate,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal\u00a0Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former chief economic adviser to Vice President Biden. \u201cWhat will happen is what always happens in these moments: You exacerbate after-tax inequality, and you generate large deficits.\u201d Trump\u2019s spending plans come amid warnings from the Federal Reserve that the economy is operating at close to full employment and productivity growth is at a near-term low. Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen testified Thursday at a hearing of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that racking up more debt under those conditions could put the economy at serious risk in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,\u201d Yellen said. Some Republican deficit hawks have said they remain worried about the debt and deficit but refused to address Trump\u2019s proposals directly. \u201cI think we\u2019ll stand up to that problem,\u201d said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). \u201cIt is going to be difficult, but I think we need to operate within our budget rules.\u201d What remains to be seen is whether Republican leaders undertake a serious effort to pursue cuts to Medicare or other major federal programs in the early months of the Trump administration. Ryan has pointed to Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, Social Security \u2014 as the main drivers of the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal pressures. He said in a Nov. 10 Fox News Channel interview that Medicare has \u201cserious problems\u201d that would need to be addressed when Congress moves to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He did not say, however, how far-reaching those changes might be. [ Is Paul Ryan already eyeing Medicare cuts? ] A policy agenda advanced by Ryan and House Republicans favors reworking Medicare from a public insurance program into a \u201cpremium support\u201d model where beneficiaries would be given vouchers to purchase private insurance plans. Medicaid, which now covers more than 70 million low-income Americans, would be converted into a \u201cblock grant\u201d where states would be handed a fixed sum and given wide latitude to administer benefits. Ryan on Thursday declined to say whether those initiatives would be considered as part of an Obamacare replacement:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll get into all this stuff down the road.\u201d One key Republican, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin\u00a0G. Hatch (Utah) \u2014 whose committee oversees taxes and entitlement programs \u2014 seemed concerned about unfettered spending and how the numbers would all add up. Asked if entitlement reform was necessary to making the Trump agenda fiscally sustainable, Hatch said, \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the understatement.\u201d Hatch said Wednesday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to\u201d consider Medicare reforms in the coming year and did not rule out a privatization push. \u201cFor some people, you\u2019d have to have premium support,\u201d he said. Even\u00a0if Republicans don\u2019t immediately pursue entitlement cuts, Bernstein said, the deficits that Trump\u2019s policies stand to create would make such cuts all but inevitable. \u201cWhen their phony growth agenda doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to throw their hands up and say, \u2018Sorry, folks, we\u2019re going to have to cut entitlements.'\u201d Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, appear to be horrified policy-wise and salivating politically at the prospect that Republicans might pursue Medicare cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Senate minority leader, said Friday. \u201cI\u2019d like to see how many Republicans in the Senate will vote for privatization of Medicare, or in the House.\u201d He challenged them, in fact, to do so: \u201cMake our day.\u201d powerpost ",

Detective Marconi was reportedly sitting in his cruiser when the shots were fired. KENS San Antonio Police Department personnel investigate the scene after Detective Benjamin Marconi was fatally shot Nov. 20, 2016. (Photo: Edward A. Ornelas, AP) San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said Monday evening that a suspect has been arrested in the fatal shooting of a police officer Sunday, a bloody day for police officers across the nation. McManus said Otis Tyrone McCain, 31, was arrested without incident in the ambush of\u00a0Detective Benjamin Marconi. He was arrested around 4:30 p.m. Monday after the car he was driving was stopped on Interstate 10. McManus said the death of\u00a0Marconi during an otherwise routine traffic stop near the police station\u00a0was more than a random act. \"I feel we (police) were targeted,\" McManus said. \"I think the uniform was the target.\" Elsewhere\u00a0Sunday, three police officers were wounded and two suspects killed in shootings in St. Louis and Gladstone, Mo.,\u00a0and\u00a0Sanibel, Fla. James Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said four attacks on officers in one day is another alarming\u00a0a sign of the times.\u00a0In July, five officers were killed in Dallas by a heavily armed sniper who opened fire at a peaceful protest against police-involved shootings. In Baton Rouge less than two weeks later, three officers were killed and three others wounded in an ambush.\u200b\u200b Sunday's violence, however, involved four attacks by four attackers scattered across the nation. x Share The San Antonio Police Department has released two surveillance videos of a suspect in a shooting that claimed the life of one of its officers. USA TODAY NETWORK Pasco says that, while no direct connection linking Sunday's shootings is apparent, social media can spread\u00a0information \u2014 often incorrect information\u00a0\u2014 quickly and widely and can provoke action.\u00a0Pasco says a drumbeat of criticism from the media, politicians and activists has eroded the esteem granted to law enforcement from the public. \"Police officers are doing their jobs the best they can, sometimes heroically, but now more than ever this kind of violence is in the back of their minds,\" Pasco told USA TODAY. \"And when cops aren't safe, nobody is safe.\" McManus\u00a0said Marconi, 50, was conducting a traffic stop outside police headquarters just before noon when he was shot in his car while writing a ticket. McManus said a black male with a goatee drove up in a\u00a0Mitsubishi Galant, walked up to Marconi's car and shot the 20-year department veteran in the head before reaching in and shooting him again. The shooter then drove off, McManus said. The driver of the vehicle who had been stopped had no role in the tragedy, McManus said. McManus said the suspect briefly visited the police station four hours before the shooting, speaking to a desk clerk. McManus did not say what was discussed. He said the dashcam video provided \"a lot of information,\" but he provided no details. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement asking everyone in\u00a0Texas to pray for the Marconis' loved ones as they deal with \"this unimaginable tragedy.\" Abbott urged the Legislature to pass his Police Protection Act, which would classify attacks against law enforcement as hate crimes. \"Attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice,\" Abbott said. The San Antonio Police Department would like to take a moment to honor SAPD Detective Benjamin Marconi, who lost... https://t.co/m0BjHFiu31 \u2014 SA Police Dept (@SATXPolice) November 20, 2016 Pasco agrees, and says his organization will press Congress in 2017 to add attacks on officers to the federal hate crimes statute. \"It should be wrong to attack somebody based on the color of their uniform,\" Pasco said. In St. Louis, a 46-year-old police sergeant who was shot twice in the face Sunday evening was released from the hospital Monday, Chief Sam Dotson said.\u00a0Dotson said the officer was sitting in his cruiser in traffic when he was shot by someone in a nearby car.\u00a0The 19-year-old suspect was killed hours later in a shootout with officers. Dotson said the teen\u00a0may have been connected to several robberies, a carjacking\u00a0and a homicide. In Gladstone, an officer was shot after a passenger ran from a car stopped for a traffic violation, according to Kansas City police, which handled the investigation. The suspect, described as a white male in his late teens, pulled out a gun and was killed in the ensuing shootout that left one officer wounded. \"Thanks to all for their prayers and calls of support,\" the Gladstone Police Department tweeted. \"Our officer is out of surgery and is expected to make a full recovery following rehab.\" In Florida, an officer was in his patrol car wrapping up a routine traffic stop at about 8 p.m. ET Sunday when he was shot by someone driving by. The city said on its website that the suspect was taken into custody a short time later after exchanging gunfire with police. The wounded officer was treated at a hospital and released. \"This is always difficult, especially in this day and age when police officers are being targeted across the country,\" McManus said. \"It's everyone's worst nightmare. Unfortunately, like Dallas, like Baton Rouge, it has happened here now.\" Contributing: KSDK-TV, St. Louis; KENS-TV, San Antonio; The News-Press, Fort Myers, Fla., Associated Press 10790 CONNECT TWEET 11 LINKEDIN 110 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gdiGdV ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics say that all children should get health maintenance visits for immunizations and other preventive services; management of acute and chronic medical conditions; access to mental health support and dental care ; and have round-the-clock availability of emergency services and timely access to subspecialists. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Medicaid and many private insurance plans recommend or require that all of those services be provided, under the umbrella of what is known as the medical home , the study found that millions of insured children are not receiving many of the benefits. There are many children with insurance who cannot get primary care and those who do can often have problems getting specialty care. As President-elect Donald J. Trump, a Republican, vows to repeal some, if not all , of the Affordable Care Act , which extended health care coverage to an additional 20 million people, the report\u2019s authors worry that even more children could have trouble receiving the care they need. \u201cThe fact that more than 20 million children in the U.S. experience insurance and noninsurance barriers to getting comprehensive and timely health care is a challenge that needs to get the highest-priority attention from the new administration,\u201d said the report\u2019s lead author, Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the nonprofit Children\u2019s Health Fund and a professor of pediatrics and health policy and management at Columbia University. Over the past two decades, the number of children without health insurance has steadily decreased to 3.3 million last year from around 10 million in 1997, according to an analysis of federal data and the federal government\u2019s 2015 National Health I nterview Survey . The effort to extend coverage began 50 years ago with the creation of Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor. It continued more recently with the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which offers low-cost coverage to those who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid and, under the Obama administration, with the Affordable Care Act, offering subsidized coverage and state exchanges. The study relied on census data and reports by federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prominent medical journals, as well as information extrapolated from the fund\u2019s clinics and from its national network of programs that provide health care to underserved children across the country. The findings reveal a system in which getting quality care is often confusing and expensive, with even those who benefit from government programs often becoming deeply frustrated.

The report noted that employer-based health insurance premiums for family coverage increased by 73 percent from 2003 to 2013. Employees\u2019 contributions to the cost of the premiums climbed by 93 percent over that same period, though the rate of increase slowed after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The average deductible for an individual with health insurance was 5 percent of median income in 2013, up from 2 percent in 2003, the report said. Advertisement The study also cited a survey that found that 59 percent of pediatricians said they had a hard time collecting patients\u2019 shares of deductibles and co-payments from families covered by private high-deductible health plans. For those with Medicaid, like Ms. Solomon, difficulties in getting care have also grown. Many clinics and health systems do not accept patients with Medicaid, the study said, because of the low reimbursement rates. Ms. Solomon\u2019s experience is typical. \u201cWhen I was pregnant with my last child, I had such a hard time finding prenatal care,\u201d she said. She called 15 to 20 doctors before finding one who took her insurance. \u201cI mean, we would call places and they would be like, \u2018We take it,\u2019 but it turned out they didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so hard.\u201d Even something as simple as getting medicine recently for her son\u2019s strep throat was not simple. Because of a mix-up with her insurance card, Ms. Solomon had to cover a $20 co-payment for a prescription that should have been free, she said. The report said experiences like hers were common, both with government programs and some private insurers. \u201cThe impacts of these barriers are significant,\u201d the report said. \u201cParents faced with financial barriers might seek to save money by calling their doctor for advice, rather than seeing that doctor in person; rather than fill expensive prescriptions, a parent might rely on a limited supply of pharmaceutical samples. The medical debt incurred by such costs has been linked to reduced access to care, creating a vicious cycle.\u201d Perhaps just as significant are the barriers caused by demographics. Dr. Michael Kappy, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado just outside Denver, has seen the problem firsthand. Advertisement Since 1996, he has traveled in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming to reach children in areas that do not have large medical centers or specialists. \u201cMy focus has been strictly speaking to solving the geographic barrier,\u201d Dr. Kappy said. The study estimates that around 14 million children live in areas with a shortage of health professionals. More than three million low-income residents in New York live in federally designated shortage areas where, among other criteria, there is less than one primary care doctor for every 3,000 people. The Affordable Care Act sought to address that problem by expanding the National Health Service Corps, but 65 percent of rural areas still have shortages of health professionals. Dr. Kappy said one encouraging trend was the use of telemedicine, allowing for patients to be evaluated over the internet, with a local physician assistant aiding with hands-on work. To expand and improve tele-health options, however, the programs need to be properly reimbursed, he said, adding that programs that fund the work of doctors doing outreach to isolated communities were critical. Dr. Redlener, the study\u2019s chief author, warned that repealing the Affordable Care Act without an adequate replacement could result in more than three million children losing their insurance. \u201cSo far,\u201d Dr. Redlener said, \u201cnone of the proposed replacements will do anything to mitigate what children would potentially lose if the A.C.A. is actually repealed.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2016, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Study Says Many Insured Children Lack Essential Care.

FILE - In this Nov. 9, 2016 file photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally in New York. Here\u0092s the idea: Swiftly pass a repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law, perhaps so Donald Trump can sign it the day he takes the presidential oath. Then approve new legislation restructuring the nation\u0092s huge and convoluted health care system despite Republican divisions, Democratic opposition and millions of jittery constituents. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci, File) ORG XMIT: WX102 (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) WASHINGTON --- President-elect Donald Trump released a \u201cvideo message\u201d Monday to the American people outlining the core principle of his presidency \u2014 \u201cputting America first\u201d \u2014 and laying out executive actions he wants to take beginning on day one in office, including scrapping regulations on energy production, withdrawing from trade agreements and \"investigating all abuses of visa programs.\" \u201cWhether it\u2019s producing steel, building cars\u00a0or curing disease, I want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here, on\u00a0our great homeland: America \u2013 creating wealth and jobs for American workers,\u201d Trump says in the video, his first address since his acceptance speech on election night. By posting the video on YouTube rather than making a personal appearance, he avoided follow-up questions, and his aides could manage how he was portrayed, rather than relying on independent media to capture the footage they wanted shown. The president-elect has been holed up in Trump Tower and his golf club in New Jersey in recent days, meeting with a parade of potential advisers and cabinet members. \u201cOur transition team is working very smoothly, efficiently\u00a0and effectively,\u201d Trump said in the video. \u201cTruly great and talented men and women, patriots indeed are being brought in and many will soon be a part of our government, helping us to make America great again.\u201d He said he wanted to provide an update on the White House transition and policy plans for the first 100 days of his administration. Trump said he plans to issue formal notification that the United States will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement hammered out with a dozen Pacific-rim countries which had already stalled and virtually died in Congress when Trump was elected. Instead, Trump said he will seek to negotiate \u201cfair\u201d bilateral agreements. And on immigration,\u00a0he said he will direct the Department of Labor to \"investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker.\" He said he will rescind \"job-killing\"\u00a0rules on clean coal and natural-gas production, \"creating millions of high-paying jobs.\" \"That's what we want, that's what we've been waiting for,\" Trump said. He said he will direct\u00a0the Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to come up with plans to protect American infrastructure from cyber- and other attacks.\u00a0Trump also wants to impose a rule that requires federal agencies to eliminate two regulations for each new one imposed. \"These are just a few of the steps we will take to reform Washington and rebuild our middle class,\" he said. \"I will provide more updates in the coming days, as we work together to make America great again for everyone, and I mean everyone.\" Trump has not had a news conference since his election and has made cabinet picks public through press releases. \"The man works 18 hours a day interviewing people taking calls from all around the world,\" Trump campaign manager and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said.\u00a0\"He will take have a press conference in due course. And he will make his announcements for his cabinet.\" David Jackson contributed. ",

The 200 attendees at the National Policy Institute's annual conference at the Ronald Reagan building celebrated the rise of Donald Trump as president-elect and promoted a conquer-or-be-conquered mentality. \"America was, until this past generation, a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity,\" Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist within the alt-right movement. \"It is our creation. It is our inheritance and it belongs to us.\" A video published by\u00a0The Atlantic, which is working on a documentary on Spencer, shows clips of Spencer's speech for the National Policy Institute, an independent research organization \"dedicated to the heritage, identity and future of people of European descent in the United States,\" according to its website. The Atlantic reported\u00a0that Spencer envisions \u201ca new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,\u201d and supports \u201cpeaceful ethnic cleansing.\u201d Members of the D.C. Antifascist Coalition protested the conference and an anti-Semitic dinner hosted at Maggiano's on Saturday. Some held banners and posters outside of the Italian restaurant, while at least one protester was seen outside of Trump International Hotel. Restaurant apologizes for 'inadvertently' hosting alt-right event Toward the beginning of his speech, Spencer said, \"Hail Trump. Hail our people. Hail victory!\" and the room broke out in applause. Some raised a hand in a Nazi salute. Spencer also slammed the press, calling members \"genuinely stupid\" and promoted a philosophy of \"conquer or die\" among attendees. \"To be white is to be a striver, a crusader, an explorer and a conqueror.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fM2XUx Most Popular ",

The Oakland Raiders beat the Houston Texans, 27-20, at a sold-out Mexico City Azteca Stadium on Monday. Dario Lopez-Mills/AP Updated at 12:31 a.m. ET Tuesday: The Oakland Raiders scored two touchdown in the fourth quarter to beat the Houston Texans, 27-20, at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on Monday night. The NFL Is Kicking The Ball To The United Kingdom. Why? Both teams grappled with a major challenge: playing at an elevation 2,000 feet higher than the players have ever confronted. The game is only the second-ever regular-season NFL game in Mexico. The first was in 2005, also at Azteca Stadium \u2014 and at the time, set a record for regular-season attendance. In the decade since, NFL games have been played in Toronto and London, but not at any other international venues. Some Britons Are Learning To Love Football \u2014 The American Kind \"This game is the first of a three-year contract for the NFL to play in Mexico City,\" The Associated Press notes, \"and the league would like it to become an annual event\" \u2014 just like it is in London. USA Today notes that the game might be rough on the players. The elevation at Azteca Stadium is some 7,200 feet (compared to the highest NFL stadium, Denver's Sports Authority Field, which is aptly called the Mile High Stadium \u2014 at 5,280 feet). And pollution can make the thin air even harder to deal with. Soccer player Eric Wynalda told the newspaper that Azteca was \"the worst place ever to play.\" But at least both teams \u2014 equally unfamiliar with the venue \u2014 will be on equal footing. And the thin air will make long-distance field goal attempts easier, reports SB Nation . The game sold out within minutes , and Mexico City residents \u2014 famous for their love for f\u00f9tbol \u2014 have enthusiasm to spare for American football, too. Over at ESPN, Carlos Alvarez Montero documented a few of the game-celebrating getups of Mexican megafans. NPR thanks our sponsors ",

The survey, conducted after the Nov. 8 election, included interviews with voters who were originally interviewed before the election. In the wake of the election, 30 percent of voters gave Trump an A or B grade, 19 percent gave him a C, 15 percent gave him a D and 35 percent gave him a failing grade. Clinton, who lost the Electoral College but who\u2019s winning the popular vote , received an A or B grade from 43 percent of voters. Half of voters, Pew said, said they are happy that Trump won while just as many, 48 percent, said they are unhappy. This split is similar to the one measured four years ago after President Obama was re-elected to a second term in 2012. Fifty-six percent of voters said they expect Trump to have a successful first term -- a prediction shared by 97 percent of Trump voters. More than three-quarters of Clinton supporters, however, said they expect Trump to be unsuccessful. The survey found 58 percent of Clinton supporters said they\u2019re willing to give Trump a chance and 39 percent said they can\u2019t see themselves giving him one. An overwhelming majority of voters, 79 percent, said that despite Clinton\u2019s loss, they still expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. The poll surveyed 1,254 voters between Nov. 10 and 14 with a 3.4 percentage point margin of error.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Email An early-morning house fire in central Indiana killed four young sisters and sent their mother and two would-be rescuers to the hospital, authorities said Monday. The fire at the home in Flora, about 60 miles north of Indianapolis was called in at around 3:40 a.m., said Todd Trent, an assistant chief of the local fire department. A Carroll County sheriff's deputy who was the first to arrive was overcome by smoke and heat while trying to reach the children in their second-floor bedrooms and was pulled from the burning home by a local police officer who also was unable to reach the kids, authorities said. Firefighters who arrived a few minutes later were able to retrieve the children but couldn't revive them, Trent said. He said all four likely died of smoke inhalation. Flora Police Chief Paul Redmon said the girls ranged in age from preschool to the sixth grade, WLFI-TV reported. The children's mother was on the first floor and survived. Trent said she suffered from smoke inhalation and may have had other injuries, and was airlifted to a hospital in Indianapolis. Her condition was not immediately known. Angela Francis, an emergency medical technician who lives next door the home, said she was awakened early Monday by the mother's screams. \"I heard the mom outside yelling and screaming,\" Francis told the (Lafayette) Journal & Courier. \"By the time I got over there, I was helping one of the ambulances with one of the officers.\" Sheriff Tobe Leazenby thanked the police officer, Josh Disinger, for rescuing his deputy, Drew Yoder. Yoder was airlifted to a Fort Wayne hospital with smoke inhalation and burns but his prognosis looks good, Leazenby said. Disinger was in stable condition at a Lafayette hospital, WLFI-TV reported. The State Fire Marshal's office says the fire's cause remains under investigation but that foul play isn't suspected. It said the children's names were being withheld pending the notification of their relatives. The home, which had one working smoke alarm, was divided into two apartments. A woman who lived in the other unit escaped unharmed, the office said. Trent said the deadly fire had shaken the town of about 3,000 people. \"For a small community, this is quite a tragedy. All four children attended the local school, you have all the classmates who knew them and the mother worked here in town,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Season could be done for Bears QB Jay Cutler Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. Brad Biggs Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Chicago Bears will have a major decision to make in regards to Jay Cutler at the end of this year -- but now the quarterback\u2019s 2016 season could be ended prematurely. Multiple sources told the Tribune that Cutler suffered a shoulder injury in Sunday\u2019s 22-16 loss to the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium . Cutler was able to finish the game and was intercepted by safety Landon Collins on the final offensive play but the Bears were working to learn more about his injury on a hectic Monday at Halas Hall. There was bad news already after leading tackler Jerrell Freeman was suspended for four games for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs was a shot to the franchise that lost No. 1 wide receiver Alshon Jeffery to a PED suspension last week. Now, Cutler is injured for the second time this season and could be the third quarterback to suffer a season-ending injury. Cutler has been a quick healer with other injuries throughout his eight seasons with the franchise but missed five games earlier this season with a right thumb injury when the coaching staff seemed determined to roll with Brian Hoyer before he suffered a broken left arm. Connor Shaw suffered a broken leg in the third preseason game. Cutler was sacked four times by the Giants in the fourth quarter on Sunday and the team\u2019s medical staff visited with him after the first possession of the game. Defensive end Olivier Vernon slammed him to the turf on the second snap leading to a roughing the passer penalty called by referee Craig Wrolstad. If Cutler cannot play, Matt Barkley would be the team\u2019s starting quarterback for Sunday\u2019s game against the Titans at Soldier Field. The team has only one other quarterback under contract, Josh Woodrum, an undrafted rookie free agent from Liberty who was signed to the practice squad last week. Cutler is under contract through the 2020 season but at this point it would not be a surprise if the team parts ways with him after the season. If the Bears release Cutler in the offseason, it would have only a $2 million hit against its 2017 salary cap. ",

    "text": "Education may help brains cope with cognitive decline, and treatments for high blood pressure and other health problems may decrease dementia risk. Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library/Getty Images Education may help brains cope with cognitive decline, and treatments for high blood pressure and other health problems may decrease dementia risk. Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library/Getty Images Some encouraging news in the battle against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia: The rate at which older Americans are getting these conditions is declining. That's according to a study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers say one reason for the improved outlook is an increase in education. The study used data gathered in two snapshots, one in 2000 and another in 2012, that each looked at more than 10,000 Americans who were at least 65 years old. In the first snapshot, 11.6 percent of them had some form of dementia. In the second snapshot, it was 8.8 percent. Put in more human terms, \"that's well over a million people who don't have dementia, who would have had it if the rates had stayed the same as 2000 rates,\" says John Haaga , who directs the Division of Behavioral and Social Research at the National Institute on Aging , which funded the study. While the prevalence of dementia cases dropped, the average amount of education in the study population increased. In 2000, the average amount of education was 11.8 years, just shy of the 12 years it usually takes to graduate from high school. In 2012, the average amount of education was 12.7 years \u2014 in other words, high school plus a little bit of college. Article continues after sponsorship Researchers don't know why education should be a protector against dementia, says Dr. Kenneth Langa , a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan and the lead author of the study. But they have some theories. \"One is that education might actually change the brain itself,\" Langa says. \"We think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life.\" Education can not only change the brain, it can change your whole life, says Haaga. \"It affects what kind of work you do, of course. It also affects who your friends are, who you're married too, whether you're married. All aspects of life are affected by educational attainment,\" he says. But the study doesn't say that education alone is the \"X factor\" in preventing dementia. There are medical factors, too. Cardiovascular conditions believed to increase the risk of dementia \u2014 things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes \u2014 are becoming more common, says Haaga. But they're also being treated more aggressively. \"So it could well be that we're getting better at managing the bad effects of these risk factors,\" he says. \"But they are still risk factors.\" This study fits a recent trend. In the past decade or so, other researchers have found similar declines in dementia risk in wealthier nations. But the populations they examined haven't been very diverse. This study is different. It draws on the ongoing Health and Retirement Study that follows about 20,000older Americans of all backgrounds nationwide. Langa says the ethnic, geographic and economic diversity of the subjects makes the trend shown in all these studies more convincing. \"The fact that our study also shows a decline [in the prevalence of dementia], provides additional evidence that this phenomenon seems to be going on across the United States and not in one particular geographic region.\" But while the risk of dementia is declining, the number of cases is still expected to rise. That's because the population of older adults in this country is increasing. The number of people 65 and older is expected to nearly double by 2050. ",

    "text": "By William Wan , Tanya Sichynsky and Sandhya Somashekhar November 21 at 8:52 PM Follow @thewanreport Follow tanyasic Follow @sandhyawp Two weeks after the election of Donald Trump, this is how divided America has become: People have moved beyond staring at the vast gulf that divides them and proceeded to arguing over who is to blame for it, what to do about it and even whether it exists at all. A woman shows her feelings about President-elect Donald Trump in a Chicago coffee shop. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re now divided is being manufactured and spread by the media,\u201d said Trump supporter Loy Brunson, 60, a musician in Provo, Utah. The protesters on the street? \u201cPaid professionals hired to provoke,\u201d Brunson said. The anger and vitriol online? \u201cHillary\u2019s fault ever since she called us deplorables.\u201d The growing number of hate crimes? \u201cPlayed up by the left.\u201d To Kelcey Caulder, 22, the division is painfully real. The college student from Athens, Ga., feels its looming presence every time she thinks about her grandma, a Trump supporter and ardent opponent of abortion rights. They haven\u2019t talked much since Caulder\u2019s grandma found out that Caulder was voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton and told her granddaughter bluntly, \u201cYou\u2019re going to hell.\u201d Caulder tried to be understanding. \u201cI think, in her way, she was trying to be protective of me,\u201d Caulder said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t saying \u2018Kelcey, go to hell.\u2019 It was more like she was saying, \u2018Kelcey, don\u2019t you know this could send you to hell?\u2019 \u201d But when her grandma unfriended her on Facebook, Caulder said, it was hard not to take it personally. Now, she is nervous about Thanksgiving, although she hopes the family dinner could be a chance to reconcile. [ A question on Americans\u2019 minds: What does Trump\u2019s win say about us as a nation? ] Korey, a student at the Georgetown University Law Center, said he is skipping Thanksgiving altogether because of lingering resentments in his family over the election. After he posted an anti-Trump message on Facebook, his father stopped talking to him, and his mother\u2019s ex-husband threatened to write him out of his will. Korey, who asked to be identified by only his first name to avoid further angering his relatives, said he\u2019s not ready to reconcile. In fact, he said, he plans to confront his father over his willingness to overlook offensive statements by Trump about immigrants, minorities, disabled people and women just to beat the Democrats. \u201cThe lesson I took,\u201d Korey said, \u201cwas you can do and say anything you want as long as you\u2019re running as a Republican against Hillary Clinton, which cuts against everything he\u2019s ever taught me about doing the right thing even when it\u2019s not easy.\u201d A supporter of President-elect Donald Trump walks away from a protest near Trump Tower in New York. (Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters) Even companies and commercial products have been forced in recent days to take sides. New Balance shoes were suddenly declared the official footwear of white supremacy by neo-Nazis and set on fire by some anti-Trump customers after a spokesman expressed support for Trump\u2019s trade policies. Trump supporters threatened to boycott Pepsi after PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi said her employees were in mourning. At least three NBA teams said they would no longer stay at Trump hotels. Twitter was celebrated and castigated as it suspended the accounts of various leaders of the \u201calt-right,\u201d a loose collection of far-right conservatives and white nationalists. Even the Girl Scouts organization in New York was drawn into controversy after sending out a post-election email noting: \u201cThroughout the past two days, our girls have been calling us to express their worry about the future \u2014 and THEIR future.\u201d From her home in the Bay Area, Shannon Coulter, 45, has been updating an online Google doc of companies with ties to Trump that she and many other women have decided to boycott. The list includes several big retailers, such as Nordstrom and Macy\u2019s, that carry Trump\u2019s ties, daughter Ivanka\u2019s shoes and other Trump-brand products. Before this election cycle, Coulter, an independent public relations consultant and registered Democrat, said she tried to understand Republicans and other conservatives: \u201cI thought we had enough in common.\u201d Not now. \u201cWe just elected a guy who questioned the nationality of our current president, who talks about how much he likes to grab women by their genitals, who is bringing a white nationalist into the White House,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not something I can work with.\u201d LEFT: Shannon Coulter has created a list of companies to boycott because of their ties to Trump \u2014 a list now being used by some women as form of protest. TOP RIGHT: Writer Leon Wieseltier is urging Trump opponents to stay angry. BOTTOM RIGHT: Trump supporter Loy Brunson, a musician in Provo, Utah, says anger among Trump backers is \u201cHillary\u2019s fault ever since she called us deplorables.\u201d (LEFT: provided by Shannon Coulter; top right by the Associated Press; bottom right provided by Loy Brunson ) \u201cThere are two Americas now,\u201d she added. \u201cI am not part of one of those Americas, and I realized I shouldn\u2019t bother trying to be.\u201d For many Trump supporters, the anger of the left feels similarly alien. \u201cOnce everything calms down, they\u2019ll see how much good Trump will accomplish and that will unite us,\u201d said Ralph Case, 39, a residential contractor in North Canton, Ohio. During the campaign, Case knocked on thousands of doors for Trump. He is now eagerly awaiting the change Trump promised. But for many opposed to Trump, that change is what they fear. Activists who have taken to the street talk about turning their waning protests into a longer term movement to oppose the new president. Tens of thousands of people are donating to civil rights groups such as the ACLU and NAACP. At least 20,000 people donated to Planned Parenthood in the name of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of abortion rights. Many minority groups also feel under attack, especially as Trump has tapped a steady stream of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim conservatives for his administration. Among Muslims, there is disagreement about what to do next, said Colin Christopher, a leader at the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center, one of the largest mosques in Northern Virginia. \u201cThere are a lot of people normalizing what\u2019s going on, as a coping mechanism,\u201d Christopher said, referring to an act many Trump opponents have described disparagingly as taking outrageous comments and behavior by Trump and making them seem normal or mainstream now that he is president-elect. \u201cOther folks in minority communities are normalizing it because they want to have a seat at the table and they think that that\u2019s a survival strategy,\u201d Christopher said. Still others are trying to channel their anger and fear into action. The debate over how to react to the new president has dominated the conversation in the still-nascent opposition camp. Should one stay angry and resist at all costs the idea of normalization? Or should one reach out, listen and understand because \u2014 as some believe \u2014 a lack of empathy is what led to Trump\u2019s rise? Since the election, Puerto Rican singer Tommy Torres, 44, in Miami, has been trying to work through the sense of division and fear in this country. He poured those emotions into a new song. \u201cSome day, I hope not too long from now, we will hold each other's hands and love each other,\u201d he sings in the song. (Omar Cruz ) Sitting in his Miami living room on a recent morning, Tommy Torres, 44, said he was pained by how divided this country had become. A popular Puerto Rican singer, Torres poured those feelings into a song that he posted on YouTube. \u201cIf you voted for Trump, I want to know your reasons,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI have to comprehend them before they can comprehend me.\u201d Writer Leon Wieseltier, trying to work out similar feelings in his home library in the nation\u2019s capital, came to a different conclusion. \u201cI\u2019m all for empathy, but empathy is not agreement,\u201d said Wieseltier, 64, who penned a call to arms published in The Washington Post under the headline, \u201cStay Angry. That\u2019s the only way to uphold principles in Trump\u2019s America.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a moral imperative here,\u201d Wieseltier said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be for or against racism. You have to be against it. You have to agitate for what you believe in.\u201d Staying angry requires sacrifice and vigilance, he said. It means resisting efforts to prettify Trump and make him more palatable, resisting the idea that supporting Trump is a way of supporting America. \u201cThere is honor in loss,\u201d Wieseltier said. \u201cAll you have to do is wake up the next morning and start fighting again.\u201d Abigail Hauslohner contributed to this report. national News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Learn what the Electoral College is in under a minute. USA TODAY NETWORK People stand in line outside a polling station located at Trump Place on Election Day in New York. (Photo: BRYAN R. SMITH, AFP/Getty Images) The presidential election is over. Or is it? Two weeks after Election Day, Donald Trump is assembling his Cabinet while\u00a0votes in many states are still being counted. Hillary Clinton's lead in the popular vote continues to grow. Michigan's 16 electoral votes remain up for grabs. And so the question: How confident can Americans be in the results announced in the wee hours of Nov. 9, given the problems that continue to beset our election system? Here are some answers: Question: Who won the electoral vote? Answer: As of today, Trump has 290 votes to Clinton's 232, with Michigan\u00a0outstanding. Even if Clinton wins there\u00a0\u2013 a possibility despite Trump's lead since election night \u2013 she still would trail, 290-248. Among other states where the vote was close, only Florida could flip the election. But she trails there and in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by too many votes to trigger an automatic recount. Q: Who won the popular vote? A: Clinton's lead of about 1.7 million votes continues to increase, largely due to an influx of absentee and provisional ballots still being counted in California. She has about 63.7 million votes to Trump's 62 million; her margin in California alone is about 3.5 million. Q:\u00a0Where are votes still being counted?\u00a0 A: Most states have yet to report officials results, meaning they are still counting absentee or mail ballots or, more likely, deciding whether to count provisional ballots. Those often are cast by voters whose names did not appear on registration lists, or who may have voted in the wrong place or lacked proper identification. Q: Why does it take so long? A: Millions of ballots come in at the last second -- or, in states that allow it, several days after the election with the proper postmarks. It takes money,\u00a0manpower and accurate voting machines to get every vote counted correctly. \"We vastly underfund the way in which we run our elections,\" says Michael McDonald, a University of Florida associate professor who maintains a web site on the electoral system. \"The bottom line is that you want to get the count right.\u201d Q:\u00a0How close are the two candidates in key battleground states? A: Three thousand votes are all that separate Clinton and Trump in New Hampshire. The margin is about 12,000 in Michigan,\u00a027,000 in Wisconsin, 68,000 in Pennsylvania and 113,000 in Florida -- close, but nothing compared to the 537 votes that separated George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida 16 years ago. Q: Can the votes be recounted? A: Several states, including Pennsylvania and Florida, require the vote difference between the two candidates to be less than one-half of 1 percentage point. In Michigan, a recount is triggered automatically if the margin is less than 2,000 votes. None of those states are close enough at the moment. Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? Q: Is it possible that provisional and absentee voting results vary significantly from Election Day? A: Yes, but it's unlikely. Despite changes in voting laws in some states\u00a0that civil rights groups claim unfairly restrict minorities, the poor and elderly, provisional votes that are accepted usually don't alter\u00a0the results. \u201cThe chances of changing tens of thousands of votes? That\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d says Hans von Spakovsky, a former Federal Election Commission member now at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Q: What's the deal in California? A: It's the largest state, with some of the most permissive voting procedures. More than half the state's votes are cast by absentee ballot, since no excuses are necessary to avoid going to a polling place on Election Day. Provisional ballots are treated more leniently than in many other states, requiring time to correct mistakes that otherwise would cause votes to be\u00a0rejected. Q: So when will the results be official?\u00a0 A: Eight states have certified their results; another four are due to do so Tuesday. Nearly all will complete their counts by Dec. 13, in time for the Dec. 19 meeting of the Electoral College\u00a0-- the 538 individuals who, usually without exception, vote according to the results in each state. In\u00a0some states, the final count may come even later. 224 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 106 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fLVzbx ",

By Elizabeth Dwoskin November 21 at 6:35 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel speaks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio\u00a0earlier this year (Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel is putting together a brain trust of Silicon Valley insiders to share ideas with the transition team for President-elect Donald Trump. But he\u2019s having trouble finding takers. In recent days, the Facebook board member and PayPal cofounder - who is also a member of the Trump transition - has been appealing to fellow entrepreneurs of all political stripes to share their best ideas and possibly join the incoming administration. Thiel has been carrying around an iPad with an editable list of possible candidates, say people familiar with Thiel\u2019s thinking who did not want to be named because the venture capitalist has not made his effort public. Those who have been approached by Thiel have been asked to add other names to the shortlist. Thiel, a libertarian who was shunned by his tech industry peers for being a Trump supporter, is pitching his personal network of entrepreneurs on the opportunity to influence an incoming administration that is somewhat of a blank slate when it comes to technology policy. Because Trump had so few ties to the world of tech, Thiel will have an unusually powerful influence on the new administration, the people familiar with his thinking said. But in the liberal bastion of Silicon Valley \u2014 where Trump is despised and even admitting you\u2019re a Republican can hurt your candidacy for a job \u2013 that coveted opportunity has been fraught with challenges. And some people have turned him down altogether. Thiel declined to comment. People who have joined Thiel form a tight-knit group of conservative and libertarian-leaning entrepreneurs who have long felt ostracized in Silicon Valley for their political views, a source said. Many are excited to finally have a voice in government. Some entrepreneurs who had not been politically active said the opportunity was too good to pass up. \u201cThe chance to influence the government is a huge opportunity,\u201d said Jack Abraham, a serial entrepreneur who is executive director of the Thiel Fellowship. \u201cThere are people who are repulsed by Trump, and it\u2019s understandable - Silicon Valley is very liberal. But it\u2019s unfortunate [that some people don\u2019t want to contribute] because this is a unique opportunity for smart people to inject ideas.\u201d Others who spoke to the Washington Post said people Thiel approached were conflicted: Thiel is revered throughout Silicon Valley for his business acumen, even by those who disagree with his politics. In any other circumstance, being tapped by someone of his stature to have a voice at the highest levels of power would be hugely appealing. Entrepreneurs working in emerging areas that the government has yet to fully regulate, such as the virtual currency bitcoin and drones, see the value in having a line to an administration that so far has had few ties in the tech world. But people who have turned Thiel down felt Trump\u2019s campaign had been too divisive and that an association with Trump could have toxic repercussions in their social and business circles, several people said. The reaction in Silicon Valley reflects a broader dilemma for the incoming administration: Many of the best and brightest are wary of contributing to the incoming government because they fear the ramifications of having ties to Trump. These concerns have played out in recent days among Republicans who are considering whether to serve. People on Thiel\u2019s shortlist include Blake Masters, who co-authored, with Thiel, the book Zero to One, which is read as a business bible in Silicon Valley. Masters is also president of the Thiel Foundation, an organization dedicated to funding young people who want to skip college to pursue an entrepreneurial idea. Other Thiel mentees have been tapped, including Joe Lonsdale and Abraham. Like Masters, Lonsdale met Thiel while he was a libertarian-leaning Stanford student, and co-founded the data-mining startup Palantir Technologies with Thiel. Abraham is executive director of the Thiel Foundation, and Thiel's ties to Abraham include sitting on the board of his startup Zenreach. Balaji Srinivasan, whose startup focusing on the virtual currency bitcoin received funding from Thiel, shares some of his anti-authoritarian ideals. Thiel has advocated for technologists to live in offshore ships that would function as mini-nations to escape regulation; Srinivasan once advocated for technologists to exit the United States and form a separate society that would govern itself. Masters and Srinivasan did not respond to requests for comment. Lonsdale declined to comment. Max Levchin, another PayPal cofounder who is an outspoken critic of Trump, has contributed ideas and suggested others for the shortlist, but does not want to join the administration, a source close to Levchin said. Levchin is on the advisory board at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency created by the Obama administration to police financial institutions. Levchin declined to comment. In speeches leading up to the election, Thiel has pushed for a government agenda that includes greater investments in science and technology. He gave a $1.25 million donation to political groups supporting Trump. Thiel is also a backer of many companies that have pending business with Washington. He\u2019s funded the ride-sharing company Lyft and home-sharing company Airbnb, which have been in the crosshairs with regulators and unions. He also has backed a marijuana business and a drone maker, areas that federal regulators are scrutinizing. The people close to Thiel said he had also told Trump\u2019s team about the the challenges startups had in doing business with the federal government.\u00a0The issue is close to Thiel: Palantir,\u00a0which\u00a0Thiel co-founded, recently won a legal case against the Department of Defense, in which the company claimed that it was sidelined from competing for government contracts. business ",

She cried a lot her first few days at a private Catholic high school in Pomona, missing family back in China. But at least she had freedom to be herself. She could go shopping, watch TV and meet friends at restaurants and teahouses in the vast, Chinese-speaking suburbs of the San Gabriel Valley. Her grades were decent, but the lessons America was supposed to teach her, she didn\u2019t learn until she was in prison. \u201cLife is a course where teachers and parents can\u2019t help, and where there is no choice but you walk by yourself, slowly,\u201d Yang wrote in a letter from the California Institution\u00a0for Women, a correctional facility in Chino. Yang and three other Chinese students were arrested last year for a bullying incident and charged with torture, kidnapping and assault. The victim, another Chinese high school student, said they took her to a park in Rowland Heights, stripped her naked, beat her and burned her with cigarettes. The dispute, according to acquaintances, was sparked by an unpaid dinner bill and regional rivalries. Yang used high-heeled shoes for the beating. Now she is 19 and she has nine years left in her sentence. She doesn\u2019t want to make excuses for what she did, she told The Times in an interview. Being alone in the U.S. put her in what she would only call a strange mind-set. She expressed herself \u201cimpulsively and stupidly.\u201d \u201cObviously, I will never think of doing this again,\u201d she said. Every year, more students like Yang arrive in American schools, dreaming of a different future than the one China allowed them. Many say the\u00a0education they receive in America offers all the support and creative freedom they had hoped for. They\u00a0consider themselves defectors from the unforgiving Chinese educational system in which, every year, 9 million students vie for just 7 million university seats. About a million of those who are rejected\u00a0attend\u00a0colleges overseas. In 2015, 300,000 of those came to the U.S.\u00a0 Problems of alienation and loneliness have grown, however, as a\u00a0growing number  leave the Chinese system even earlier. In the last decade, the number of Chinese students in U.S. high schools and middle schools has jumped from\u00a01,200 to 52,000.\u00a0More than a quarter of these students \u2014 called \u201cparachute kids\u201d\u00a0if they come without their family \u2014\u00a0land in California. Globalization and rapid wealth creation\u00a0have\u00a0put two Chinese traditional values at odds:\u00a0family and education.\u00a0Now, more parents are willing to split their families apart and send their children here alone. \u201cIt\u2019s this mind-set of \u2018I\u2019m going to do everything and sacrifice for you,\u2019 \u201d said Yuying Tsong, a professor at Cal State Fullerton who is conducting a study on parachute kids. \u201cEven if it means we must be separated.\u201d :: At Bill Zhou\u2019s home in Rowland Heights, the clock strikes 7 p.m., trick-or-treaters are ringing the doorbell, and his 17-year-old home-stay student \u2014 who asked to be called only by his last name, Hsu \u2014 has still not come home from school. The parents sacrifice a lot, but they may not remember that the child is also sacrificing a lot. \u2014 Yuying Tsong, a professor at Cal State Fullerton who studies parachute kids As his 6-year-old son cartwheels around the house on a sugar rush, Zhou is getting anxious. He taps out a text. He shifts from the dinner table to the couch, then back again. Finally, he calls, pacing as it rings unanswered. Most Chinese minors studying in the U.S. live in home-stay\u00a0arrangements like this: An acquaintance or a friend or stranger found on the Internet  agrees to feed, house and care for the students for about $1,000 a month. They form a huge, unregulated industry of parental surrogacy that depends largely on  host families to ensure student safety and health.\u00a0 Parachute kids,\u00a0separated from their family and culture at a formative age,\u00a0are more susceptible to isolation, aggression, anxiety, depression and suicide, Tsong said. It\u2019s difficult for home-stay families and schools to reproduce the support students might have had in China. And the pressure on students to make good on their parents\u2019 investment presents even greater challenges. \u201cThe parents sacrifice a lot, but they may not remember that the child is also sacrificing a lot,\u201d Tsong said.\u00a0 Some kids lose their way, said Hsing-Fang Chang, a Pasadena psychologist who specializes in working with Chinese families who  send their kids to study in America. \u201cTeenagers need to connect and belong to their own community,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey look for popular girls, boys or cliques to connect to. And when they don\u2019t have their family around, this need becomes even more strong.\u201d A few minutes after 8 p.m., Hsu arrives. He grins at Zhou\u2019s son, takes off his sneakers and dons black and orange Nike sandals. In his room, he opens his binder to the day\u2019s homework \u2014 \u00a0a vocabulary worksheet with words like \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201caustere\u201d and \u201cgenre.\u201d He sheds his Southlands Christian School sweater and changes into a zip-up hoodie, then sits next to Zhou on the\u00a0couch.\u00a0 Hsu is a shy 17-year-old with owl-like glasses and long combed hair that falls over his eyes when he laughs. He\u2019s skinny but he doesn\u2019t plan to stay that way \u2014 a giant jar of protein powder sits on the shelf above his desk next to a picture of his parents, with whom\u00a0he texts every day.\u00a0 I was below average in China. Here, I am above average. \u2014 Hsu, a Chinese student doing a home stay in Rowland Heights It was his decision to come to the U.S., he said. But then he clarifies that: His father, an executive at a Chinese telecom company, suggested it, and Hsu agreed. Hsu wants to be a dentist when he grows up. Upon further questioning, he admits that becoming a dentist was his mother\u2019s idea, but he doesn\u2019t have a problem with it. Someday he wants to go to UCLA, and that was definitely his call. He\u2019s a huge fan of NBA star and former UCLA star  Russell Westbrook. So far, his new life in America consists of school, basketball and computer games. He has been in the country only three months, and someone has already shouted at him to go back to his country, he said. In the mornings at Southlands Christian School, he lowers his head in prayer. \u00a0More than half of Chinese parachute kids attended private Christian high schools in 2014 \u2014 public schools don\u2019t accept many international students and private schools tend to be religious\u00a0\u2014 and although Hsu\u00a0is not religious, he follows the rules.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know if the school is good. They don\u2019t know if the home stay is good. But everyone else is doing it so they do it too. It\u2019s reckless. \u2014 Bill Zhou, home-stay parent America is growing on him. His English is still weak, but he knows all the lyrics to Eminem and Rihanna\u2019s \u201cLove the Way You Lie.\u201d He feels more relaxed. His grades have improved \u2014 \u00a0A\u2019s in everything except some Bs in gym and math. \u201cI was below average in China,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cHere, I am above average.\u201d Zhou takes pride in Hsu\u2019s success \u2014 he keeps a screenshot of Hsu\u2019s recent report card on his phone and proudly displays it to whoever\u2019s interested. Both Hsu and his American hosts are from Shenzhen, and Zhou\u2019s wife makes local dishes for dinner each night. Zhou wants to make Hsu feel welcome, but he knows that a fatherly pat on the back only goes so far.\u00a0 Parents of children as young as 6 years old have responded to his home-stay ad (he won\u2019t take students that young), and he\u2019s worried that many of them don\u2019t know enough about the situations their children are entering. The vast majority use brokers and agents to arrange their children\u2019s education and housing. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if the school is good. They don\u2019t know if the home stay is good. But everyone else is doing it so they do it too,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cIt\u2019s reckless.\u201d :: In Wuhan, China, Allen Qu\u2019s grades were average, and schools traditionally group students by performance as early as middle school. So Qu was placed on a track for average students, a path that would lead to an average university, followed by an average job and an average future. So one day, his parents told him he was going to America, and he agreed. They dropped him off at a boarding school in San Marino, then went on vacation to New York. Like many Chinese students, Qu, then 15, came to the U.S. because his grades weren\u2019t high enough to match his family\u2019s ambitions. He and his parents believe that an education in the U.S. will give him better job prospects. But studies show that rates of employment and compensation for returnees with American degrees in China are lower than those of domestic graduates. In the end, most families choose an American education for the status, or mianzi, that it confers on the family, said Dennis Yang, a researcher who wrote a book about his experiences embedding with several Chinese families deciding to send their kids abroad. \u201cThey all expect their children to be the valedictorian. If they\u2019re unable to get that, going to an American university is a way to compensate,\u201d Yang said.\u00a0 Qu is now 17, and he\u2019s never discussed mianzi with his parents. \u00a0He\u2019s not sure what he wants to do when he grows up, though he would like to travel and see the world. But at Southwestern Academy, he has friends, a better grade in math and much less homework. The food at the school smells weird to him, but on weekends he and his friends eat at nearby Chinese restaurants and hit Tea Station for boba.\u00a0 He video chats with his parents a few times a month. His mother misses him terribly. His father, who runs a construction materials business, is a little more distant, Qu said. Chinese New Year is the loneliest time, he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really visit,\u201d Qu says. He adds, as if apologizing, that they would come if they had time. The boarding school, which occupies a lush, secluded property, struggles to engage overseas parents, said Robin Jarchow, a dean. The school\u2019s student body is now about 86% international students, and more than half of them are from China. International parents are rarely in town,\u00a0and they and the staff don\u2019t communicate much. The school assigns \u201cdorm parents\u201d to watch over each group of kids, and faculty members sit at every lunch table.\u00a0 For some students, being separated from their parents allows them to grow in ways that life in China would have denied. On a recent weekday at the school, in an art room with a 3-D printer, a Chinese international student aspiring to a career as a product designer sketches plans for a wallet that functions as a phone charger. Next door, some Chinese students gather for band practice.\u00a0 A pink-haired girl from Shanghai plunks out a tune on the piano, working the pedal with gold Vans, while her friend picks up a guitar.\u00a0 The drummer, another Chinese student, sweeps dyed blue hair away from her face and starts the beat. Another Chinese student takes up the mic. The tune emerges, shaky, but recognizable: Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cSay My Name.\u201d :: On her daughter\u2019s last day in China, after all the bags were packed and all the school supplies were purchased, Aimee Guo had just one thing left to do, the most important thing. She drove her daughter, Olivia, to a hair salon in Hangzhou, China. Chinese belief holds that a haircut can bring good luck, symbolizing transition, a way to shake off the past and leave all the bad luck on the ground next to the old hair.\u00a0 The haircut was their ritual before every new school semester. But this one was different, Guo\u00a0said. The past Olivia was\u00a0leaving behind was a happy childhood in a house full of love in Hangzhou. The future wasn\u2019t just a new semester, but, for Guo, a new life as a long-distance mother to a daughter an ocean away. There was lots of crying. But Olivia had been dreaming of this since she was a kid.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t have my own desires for her. I only have one child. I want for her what she wants for herself,\u201d Guo said.\u00a0 While some\u00a0of the students arriving in the U.S. are average or poor students, Olivia was at the top of her class, her mother says. Most students arrive without much English ability, but Olivia, 17, is\u00a0conversant in words like \u201cmicrocosm\u201d and speaks\u00a0fluent English in breathless, tumbling stanzas, all delivered with an air of comic angst. And though many students are forced to come to America by their parents, Olivia\u00a0had to persuade\u00a0her parents. Once her grades improved enough, they let her go. Olivia cried a lot her first few weeks in America. She couldn\u2019t get used to eating her home-stay family\u2019s Mexican food all the time, or how close Americans stood to you when they talked.\u00a0 But she made friends quickly and began to excel at Fairmont Prep Academy, a private school in Anaheim. Her host family was patient and affectionate. A few weeks in, after a Skype session, her father texted her \u201cwo ai ni\u201d \u2014 \u00a0\u201cI love you\u201d \u2014 \u00a0the first time he had ever said it to her. She grew more patient, and more mature, and her grades reflected that. She recently took the SATs for the first time over the summer, and it didn\u2019t go well \u2014 \u00a0she described her score as \u201cbad, bad, bad. Like super bad.\u201d But in a few days, she\u2019ll get something she would have never had in China \u2014 a second chance. She\u2019ll take the SAT again and get another opportunity\u00a0to impress colleges and universities, another shot at achieving her dreams.

Times 9:14 p.m. EST November 21, 2016 x Share Danny Heinrich was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on a single count of possessing child porn. He is also accused of murdering Jacob Wetterling. His family got to speak to Heinrich in court, sharing how that night changed their lives forever. KARE Danny James Heinrich (Photo: Sherburne County Jail) MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Technically, Danny Heinrich was in federal court Monday to be sentenced for possessing\u00a0child pornography. But Heinrich's 20-year sentence, which is the beginning of what could be the rest of his life removed from society, was all about what he did to Jacob Wetterling. Judge John Tunheim, calling it \u201cone of the truly most horrible crimes I have ever seen,\u201d sentenced Heinrich to the maximum allowed for the count to which Heinrich pleaded guilty.\u00a0It was a sentence enhanced because Heinrich kidnapped and murdered Jacob in October 1989, 10\u00a0months\u00a0after he\u00a0kidnapped and sexually assaulted Jared Scheierl. Tunheim heard the pained words of Jerry and Patty Wetterling and their children. He also heard from Scheierl and Aaron Larson, who was with Jacob and Jacob\u2019s brother, Trevor, the night Jacob was taken. With numerous people sobbing in the courtroom, Patty Wetterling was the last to speak. She took some of her time to speak directly to Heinrich. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to kill him,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cHe did nothing wrong. He just wanted to go home.\u201d Attorney: Minn. man plans to apologize for boy's murder and sexual assault Several Wetterling family members told Tunheim that the gravity of Jacob\u2019s murder was made worse by the fact that Heinrich\u00a0concealed it for nearly 27 years, knowing a small town, a region, a state, a nation was searching and grieving. \u201cThe worst part is for nearly 27 years, he made us believe we might see Jacob again,\u201d Jacob's\u00a0sister, Amy, told Tunheim. \u201cLosing Jacob was hard enough,\" said his brother, Trevor. \"But for this man to hold this secret for almost 27 years and continue to be free is, as Jacob would say, entirely not fair.\u201d Heinrich showed little emotion and spoke briefly before he was sentenced. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Wetterling,\u201d he said, before a long pause. \u201cThe heinous acts, the selfishness are unforgivable for what I have taken away from you. I am so sorry.\u201d He also apologized to Scheierl, who left the courtroom before Heinrich spoke. Scheierl told Tunheim that he didn\u2019t want to hear anything from the man who abducted him as he was walking on a Cold Spring, Minn., street in January 1989 and raped him. Suspect gives chilling details about 1989 killing of Jacob Wetterling \u201cHe should know that the words that he had spoke to me on that evening haunted me for years, and I don\u2019t choose to hear anything he wishes to say at this time,\u201d Scheierl told Tunheim. \u201cI would just simply like to say to him, there\u2019s nothing uncommon about common sense. I just wish you had more common sense.\u201d Heinrich in September pleaded guilty to one of 25 child pornography charges. As part of that plea agreement, he agreed to tell investigators where they could find Jacob\u2019s remains. He admitted taking Jacob at gunpoint as Jacob biked along a county road with Trevor and Aaron. He said he handcuffed Jacob and drove him to a rural Paynesville location, sexually assaulted him and shot him twice in the head. Heinrich said he buried Jacob and returned a year later to move the remains, which could be seen protruding from the ground. Larson said he carried guilt with him for years because he ran when Heinrich told him to and he left Jacob behind with a masked man who jumped out of the woods holding a gun. \"For 20 years I lived with a huge amount of guilt from the choices that were made from that night,\" Larson said. \"I lived every day thinking I was the monster that night. I was the coward that left my friend. I was the coward that ran away.\u201d At that September plea, Heinrich also admitted kidnapping and sexually assaulting Scheierl. Heinrich said he was \u201cdriving around Cold Spring, looking for a child\u201d when he spotted Scheierl on a dark street. He drove around with Scheierl before sexually assaulting the boy\u00a0and then letting him go. Scheierl said the sentencing of Heinrich is something that\u2019s been a long time coming. \u201cAt times I thought that this day may never come, but it\u2019s here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here today to hear the level of pain and trauma that Danny Heinrich has inflicted on a number of people through the course of 27 years or longer.\u201d Scheierl said he was left as a young child a victim of physical, verbal and sexual assault, left that night to deal with emotions and\u00a0questions,\u00a0trying to seek clarity in his own life. \u201cI can say that this is just one more step in gaining closure to an incident in my life that has defined me in many ways,\u201d he said. Prosecutor Julie Allyn called Heinrich a predator who showed no remorse and only admitted his role in Jacob\u2019s killing because it would get him less time in prison. \u201cDanny Heinrich only does what is good for Danny Heinrich,\u201d she said. Tunheim told Heinrich that his actions changed the way parents raise their kids, that he took away what had been a carefree security of being a child. He made real the boogeyman who would jump out of the woods, out of the dark and snatch a child who would never be\u00a0seen again. \u201cEvery child knows the story of Jacob Wetterling,\"\u00a0Tunheim said. \"You stole the innocence of children\u2019s lives in the small towns and rural areas, the cities of Minnesota and beyond.\u201d Follow David Unze on Twitter: @sctimesunze 73 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gdRtaV ",

It must be shut down immediately.\" But doesn't that exact-same line of argument apply to Trump and his business interests now that he's president-elect? Consider: The Washington Post reports how foreign diplomats are now staying at Trump's DC hotel as a way to curry favor with the new administration. \"'Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, \"I love your new hotel!\" Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, \"I am staying at your competitor?\"' said one Asian diplomat.\" The New York Times notes how Trump's Indian business partners met with him in New York last week. \"In a telephone interview, Atul Chordia, one of the developers who met last week with Mr. Trump, played down the appointment as a 'two-minute' congratulatory conversation in which no business was transacted and no new projects were discussed. But newspapers in India reported it as a business meeting, illustrated with a photograph of the beaming real estate executives \u2014 Atul Chordia, Sagar Chordia and Kalpesh Mehta \u2014 flanking the future president, and indicated that the builders and Mr. Trump's organization are planning further collaborative real estate projects.\" And as we mentioned on Friday , daughter Ivanka Trump -- who is likely to help run Trump's business empire -- sat in on a meeting Thursday with Japan's prime minister. Priebus: \"We're looking at this right now\" Asked about these potential conflicts of interest, incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on \"Meet the Press\" yesterday : \"We're looking at this right now Chuck, as well. And like, like I said before, we're going to make sure that no matter what decisions are made, that they're going to be run through counsel. And as you know, there's a White House Counsel's office that will be there, that will be issuing opinions and these matters will all be dealt with, they'll all be dealt with accordingly.\" But if the Clinton Foundation was problematic because it was seen as a way to curry favor with a then-secretary of state and possible president, and if the GOP's call was to shut it down \"immediately,\" then how is Trump's business any different? And why shouldn't immediate action be taken to deal with it? As the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page recommended last week, the only real solution is for Trump to liquidate his stake in his company. \"Millions of Americans have put their trust in Mr. Trump to succeed as President and improve their lives, not treat this as a four-year hiatus from his business. The presidential stakes are too high for Mr. Trump to let his family business become a daily political target.\" Play ",

Got it The cast of \"Hamilton\" delivered a message to Vice President-elect Mike Pence from stage after he watched the show at Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful) By Paul Farhi November 21 at 4:19 PM Follow @farhip He\u2019s out there, lurking, his fingers poised on the buttons. At any moment, he may strike. News, inevitably, will follow. As he illustrated with tweets about the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump knows how to change the subject \u2014 and the entire news cycle. Just as questions were mounting about Trump\u2019s appointments, his business conflicts, his $25 million fraud-case settlement \u2014 bam! \u2014 Trump had everyone talking about something else. In this case, a Broadway show. Whether inadvertent or part of a calculated media strategy (there\u2019s evidence going both ways), Trump has proved he\u2019s very, very good at hijacking the national conversation. All politicians want to talk about their issues, but Trump is a cruise missile when it comes to butting in. He\u2019s the Distractor in Chief. The \u201cHamilton\u201d flap \u2014 \u201cApologize!,\u201d Trump demanded after the cast of the show read a message about inclusiveness to the departing figure of Vice-President-elect Mike Pence \u2014 was vintage Trump. Time and again during the campaign, Trump dropped a verbal bomblet that shifted the day\u2019s media focus away from whatever else was threatening to displace him. Some audience members booed Vice President-elect Mike Pence as he walked to his seat at a \"Hamilton\" show, held at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. (Storyful) Trump made everyone forget his rather weak first primary debate performance, and the embarrassing opening question about his treatment of women posed by moderator Megyn Kelly, by unleashing an epic Twitter jihad against Kelly immediately afterward. His vilification culminated with his infamous incantation that \u201cthere was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,\u201d as he told CNN , making Kelly\u2019s fairness the issue rather than his own behavior. Just when Trump\u2019s headline-hogging ways began to flag last December because of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, he reignited media interest by proposing a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. He tapped the pedal again in late January by boycotting a Fox-sponsored primary debate held just before the Iowa caucuses. In February, he all but short-circuited headlines about Marco Rubio\u2019s strong debate performance by rolling out an endorsement from Chris Christie . \u201cTrump has been able to disrupt the news pretty much any time he wants, whether by being newsworthy, offensive, salacious or entertaining,\u201d wrote data guru Nate Silver not long thereafter. \u201cThe media has almost always played along.\u201d And so on: Trump drew coverage to himself during the Democratic convention \u2014 Clinton\u2019s ostensible moment in the sun \u2014 by calling on the Russian government to find and release the emails Clinton had deleted from her private server. ( Just kidding , he later said, but then he said maybe he wasn\u2019t. ) Trump hasn\u2019t held a news conference since July, but that says little about his ability to make, and shape, the news. He\u2019s given a series of interviews (most recently his post-election sitdown with \u201c60 Minutes \u201d), but interviews aren\u2019t really necessary, either. Trump has 15.2 million Facebook likes and 15.7 million Twitter followers , giving him a massive megaphone requiring no meddlesome media middleman. \u201cPresidents do like to change the subject from time to time, but never daily,\u201d laughs Stephen Hess , a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution in Washington, whose direct experience with presidents stretches to the Eisenhower administration. Hess doesn\u2019t buy the idea that Trump is being strategic in shifting the conversation his way. \u201cI thought it was a campaign strategy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now we think of it just as Trump being Trump.\u201d Fair point. Some of Trump\u2019s stunts might just be impulsive, even counterproductive. In a rare act of contrition, Trump conceded that his mean-spirited retweet about Heidi Cruz in March was \u201ca mistake .\u201d Similarly, his dead-of-night tweetstorm attacking former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado probably did Trump no favors, especially among women, which is exactly why Clinton brought up Machado in the first presidential debate. It might also have been the reason Trump\u2019s campaign aides wrested his Twitter account away from him during the final weeks of the race. Yet here he is again, back on Broadway. Trump\u2019s \u201cHamilton\u201d tweets became the soundtrack of the weekend, widely discussed on television and in social media, and occupying prime real estate on Sunday newspaper fronts. Some saw that as the entire point of those tweets: an effective way to change the conversation from topics Trump might not have been as eager to talk about. \u201cIn the villainous golden lair he maintains in Trump Tower, [Trump] laughed his best Dr. Evil laugh,\u201d wrote media critic Jack Shafer at Politico . \u201c\u2018Got \u2019em again,\u2019 he thought.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper called the tweets \u201cweapons of mass distraction\u201d in a promotion for a segment about them on his Sunday program, \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Vox.com\u2019s headline put it even more sharply: \u201cDon\u2019t let Donald Trump\u2019s antics distract you from what\u2019s really important. \u201d (Among the \u201cimportant\u201d things Vox suggested Trump was directing attention from: the conflicts inherent in marketing his new luxury hotel in Washington to foreign diplomats.) \u201cIt\u2019s off-base to ascribe an intent to deflect in these \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tweets,\u201d argues Gabriel Kahn, a journalism professor at USC\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication. \u201cThey are entirely consistent with the thin-skinned, petulant character of the president-elect. He clearly can\u2019t help himself, and to think that this is part of a thought-out strategy gives him too much credit.\u201d Those in the news media note that it\u2019s possible to cover more than one story about Trump at once. And the \u201cHamilton\u201d story registered on several levels. New York Times Editor Dean Baquet points out that his newspaper had four other Trump-related stories on its front page on Sunday in addition to the one about \u201cHamilton,\u201dincluding a profile of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and an update on the transition . The controversy over what happened in the theater \u201cwas a very powerful illustration of the different ways Americans view the world. Some saw the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 cast as courageous and others saw it as insulting. That\u2019s a good story.\u201d And, he added, \u201cwhen the [president-elect] tweets at the cast of the biggest play in a generation, that\u2019s news.\u201d Baquet\u2019s counterpart at The Washington Post, Martin Baron, made a similar point, saying the story didn\u2019t push anything of importance off the paper\u2019s front page, which included a profile of Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon , and a report on the president-elect\u2019s meeting with Mitt Romney. \u201cThe \u2018Hamilton\u2019 story was one of intense reader interest, probably because it brought into especially sharp relief the tensions in American society after this presidential election,\u201d Baron said. \u201cIt also happened to spark a vigorous conversation about free expression.\u201d lifestyle ",

    "text": "WATCH 6.9-Magnitude Earthquake Reported in Japan: USGS 0 Shares Email A 6.9-magnitude earthquake has been reported in Fukushima, Japan, according to the United States Geological Survey. Tremors from the earthquake could be felt as far away as Tokyo, about 150 miles south of the epicenter. Hazardous tsunamis are possible for parts of Japan's east coast within 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) of the earthquake's epicenter, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. There is no tsunami threat to Hawaii. At least four small tsunamis were detected following the earthquake. Fukushima's Iwaki City shore detected a tsunami around 6:49 a.m. local time, according to the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), which broadcast a live shot from the city's Onahama port. A 2-foot-high tsunami was observed at the post at 6:49 a.m. local time. Tsunamis were also detected at Katsuura port in Chiba prefecture, Soma port in Fukushima prefecture and Oarai port in Ibaragi prefecture at just after 7 a.m. local time, NHK reported. Minor injuries were reported. The earthquake hit in the Pacific Ocean east of Japan just before 6 a.m. Tuesday local time, at a depth of about 7 miles, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. A tsunami warning was issued for Fukushima's coast. A tsunami advisory was issued north and south of Fukushima, the agency reported. People living in several coastal prefectures were told to evacuate immediately. The water cooling system has stopped operating at the third reactor at the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant, said Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. But there are no concerns of sudden rises in the spent fuel pool or radiation leaks, Suga said. No abnormalities were found at TEPCO's nuclear power stations after the earthquake, TEPCO said. In March 2011 the same region was hit by a 9-magnitude earthquake, which unleashed a devastating tsunami that killed thousands of people. The tsunami caused a nuclear disaster when it hit the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, resulting in a release of radioactive materials. The 2011 disaster was a triple threat, since Japan was hit with an earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown within a matter of hours. This is a breaking news story.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 21, 2016 7:22 PM EST The far right-wing group known as the alt-right latched onto to the Donald Trump campaign -- and some of its leaders say his victory has given them a big boost. \u201cHail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,\u201d was heard over the weekend at a meeting in Washington, D.C. A meeting of the National Policy Institute \u2013 an alt-right think tank \u2013 drew hundreds to the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington.\u00a0 Since 2008, the alt- or alternative-right movement lived mostly on obscure message boards online.\u00a0 It gained more attention after Donald Trump hired Steve Bannon to run his presidential campaign in August. \u00a0 Bannon\u2019s Breitbart website is, among other things, seen as the largest platform for the alt-right message \u00a0-- with more than 300 million views in the last month. Steve Bannon, campaign CEO for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, right, looks on during a national security meeting with advisers at Trump Tower, Friday, Oct. 7, 2016, in New York.\u00a0 Close Evan Vucci, AP Thirty-eight-year old Richard Spencer, who is president of the National Policy Institute, said he is enthusiastic about Bannon acting as the strategist for President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0 \u201cBecause Breitbart has been an open place for a lot of ideas that I care about,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Bannon denies being alt-right. Trump team defends controversial pick for top White House role Its members are usually college-educated white males, with strong right-wing views. They are difficult to define because of the wide range of members \u2013 from those who believe that America will be great only when it looks out for itself, to those who believe in anti-immigration and white dominance.\u00a0 \u201cThey say instead of asking what\u2019s good for the world they ask what is good for us,\u201d explained Professor Thomas Main, a public policy professor at Baruch College in New York City.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print When the Oakland Raiders and Houston Texans face off Monday night in Mexico City\u2019s Estadio Azteca, the teams will have to battle more than just their opponents come kick-off. In the first NFL game in the country in more than 11 years, players and fans alike will have to contend with rampant street crime, simmering anger by many Mexicans over the election of Donald Trump, suffocating levels of smog and the bewildering effects of the stadium\u2019s high altitude. While the crime rate in Mexico City is a far cry from that in the northern part of the country, where drug cartels hold sway, the capital city has recently seen an uptick in homicides and other violent crimes. Homicides\u00a0in the city shot up by more than 20 percent last year to levels not seen since 1998 -- and\u00a0in spite of more than $1 billion spent on public security in 2015,\u00a0 recent studies show\u00a0 that\u00a0a third of Mexico City\u2019s population was a victim of crime\u00a0and two-thirds said they do not trust the local police. The threat of violent crime caused Texans\u2019 management to warn players not to leave the hotel during their trip south of the border. According to The Associated Press, a section of a memo sent to Texans\u2019 players under the heading \"safety\" had a bullet point with: \"DO NOT leave the hotel.\" It was followed by a line advising players to leave all \"expensive jewelry at home,\" not to bring large sums of money and not to use ATMs. Raiders\u2019 players did not receive any type of memo or written warning. Related Image Expand / Contract (The Associated Press) Experts on Latin American security say that, despite the warning and statistics, so long as players and fans use common sense they should have very few problems in regards to their personal safety. \u201cFans and players need to be aware and careful if they\u2019re in Mexico City, but just as careful as they would be in any large city in the U.S,\u201d Chris Wilson, the deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe murder rate in the city is lower than Washington D.C.\u2019s, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big an issue as many people are making it out to be.\u201d Given the large presence of media from the United States covering the game, there is speculation that there could be demonstrations against the election of Donald Trump. During the president-elect\u2019s trip to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto during his campaign, the city saw widespread protests and there is some concern of a repeat during the Monday Night Football game. Related Image Expand / Contract President-elect Trump with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. (The Associated Press ) Jay Rothman, ESPN's vice president of production and the \"Monday Night Football\" producer, said that the channel is not planning to focus any anti-Trump protests, but if they occur they will cover them. \"We wear our news hats, too, and we will get together and discuss that,\" Rothman said. \"If there are things outside and inside the stadium to cover, we would be criticized for ignoring them and we need to do the right thing.\u201d The biggest concern so far has not been crime or unrest, but the air in Mexico City \u2013 both in terms of its quality and how much of it the players will be breathing on the field. Mexico City is notorious for the thick layer of smog that hangs over the town and can range from a minor nuisance to a nauseating presence depending on the weather, time of year and traffic on the street. While the city has seen improvements to its smog problems over the last decade thanks to catalytic converters being installed on cars and bans on driving during certain days, it can still pose a risk, especially to athletes hoping to perform at the top of their game. Related Image Expand / Contract (The Associated Press) \u201cThe smog in Mexico City is not as bad as some of the cities in China,\u201d said Wilson, who returned last week from a trip to the city. \u201cIt\u2019s more like Los Angeles on a bad day.\u201d Mexico City\u2019s government keeps hourly tabs on the air quality and as of early afternoon the section of the city where Estadio Azteca is located was deemed to be in good condition. Besides the pollution, however, there is the lack of air that players will have to deal with during their time on the Mexican gridiron. Sitting at an altitude of 7,380 feet, Estadio Azteca is 2,100-feet higher than Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver and both the Raiders and Texans play their home games at stadiums less than 50 feet above sea level. \u201cThe altitude is a real concern for these players,\u201d Jason Marczak, director of the Latin America Economic Growth Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, told FoxNews.com. \u201cFor running backs, wide receivers, and other players that have to run a lot, it\u2019s going to be a tough game.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "text": "Nov 21 2016, 3:50 pm ET Who Is Mad Dog Mattis, Trump's Likely Pick for Defense Chief? by Ken Dilanian and Courtney Kube Share advertisement James Mattis, the retired Marine general who is under consideration to be Donald Trump's secretary of defense, is beloved among military types for publicly proclaiming the things many of them whisper in private. In 2005, for example, he was speaking at a panel discussion in San Diego, when he described how enjoyable it can be to kill the enemy in war. \"Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot,\" Mattis said, prompting laughter from some military members in the audience. \"It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.\" President-elect Donald Trump with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis in Bedminster, N.J.,on Nov. 19, 2016. Carolyn Kaster / AP He continued, \"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,\" Mattis said. \"You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\" That is the kind of rhetoric befitting a military leader with the nickname, \"Mad Dog.\" But Mattis, who retired in 2013 and joined a conservative think tank, is more cerebral than his nickname -- which he dislikes - would suggest. He is also known as a \"warrior monk,\" who has devoted his life to the military (he is unmarried) and has thought deeply about military strategy. Now 66, the Pacific Northwest native graduated what was then Central Washington State College in 1972. He became famous for leading the 1st Marine Division's lightning fast movement into Baghdad during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. That is one reason his possible selection has drawn praise from multiple quarters, including Democrats, traditional Republicans and Trump loyalists. \"General Mattis is a storied and much respected military thinker,\" Michele Flournoy, who by all accounts would have led the Pentagon had Hillary Clinton become president, told NPR Monday. \"He would be an outstanding candidate.\" Play Trump's potential cabinet under microscope 2:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161122010248if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/814295107940\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Like Rep. Mike Pompeo -- Trump's pick to be CIA director -- Mattis is known as a hardliner on Iran. Before he retired he was commander of U.S. Central Command, which covers the Middle East, and he alienated the Obama White House with a confrontational approach to Iran, current and former U.S. officials have said. Shortly after he left, he criticized the administration over what officials charged was a plot by Iran to assassinate the Saudi ambassador at a Washington, D.C. restaurant. Mattis said the plot was orchestrated \"at the highest levels\" of the Iranian government, and he criticized the fact that the U.S. treated it as a law enforcement matter. \"I don't know why [it] wasn't dealt with more strongly,\" he said. Mattis, whose gravelly voice and steely eloquence is right out of central casting, has become known for a series of frank quotes that underscore the brutal nature of war. At least one has ended up on a not-safe-for-work t-shirt . According to a compilation published by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Mattis once said he believed the U.S. should \"Find the enemy that wants to end this experiment (in American democracy) and kill every one of them until they're so sick of the killing that they leave us and our freedoms intact.\" In 2003, according to the book \"Fiasco,\" an account of the Iraq War by journalist Tom Ricks, Mattis told a group of Iraqi commanders: \"The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some assholes in the world that just need to be shot.\" But Mattis is also famous for telling his Marines: \"The most important six inches on the battlefield is between your ears.\" Another famous Mattis story is the time he worked on Christmas in 1998. Charles Krulak, who was the Marine Commandant at the time, told Stars and Stripes newspaper that when he arrived to deliver holiday cookies to a Marine command at Quantico, Virginia, he was told that the duty officer was Mattis, then a brigadier general. \"So I said to him, 'Jim, what are you standing the duty for?' \" Krulak told the military newspaper. \"And he said, 'Sir, I looked at the duty roster for today and there was a young major who had it who is married and had a family; and so I'm a bachelor, I thought why should the major miss out on the fun of having Christmas with his family, and so I took the duty for him.' \" Ken Dilanian ",

    "text": "(Natalie Kitroeff) In all, about 7 million men ages\u00a025 to 54 are neither employed nor \u201cavailable for work,\u201d putting them outside the labor force.\u00a0Their growing numbers worry\u00a0and puzzle\u00a0economists. A little more than half of the men reported they were ill or disabled, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 14% are going to school. And about 20% said they were either retired or handling home responsibilities. Economists said increased globalization and the decline in factory jobs has played a major role in pushing prime-aged men, particularly those with less education,\u00a0out of the workforce. But that doesn\u2019t explain why the problem is worse in the U.S. than in most other economically advanced nations. Researchers have pointed to some other potential explanations. Prime-age American men outside the labor force are spending more time playing video games, making leisure time more enjoyable.\u00a0About half are in so much pain from physical maladies that they take daily medication for it, making holding a job difficult. And in a problem drawing more attention from economists, the nation\u2019s high incarceration rate has left many men\u00a0with felony convictions that raise red flags during employer background checks. While the reasons may be up for debate, having so many men failing to contribute has troubling implications for the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. There\u2019s absolutely nothing good that comes out of it,\u201d said Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank.\u00a0\u201cIt is certainly near the center of so much that is sad and wrong about the way our society and our economy are performing today.\u201d The problem has been building for a long time.\u00a0 The percentage of prime-aged men in the U.S. workforce \u2014\u00a0those either with a job or\u00a0actively looking for one \u2014\u00a0peaked at 97.9% in 1954. But since the mid-1960s, the labor force participation rate for those men has steadily declined. The rate has varied during economic booms and busts, but generally has been on a downward trend. The rate bottomed out at 88% in 2014 and has been hovering near there ever since. The figure was 88.6% in October. The labor force participation rate for women rose sharply from the mid-1960s through the 1980s as it became more socially acceptable for them to work. But the rate for women has fallen off in recent years, too, to\u00a056.8% in October. The overall participation rate for men and women over 16 years old was 62.8% last month. The Obama administration was concerned enough about the trend and its implications that the White House Council of Economic Advisors issued a 47-page report this summer examining the reasons for the decline and policies that could help address it.\u00a0Eberstadt wrote a book on the subject, \u201cMen Without Work, America\u2019s Invisible Crisis,\u201d that was published in September. And economists have been studying the phenomenon. Alan Krueger , a Princeton economist, published a paper last month titled \u201cWhere Have All the Workers Gone?\u201d that said \u201caddressing the decades-long slide in labor force participation by prime age men should be a national priority.\u201d \u201cWe're not fully utilizing the human resources we have and that means the economy is not performing as well as it could be,\u201d Krueger said in an interview. \u201cThat means our overall standard of living is lower because output is lower than it can be.\u201d Krueger, who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisors from 2011 to 2013, added to the debate over the issue by conducting a survey that found that 47% of prime-aged men who are out of the workforce said they took pain medication the previous day. Nearly two-thirds of those reported that they took prescription painkillers. When asked if pain prevented them from working at a full-time job, 40% of prime-aged men out of the workforce said yes,\u00a0Krueger found. He said he hasn\u2019t been able to determine if the pain problems are a cause or an effect for the men being out of the workforce.\u00a0 \u201cI suspect the arrows go in both directions,\u201d Krueger said. \u201cSome had severe disabilities that caused them to withdraw [from the workforce]\u00a0and others became despondent and perhaps obese from their lifestyles which caused disability problems.\u201d Research this year by Krueger\u2019s Princeton colleague, economist Mark Aguiar, pointed to another potential reason \u2014\u00a0the lure of video games. Video games have become more elaborate and sophisticated, while online gaming has expanded the universe of people to play against.\u00a0 The life of these nonworking, lower-skilled young men looks like what my son wishes his life was like now: not in school, not at work, and lots of video games. \u2014 Erik Hurst, University of Chicago economist Men ages 21-30 who were not in the workforce reported spending an average of 6.7 hours a week playing video games from 2012 to 2015, compared with just 3.6 hours from 2000 to 2007. The figures are higher for men in that age group with less than a college education.\u00a0Erik Hurst, an economist at the\u00a0University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business,\u00a0found that those men spent an average of two hours a day on video games in 2014, with 10% of them reporting playing for six hours a day. About seven in 10 lower-skilled men in their 20s without a job lived with a parent or close relative, according to his research. But despite that, they reported being happier on average than they were in the early 2000s. \u201cThe life of these nonworking, lower-skilled young men looks like what my son wishes his life was like now: not in school, not at work, and lots of video games,\u201d Hurst wrote recently. Eberstadt said the \u201cmost scandalously ignored\u201d reason why so many prime-aged men are not in the workforce is the nation\u2019s high incarceration rate. As many as 20 million Americans, most of them men, have a felony record. That could help explain why the labor force problem is worse here than in other advanced economies, he said. The U.S. has the world\u2019s second-highest prison population rate \u2014\u00a0698 prisoners for every 100,000 people, according to the Institute for Criminal Policy\u00a0Research. People in prison are not counted in any way in U.S. labor statistics, which look only at the civilian non-institutionalized population. \u201cIs there discrimination against felons and ex-cons? Do they lose their skills in jail?\u201d Eberstadt said. \u201cThis is a huge missing piece of the puzzle.\u201d Joel Valdez, 32, of Los Angeles, was paroled in June from California\u2019s Chuckawalla Valley State Prison\u00a0after more than 15 years behind bars for his conviction on two counts of assault with a firearm. He\u2019s been working at a voter-engagement phone bank that employs mostly former inmates and is operated by LA Voice, a faith-based community organization. But it\u2019s been difficult to find work with a felony record and, even though he earned a high-school equivalency degree in prison, he didn\u2019t get much training. \u201cI know that, more often than not, if I\u2019m not working in a warehouse or getting my foot in the door through labor jobs or having family friends, that it would be super hard to get a job because of my background,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cSome people are sketchy about hiring people with that background. It\u2019s tough.\u201d A Los Angeles\u00a0City Council committee approved an ordinance in September that would prevent most employers from asking about a job applicant\u2019s criminal history until after a conditional offer has been made. Reforming the criminal justice system, including \u201cimproving reentry into the workforce for the formerly incarcerated,\u201d is among the ways to get more prime-aged men back into the workforce, according to the White House report. Its other recommendations included changing the tax code to expand work incentives and creating more demand for workers through funding for infrastructure upgrades. Eberstadt said that overhauling disability programs also could help push more prime-aged men back into the workforce by removing a key source of income. Expanding health insurance coverage also could address the problem of out-of-work men taking painkillers. \u201cIf men have preventative care and treat problems earlier on it could prevent them from causing the kinds of chronic pain that seems to be a barrier to work for so many people,\u201d Krueger said.

A Tsunami warning has been issued after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck off Fukushima in Japan. Associated Press A powerful earthquake off Japan\u2019s northeastern shore Tuesday sent residents fleeing to higher ground and prompted worries about the Fukushima nuclear power plant destroyed by a tsunami five years ago. Lines of cars were seen snaking away from the coast in the predawn hours after authorities issued a tsunami warning and urged residents to seek higher ground immediately. The warning was lifted nearly four hours later. The magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck in the same region that was devastated by a tsunami in 2011, killing about 18,000 people. There were reports of minor injuries and damage, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. The earthquake shook buildings in Tokyo, 150 miles southwest of the epicenter. NHK also showed one person's video of water rushing up a river or canal, but well within the height of the embankment. It was eerily reminiscent of the 2011 disaster, when much larger tsunamis rushed up rivers and overflowed, wiping away entire neighborhoods. On Tuesday, tsunami waves were recorded along the coast. The highest one\u00a0was 4.6 feet in Sendai Bay. A tsunami advisory for waves of up to 3 feet remained in effect along the coast.\u00a0 WATCH LIVE: Coverage from Japan public broadcasting >> The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant said there were no abnormalities observed at the plant, though a swelling of the tide of up to 3 feet was detected offshore. The plant was swamped by the 2011 tsunami, sending three reactors into meltdown and leaking radiation into the surrounding area. The plant is being decommissioned but the situation remains serious as the utility figures out how to remove still-radioactive fuel rods and debris and what to do with the melted reactor cores. Plant operator TEPCO said a pump that supplies cooling water to a spent fuel pool at the nearby Fukushima Daini plant stopped working, but that a backup pump had been launched to restore cooling water to the pool. Both plants are run by Tokyo-based TEPCO. Naohiro Masuda, head of TEPCO's decommissioning unit, said he believes that the pump was shut off automatically by a safety system as the water in the pool shook. He said decommissioning work at the destroyed Daiichi plant had been temporarily suspended because of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake\u2019s magnitude at 6.9.

Vatican Pool/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Vatican Pool/Getty Images Pope Francis closes the Holy Door in St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday in Vatican City, marking the end of the Jubilee Year of Mercy. Vatican Pool/Getty Images Pope Francis has declared that abortion, which remains a \"grave sin\" in the eyes of the Catholic Church, can be absolved by ordinary priests for the foreseeable future \u2014 instead of requiring the intervention of a bishop. The change was implemented on a temporary basis, for one year only, as part of the Catholic Church's \"Year of Mercy,\" which began last December and ended on Sunday. In a letter released on Monday, the pope announced that the change was being extended indefinitely. Pope Calls Abortion Evidence Of 'The Throwaway Culture' \"I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,\" the pope wrote in the letter . \"In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father. May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation.\" \"Because the Roman Catholic Church holds abortion to be such a serious sin, it had long put the matter of granting forgiveness for it in the hands of a bishop, who could either hear the woman's confession himself or delegate that to a priest who was expert in such situations,\" The Associated Press explains. Article continues after sponsorship On Divorce And Remarriage, Pope Calls For More Grace, Less Dogma In the U.S., Catholic News Service reports , most bishops have routinely granted the faculty to their priests, but the Year of Mercy made the permission universal. In the letter released Monday, the pope indicated he was extending the ability to absolve abortions \"lest any obstacle arise between the request for reconciliation and God's forgiveness.\" The Pope Commemorates The Reformation That Split Western Christianity As the Two-Way reported last year, when the change for the Year of Mercy was announced, allowing priests to grant absolution for abortion does not constitute a \"doctrinal shift\" for the church. \"Forgiveness has always been available \u2014 albeit through more formal channels,\" Candida R. Moss , a professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame, told NPR at the time. \"That message wasn't out there because the rhetoric that accompanies abortion is so elevated that it eclipses the Church's teaching on forgiveness and mercy.\" ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 21, 2016 4:52 PM EST NEW YORK - Three benchmark U.S, stock indexes closed at record highs, the first time that has happened in more than 16 years. The price of oil rose about 4 percent as investors hope the countries in OPEC, which collectively produce more than a third of the world\u2019s oil, will soon finalize a deal that would lower oil production and help support prices. The gains were widespread, with technology, basic materials and utility companies all moving higher.\u00a0 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 18,957, topping the record close it set last week. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index added 16 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,198. The Nasdaq composite finished at 5,369, up 47 points, or 0.9 percent, beating its all-time high from September. The last time all those indexes set records on the same day was Dec. 31, 1999, according to Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial.\u00a0 For the year, the Dow is up 1,531.66 points, or 8.8 percent; the S&P 500 is up 154.24 points, or 7.5 percent; and the Nasdaq is up 361.45 points, or 7.2 percent. An index of small-company stocks, which have outpaced the market this month, is also at a record high. The Russell 2000 has climbed for 12 straight trading days. Investors are betting that smaller companies will benefit from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plans to lower corporate taxes and loosen regulations. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Financial markets are also betting that OPEC countries will soon be able to finalize a deal that would cut oil production and help support prices. Meat producer Tyson Foods is tumbling after it reported weak fourth-quarter results. The Dow has been setting records since the presidential election earlier this month, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached all-time highs this summer. Small-company stocks, which are at record highs already, also continued to climb. Benchmark New York crude gained $1.96, or 4.3 percent, to $47.65 a barrel while Brent crude, the international standard, rose $2.09, or 4.5 percent, to $48.95 a barrel in London. That led to gains for energy companies. Marathon Oil added 81 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $16.43 and Exxon Mobil added $1.10, or 1.3 percent, to $86.38. Chevron gained $1.44, or 1.3 percent, to $110.64. OPEC nations will meet in Vienna on Nov. 30. They have agreed to preliminary terms of a deal that will reduce the production of oil slightly, but the details remain to be determined. Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said investors are encouraged that OPEC is trying to limit production. But she doesn\u2019t think a deal, if one happens, will have much effect on oil prices. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to suggest the agreement\u2019s going to hold,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen all is said and done, supply and demand will ultimately dictate the price.\u201d Meat producer Tyson Foods tumbled $9.76, or 14.5 percent, to $57.60. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter profit and sales fell far short of Wall Street\u2019s forecasts as Tyson\u2019s chicken business struggled. The company also said CEO Donnie Smith will step down at the end of this year, and company president Tom Hayes will replace him. Competitor Hormel Foods lost 64 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $34.94. Small-company stocks have surged since the election. The Russell 2000 has risen for 12 days in a row. Technology stocks also made substantial gains. They have lagged the market since the election after very strong performance over the summer. Facebook rose $4.75, or 4.1 percent, to $121.77 while online payments company PayPal advanced 55 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $40.63 and Apple picked up $1.69, or 1.5 percent, to $111.75. Identity theft and fraud protection company LifeLock jumped $3.06, or 14.7 percent, to $23.81 after security software maker Symantec agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion. The deal values LifeLock at $24 a share. Symantec picked up 77 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $24.52, a sign investors approve of the purchase. Sunoco Logistics agreed to buy Energy Transfer Partners in an all-stock deal worth about $20 billion. Both companies are involved in the Dakota Access oil pipeline, a project that\u2019s been the subject of protests for months. A portion of that pipeline would pump oil under Lake Oahe, a reservoir in North Dakota, and the local Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it fears a leak could contaminate the drinking water on its reservation. The tribe also says the pipeline could disturb sacred sites. Both companies traded lower after the deal was announced, as they won\u2019t distribute as much cash to shareholders after combining. Energy Transfer Partners lost $2.85, or 7.2 percent, to $36.52 and Sunoco Logistics skidded $1.72, or 6.6 percent, to $24.47. Energy Transfer Equity, the general partner of Energy Transfer Partners, picked up 63 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $17.92. Gold inched up $1.10 to $1,209.80 an ounce. Silver lost 10 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper climbed 5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.52 a pound. The dollar slipped after trading at 13-year highs last week. The euro rose to $1.0612 from $1.0599. The dollar rose to 111.07 yen from 110.63 yen. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.32 percent from 2.35 percent. That helped utility stocks. They stocks tend to do better when bond yields fall because investors seeking income buy them for their big dividends. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 6 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil rose 7 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $1.52 per gallon. Natural gas rose 11 cents, or 4 percent, to $2.95 per 1,000 cubic feet. France\u2019s CAC-40 index rose 0.6 percent while the DAX of Germany picked up 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain rose less than 0.1 percent. The Nikkei 225 of Japan rose 0.8 percent.

By Ishaan Tharoor November 21 at 12:22 PM Follow @ishaantharoor The reproductions provided by Landesarchiv Speyer show a letter by the grandfather of President-elect Donald Trump found in a German archive. (Landesarchiv Speyer via AP) A letter publicized this week by the\u00a0 German tabloid Bild reveals how President-elect Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Trump begged\u00a0local authorities in southern Germany to revoke an expulsion order for avoiding military service as a teenager. His plea, it seems, proved unsuccessful, and he had to settle for a life across the Atlantic. According to a bulletin\u00a0by the Associated Press , the letter was penned in 1905 and was addressed to\u00a0Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, a\u00a0monarch who presided over a realm\u00a0within the united German Empire. Trump beseeches the \u201cwell-loved, noble, wise and just\u201d Bavarian royal not to deport him. Luitpold apparently decided to reject what Trump\u00a0offered as\u00a0a\u00a0\u201cmost subservient request.\u201d The document was recently identified by a local historian in a state archive. Friedrich Trump reached the United States in 1885 when he was 16, after leaving his home town of Kallstadt, in what is now the southwestern German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Although his arrival in New York City was like that of myriad other European immigrants seeking greater opportunity, his departure from Bavaria was illegal \u2014\u00a0he skipped mandatory military service\u00a0in the kingdom's armed forces and was\u00a0formally stripped of Bavarian citizenship four years later. Trump went on to make his fortune out west, including a stint running taverns and brothels amid the gold rush in Canada's Yukon territory. He \u201cmined the miners,\u201d as one chronicler put it , and his Arctic restaurant became one of the more infamous institutions of the territory. \u201cFor single men the Arctic has the best restaurant,\u201d wrote a moralizing 19th-century journalist in the Yukon Sun.\u00a0\u201cBut I would not advise respectable women to go there to sleep as they are liable to hear that which would be repugnant to their feelings and uttered, too, by the depraved of their own sex.\u201d Trump later returned east and made trips back to his homeland in the early 1900s, including one visit during which he met his eventual wife. Her homesickness compelled Trump to attempt to return to Kallstadt with all of his life savings. But his status as a draft dodger and noncitizen\u00a0prompted a deportation order. \u201cThe American citizen and pensioner Friedrich Trump, currently residing in Kallstadt, is hereby informed that he is to depart the state of Bavaria, or face deportation,\u201d authorities said in a document dated February 1905, according to Deutsche Welle . Trump attempted to fight the decree but failed. The documentary, \"Kings of Kallstadt\" from director Simone Wendel, tells the story of Kallstadt, Germany, the town where Friedrich Trump, the grandfather of President-elect Donald Trump, was born.

Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler (6) drops back to pass against the New York Giants during the first quarter at MetLife Stadium. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports) Check back here for all the latest quick-hit news: Report: Cutler could be out for season The Chicago Bears may have taken another serious hit. Quarterback Jay Cutler has a shoulder injury that could put his season in jeopardy, according to the Chicago Tribune . Cutler missed five games earlier this season with a thumb injury. With Brian Hoyer on injured reserve, Matt Barkley would likely take over as the starting quarterback. Fitzpatrick back as starter FLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 The Jets are sticking with Ryan Fitzpatrick as their starting quarterback. Coach Todd Bowles announced the decision this afternoon after practice. The decision is sure to anger some fans, because the Jets are 3-7 and out of the playoff race. Fitzpatrick may give the Jets the best chance to win with his experience, though at this point, winning only hurts the Jets' draft position. But apparently, the Jets aren't ready to turn the team over the the 25-year-old Bryce Petty \u2014 or they don't think he's ready for that just yet. The Jets return from their bye week today, to start getting ready for Sunday's game against the Patriots. \u2014 Andy Vasquez, The (Bergen, N.J.) Record Bears LB Freeman suspended four games Chicago Bears linebacker Jerrell Freeman was suspended four games Monday for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery also is serving a four-game suspension for the same infraction. Freeman leads the Bears with 91 tackles this season. Posted!

    "text": "Restrict lobbying by former members of Congress Pass a child care bill Pass a law enforcement bill Doesn\u2019t Need Congress Mr. Trump will be able to use his authority to reverse executive actions taken by President Obama. He will also have significant latitude to carry out new immigration policies, though they would require an ambitious bureaucratic effort. Mentioned in almost all speeches. Suspend immigration from \u201cterror-prone regions\u201d Mr. Trump's controversial call to ban all Muslims from the United States seems to have evolved into a promise to bar people from certain regions rather than religions. He will have the power to carry out this plan, but it would make sweeping use of executive authority and require an ambitious bureaucratic effort not likely to move as quickly as he envisions. More \u00bb Mentioned in almost all speeches. End foreign trade abuses Mr. Trump says he will direct his commerce secretary and trade representative on Day 1 to identify and end alleged abuses. The White House has plenty of leeway to penalize other nations it accuses of undercutting American manufacturers. Mentioned in most speeches. Choose Supreme Court nominee Mr. Trump has released a list of 21 possible candidates vetted by conservative legal groups to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nominee will then be subject to approval by the Senate. More \u00bb Mentioned in about half of speeches. Leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership Since the deal was never approved by Congress, Mr. Trump will not have to do anything to get out of the pact. More \u00bb Mentioned in about half of speeches. Label China a currency manipulator Mr. Trump has repeatedly accused China of keeping its currency artificially cheap, though many economists believe the renminbi is overvalued, not undervalued. Mentioned in about half of speeches. Limit federal regulations Mr. Trump promised to eliminate two existing federal regulations for every new one. The executive branch has the power to undo regulations through the same lengthy bureaucratic process that is used when they are created. More \u00bb Mentioned in a few speeches. Roll back environmental regulations Mr. Trump could undo the Obama administration's environmental rules through the same lengthy bureaucratic process that was used when they were created. (In some cases, Congress could also vote to undo them.) He has also vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d last year\u2019s Paris climate agreement. The United States remains legally bound to the plan for four years, but there would be no legal consequences or economic sanctions if Mr. Trump does not follow through with the commitment to limit carbon emissions. More \u00bb Mentioned in a few speeches. Rescind Obama's actions on guns Mr. Trump's 100-day plan says he will \"cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\" The gun actions are some that he frequently cited. More \u00bb Mentioned in a few speeches. Approve the Keystone XL pipeline Mr. Trump said he will lift \u201cObama-Clinton roadblocks\u201d on energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline. He could grant the State Department the permit that the Obama administration has denied for the project. Mentioned in a few speeches. Tighten lobbying restrictions Mr. Trump said he will issue a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for a foreign government and a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for United States elections. His transition team has already asked administration appointees to sign a form agreeing to the policies. More \u00bb Mentioned in a few speeches. Freeze federal hiring Mr. Trump pledged to implement a hiring freeze on the federal workforce. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan put freezes into effect during their presidencies, but a 1982 comptroller general report determined that the \u201cfreezes have not been an effective means of controlling federal employment.\u201d Mentioned in a few speeches. Overturn protections for certain undocumented immigrants The 100-day plan does not specifically cite the immigration actions, but Mr. Trump has said he will overturn them. One Obama administration program protects immigrants who came to the United States as children. Another program, which was blocked by the courts, offered protection to a broader group. Mentioned in a few speeches. Cancel payments to U.N. climate programs Mr. Trump seems to be referring to money committed by the Obama administration to the Green Climate Fund, created to help poor countries control their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Mentioned in a few speeches. Propose term limits on Congress Mr. Trump can propose an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a two-thirds majority in Congress to advance. But Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the measure would not be on the agenda. More \u00bb Might Need Congress Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans may or may not need the help of Congress, depending on a variety of factors, including whether they would require new funding or a change in current laws. Mentioned in almost all speeches. Deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes Mr. Trump said he will begin removing the two million to three million people he says fall into this category on his first day in office. But it may be difficult to carry out the deportations quickly without violating due process and without needing more money from Congress. More \u00bb Mentioned in almost all speeches. Renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement Mr. Trump would have to bring Mexico and Canada back to the table and get Congress to approve a new deal, but the United States can withdraw from the treaty six months after giving written notice. Mentioned in almost all speeches. Impose tariffs on companies moving overseas The Constitution bans the imposition of tariffs specifically aimed at a single company. Mr. Trump has a lot of power under existing law to impose broader tariffs without getting approval from Congress, but it is possible he may want to do something that requires new legislation. Mentioned in about half of speeches. Stop funding \u201csanctuary cities\u201d Mr. Trump has said he will cancel federal funding to cities that have curtailed their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But because Mr. Trump has not given a detailed proposal, it is unclear whether he would have the authority to do so without Congress. Several Democratic mayors of major American cities have said they will oppose his plan. More \u00bb Needs Congress Mr. Trump will need to work with Congress to carry out some of his significant proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act and building a wall along the border with Mexico. Mentioned in almost all speeches. Repeal and replace Obamacare Congress is unlikely to be able to repeal the entire law without a supermajority of 60 votes in the Senate, but it can eliminate parts of the law with a simple majority. Last year it passed a bill that would have eliminated the law's Medicaid expansion, premium subsidies and the requirement that all Americans buy insurance, but Mr. Obama vetoed it. Experts say repealing just these select parts of the law could lead to market chaos, and an estimated 22 million Americans would lose coverage. More \u00bb Mentioned in almost all speeches. Build a wall Mr. Trump has said he will work with Congress to pass a bill that finances the construction of a southern border wall \u201cwith the full understanding\u201d that Mexico will reimburse the United States. (Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall.) If he is able to get Congress to fund the wall \u2014 a big if \u2014 Mr. Trump would still have to overcome a myriad of environmental and legal hurdles in order to move forward. More \u00bb Mentioned in most speeches. End Common Core Mr. Trump said he will work with Congress to introduce an education bill that will, in part, end Common Core. However, it is unclear how Congress would get rid of Common Core when the federal government did not create it. Governors and state boards of education developed and voluntarily adopted the standards. Mentioned in most speeches. Pass a security bill Mr. Trump\u2019s plan includes the elimination of defense spending caps, changes to veterans\u2019 health care and new screening procedures for immigration. Many of his defense priorities align with Republicans in Congress, but he is likely to face opposition from Democrats and from Republicans wary of increased spending and of Mr. Trump\u2019s views on national security. More \u00bb Mentioned in about half of speeches. Cut taxes Congressional Republicans are also eager to pass tax reform, and their proposals share a lot of common ground with Mr. Trump's plan, which would significantly cut taxes on businesses and most types of income. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the plan would cut revenues significantly. While Mr. Trump insists the cuts would be paid for through economic growth, there is not evidence from previous tax cuts that growth would increase at those levels. More \u00bb Mentioned in about half of speeches. Pass an infrastructure bill Mr. Trump says his plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects over 10 years would be paid for through leveraging public-private partnerships and encouraging private investment through tax incentives. Infrastructure spending is a shared priority with congressional Democrats, who have said they believe they can work with Mr. Trump on the issue. More \u00bb Mentioned in about half of speeches. Pass an ethics bill Mr. Trump's 100-day plan does not give details on his ethics bill proposal, but includes an oft-repeated objective to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests in Washington. Mentioned in a few speeches. Restrict lobbying by former members of Congress Mr. Trump also called for a five-year ban on lobbying for former members of Congress and their staff, an increase from the current two-year ban for senators and a one-year ban for House members. Congress is unlikely to pass this measure. Mentioned in a few speeches. Pass a child care bill Mr. Trump's proposal includes allowing child care and elder care tax deductions, incentives for employers to provide on-site childcare, and tax-free savings accounts with matching contributions for low-income families. Democrats in Congress are also hoping to be able to work with Mr. Trump in this area. Mentioned in a few speeches. Pass a law enforcement bill Mr. Trump has proposed a bill that would create a new violent crimes task force and increase spending on resources for law enforcement and federal prosecutors. Mr. Trump would need to galvanize support from a Congress in which many lawmakers believe that the tough-on-crime policies of the 1990s were counterproductive. The frequency of mentions is based on transcripts from 122 rallies and speeches over the course of the presidential campaign. More on NYTimes.com ",

    "text": "France: 7 Arrested in Anti-Terror Raids, Attack Thwarted By angela charlton, associated press PARIS \u0097 Nov 21, 2016, 12:47 PM ET 0 Shares Star Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images French Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve gives a press conference, Nov. 21, 2016, in Paris. Police have broken up a terror ring plotting an attack in France after arresting seven suspects in Strasbourg and Marseille, Cazeneuve said. 0 Shares Email French anti-terrorism police have arrested seven men in Strasbourg and Marseille who had links to Syria and had been plotting an attack on France for several months, the interior minister said Monday. A series of arrests in June and this past Sunday put an end to the plot and \"allowed us to thwart a terrorist act that had been envisaged for a long time on our soil,\" Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters in Paris. France remains under a state of emergency imposed after deadly Islamic State attacks on Paris last year. The suspects are believed to have initially wanted to target the Euro 2016 European soccer tournament earlier this year but later focused on another target, possibly in Paris or Marseille, according to a security official. The official was not authorized to be publicly named speaking about ongoing investigations. The June arrests involved people behind financing the alleged attack plot, while the Sunday arrests targeted the operational team \u2014 and both groups were under orders from unidentified commanders in Syria, the official said. Weapons were also seized in Sunday's arrests, the official said. Cazeneuve said investigators are studying whether the thwarted attack was part of a larger plot to attack multiple sites simultaneously. Five of the suspects are French, one is Moroccan and the other Afghan, and they are between 29 and 37 years old, the security official said. Cazeneuve said six of them hadn't been known to intelligence services. The Moroccan had apparently been living in Portugal. Portuguese police said Monday that they had flagged a 26-year-old Moroccan residing in Aveiro in northern Portugal to other European authorities, warning that he was part of a terrorist group. In statement, the police said they had been watching him since 2015, and he was arrested by French police over the weekend. One of the suspects worked for the Strasbourg city government on special events, Strasbourg metropolitan area president Robert Hermann said, according to his office. The arrests rattled nerves in Strasbourg because they came just five days before the opening of the city's famed Christmas market, which attracts tourists from across Europe and was the target of a failed extremist plot in 2000 by Algerian and French militants who had trained in Afghanistan . However, Mayor Roland Ries said the case had no direct link to the market, so the event will open as usual Friday \u2014 under heavy security. The raids in Strasbourg took place in the Neuhof and Meinau neighborhoods, where authorities dismantled a jihadi network in 2014 that included the brother of an Islamic State bomber who attacked the Bataclan concert hall in Paris last year. French police have detained 418 people this year in terrorism investigations, Cazeneuve said. \"In the face of a threat that remains very high in France, everything is being done, at every moment, to protect the French,\" President Francois Hollande said in a statement about the new arrests. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Barry Hatton in Lisbon contributed. 0 Shares ",

Morrad Ghonim appears in court on charges of hiring a man to stage a robbery and kill his wife in 1992. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) Marisa Gerber Contact Reporter Morrad Ghonim sped out of the parking lot with his young bride\u00a0bleeding to death in the passenger seat next to him. On the way to a hospital, he barreled through a red light. Through frantic screams, he told the California Highway Patrol officer who pulled him over that someone had just shot his wife, Vicki, through the window of the family\u2019s burgundy Honda as they left a park in La Mirada. He\u00a0didn\u2019t get a look at the shooter\u2019s face, he said. As her body went limp, their 6-month-old son watched from the back seat. It was July 23, 1992, and Ghonim had just become a 19-year-old widower. Detectives followed a few leads, but the investigation went cold. A\u00a0breakthrough nearly two decades after the shooting would lead investigators to a drug dealer with a wild story \u2014\u00a0and a courtroom drama that ended\u00a0Monday. The morning after\u00a0the shooting, Ghonim\u00a0and a pair of somber detectives went to see Vicki\u2019s parents. He told them that he and his wife\u00a0had taken their baby to Creek Park. It was a special place for\u00a0the sweethearts \u2014\u00a0Morrad, 19, and Vicki, 17 \u2014\u00a0who sometimes had sneaked\u00a0away from class\u00a0at John Glenn High School to spend time there together. Soon after they got to the park, Ghonim\u00a0said, he heard a group of people\u00a0catcalling his wife. He figured they were gang members. Vicki, whose loving\u00a0but feisty\u00a0personality\u00a0sometimes got the best of her, screamed something back. Ghonim\u00a0said\u00a0he got a bad feeling and\u00a0ushered his family toward their car.\u00a0As they settled into the\u00a0Honda, he heard gunfire.\u00a0The shooter\u00a0had been hiding behind bushes, he said, so he never got a look at who had attacked his wife. Police had collected a clump of clothes from the park that night, including a sweatshirt\u00a0a witness recognized as one worn by a man jogging nearby right after the gunshots rang out. But detectives could never determine whom the items belong to. Ghonim eventually remarried a woman from Jordan \u2014\u00a0his parents\u2019 homeland.\u00a0He and his new wife had\u00a0five children. They raised Vicki\u2019s son together. He fell out of touch with his dead wife\u2019s\u00a0family. About a decade\u00a0ago, the\u00a0Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department received grant money to reopen old cases and look at genetic evidence. Defense attorney Alan Eisner delivers an opening statement in the trial of Morrad Ghonim, who is charged with hiring Leon Martinez to stage a robbery and kill his wife in 1992. Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times Defense attorney Alan Eisner delivers an opening statement in the trial of Morrad Ghonim, who is charged with hiring Leon Martinez to stage a robbery and kill his wife in 1992. Defense attorney Alan Eisner delivers an opening statement in the trial of Morrad Ghonim, who is charged with hiring Leon Martinez to stage a robbery and kill his wife in 1992. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) They tested a pair of black pants found in the bushes at Creek Park and\u00a0turned up DNA from\u00a0Leon Martinez, who was serving prison time for burglary. At first, Martinez tried to pin the murder on a dead friend. But he eventually admitted to shooting Vicki Ghonim. It wasn\u2019t the\u00a0botched carjacking that authorities long had suspected. No, he told detectives, he was a hired hit man. And his client was Morrad Ghonim. Now a businessman living in Antigua with his third wife, Ghonim recently sat at the defense table in a Norwalk courtroom \u2014\u00a0his graying temples framing\u00a0heavy eyes.\u00a0 As Martinez entered to testify, Ghonim cleared his throat and glared. The two had met through a mutual acquaintance in 1992, Martinez said. After Ghonim bought \u00a0crack cocaine from him\u00a0that same day, Martinez said, Ghonim asked if he knew anybody who would kill for money. Martinez had recently traded drugs for a .22-caliber revolver, so he said he would do it. They didn\u2019t get into many details, Martinez said, but Ghonim told him that he wanted it to look like a robbery. They settled on a price: $20,000. \u201cHe just wanted her dead,\u201d Martinez said. When he saw the burgundy Honda pull into the parking lot that evening, Martinez was high on cocaine. But he said he remembers walking up to the window and pulling the gun from his pocket. He stood a foot away, he said, and fired at Vicki\u2019s\u00a0head. As she pleaded with him not to hurt her baby,\u00a0he shot her again\u00a0and again. The last time, he said, he put the gun directly to her eyes and pulled the trigger. As her body slumped over, Martinez testified, Ghonim handed him an envelope of cash, reaching over his wife\u2019s body. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get more premeditated and deliberate,\u201d Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Villa said during the trial. After taking the money, Martinez said, he jogged away, shedding his top layer of clothes near some bushes. He then headed to a nearby Del Taco, where he waited for a friend. During Martinez\u2019s testimony, Ghonim\u00a0scribbled notes. Sometimes\u00a0he stared down, shaking his head. Villa urged\u00a0jurors to consider Martinez\u2019s testimony along with that of his former friend, Deanna Woody, who had picked him up the night of the murder. In 1998, Woody said, a tearful Martinez had confessed to her. She said she didn\u2019t tell police until after a detective contacted her in 2009\u00a0because she feared\u00a0for her life and her family\u2019s safety. She also testified that a few days before the slaying, she had seen Martinez with a man who she thought looked Middle Eastern. She said the man asked her if she was single and told her that he was having problems with the mother of his child \u2014\u00a0a student at John Glenn High. He said they were planning to split up. The man\u00a0also told Woody, whose child had recently had a heart transplant, that he too had had an\u00a0operation on his heart, she testified. But\u00a0the\u00a0defense pointed out that\u00a0Woody had been unable to pick out Ghonim\u2019s photograph from a lineup.\u00a0And Martinez had changed some details while on the witness stand. During previous interviews and court appearances, he\u2019d said that Ghonim had paid him a lot less \u2014 putting the amount at $500 one time and $10,000 at another. Earlier, he\u2019d told authorities that he had met Ghonim\u00a0on numerous occasions to sell him drugs before he was asked about killing Vicki.\u00a0 Pressed by the defense, Martinez said, \u201cMy memory ain\u2019t that good at all.\u201d And in several recorded phone calls Martinez made to his wife from behind bars, he said he had talked to the prosecutor about the case and was considering lying about Ghonim\u2019s role in the killing. \u201cI could tell by the way the D.A. is acting that they need me,\u201d he told her.\u00a0\u201cIf I could make up a lie to convict this other guy, they\u2019re going to do that.\u201d In another call, he said the detectives and attorneys wanted him \u201cto basically sit and make a story up.\u201d Asked about the calls during the trial, Martinez said he was lying because he didn\u2019t want his wife to know that he had\u00a0 killed Vicki. He just wanted her dead. \u2014 Leon Martinez, talking about Morrad Ghonim and his wife, Vicki Ghonim\u2019s attorneys argued\u00a0that the recordings were clear proof that Martinez had lied for his own benefit. After a jury convicted him last year of Vicki\u2019s murder, Martinez struck a deal. In\u00a0exchange for his testimony against Ghonim, he\u2019d get 28 years to life in prison instead of\u00a0life without the possibility of parole. \u201cHe\u2019s told so many different stories,\u201d defense attorney Dmitry Gorin told jurors before they began deliberating last week.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s somebody that can\u2019t be trusted and he\u2019s the centerpiece of the government\u2019s case.\u201d In his closing arguments, Villa asked the jury to think back a few days to when they\u2019d heard from Ghonim\u2019s second wife, Nisreen Alfaleh. She testified that Ghonim\u00a0has a scar on his chest from heart surgery he had as a child\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a clear sign, Villa told jurors, that the Middle Eastern man Woody had spoken to years earlier was\u00a0Ghonim. Alfaleh also testified that\u00a0during the winter of 2012,\u00a0the couple got into a fight\u00a0at a restaurant in Antigua.\u00a0Alfaleh said she told her then-husband\u00a0she was planning to take the kids and move to Texas. \u201c\u2018If you ever think of getting a divorce, I\u2019ll hurt you,\u2019\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018It cost me $500 then, it won\u2019t cost me much now.\u201d Why\u00a0did you pick $500, she asked him? Are you referring to\u00a0your first wife? He didn\u2019t respond, she said.\u00a0 The jury, which\u00a0deliberated for nearly a week, reached a verdict Monday: Morrad Ghonim\u00a0was guilty of first-degree murder. He faces\u00a0life in prison without the possibility of parole at his sentencing Dec. 19. Villa praised the panel\u2019s decision, calling it a\u00a0relief for Vicki\u2019s family. \u201cIt\u2019s finally over,\u201d he said.

Twenty three of the 35 students on-board the bus were transported to area hospitals, according to Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher. The immediate cause of the crash was unknown. \"Through our channels we can confirm there are children deceased,\" said a spokesperson for the Tennessee Highway patrol. Officials initially said two children died, but a spokeswoman for Hamilton County District Attorney Neal Pinkston later said there were at least six fatalities. Fletcher described accident as a \"single-driver incident.\" The Chattanooga Fire Department tweeted photos of the accident that appeared to show that the bus flipped over after it struck a tree.

This excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits, among other measures. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I also must add that I\u2019m much less confident of a repeal (or partial repeal) without agreement on a replacement. But I\u2019ll turn it back to you, Aaron. Do you think the G.O.P. has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal? Or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits? Aaron: I think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits, but not too much. There\u2019s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a \u201crepeal\u201d because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law. They got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside. Actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health insurance , without anything in return. This would be an unmitigated political disaster. The stories \u2014 of people with cancer , diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold \u2014 would very likely dominate our discussion for months. That leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections. With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame, I think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 elections, but in reverse. Photo Credit Francesco Ciccolella Now, if they can coalesce around a \u201creplace\u201d plan that doesn\u2019t leave too many people out, then I think they could move forward. But in all the years since the A.C.A. was passed, Republicans haven\u2019t been able to do that. Do you think they can? What do you think that plan would look like? Austin: One way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesn\u2019t call for repeal for several years, at least after the 2018 midterms, though possibly after the 2020 election. Between now and then, there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces Obamacare that didn\u2019t just dump people off coverage with no alternative. But the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly. Absolutely there will be bad stories. But keep in mind, there will be bad stories under Obamacare, too. Rocketing premiums, huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success. Republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if they\u2019re making Obamacare better. They\u2019re actually in a tough policy spot. They\u2019ll get the blame if they don\u2019t fix or repeal the A.C.A., and they\u2019ll get the blame if they don\u2019t replace it with something people like better. Health policy is a very difficult and thankless task. I think they\u2019ll opt for something they can call repeal and replace, but they could also just let Obamacare struggle and die. Neither looks good. One other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states. Do you think a Trump administration, working with a G.O.P. Congress, will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from Obamacare? If so, what are some ideas states might try? Advertisement Continue reading the main story Aaron: I think it\u2019s very likely those in Congress could punt Medicaid to the states. For years, they\u2019ve been trying to change Medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time. This will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce Medicaid spending in the future, while forcing states to make the tough decisions \u2014 and take the blame \u2014 for cuts in either beneficiaries or services. Fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, though, is a different story. Without some sort of market regulation, which they\u2019ve generally been opposed to, the same problems that existed pre-A.C.A. with respect to pre-existing conditions and individual ratings will exist. Many people will become uninsured. Annual and lifetime limits could reappear. Lots of people will have problems getting insured. Moreover, I have yet to be convinced that a significant number of Republicans in the House might coalesce around such a plan. Maybe for Medicaid, but I\u2019m not sure about the exchanges. Even if they could, it\u2019s likely the Democrats in the Senate would try to filibuster either of these plans. Don\u2019t you think? Austin: Yes, I think Democrats would filibuster anything they could. The filibuster is not set in stone . A Senate majority can change it , and some are already calling for the G.O.P. to do so. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be what the Senate will do \u2014 they\u2019ll retain the filibuster. This could play to their favor, since they can propose things they like, let the Democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement.

USA TODAY Emergency crews respond to a deadly school bus accident on Talley Road in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Nov. 21, 2016. (Photo: Chattanooga Fire Department) CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014\u00a0At least six people were killed\u00a0and at least\u00a023 children taken to the hospital after a school bus crashed into a tree Monday afternoon in Chattanooga, authorities said . Hamilton County District Attorney Neal Pinkston told media outlets that five people died at the scene and one died at the hospital. Melydia Clewell, spokeswoman for the district attorney, confirmed the number. The Chattanooga Police Department had not confirmed the exact number. The\u00a0accident took place in the Brainerd area of southeast Chattanooga, and the area was closed to traffic, according to police. The bus driver was being questioned and was cooperating with authorities. In a news conference Monday, Assistant Chief Tracy Arnold said there were 35 schoolchildren on the bus, and\u00a0the ages of the students ranged from kindergarten through fifth grade. The students were from Woodmore\u00a0Elementary School. Multiple fatalities are involved in this bus crash. However, contrary to media reports, no firm numbers have been confirmed yet. #ChattFire \u2014 Chattanooga FireDept (@ChattFireDept) November 21, 2016 Rescue crews worked until after dark. Nearly an hour after the crash, two bloodied students were on stretchers in a nearby front yard, the\u00a0 Chattanooga Times Free Press reported. Others who did not go to the hospital walked away clutching their parents\u2019 hands, the Times Free Press reported. Images posted on social media also showed interim Hamilton County Schools Superintendent Kirk Kelly racing to the scene of the crash. And blood donors rushed to Blood Assurance in downtown Chattanooga, where marketing coordinator Mindy Quinn said there was a line out the door. A\u00a0WRCB reporter reported seeing several ambulances and a police chaplain on the scene. The fire department described it on Twitter as \"very serious\" and Chattanooga's mayor called it \"horrible.\" This was the second bus crash in Tennessee in recent days involving dozens of students. Nearly two dozen Chester County\u00a0Beta Club students on their way to a convention at Gaylord Opryland\u00a0 were\u00a0injured Friday morning \u00a0in a\u00a0crash after a school bus flipped\u00a0on Interstate 65 in Nashville. This is still an active scene. 23 patients were transported to local hospitals via ambulances. #ChattFire pic.twitter.com/7lCNicEkWx \u2014 Chattanooga FireDept (@ChattFireDept) November 21, 2016 None of those\u00a0injuries were life-threatening. The governor said\u00a0events like Monday\u2019s and last week\u2019s crash in Nashville could lead officials to begin additional talks about safety. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a good discussion to have,\u201d Haslam said. \u201cI think when this is over it\u2019s time to have a good conversation about everything around school buses.\u201d Contributing: Joel Ebert, The Tennessean, WBIR-TV and The Associated Press.

Here's what's happening right now: Trump peddles a softer message in a new video Mike Pence says Trump can separate his business holdings from government Neo-Nazi 'alt-right' group offers a 'Hail Trump' salute Follow us on Twitter for more, or subscribe to our free daily politics newsletter . Nov. 21, 2016, 4:19 p.m. Noah Bierman President-elect Donald Trump spent more than a year campaigning to build a border wall, repeal\u00a0Obamacare and rescind\u00a0President Obama's moves to protect from deportation some immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. But in his first extensive public comments since winning the election this month, Trump mentioned none of those issues. Nor did he talk about withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, banning Muslims from entering the country, or ending the Syrian refugee program. Trump instead made five more modest promises for his first day in office during\u00a0a nearly three-minute video released Monday that presented him as a more moderate figure and\u00a0appeared to be an effort to soften Trump's message while he establishes an inner circle of advisors and Cabinet picks of hard-liners. In the video, Trump promises\u00a0to withdraw from the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, \"a potential disaster for our country,\" and instead pursue bilateral agreements with some of the Pacific countries involved. He promised to lift\u00a0restrictions on energy production, including shale and coal, implement a rule that any new government regulation must be accompanied by removing two regulations on the books and to instruct\u00a0his Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a new cybersecurity\u00a0plan. His only discussion of immigration involved the legal immigration system \u2014\u00a0a crackdown on visa fraud. Trump also said his previously announced ethics rules \u2014\u00a0barring employees in his administration from lobbying for five years after they leave the government and from lobbying for foreign governments for life \u2014\u00a0would take effect as soon as he is inaugurated. Trump vowed in the video to release more plans in the days to come. \"These are some of our Day 1 executive actions,\" spokesman Jason Miller said in an email. \"By no means is it everything he'll work on day one or after that \u2014\u00a0many additional good things to come.\" ",

Three charges were filed against Dr. Larry Nassar of Holt, Michigan, according to online court records in Ingham County. The alleged incidents occurred in 1998. The records don\u2019t indicate whether the charges involve one victim or more. Nassar was arrested and lodged in the county jail. It\u2019s unclear when he\u2019ll appear in court. A message seeking comment was left for his attorney.\u00a0 Did USA Gymnastics officials ignore sexual abuse? Nassar, 53, has been under scrutiny this year after two gymnasts, including a member of the 2000 U.S. women\u2019s Olympic team, accused him of sexual abuse. A lawsuit by one is pending in California. Nassar has denied wrongdoing. He was on the faculty at Michigan State University but was fired in September for not complying with \u201cemployment requirements\u201d put in place after a 2014 investigation of alleged misconduct. MSU didn\u2019t elaborate. USA Gymnastics, based in Indianapolis, cut its ties to Nassar in 2015. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette plans to talk to reporters Tuesday. In October, Schuette said MSU asked his office to review allegations against Nassar, who taught at the school and worked in its sports medicine clinic. Nassar recently finished last in a three-candidate race for two seats on the Holt school board. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story As Democrats pick through the wreckage of the campaign, one lesson is clear: The election was notable as much for the people who did not show up, as for those who did. Nationally, about half of registered voters did not cast ballots. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Wisconsin, a state that Hillary Clinton had assumed she would win, historically boasts one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of voter participation; this year\u2019s 68.3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states. But by local standards, it was a disappointment, the lowest turnout in 16 years. And those no-shows were important. Mr. Trump won the state by just 27,000 voters. Milwaukee\u2019s lowest-income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures. Of the city\u2019s 15 council districts , the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas \u2014 accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide. The biggest drop was here in District 15 , a stretch of fading wooden homes, sandwich shops and fast-food restaurants that is 84 percent black. In this district, voter turnout declined by 19.5 percent from 2012 figures, according to Neil Albrecht, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission. It is home to some of Milwaukee\u2019s poorest residents and, according to a 2016 documentary, \u201c Milwaukee 53206 ,\u201d has one of the nation\u2019s highest per-capita incarceration rates. At Upper Cutz, a bustling barbershop in a green-trimmed wooden house, talk of politics inevitably comes back to one man: Barack Obama . Mr. Obama\u2019s elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced. But their lives have not gotten appreciably better, and sourness has set in. \u201cWe went to the beach,\u201d said Maanaan Sabir, 38, owner of the Juice Kitchen , a brightly painted shop a few blocks down West North Avenue, using a metaphor to describe the emotion after Mr. Obama\u2019s election. \u201cAnd then eight years happened.\u201d All four barbers had voted for Mr. Obama. But only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time. And even then, it was a sort of protest. One wrote in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The other wrote in himself. Photo Ian Pfeiffer, a cook at Jake\u2019s Delicatessen, said he did not vote. \u201cWe were stuck between Trump and Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really left us with no choice.\u201d Credit Ben Brewer for The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m so numb,\u201d said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. \u201cIt\u2019s like I should have known this would happen. We\u2019re worse off than before.\u201d But Mr. Obama did do something important: \u201cHe did give black people something to aspire to. That\u2019s a lot. I\u2019m happy my son was able to see a black president.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Fleming, 47, who has been trimming hair, beards and mustaches for 30 years, had hoped his small business would get easier to run. But it hasn\u2019t. \u201cGive us loans, or a 401(k),\u201d he said, trimming the mustache of Steve Stricklin, a firefighter from the neighborhood. His biggest issue was health insurance. Mr. Fleming lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford. He finally found one, which starts Monday but costs too much at $300 a month. \u201cAin\u2019t none of this been working,\u201d he said. He did not vote. Mr. Albrecht, of the election commission, said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout. This was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo ID card, and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence. This was particularly onerous for the poor, who move often. Mr. Albrecht said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote. \u201cTo me that\u2019s very significant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes away from the fairness and integrity of the election.\u201d Although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo ID law discriminated against African-Americans, who disproportionately lack the approved IDs, the law was applied on Election Day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who backed the laws, has said they have no impact on voter participation, and Mr. Albrecht allowed that their effect on Milwaukee\u2019s turnout would not have erased Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the state. Perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in Milwaukee, as in the rest of the country, were the candidates themselves. To some, it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver. \u201cI felt cornered,\u201d said Ian Pfeiffer, 25, who works the grill at Jake\u2019s Delicatessen and says he did not vote. \u201cWe were stuck between Trump and Hillary. They really left us with no choice.\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer\u2019s grandmother, an avid supporter of Mrs. Clinton, spent months trying to convince him to vote for her. But he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the Clinton Foundation. (Mr. Pfeiffer\u2019s grandfather pushed him toward Mr. Trump, but he found him even less appealing.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story He thought Oprah Winfrey would be a good candidate. \u201cHey, would you vote for Oprah Winfrey?\u201d he said in a loud voice to a line of customers. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d vote for her,\u201d said Erin Miles, 41, a financial services worker waiting for her sandwich. \u201cShe has a level head and decision-making skills.\u201d Photo Maanaan Sabir, owner of the Juice Kitchen, said Barack Obama\u2019s election was like going \u201cto the beach.\u201d Then, he said, \u201ceight years happened.\u201d Credit Ben Brewer for The New York Times Few of the men and women interviewed on West North Street last week had voted for Mr. Trump, though many said they admired him. (He spoke his mind. He was rich.) \u201cIf I would have voted, I would have voted for him,\u201d said Andre Frierson, 40, a security guard working the evening shift at Jake\u2019s. \u201cFrom a business perspective, I loved him.\u201d As for Mrs. Clinton, \u201cother countries probably wouldn\u2019t have respected us because we had a woman running the country,\u201d he said. One exception was Justin Babar, who said he voted for Mr. Trump as a protest against Mrs. Clinton. He blamed her husband\u2019s policies for putting him in prison for 20 years. As for the claims of racism that have dogged Mr. Trump, Mr. Babar wasn\u2019t so worried. \u201cIt\u2019s better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our kids,\u201d he said. Tarvus Hawthorne, 45, a program coordinator at a local nonprofit, agreed. \u201cHe was real, unlike a lot of liberal Democrats who are just as racist\u201d but keep it hidden, he said, his jaw slathered with shaving cream. \u201cYou can reason with them all day long, but they think they know it all.

    "text": "Pope Allows All Priests to Absolve \"Grave Sin\" of Abortion By frances d'emilio, associated press VATICAN CITY \u0097 Nov 21, 2016, 4:27 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH The Pope's Address to the United Nations 0 Shares Email Saying nothing is beyond the reach of God's mercy, Pope Francis told Catholics worldwide he is allowing all priests to absolve the faithful of abortion \u2014 women and health workers alike \u2014 even while stressing that it is a grave sin in the eyes of the church to \"end an innocent life.\" In an Apostolic Letter made public Monday, Francis said he was extending indefinitely the special permission he had granted to all rank-and-file priests during the just ended Holy Year of Mercy. \"There is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled\" with God, the pope wrote in the 10-page letter, signed Sunday, the day the Holy Year ended. But, he added: \"I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life.\" Because the Roman Catholic Church holds abortion to be such a serious sin, absolution had long been a matter for a bishop, who could either hear the woman's confession himself or delegate it to a priest considered an expert in such situations, a potentially intimidating scenario for many of the faithful. In his letter, the pope appeared to acknowledge that. \"Lest any obstacle arise between the request for reconciliation and God's forgiveness,\" he wrote, \"I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion.\" A top Vatican official, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, told a news conference at the Vatican on Monday that the pope's words applied to all those who were involved in an abortion \u2014 \"from the women to the nurse to the doctor and whoever supports this procedure.\" \"The sin of abortion is inclusive. Thus forgiveness for the sin of abortion is all-inclusive and extends to all those who are participants in this sin,\" Fisichella said. The pope is \"absolutely not\" lessening the gravity of the sin of abortion, Fisichella added in comments to Sky TG24. Still, the head of an Italian anti-abortion group expressed concern that some priests might trivialize the sin of abortion. Gian Luigi Gigli, president of the Movement for Life, said women or health care workers who confess to abortion should be given penance in the form of volunteer work at the group's centers that work to prevent abortion. By permitting all priests to absolve the sin of abortion, Francis was further applying his vision of a merciful church called to minister to the problems of its flock, reflecting concerns he became familiar with while archbishop of Buenos Aires in his native Argentina. Last year, he wrote that some women who had abortions felt they had no choice but to make \"this agonizing and painful decision.\" In his Apostolic Letter, Francis called on every priest to \"be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation.\" O. Carter Snead, director of the Center for Ethics and Culture at the University of Notre Dame, noted that priests hearing the confessions of those involved in abortion had already been \"a longstanding practice in the United States and several other countries.\" Thus, Francis is essentially \"reminding us that the core message of the right-to-life movement is one of radical hospitality, mercy and unconditional love for every member of the human family, including mothers and fathers whose lives have been broken by abortion and who now seek forgiveness,\" Snead said. During the recent U.S. presidential election campaign, some pastors urged their congregations to keep in mind the \"sacredness in life\" \u2014 seen as a reference to abortion \u2014 when deciding which candidate would get their vote. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump voiced opposition to abortion during his campaign, while his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton , supported women's right to have an abortion. In his letter on abortion, Francis made plain that there can be no ambiguity in laying out moral principles, even while stressing the church's merciful side. Addressing priests, Francis wrote: \"I ask you to be welcoming to all, witnesses of fatherly love whatever the gravity of the sin involved, attentive in helping penitents to reflect on the evil they have done, clear in presenting moral principles, willing to walk patiently beside the faithful on their penitential journey, farsighted in discerning individual cases and generous in dispensing God's forgiveness.\" \"Mercy cannot become a mere parenthesis in the life of the church; it constitutes her very existence,\" Francis wrote. Four cardinals, including archconservative U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, recently criticized Francis for his statements on another hotbed issue in the church, whether divorced Catholics who remarry can receive Communion. Burke and the others expressed fear that Francis was causing \"confusion\" by saying the matter could be left to the discernment of local priests. Church teaching holds such Catholics are adulterers living in sin, and thus shouldn't receive Communion. While the pope's approach to forgiveness for abortion could distress Catholics holding a more rigid application of church teaching, Francis also reached out to traditionalists in his letter. Faithful attending churches officiated by priests of an ultra-conservative breakaway group, the Fraternity of St. Pius X, can \"validly and licitly receive the sacramental absolution of their sins,\" the pope wrote. Francis had previously granted that permission only for the period of the Holy Year. Francis also expressed hope that these breakaway priests would strive to work for full Communion with the Roman Catholic Church. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Frances D'Emilio on Twitter at www.twitter.com/fdemilio 0 Shares ",

    "text": "(Marwa Eltagouri) The couple's eldest daughter, Julia Bogdanov, is serving a 15-month prison term after pleading guilty to her role in the scheme. The Bogdanov family's roots go back to Eastern Europe, although neither Branko or Lela is a citizen of any particular country. Once they complete their sentences, they likely won't be deported because they do not have a home country to send them back to, prosecutors have said. In court Monday, Lela's attorney, Michael Goode, described his client as \"two feet out of the Stone Age.\" She was born \"in a wagon\" and given away to another family as teen, Goode said. She has no birth certificate, can't read or write and has never had a driver's license, bank account or job. Goode said she essentially stole at the behest of her husband but never helped sell any of the items she stole on the internet. \"She wouldn't know how to operate a computer if you put a gun to her head,\" Goode said as Lela, who has been treated for cancer and heart disease since her arrest, listened to the proceedings through a Romani interpreter. The Bogdanovs were arrested in March 2014 after federal authorities followed the family on a four-day, cross-country spree in their gray Honda minivan. Agents watched as the Bogdanovs entered stores in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, then exited with Lela Bogdanov's dress seemingly bursting at the seams, according to a criminal complaint unsealed after their arrest. Lego blocks, expensive dolls, electronics, cosmetics \u2014 even bags of coffee from Starbucks \u2014 were concealed under clothing and slipped out of the stores. Many of the items, such as American Girl dolls, Furby robotic toys and Nanoblock building blocks, were sold in bulk and in their original packaging by a \"fence,\" authorities said. In one stop at a Toys R Us outside New Orleans, agents noticed that Lela Bogdanov's \"stomach appeared more square or rectangular than usual, and it appeared that she was holding something against her stomach with her right arm,\" the complaint alleged. As she walked to the van, a gust of wind blew the mother's dress open, revealing a package contained in a blue lining \"that appeared to be some kind of carrying device,\" the complaint alleged. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story These are exultant times for the alt-right movement, which was little known until this year, when it embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and he appeared to embrace it back. He chose as his campaign chairman Stephen K. Bannon, the media executive who ran the alt-right\u2019s most prominent platform, Breitbart News, and then named him as a senior adviser and chief strategist. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now the movement\u2019s leaders hope to have, if not a seat at the table, at least the ear of the Trump White House. While many of its racist views are well known \u2014 that President Obama is, or may as well be, of foreign birth; that the Black Lives Matter movement is another name for black race rioters; that even the American-born children of undocumented Hispanic immigrants should be deported \u2014 the alt-right has been difficult to define. Is it a name for right-wing political provocateurs in the internet era? Or is it a political movement defined by xenophobia and a dislike for political correctness? At the conference on Saturday, Mr. Spencer, who said he had coined the term, defined the alt-right as a movement with white identity as its core idea. \u201cWe\u2019ve crossed the Rubicon in terms of recognition,\u201d Mr. Spencer said at the conference, which was sponsored by his organization, the National Policy Institute. And while much of the discourse at the conference was overtly racist and demeaning toward minorities, for much of the day the sentiments were expressed in ways that seemed intended to not sound too menacing. The focus was on how whites were marginalized and beleaguered. One speaker, Peter Brimelow, the founder of Vdare.com , an anti-immigration website, asked why, if Hispanics had the National Council of La Raza and Jews had the Anti-Defamation League, whites were reluctant to organize for their rights. Some speakers made an effort to distance themselves from more notorious white power organizations like the Ku Klux Klan. But as the night wore on and most reporters had gone home, the language changed. Mr. Spencer\u2019s after-dinner speech began with a polemic against the \u201cmainstream media,\u201d before he briefly paused. \u201cPerhaps we should refer to them in the original German?\u201d he said. The audience immediately screamed back, \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse,\u201d reviving a Nazi-era word that means \u201clying press.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Spencer suggested that the news media had been critical of Mr. Trump throughout the campaign in order to protect Jewish interests. He mused about the political commentators who gave Mr. Trump little chance of winning. \u201cOne wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem,\u201d he said, referring to a Jewish fable about the golem, a clay giant that a rabbi brings to life to protect the Jews. Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Spencer said, was \u201cthe victory of will,\u201d a phrase that echoed the title of the most famous Nazi-era propaganda film. But Mr. Spencer then mentioned, with a smile, Theodor Herzl, the Zionist leader who advocated a Jewish homeland in Israel, quoting his famous pronouncement, \u201cIf we will it, it is no dream.\u201d The United States today, Mr. Spencer said, had been turned into \u201ca sick, corrupted society.\u201d But it was not supposed to be that way. Photo Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the alt-right movement, spoke at a conference in Washington on Saturday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times \u201cAmerica was, until this last generation, a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity,\u201d Mr. Spencer thundered. \u201cIt is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us.\u201d But the white race, he added, is \u201ca race that travels forever on an upward path.\u201d \u201cTo be white is to be a creator, an explorer, a conqueror,\u201d he said. More members of the audience were on their feet as Mr. Spencer described the choice facing white people as to \u201cconquer or die.\u201d Of other races, Mr. Spencer said: \u201cWe don\u2019t exploit other groups, we don\u2019t gain anything from their presence. They need us, and not the other way around.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The ties between the alt-right movement and the Trump team are difficult to define, even by members of the alt-right. Mr. Bannon was the chief executive of Breitbart, an online news organization that has fed the lie that Mr. Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim. As recently as last year, Breitbart published an op-ed article urging that \u201cevery tree, every rooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should be festooned with the Confederate battle flag.\u201d Mr. Bannon told Mother Jones this year that Breitbart was now \u201cthe platform for the alt-right.\u201d But in an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bannon said that the alt-right was only \u201ca tiny part\u201d of the viewpoint represented on Breitbart. \u201cOur definition of the alt-right is younger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment,\u201d he told The Journal, adding that the alt-right had \u201csome racial and anti-Semitic overtones.\u201d When asked about Mr. Bannon, the conference\u2019s speakers said that they might have shaken his hand on occasion, but that they did not know him well. Mr. Brimelow said that he had met \u201cMr. Bannon once, earlier this summer, before he ascended to Olympus.\u201d He said he had told Mr. Bannon that he was doing great work at Breitbart. \u201cHe agreed,\u201d Mr. Brimelow recalled to the audience. As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Brimelow said he had met him about 30 years ago at a \u201cconservative affinity meeting\u201d in Manhattan. But that was it. \u201cTrump and Steve Bannon are not alt-right people,\u201d Mr. Brimelow said, adding that they had opportunistically seized on two issues that the alt-right cares most about \u2014 stopping immigration and fighting political correctness \u2014 and used them to mobilize white voters. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Spencer said that while he did not think the president-elect should be considered alt-right, \u201cI do think we have a psychic connection, or you can say a deeper connection, with Donald Trump in a way that we simply do not have with most Republicans.\u201d White identity, he said, is at the core of both the alt-right movement and the Trump movement, even if most voters for Mr. Trump \u201caren\u2019t willing to articulate it as such.\u201d At various points, he and other speakers outlined where they differed from Mr. Trump. They see him as too beholden to Israel. They do not see any reason to start a trade war with China, and they are not necessarily opposed to the Iran nuclear deal. For them, immigration is the most potent mobilizing issue, less for economic reasons than because of the prospect that white Americans will someday represent less than half of the population of the country. For the alt-right, the most exciting thing about Mr. Trump was that he built a campaign around the issues that mattered most to them, and that white people had voted for him in numbers that left the political establishments of both parties stunned. Now, Mr. Spencer said, it is up to the alt-right to formulate the ideas and policies to guide the new administration. \u201cI think we can be the ones out in front, thinking about those things he hasn\u2019t quite grasped yet, who are putting forward policies,\u201d Mr. Spencer said, that \u201chave a realistic chance of being implemented.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Alt-Right, Exulting in Election,  Salutes Winner: \u2018Heil Victory\u2019.

(Videos provided by Jeff Grider) A man\u00a0is\u00a0taken into custody at the\u00a0PrivateBank Theatre\u00a0after interrupting the performance Nov. 19, 2016. (Videos provided by Jeff Grider) Chris Jones and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters The lawyer for a man charged with disrupting a Chicago performance of the musical \"Hamilton\" \u00a0 blamed the incident on a \"hostile\" and \"partisan\" audience and said his client does not owe theatergoers an apology. Attorney Jonathan Feldman took issue with several witnesses who said John Palmer, 56, appeared intoxicated Saturday night as he yelled obscenities at the people around him and at the actors on stage after they sang the line, \"Immigrants / We get the job done,\" among the most political references in the show. Witnesses described Palmer as stumbling down the steps, spilling wine from a plastic cup and clenching his fists, threatening to fight people around him. Feldman insisted Palmer was incited by an audience that was clearly\u00a0 against President-elect Donald Trump , whom Palmer supports.\u00a0 He said the \"biased audience\" seemed whipped up by comments made by the cast of the Broadway production last week as Vice President-elect Mike Pence was leaving the theater. Brandon Victor Dixon, who portrayed Aaron Burr in the New York show, pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and read a message to Pence: \u201cWe, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir.\" Trump called the remarks \"harassment\" and has demanded an apology. Feldman said the incident in New York City helped create \"a hostile, partisan and biased environment in the theater\" in Chicago. \"It is unfortunate that I have to say that it seems as if the only party responsible for creating a hostile, partisan and biased audience ...\u00a0 might very well have been the cast and production of Hamilton itself,\" Feldman told reporters outside the East Bank Club. \" 'Hamilton' has created an audience environment that is very against our president-elect and it is unfortunate someone who supports the president-elect cannot feel welcome attending theater with his family,\" the lawyer added. Palmer, the CEO of a company based in Iowa, was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass after he was arrested around 9:30 p.m. at the PrivateBank Theatre in downtown Chicago. Mary Patchell of Chicago said Palmer showed up late with his party and was talking loudly. After getting up shortly after being seated, Palmer tripped and fell and spilled red wine on a child seated behind him, as well as on her arm, she said. \u201cHe got to his seat, then turned around to apologize to the kid,\" Patchell said. \"They accepted his apology and that should have been that. But then he continued apologizing in an extremely aggressive manner and his volume kept increasing. \u201cShortly after that was the line in Yorktown of 'Immigrants / We get the job done.\u2019 The crowd cheered at that, and that is when he started speaking at full volume,\" Patchell said. \"I immediately shot him a look of disapproval as we had just asked him to stop disrupting the show.\" ",

Rebel-held eastern Aleppo is shuddering as bombs rain down, with no place to treat the wounded. After each airstrike, every second counts. But sometimes all the rescue crews can do is take away the bodies. Between 200 and 300 people have been killed in the past week of relentless bombing. Hospitals that were still functioning have just now been hit. There are now none left to help the more than 200,000 residents, many of them already gravely hurt. Rebel-held eastern\u00a0Aleppo is shuddering as bombs rain down, with no place to treat the wounded.

    "text": "By Annie Gowen November 21 at 5:37 PM Follow @anniegowen NEW DELHI \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s company has partnered with Indian developers to create more business ventures than in any other foreign nation or territory, a Washington Post analysis of financial filings shows. In doing so, the Trump Organization has forged deals with leading moguls here, and with a billionaire politician. One Trump-branded project is under investigation for land- acquisition irregularities, among several projects in India now prompting conflict-of-interest concerns. The president-elect \u2014 who has called India a \u201cgreat country\u201d \u2014 is involved in at least 16 partnerships or corporations here. Those business interests \u2014 and the financial relationship with a leading member of the governing party \u2014 will be a significant backdrop to Trump administration policy toward the world\u2019s most populous democracy \u2014 and toward its warily hostile neighbor, Pakistan. At an October campaign event with the Indian American community in New Jersey, Trump boasted of his \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cvery beautiful\u201d development projects in the country and vowed that the relations between India and the United States would be \u201cthe best ever.\u201d The Trump Organization has struck lucrative licensing deals to lend its name to a luxury high-rise Trump Tower in Mumbai, a residential project in the smaller city of Pune, a large office-and- retail complex in the high-tech hub of Gurgaon, outside the capital, and another residential project and tower in Kolkata. Two Trump businesses associated with the Kolkata project were organized in November 2015, after Trump had formally begun his campaign for president. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) At least 111 Trump companies have done business in 18 countries and territories across South America, Asia and the Middle East, the Post analysis showed, ranging from luxury real estate complexes to small holding companies and branding deals. Some of the properties had multiple entities created for a single deal, records showed. A consortium of watchdog groups has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and called for the president-elect to set up a proper blind trust for his vast empire, instead of turning over the day-to-day management to his three grown children, as he has suggested he will do. \u201cTo sell the Trump name in a foreign country, that\u2019s just an excellent way to have him receiving gifts from all over the world. They\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ll just pay you to get the name Trump on my building,\u2019 as a way to curry favor,\u201d said Richard Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota who was the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Painter said that if \u201cforeign government money got in there through the back door,\u201d that would be a violation of the constitutional ban on foreign gifts to U.S. officials, a potentially impeachable offense. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Painter said. Pictures that emerged of three Indian businessmen posing for the cameras with Trump during a visit to Trump Tower in New York last week raised additional concerns about the president-elect\u2019s ability to separate his own business interests from his new role. Two of the men in the photo are brother developers of a residential tower complex bearing Trump\u2019s name. Atul and Sagar Chordia are under investigation after a civic activist, Ravindra Barhate, alleged that the land where the complex sits, in Pune, was acquired with fabricated documents. Authorities are investigating whether the developers built the complex \u201cwithout adhering to all the required formalities\u201d and without the \u201crequired permissions,\u201d according to Mukund Mahajan, a police inspector in Pune. Calls to the Chordias\u2019 office were not returned. The third Indian visitor to meet with Trump, \u00adKalpesh Mehta, told the Indian Express newspaper this month that the development value of Trump\u2019s projects in India is $1.5\u00a0billion, making the country one of the organization\u2019s largest markets. A spokesman for the Trump Organization said that \u201cno meeting of any sort took place\u201d and that the parties \u201cgreeted one another when passing and briefly exchanged quick hellos and congratulations.\u201d Trump swept into India in 2014 on his private jet with a phalanx of security and his son, Donald Jr., in tow, causing a stir in both Mumbai and Pune. He was feted at events with politicians and stars from the Bollywood film industry, saying at one point, \u201cI have tremendous confidence in India.\u201d Trump was there to promote the Trump Tower Mumbai, the 75-story building currently under construction by the Mumbai-based Lodha Group, with luxury apartments starting at $1\u00a0million and penthouses at $3\u00a0million. The company was founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, a state legislator from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, who leveraged his political connections into millions over the past 30 years \u2014 a \u201cmeteoric rise,\u201d as one analyst put it, that confounded many. Lodha currently ranks No.\u00a056 on the Forbes list of India\u2019s richest, with an estimated net worth of $1.55\u00a0billion. Lodha, 60, a teetotaling vegetarian of the Jain faith, has two sons who run the company now, prompting comparisons to the Trump scions Donald Jr. and Eric. \u201cIs this India\u2019s Donald Trump \u2014 minus the flash?\u201d the Indian Express wondered in 2014. \u201cHe must be elated. You have a partnership with the president of the United States? That\u2019s a huge thing,\u201d said Praveen Chakravarty, a political economist with the IDFC Institute in Mumbai. Buyers into the Trump Tower project have been promised such amenities as a 24-hour gym and spa and access to a private jet, according to promotional materials. But wealthy residents enticed into buying at another one of Lodha\u2019s recently built properties \u2014 the Bellissimo, which was not Trump-branded \u2014 thought they were getting similar amenities but wound up clashing with the developer over luxuries that failed to arrive, according to former residents. A tennis court was too small to be useful, the pool brown with construction dust, and the guaranteed \u201cbreathtaking views\u201d of the Arabian Sea disappeared \u00adafter another high-rise went up next door. The hot-water heaters routinely burst, causing floods. An elevator on the 48th floor opened to a brick wall. \u201cThere were many owners for whom the multimillion-dollar flats didn\u2019t live up to their billing,\u201d said Anil Kakani, 46, a tech investor who used to live in the building . A spokesman for the Lodha Group said it was investigating the complaints. Experts say that the Trump name is likely to remain marketable for the Trump family in India and that this could result in millions in future licensing fees. Indeed, a spokesman for the Lodha Group said that \u201centhusiasm and trust of the Trump brand\u201d was well reflected in the fact that the luxury apartments in its project in Mumbai were selling at 30\u00a0percent above the value of comparable residences nearby. The fractious presidential campaign had caused residents in the United States to demand that Trump lettering be removed from the front of their buildings is not likely to have the same impact here, experts say. \u201cThe Trump name is already associated with high-end, luxury buildings. Now it will be even more so,\u201d said Anshuman Magazine, the South Asia chairman of the property consulting firm CBRE. Prithviraj Chavan, a former chief minister of the state of Maharashtra, said that he met with Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. about five years ago and that the family was chiefly focused on licensing agreements. \u201cVery soon it was clear to me that Trump Junior wasn\u2019t really interested in investing in India, or putting in hard cash. He was only giving his brand name,\u201d Chavan said. Drew Harwell in Washington and Rama Lakshmi and Swati Gupta in New Delhi contributed to this report. Read more ",

    "text": "Suspect arrested in killing of San Antonio police officer Published               November 21, 2016 \u00a0 The suspect in the murder of a San Antonio police detective was arrested Monday afternoon. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said that 31-year-old Otis Tyrone McKane was taken into custody without incident at around 4:30 p.m. local time.\u00a0 McManus said authorities had pulled over a car McKane was a passenger in on Interstate 10, on the eastern edge of San Antonio. The car was being driven by a woman and a 2-year-old child was also in the vehicle. It was not immediately clear what connection McKane had to the woman and child.\u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract This image from 2012 shows Otis Tyrone McKane (Bexar County Jail) The arrest ended a 30-hour-long manhunt following the shooting of Det. Benjamin Marconi, 50, who was writing a traffic ticket when he was killed in his squad car late Sunday morning outside police headquarters. Investigators believed McKane pulled up behind Marconi's squad car, walked up to the officer's driver's-side window and opened fire. Authorities say the driver said the driver Marconi pulled over was not connected to the shooter.\u00a0 \"Everyone is relieved,\" McManus told reporters at a Monday evening news conference. \"I don't think anyone slept last night.\" McManus said that McKane had a criminal record, but did not elaborate. The chief also said that a vehicle sought by police was found near McKane's home. Surveillance video shows McKane at San Antonio police headquarters about four hours before Marconi was shot. The suspect asked a desk clerk a question but left before receiving an answer, said McManus, who declined to say what the man asked. \"I don't know why he was in headquarters. We have some ideas,\" he said. The shooting was one of several weekend\u00a0attacks that authorities say targeted law enforcement in multiple states. In Missouri, a St. Louis police sergeant was shot twice in the face Sunday evening while he sat in traffic in a marked police vehicle. The sergeant was released from the hospital Monday. Police officers also were shot and injured during traffic stops in Sanibel, Fla., and Gladstone, Mo., on Sunday night, but authorities have not suggested these were targeted attacks. The shootings come less than five months after a black military veteran killed five white officers at a protest in Dallas -- the deadliest day for American law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",

The news came amid an FBI-assisted nationwide manhunt. Local police spotted a black sedan with chrome rims that was captured on surveillance footage leaving the scene of Marconi's killing on Sunday, McManus said. After authorities tracked McCain for a few hours on Monday, a SWAT unit took him into custody without incident, he said. \"Everyone is feeling relief,\" he said. Earlier, McManus had been urging vigilance, telling officers to double up and ride two-to-a-car. SAPD Detective Benjamin Marconi SAPD Officers in Missouri and Florida were also wounded with non-life threatening injuries when suspects opened fire. In St. Louis, a 46-year-old, 20-year sergeant was shot in the face twice by a man who pulled up next to him at a traffic light at 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET). Authorities believe the suspect, who was later identified as George P. Bush, 19, had been involved in several robberies, a carjacking and a murder, chief Sam Dotson told reporters. \"We believe that he knew he was good for those crimes and that we were looking for him and [that] is why he aggressively attacked\" the officer, Dotson said. This undated photo provided by the St. Louis Police Department shows George P. Bush III, who police say shot a St. Louis police sergeant in the face Sunday night, Nov. 20, 2016, and then fled. Bush was killed by police as they converged on him early Monday morning. Bush had been wanted for questioning for several recent crimes. AP Bush, who fled the scene, was later killed by police after a chase and a gun battle, a St. Louis police spokesman said, adding that the sergeant, who was not identified, was released from a local hospital on Monday morning. Across the state, near the Kansas border, an officer from the city of Gladstone was shot after a passenger fled from a traffic stop at 10:34 p.m., then opened fire. A spokeswoman from the Kansas City Police Department, which is assisting authorities in Gladstone, said the officer was struck but returned fire, killing the suspect. Neither the officer nor the suspect were immediately identified. NBC affiliate KSHB of Kansas City reported that the officer was expected to make a full recovery. Police investigate a scene where a St. Louis police officer was shot  in St. Louis. The officer was shot Sunday night when a vehicle pulled alongside his SUV. The suspect fired two shots that struck the 46-year-old officer in the face. Police Chief Sam Dotson called it an \"ambush.\" The officer was released from a hospital Monday morning. St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP / AP On Sanibel Island, on Florida's Gulf Coast, some residents were warned to lock their doors and close their windows after an officer was injured during an incident that bore an eerie resemblance to the killing in San Antonio: while an officer completed a traffic citation just before 8 p.m., a passing motorist opened fire, wounding him, the Sanibel Police Department said in a statement. The officer, identified by NBC affiliate WBBH as Jarred Ciccone, was treated at a local hospital and released. The suspect, Jon Webster Hay, was taken into custody at his home after a shootout with authorities, the station reported. Related: Dallas Police 'Ambush': 12 Officers Shot, 5 Killed During Protest The spate of violence was a grim reminder that attacks against police have risen dramatically this year, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund said in a statement. According to what the fund described as preliminary information, 127 officers have been killed in the line duty in 2016, a 67 percent jump from the same time last year. \"Clearly, our officers are facing horrendous and growing risks while serving and protecting our communities,\" the statement said. Noting the spike in police killings, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Department of Justice was working to improve officer safety. \"I regard this increase with the utmost seriousness,\" she said. \"In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to assist state and local law enforcement officers in any way that we can to reduce the frequency and deadliness of these tragic incidents.\" Meanwhile, in Dallas, interim chief David Pughes said that he warned his officers on to use \"extreme caution,\" and he encouraged them to pair up with a partner. In Chicago, police officials distributed a safety bulletin on Monday morning and reminded officers to be \"extra vigilant\" while conducting traffic stops and field interviews, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Dispatchers will also check in with officers more regularly, he said. Chelsea Bailey ",

Hamilton County District Attorney Neal Pinkston told media outlets that five people died at the scene and one died at the hospital. Melydia Clewell, spokeswoman for the district attorney, confirmed the number. Previously, Chattanooga Police Assistant Chief Tracy Arnold said officials would not identify the students who died, or their ages, until parents were notified.

    "text": "President-Elect Trump Continues To Blur Line Between Business And Politics Typically when presidents or officeholders use a blind trust it's when their investments are handled by an investor, and they have no ability to manage or change them. That's crucial given a president's or key member of Congress' role in legislation or world events that can affect stock prices, investments or business interests. Trump has business entanglements and properties in the United States and all over the world. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, raising questions about the mixing of the family's business and politics. There were initial reports that Trump had inquired about security clearance for his children, but the president-elect has denied that . Still, it's clear his children have influence with their father when it comes to politics, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, figures to play a potentially prominent role in a Trump White House, formally or informally. Conway told NPR that Trump would \"comply with the law\" and is consulting with \"proper legal advisers.\" But there is hardly any precedent for a person with Trump's wealth and active business interests serving as leader of the free world. Conway pushed back on the idea that Trump should sign a pledge of any kind not to further his business interests while in the White House. Earlier on Monday, an Argentine newspaper, La Nacion, reported that Trump had asked the country's president to help with business permits for a Trump office building in their call last week. Spokesmen for both Trump and Argentine President Mauricio Macri both denied the report . \"It's a very interesting situation to have a president-elect that is such a successful businessman and has so many holdings,\" Conway acknowledged. Conway also commented on talk of a potential registry of Muslims in the country, saying it had been covered unfairly. She explained that Trump's \"main concern is making sure\" there's a system in place to better vet immigrants from \"countries that tend to train and export and harbor terrorists.\" \"It is not a blanket situation,\" Conway argued. \"He's made it very narrowly prescribed to countries that fit a particular description.\" Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday that he wasn't \"going to rule anything out\" but that \"we're not going to have a registry based on a religion,\" though \"some people that are radicalized ... have to be prevented from coming into this country.\" Conway also told NPR that the president-elect would hold a news conference \"at some point\" but that \"anytime you try to apply conventional techniques to Donald Trump you're going to be disappointed.\" Trump hasn't held a news conference since July 27, and he has waited longer than any president since Jimmy Carter to hold one after becoming president-elect.

Dale Kirlin Jr., left, and Gary Kirlin stand in their Kirlin's Hallmark store in Quincy, Ill., in 2001. The two men are being sued by their brother Donald Kirlin, who is co-owner of the business, which runs about 60 stores. (Phil Grussenmeyer / Illinois Retail Merchants Association) Becky Yerak Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Family businesses sometimes are ripped apart by warring siblings. The outwardly warm-and-fuzzy world of greeting cards is no exception. Once the nation's biggest independent Hallmark store chain, Kirlins Inc. is at the center of a lawsuit filed by one brother of the founding family against two of his siblings. Donald Kirlin says his brothers, Dale Kirlin Jr. and Gary Kirlin, aren't doing their very best when it comes to running Quincy-based Kirlins. The second-generation business, Donald Kirlin alleges, has been run into the ground by Dale Kirlin, chairman, and Gary Kirlin, president. He accuses his older brothers of paying a total of $40 million in bonuses, salaries, perquisites and other compensation to themselves and their families over the years. Donald Kirlin, meanwhile, has been shortchanged out of \"millions\" of dollars, the lawsuit says. \"This is a case about a once successful greeting card and gift shop company that has been looted and decimated by the rapacious greed, dishonesty and malfeasance of two brothers to the great detriment of their younger brother,\" says the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. The siblings' parents \"spent 50 years building this business with the intent to provide for future generations,\" the lawsuit says, \"and Dale and Gary have spent 20 years tearing it down.\" In 1948, Dale Kirlin Sr. borrowed $5,000 from his wife's brother \u2014 about $50,000 in today's dollars \u2014 to open a candy store in downtown Quincy, according to the company's website. Dale Jr. and Gary Kirlin hand-packed candy in the family basement. After customers began requesting greeting cards with their candy,  the retailer started stocking the Hallmark line. The patriarch initially thought the business might grow to a handful of stores. If you're like me, and you don't have kids of your own, holiday shopping for your littlest relatives can be tricky business. During your once-a-year pilgrimage into the toy aisle, you might find yourself wondering: Are Ninja Turtles even cool anymore? Who exactly is this Princess Elena of Avalor? ... ... (Sarah Halzack) When their father retired and handed over management to Dale and Gary Kirlin, the family's Hallmark chain had more than 115 stores, about 2,000 workers and annual revenues of over $120 million, the lawsuit says. In 2001, Kirlins was named Illinois Retailer of the Year by the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. \"I'm planning for it to be around to pass on to my family,\" Gary Kirlin told the Tribune that year. The city of Quincy, in a 2013 land-use plan, listed Kirlins'  local operations as one of the area's major employers, with 77 workers. By the end of 2015, Kirlins had shrunk to about 60 Hallmark stores with approximately 1,250 workers and $60 million in annual revenues, says the lawsuit, noting that the company is \"struggling financially.\" Earlier this year it closed a Hallmark store in Mattoon at Cross County Mall, where it had been a tenant since the center's 1971 opening and where it had expanded in 1999, according to the Journal Gazette and Times-Courier in Mattoon. Dale Kirlin chalked up his brother's lawsuit to a \"family disagreement that has spilled over into the court system.\" \"The charges are without merit,\" he said. \"We expect the ultimate dismissal of all charges.\" The lawsuit includes many \"erroneous\" allegations, including how much the brothers have paid themselves, Dale Kirlin said. Although Donald Kirlin's lawsuit pins the company's problems on his brothers' \"negligence, recklessness and sheer incompetence,\" the entire Hallmark empire's chain of stores has shrunk over the years. Hallmark says on its website it has about 2,000 Hallmark Gold Crown stores nationwide, including 1,650 that are independently owned. In 1996, there were 5,000, according to a Hallmark news release that year. Some of the Gold Crown stores that closed were opened in the 1970s and '80s and their owners have retired, Hallmark spokesman Andy DiOrio said in an email. Others were in shopping malls that have closed or seen declining customer traffic as the retail landscape has evolved, he added. The greeting card market is expected to witness slow growth over the coming years, said Brijesh Kumar Choubey, lead consumer and retail analyst for research firm Technavio. In 2015, U.S. retail sales of greeting cards \u2014 excluding e-cards \u2014 rose by 1.5 percent to $8.59 billion, and are expected to reach $9.07 billion in 2020, according to industry tracker Sundale Research. One possible reason: The explosion of social media has rekindled old friendships and created new ones, resulting in the purchase of more cards to stay in touch with a growing network of friends. \"A social media message isn't always acceptable for certain occasions,\" the research firm said in a July report. But growth rates of e-cards far exceed those sold in retail channels. In 2015, e-card sales rose by 4.6 percent to $868 million, and are expected to pass $1 billion in 2019. Hallmark, which wasn't named as a party in the lawsuit, is the biggest of about 3,000 greeting card publishers nationally, Sundale estimates. Donald Kirlin, who became a pilot instead of going into the family business, lives in Colorado. His brothers live in Illinois. Each owns about a third of Kirlins' stock. They're also the company's sole board members. Donald Kirlin repeatedly urged his brothers to hire professional managers to run the company or to retain consultants who might suggest improvements, but his request fell on deaf ears, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit also alleges conflicts of interest. Dale and Gary Kirlin took it upon themselves, without telling Donald Kirlin, to move management  of the company's $16 million retirement plan to the brokerage firm of one of Dale Kirlin's sons, who \"lacked appropriate experience,\" the lawsuit says. Another of Dale Kirlin's sons was made a store manager and later a district manager without evaluating his experience, the suit says. The brothers also moved the company's health insurance account, without Donald Kirlin's knowledge, to a firm run by a son-in-law of Dale Kirlin who wasn't qualified to oversee a plan covering more than 1,000 workers, the lawsuit says. . Kirlins, over Donald Kirlin's objections, also spent $1.8 million on a Cessna Citation II plane that cost at least $250,000 a year to insure, maintain and store, the suit says. The aircraft was used by Dale and Gary Kirlin and their families about 90 hours a year, but was used for company business only three to four times a year, the lawsuit says. The brothers eventually sold the aircraft for about $500,000. Charges in the lawsuit include civil racketeering, oppression of a minority shareholder, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, fraudulent concealment and interference with prospective economic advantage. Donald Kirlin seeks, among other things, a jury trial, compensatory and punitive damages, the removal of his brothers from the company, and the temporary appointment of a conservator to run the business.

In a brief statement, concert promoter Live Nation said the remaining dates of West's SAINT PABLO TOUR had been called off. No reason was given. But the statement added: \"Tickets will be fully refunded at point of purchase.\" A representative for West did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. The sudden cancellation of West's tour comes on the heels of a rough week for the rapper, who has made controversial statements and public feuds with fellow celebrities a centerpiece of his art and persona. On Thursday, West announced at a concert in San Jose, California, that he had not voted in the 2016 presidential election, but that he would have supported Trump \"if [he] voted.\" The statement was met with boos. \"I would've voted for Trump\" - @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/XtyUteCgUZ \u2014 albertoreyes (@albertoreyes) November 18, 2016 Two days later, West used another concert in Sacramento as an opportunity to lash out against everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Mark Zuckerberg, saying he was \"on my Trump sh-t tonight.\" West performed just two songs, according to The Sacramento Bee, and left abruptly after 30 minutes. Afterwards, the hashtag #KanyeIsOverParty soon began trending on Twitter. in one week, kanye west praised donald trump and bashed beyonc\u00e9... the life of pablo who? #KanyeIsOverParty pic.twitter.com/TG8VOTodWw ",

Reports of damage weren't immediately available. Two U.S. military officials told NBC News there were no early reports of injuries or damage to U.S. military installations. The Japan Meteorological Agency initially put the earthquake, which hit about 6 a.m. Tuesday (4 p.m. ET Monday), at magnitude 7.3 at a depth of about 19.6 miles. It later revised the magnitude to 7.4. The weather agency issued an early tsunami warning for Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures and urged immediate evacuations. The U.S. State Department advised Americans in the warning regions to seek higher ground. The JMA later downgraded the tsunami \"warning\" to a lesser \"advisory,\" at around 10 a.m. Tuesday local time. #Japan #Tsunami Warning- Those in regions under Tsunami Warning should evacuate to safer place such as high ground. https://t.co/iUSnNhK7bA \u2014 Travel - State Dept (@TravelGov) November 21, 2016 The U.S. Geological Survey, which put the quake at magnitude 6.9, described it as having moved along a lateral slip, saying quakes along faults that move laterally don't create the vertical movement associated with large tsunamis. Traffic jams as people flee after tsunami advisories are issued Tuesday morning in Iwaki in Japan's Fukushima Prefecture. Kyodo via Reuters Top tsunami waves of no more than about 3 meters (10 feet) were expected. The first wave, measuring 60 cm, or about 2 feet, arrived in Onahama port in Iwaki City in Fukushima Prefecture at 6:49 a.m., the weather agency reported. State broadcaster, NHK citing the Fukushima fire department, said there were several reports of people getting cut by broken glass but all the injuries were light. Jake Emen, an American staying in a 16th-floor hotel room in Tokyo, almost 150 miles away, told NBC News that his room began \"rumbling\" about 6 a.m. and then started to sway for several minutes. \"After settling down, an emergency announcement was made by the hotel indicating the building was stable but to avoid using elevators until they were tested,\" Emen said.

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station suffered meltdowns in three of its six reactors, leaving a huge area of land unusable for decades. The main government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said in a televised briefing that there was no imminent danger to the cooling system for spent fuel. But he said the No. 3 reactor at Fukushima Daini, the facility's sister plant, had stopped functioning and was under review. Fukushima Daini wasn't affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Coastal residents in Japan were ordered to flee to higher ground on Tuesday after a strong earthquake struck off the coast of Fukushima prefecture. (Photo: Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO \u2013 Residents were ordered to evacuate after a strong earthquake struck Japan\u2019s northeast coast early Tuesday. The magnitude 7.4 earthquake occurred at 5:59 a.m., local time, off the coast of Fukushima prefecture. It caused minor damage and injuries\u00a0and rocked buildings in Tokyo, about 150 miles away. A tsunami measuring 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) was reported near Sendai and officials issued a warning. The tsunami alert was later lifted, but the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a warning for additional waves of up to three meters (10 feet) in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, parts of which have still not recovered fully from the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in 2011. Residents were ordered to move to higher ground on Tuesday. Live television showed vehicles moving away from coastal regions at high speeds, and ships and fishing vessels moving out to sea. No damage or abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, which suffered a partial meltdown in 2011. Power was lost briefly Tuesday at the nearby Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant, but was quickly restored, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company. Most nuclear power plants in Japan have been shut down since the 2011 disaster. The weather agency placed the epicenter of the quake at 10 kilometers underground, off the coast of Fukushima. The quake measured a lower 5 on Japan\u2019s intensity scale, the weather agency said. Service was temporarily interrupted on some high-speed \u201cbullet\u201d trains in the region. Japan is one of the most seismically active regions of the world and earthquakes are fairly common.\u00a0 Nearly 16,000 people were killed and more than 2,500 remain missing from the magnitude 9.1 earthquake that struck Japan\u2019s northeastern \u201cTohoku\u201d on March 11, 2011, disaster. That quake generated a tsunami that reached heights of 133 feet and spread some six miles inland in some regions. ",

The hotly anticipated special holiday tree that Apple's chief design officer, Sir Jony Ive, decorated for London's swanky Claridge's hotel has been unveiled. The kicker: There's not a single ornament, light, or strand of tinsel on it. Claridge's Christmas tree. Claridge's Ive and his designer partner Marc Newson focused instead, they said, on centering an immersive experience around the tree that makes it feel like guests are walking through a snow-covered forest. Related: The Holly and the Ive-y: Apple's Design Guru Has a Christmas Surprise \"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,\" the design duo said in a statement. \"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\" The exclusive \u2014 and frequently over-the-top \u2014 holiday tree has been a Claridge's tradition for the past seven years, with designers such as Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry's Christopher Bailey having the honor in previous years.

Credit Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News, via Getty Images The proposed health insurance mega-merger between Anthem and Cigna heads to court on Monday, as the companies face off against a Justice Department seeking to block their $48 billion deal. It will be followed in just a few weeks by the trial for another proposed insurance mega-merger, between Aetna and Humana .

Trump could recalibrate how vigorously the federal government handles these two deals, as well as the many other deals now taking place in health care, according to legal experts. On Friday, Mr. Trump nominated Senator Jeff Sessions, the conservative Republican from Alabama, to replace Ms. Lynch. While it is unclear how Mr. Sessions would have the department handle antitrust cases, Mr. Trump has said that he wants less government regulation of business. In each of the two big cases headed to court, a federal judge will decide whether consumers would be worse off after the mergers take place. The companies contend people would benefit because a bigger company would be more efficient and better able to strike deals with hospitals and doctors that result in lower prices for medical care. In its pretrial brief, Anthem argues the government\u2019s opposition threatens to \u201cdeprive American consumers of lower health care costs.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The insurance deals were the culmination of a deal frenzy that took place in which the giant for-profit companies were desperate not to be left behind if the biggest companies got even bigger. All four companies involved in the mergers say they are committed, although the relationship between Anthem and Cigna has been fraught. The two have accused each other of breaching the merger agreement. Any fallout from the election would almost certainly not be felt immediately. Both cases are expected to be decided before Mr. Trump takes office in January. But a Trump administration could still have a major say, particularly if either the companies or the government decide to appeal the initial decision. There is little expectation that the Justice Department under the Trump administration would drop the case if the companies lost and appealed, for example, but it might be inclined to strike a settlement less onerous to the insurer. After the department under President Bill Clinton won its antitrust case against Microsoft, the officials taking over for President George W. Bush pursued a settlement that many viewed as less far-reaching than one that would have been sought by their predecessors. There is also a distinct chance, antitrust experts said, that the approach to health care mergers will not pivot much from the current one. \u201cThere is a history of bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement in health care,\u201d said Leslie C. Overton, a partner at Alston & Bird and a former Justice Department official. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should expect a wholesale shift, based on the change from Democratic to Republican.\u201d The clearest sign of the new administration\u2019s position, antitrust experts said, will come from who is appointed to crucial positions at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Other parts of the health care industry will also be on the lookout for any shift in stance. Hospital mergers, for example, have been aggressively challenged by the F.T.C. Last week, two large Chicago-area health systems, Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University HealthSystem, said they would continue their legal fight after an appeals court sent the case brought by the commission back to a lower court. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The F.T.C.\u2019s position on the health care deals may change less than the Justice Department\u2019s. The commission, an independent agency that includes both Republicans and Democrats, is somewhat less subject to the political preferences of the White House. But priorities often do change. \u201cThe swings from administration to administration have not been as strong as they have in the Justice Department,\u201d said Michael J. Perry, a former lawyer for the F.T.C. who is now a partner at Baker Botts. The agency has a long history of pursuing hospital mergers, he said, and \u201chas a lot of success\u201d in its attempts to block various deals. In any event, few expect the deal-making that has taken place in recent years to abate. Hospitals have joined with other hospitals and bought physician practices, surgery centers and the like to bulk up. Last month, two of the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit health systems, Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health, said they were in talks to join forces. Even among smaller insurers, mergers are likely to continue. This month, WellCare Health Plans announced its intention to buy Universal American, a smaller insurer, as a way to expand its presence in the private Medicare Advantage market. Although the federal health care law that was passed under President Obama, which prodded both insurers and health systems to deliver less-expensive medical care, encouraged some of the merger activity, many of these entities were likely to combine anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a global merger wave,\u201d said Martin S. Gaynor, an antitrust expert at Carnegie Mellon University. The possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans are pushing, is unlikely to change those dynamics. Hospitals may feel more pressure to join forces as a way of coping with what many people think will be a difficult environment. Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid could become less generous with their payments, and hospitals may experience an increase in the number of patients who have no insurance. What\u2019s more, health systems need access to capital to pay for sophisticated computer systems, and insurers, hospitals and doctors prefer the negotiating clout that comes with being bigger. Hospitals are likely to see the divide between winners and losers grow, said Dr. Sanjay B. Saxena, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, whose clients include health systems and insurers. \u201cThat shake-up,\u201d he said, \u201cis going to continue.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Experts Consider Health Care Deals Under a Trump Justice Department.

    "text": "Close Wetterling Family MINNEAPOLIS --\u00a0\u00a0A Minnesota man who abducted, sexually assaulted and killed 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling 27 years ago apologized in court Monday for his \u201cevil acts\u201d as he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on a child pornography count that let authorities close the books on a mystery that had haunted the state for nearly three decades. Danny Heinrich, 53, led authorities this summer to the field where he buried Jacob\u2019s remains. As part of his plea bargain, prosecutors agreed not to charge Heinrich with murder. \u201cI am truly sorry for my evil acts,\u201d Heinrich said as he stood before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim, Jacob\u2019s parents, Patty and Jerry Wetterling, and the boy\u2019s siblings. READ: Why Jacob Wetterling\u2019s confessed killer isn\u2019t charged with murder Heinrich told them that his actions were \u201cheinous\u201d and \u201cunforgivable,\u201d and apologized for what to Jacob\u2019s parents for taking their son away. He said he kept silent for nearly three decades out of fear, but he offered no explanation for why he killed Jacob. Heinrich\u2019s attorney told CBS Minnesota he hoped to \u201cexplain that he is a human being.\u201d When he confessed in court in September, Heinrich quoted a handcuffed Jacob as saying, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Jacob\u2019s mother, Patty Wetterling said Heinrich deliberately set out to hurt a child the night he abducted Jacob on Oct. 22, 1989, while her boy was biking with his brother and a friend near their home in the central Minnesota community of St. Joseph. She pointed out that by Heinrich\u2019s own admission, he put two bullets into his gun and shot Jacob with them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to hurt him. He did nothing wrong. He just wanted to go home,\u201d Patty Wetterling said. Danny Heinrich Close Patty Wetterling also told her son\u2019s killer she won\u2019t \u201cwaste a minute of time\u201d thinking about him \u201cfrom this day forward.\u201d The sentence was the maximum the law allowed, and Heinrich technically could complete it in 17 years with good behavior, but the plea deal allows state authorities to seek his civil commitment as a sexual predator at the end of his federal prison term, which could prevent him from ever going free. Tunheim said he \u201cwon\u2019t pretend\u201d that the sentence is only about child pornography. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is so heinous, so brutal and so awful that I don\u2019t believe society will let you go free,\u201d Tunheim said. While some of Jacob\u2019s siblings said they want Heinrich to spend the rest of his life in prison, the family agreed with prosecutors and investigators that the plea deal was their best hope of learning Jacob\u2019s fate. Early during the investigation, authorities questioned Heinrich, who maintained his innocence. But he came under renewed scrutiny when authorities decided to take a fresh look at the case around the 25th anniversary of the kidnapping. As part of that effort, investigators used new technology to go back to the sex assault cause of a 12-year-old Cold Spring boy that happened nine months before Jacob\u2019s disappearance. They found Heinrich\u2019s DNA on that boy\u2019s sweatshirt, and used that evidence to get a search warrant for Heinrich\u2019s home in Annandale, where they found his child pornography collection last year. After months of denials, Heinrich agreed in late August to confess to killing Jacob, as well as the Cold Spring sex assault. He led authorities to Jacob\u2019s remain\u2019s buried in a Paynesville field. Jacob Wetterling case ends with killer's confession Prosecutors and the Wetterling family agreed to the plea deal in exchange for information about what happened to the boy. Heinrich\u2019s attorney told CBS Minnesota what his client has struggled with the most is whether there is anything he could say to help with the healing. The attorney said Heinrich was moved most by the Wetterlings and that \u201cin the end the only thing he felt like he could give them is the location of Jacob\u2019s body so they could bury him.\u201d Heinrich detailed his crimes in chilling detail in court in September, recounting how he drove the boy to a gravel pit near Paynesville and molested him. After a patrol car with siren and lights passed nearby, he fired two shots at Jacob\u2019s head, killing him. Jared Scheierl, the victim of the Cold Spring sex assault, also attended the hearing. \u201cThis is another step towards closure,\u201d Scheierl said. \u201cIt\u2019s a traumatic event that defines your life in a lot of ways.\u201d Patty Wetterling and her husband Jerry became national advocates for missing children after Jacob\u2019s disappearance. A 1994 federal law named for Jacob requires states to establish sex offender registries. In\u00a0 a statement, U.S. attorney for the district of Minnesota Andrew Luger said the sentencing \u201cmarks the close of a sad chaper in Minnesota history.\u201d \u201cDanny Heinrich hurt countless lives, none more tragic than Jacob Wetterling,\u201d Luger said. \u201cI encourage all Minnesotans to draw on the example of Patty and Jerry Wetterling, who transformed their grief into hope. Patty and Jerry have dedicated their lives to helping other parents bring their kids home.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0President-elect Donald Trump took to social media this weekend to demand an apology from the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d after star Brandon Victor Dixon read a statement from the stage about the recent election to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was in attendance. Dixon said Monday morning he had \"nothing to apologize for,\" but now he may be saying sorry for something entirely different, namely some tweets (and retweets) he made years ago, before \u201cHamilton\u201d (and President-elect Donald Trump, for that matter) were even a thing. In one, Dixon wrote this: St. Patty's day weekend is like Christmas for black dudes who like white chicks. Happy holidays boys. @reesewaters #seasonsgreetings \u2014 Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) March 17, 2012 In another, he retweeted this: \u201c @jleefilm : 4 every racist comment I get about Trayvon Im going 2 turn 1 white married suburban housewife & mother n2 a jump off\u201d The. Best. \u2014 Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) July 18, 2013 For those not in the know, a \u201cjump off\" is a casual sexual encounter. And finally, in another, Davis wrote this: @TAMIKASLAWRENCE the problem is ho's aren't what they used to be. If ho game would step up, cats wouldn't get distracted. \u2014 Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) June 27, 2013 Marketing guru Scott Pinsker told FOX411 that Dixon\u2019s on-stage performance on Friday, in which the actor also chided his audience for booing Pence, is at odds with these less buttoned-up social media interactions. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly hypocritical for Mr. Dixon to adopt the persona of a concerned civil rights statesman and dress-down Pence in a public theater, and then use that kind of language on social media,\u201d Pinsker said. \u201cIt reeks of phoniness.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one of the dangers of celebrities who use social media, many of us have multiple sides to our personality, and there are unintended consequences to angry, divisive language,\u201d Pinsker added. \u201cIt can cost you the moral high ground, and make you look like an oblivious, self-aggrandizing hypocrite.\u201d Actor Dean Cain was also surprised by Dixon\u2019s past Twitter behavior. \u201cWow. When you decide to give a public lecture to the VP-elect, everything you have said now becomes public knowledge. I liked the response from Pence, \u2018This is what freedom sounds like,\u201d Cain said, referencing Pence\u2019s reported remarks to his family regarding the boos directed at him in the theater. But entertainment personality Cate Meighan said she doesn\u2019t see any disconnect at all. \u201cI get the sense that it was said tongue-in-cheek based on a particular situation at the time,\u201d Meighan said. \u201cI'm sure if you want to pick it apart and take offense then of course, you will.\u201d Meighan added that Dixon\u2019s past tweets don\u2019t detract \u201cfrom the basic message that was read at all. That, was very simple. Pence attended a production that is rooted in cultural diversity with the message being one of unity. Dixon spoke on behalf of the cast and simply requested that Pence take the message with him and use it in his new job as well.\u201d In the message delivered onstage, Dixon said to Pence in part: \"Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us here at 'Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do. \"We sir, we, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us \u2014 our planet, our children, our parents \u2014 or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. All of us.\" FOX411 reached out to Dixon several times but did not receive comment.

Advertisement It also calls for \u201cextreme vetting questions\u201d for \u201chigh-risk aliens.\u201d Questions included support for Sharia law, jihad and the equality of men and women. The document also calls for an end to entry for Syrian refugees. A Democrat explains why she met with Trump. Ms. Gabbard , an Iraq war veteran and former Bernie Sanders supporter, defended her visit Monday to the office of the president-elect, saying she needed to talk foreign policy with Mr. Trump \u201cbefore the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government.\u201d Her statement, lengthy and somewhat defensive, allowed, \u201cWhile the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump, I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives.\u201d She then made the case against any intervention in a war that has pulled in Russia and left hundreds of thousands slaughtered. \u201cPresident-elect Trump and I had a frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth. I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no-fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country and the world. It would lead to more death and suffering, exacerbate the refugee crisis, strengthen ISIS and Al Qaeda, and bring us into a direct conflict with Russia, which could result in a nuclear war. We discussed my bill to end our country\u2019s illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government, and the need to focus our precious resources on rebuilding our own country, and on defeating Al Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups who pose a threat to the American people.\u201d Her case is a break from the position that her fellow Democrat, Hillary Clinton, campaigned on. It fits nicely with Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to engage \u2014 and with warnings against American involvement from the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin. Kellyanne Conway advises Democrats on \u2018identity politics.\u2019 And speaking of Ms. Gabbard, Kellyanne Conway, a Trump senior adviser and his campaign manager, took some time on Monday to laud the fledgling rebellion in Democratic ranks against the liberal old guard. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Conway praised Ms. Gabbard\u2019s willingness to buck the party, boosted Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Youngstown, Ohio, who is challenging Representative Nancy Pelosi\u2019s leadership, and had kind words for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has said Democrats need to focus more on economic struggles and less on the grievances of minorities and women. \u201cBernie Sanders today was also quoted as saying they should stop identity politics in the Democratic Party. Whoa. He can call and we\u2019ll tell him how to do that and win,\u201d she said.

Trump's plan to repair our infrastructure is a scam that gives massive tax breaks to large companies & billionaires. https://t.co/05JEyOwddR \u2014         Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) Nov. 21, 2016 Conway says Trump\u2019s business pursuits don\u2019t violate the law. Ms. Conway also weighed in on the growing scrutiny of the president-elect\u2019s business pursuits, which appear to be continuing even as he prepares to lead the free world. \u201cI\u2019m very confident he is not breaking any laws. He has various lawyers, accountants and advisers who tell him what he must do and what he can. He\u2019s a businessman, he\u2019s also working on transition. He\u2019s the president-elect. We\u2019re in unprecedented times. We have someone who has been very successful.\u201d She also made it clear she did not like reporters questioning his continuing business pursuits. \u201cDo you ask people how long they will play golf and do the transition? Are you suggesting he is doing something illegal?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI already said he is not. But the presumption is that he is.\u201d Reports of a fractious TV get-together with Trump. A coterie of leading television executives and on-air personalities met Monday with the president-elect for an off-the-record meeting. Depending on the accounts, it may or may not have gone swimmingly. The New York Post wrote it up as a battle royal. \u201cTrump kept saying, \u2018We\u2019re in a room of liars, the deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong,\u2019\u201d the president-elect\u2019s favorite tablo i d wrote . Ms. Conway said the meeting had been \u201cmischaracterized.\u201d \u201cNo, he did not explode in anger,\u201d she said. Among those spotted were NBC\u2019s Deborah Turness, MSNBC\u2019s Phil Griffin, CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker and Wolf Blitzer, Fox News\u2019s Bill Shine , Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace and Suzanne Scott, and CBS\u2019s John Dickerson and Charlie Rose. Scott Brown really wants a job. Former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts emerged from the gilded elevators of Trump Tower on Monday to do what most visitors have not: Make a public case to be in the president-elect\u2019s cabinet. Specifically, the man who lost a Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren, then failed to win another in New Hampshire, wants to be secretary of veterans affairs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe obviously spoke about my passion and his passion, which are veterans and veterans issues,\u201d he told the news media. \u201cThe toughest job in the cabinet is to lead the V.A., because it has, while it has so many angels working there, it has so many great problems as well. So he\u2019s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I\u2019m glad that he called.\u201d He did acknowledge he was not a sure thing, despite his early and passionate advocacy for candidate Trump in New Hampshire, which Mrs. Clinton narrowly carried. \u201cI think I\u2019m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there, and I don\u2019t look at it as a competition,\u201d he said. The \u2018Seven Sisters\u2019 strike back against Bannon. Perhaps it was impolitic of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s senior adviser, to praise conservative women like Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter by saying their leadership \u201cwould be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children.\u201d \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England,\u201d he said in a 2011 radio interview. Now the heads of Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, Smith College, Vassar College and Wellesley College are asking the future senior White House adviser to \u201ctake a more expansive, informed and tolerant worldview.\u201d \u201cOur alumnae are accomplished leaders in all spheres of public and professional life; they are committed to their work, their families and their countries. Now more than ever, we look to those who would lead the United States of America for a message of inclusion, respect and unity,\u201d they wrote in an open letter to Mr. Bannon . Clinton\u2019s popular vote lead surpasses 1.7 million. Hillary Clinton\u2019s popular vote lead surged above 1.72 million on Sunday night, with millions of votes still to count. At 1.3 percentage points, she has built a lead not seen in a losing campaign since Rutherford B. Hayes\u2019s bitterly disputed election of 1876 .

    "text": "Close AP NEW YORK \u2014\u00a0The Bureau of Prisons has acknowledged for the first time that two of its officials traveled 14 years ago to a secret CIA detention site in Afghanistan, where they provided training to staff at a facility once described by an intelligence official as \u201cthe closest thing he has seen to a dungeon.\u201d The admission came Thursday in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which sued in April after the Bureau of Prisons denied having any record of involvement with the detention site. The Bureau of Prisons\u2019 November 2002 visit to the site \u2014 known interchangeably as \u201cThe Salt Pit\u201d and COBALT \u2014 was documented in a Senate Intelligence Committee report on torture, interrogation and detention, which was released in 2014.\u00a0 The report notes that prison officials determined the site was \u201cnot inhumane\u201d despite seeing detainees who were forced to stand for days naked and shackled to walls in total darkness, \u201cin a facility that was described to be 45 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d Loud music played around the clock and the detainees were given only buckets for their waste. The CIA asked for the Bureau of Prisons inspection, because agents worried conditions were too harsh for them to elicit reliable intelligence, according to the Senate report.\u00a0 Some detainees \u201c\u2019literally looked like (dogs) that had been kenneled,\u201d one interrogator said, according to the Senate report. \u00a0\u201cWhen the doors to their cells were opened, \u2018they cowered.\u2019\u201d Gul Rahman (pictured) died in the early hours of Nov. 20, 2002, after being shackled to a cold cement wall in a secret CIA prison in northern Kabul known as the Salt Pit. Close AP Photo/Habib Rahman, Ho During the prison officials\u2019 visit, one detainee,\u00a0 Gul Rahman, died from apparent hypothermia, \u201cnaked except for a sweatshirt ,\u201d the report said. Rahman was well-known in Afghanistan after an earlier incident in which he rescued the country\u2019s president, Hamid Karzai, while wading through rocket and small-arms fire. Prison officials said they were \u201cwow\u2019ed\u201d and had \u201cnever been in a facility where individuals are so sensory deprived,\u201d according to the Senate report.\u00a0 The Bureau of Prisons is a domestic law enforcement agency that does not have the authority to classify intelligence information. The agency explained in the legal filing on Thursday that the two officials who visited the detention site were told by the CIA \u201cthat they were not permitted to discuss their participation in this training, or to create or retain any records of the training or their involvement.\u201d Despite the extraordinary, and rare, assignment to travel to a war zone, one of the two officials told a Bureau of Prisons lawyer this year that he \u201cnever saw a written request .... rather, his supervisor orally tasked him to participate.\u201d That same prisons official conducted training for the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, and was allowed to produce limited documentation of that assignment.\u00a0 Carl Takei, the ACLU attorney who first asked the Bureau of Prisons for information about the COBALT visit in a Freedom of Information Act request, said Thursday\u2019s acknowledgement raises new questions about the agency\u2019s role at the detention site. \u201cThese two particular individuals, according to the Senate report, saw a place that was simply horrifying and they had a chance to raise alarms about these conditions of confinement. Instead of doing that, they allowed it to proceed unopposed,\u201d Takei said. He added that it\u2019s an issue that has suddenly become pressing in the days since members of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team have indicated an interest in reinstating approval for certain controversial interrogation techniques . \u201cAs we transition from the Obama administration to the Trump administration, this entire question of official torture is being raised anew,\u201d Takei said. \u201cThis is an illustration of how when there\u2019s an administration that officially endorses torture, that endorsement effects every level of government.\u201d The ACLU said Monday it is dropping its lawsuit against the Bureau of Prisons because of Thursday\u2019s disclosure. The Bureau of Prisons filing includes a series of emails sent in 2011 and 2015 about the Afghanistan trip.\u00a0 The 2015 email includes a link to a CBS News article about the agency\u2019s visit to the detention site , and the email\u2019s subject line was the title of the article.\u00a0 In the body of the email, the sender wrote just one sentence: \u201cThey just won\u2019t let it go.\u201d The Bureau of Prisons has not yet responded to a request for comment on this case.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic If he is nominated as secretary of state, Mr. Giuliani would face questions over his security firm\u2019s ties to the government of Qatar and the speeches he gave to an Iranian exile opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations. Asked whether he was concerned about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s business dealings, Mr. Trump said, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Mr. Trump, as he used his golf resort as the backdrop for his official activities, gave no indication that he was concerned about news reports over the weekend that he had held meetings last week with three Indian business partners even as he was starting to assemble his administration. The very public process \u2014 CNN trained a camera on the golf club\u2019s wooden front door throughout the day on Sunday \u2014 has borne few similarities to attempts by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors to project an image of careful, private vetting of cabinet-level hopefuls. Officials running President Obama\u2019s transition in late 2008 took pains to keep under wraps his plans to select Hillary Clinton for secretary of state, and they orchestrated a secret meeting at the firehouse at Reagan National Airport to discuss keeping Robert M. Gates as defense secretary. But for Mr. Trump and his aides, many of whom have long rejected the capital\u2019s customs, such traditions are best discarded. Advertisement \u201cThis has been a year and election cycle where the normal conventions and past history has been challenged,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist whose longtime boss, Mr. Romney, discussed the secretary of state post with Mr. Trump. Photo Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey arriving at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster on Sunday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times \u201cWhy would the transition and the first few months of the administration be any different?\u201d Mr. Madden said. \u201cTrump does things Trump\u2019s way.\u201d After each interview, Mr. Trump, dressed in a suit and tie, emerged from the club next to an American flag to see the candidates off to their sport-utility vehicles and once again speak with reporters. \u201cTremendous talent \u2014 we\u2019re seeing tremendous talent,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Saturday. \u201cPeople that, as I say, we will \u2018make America great again.\u2019 These are really great people. These are really, really talented people.\u201d By the evening, however, Mr. Trump had announced no appointments, leaving reporters waiting on the cold, gusty day to speculate about Mr. Trump\u2019s brief comments. \u201cWe made a couple of deals,\u201d he said as his weekend of interviews drew to a close. Mr. Giuliani is apparently in competition with several others for the secretary of state position, including David H. Petraeus, the retired four-star general who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s C.I.A. director before leaving amid revelations that he had provided classified information to a woman with whom he was having an affair. Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics during the 2016 campaign, met with the president-elect on Saturday. If he becomes secretary of state, he could be a moderating influence on the hard-liners Mr. Trump has chosen for attorney general, national security adviser and C.I.A. director. \u201cI can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program. Photo Mr. Trump with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, on Sunday. Mr. Giuliani is apparently in competition with several others for the secretary of state position. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Mr. Trump\u2019s consideration of General Mattis, who is widely respected throughout the military, could also signal an effort to ease concerns among members of the Washington establishment about the shape of his cabinet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story General Mattis, who led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein, later commanded American troops during the hard-fought battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in 2004. But his argument for a tougher military posture against Iran at times clashed with the views of Mr. Obama and his national security team. General Mattis, who would be the first former ranking general to become defense secretary since George Marshall in the early 1950s, would need a congressional waiver to take office because federal law stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years. General Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013. As Mr. Trump moves to complete his national security team, he may soon turn his attention to domestic affairs. Aides have said members of the transition effort\u2019s economic and domestic policy teams will fan out to meet with agency officials starting on Monday. Mr. Obama, asked Sunday at a summit meeting in Lima, Peru, about stances Mr. Trump has taken that align with the views of his nascent national security team, said: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that the president-elect won\u2019t pursue some of the positions that he\u2019s taken. But what I can guarantee is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That\u2019s just the way this office works.\u201d Mr. Trump also continued his practice of early-morning bursts on Twitter this weekend. Before attending church with Mr. Pence, Mr. Trump condemned the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d for its onstage appeal on Friday night to the vice president-elect \u2014 who was in the audience \u2014 to uphold the rights of a \u201cdiverse America.\u201d \u201cThe cast and producers of \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote . In another Twitter post , the president-elect expressed his disapproval of \u201c Saturday Night Live ,\u201d calling it a \u201ctotally one-sided, biased show \u2014 nothing funny at all.\u201d Mr. Trump was portrayed on the show as being overwhelmed by the prospect of being president. Even as Mr. Trump bemoaned the actions of the cast of \u201cHamilton,\u201d a smash hit on Broadway, Mr. Pence said on Sunday morning that he was not offended or bothered. In an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Pence said he would \u201cleave it to others\u201d to decide whether the theater was an appropriate place for a political message. \u201c\u2018Hamilton\u2019 is just an incredible production and just incredibly talented people,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIt was a real joy to be there.\u201d Michael S. Schmidt reported from Bedminster, and Michael D. Shear from Washington. Nicholas Fandos and Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

    "text": "How Fake News Goes Viral: A Case Study By Sapna Maheshwari Image Images posted on Twitter by a marketer in Austin, Tex., the day after the presidential election. Credit Eric Tucker, a 35-year-old co-founder of a marketing company in Austin, Tex., had just about 40 Twitter followers. But his recent tweet about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations against President-elect Donald J. Trump fueled a nationwide conspiracy theory \u2014 one that Mr. Trump joined in promoting.\u00a0 Mr. Tucker's post was shared at least 16,000 times on Twitter and more than 350,000 times on Facebook. The problem is that Mr. Tucker got it wrong. There were no such buses packed with paid protesters. But that didn't matter. While some fake news is produced purposefully by\u00a0 teenagers in the Balkans \u00a0or\u00a0 entrepreneurs in the United States \u00a0seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. Here, The New York Times deconstructs how Mr. Tucker\u2019s now-deleted declaration on Twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon. It is an example of how, in an ever-connected world where speed often takes precedence over truth, an observation by a private citizen can quickly become a talking point, even as it is being proved false. Nov. 9, shortly after 8 p.m. Eastern Image CreditSnopes Mr. Tucker, who had taken photos of a large group of buses he saw near downtown Austin earlier in the day because he thought it was unusual, saw reports of protests against Mr. Trump in the city and decided the two were connected. He posted three of the images with the declaration: \u201cAnti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin\u201d Mr. Tucker said he had performed a Google search to see if any conferences were being held in the area but did not find anything. (The buses were, in fact, hired by a company called Tableau Software, which was holding a conference that drew more than 13,000 people.) \u201cI did think in the back of my mind there could be other explanations, but it just didn\u2019t seem plausible,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he had posted as a \u201cprivate citizen who had a tiny Twitter following.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m also a very busy businessman and I don\u2019t have time to fact-check everything that I put out there, especially when I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going out there for wide consumption.\u201d Nov. 10, 12:49 a.m. Eastern Image Credit Several hours later, the first important step occurred. Mr. Tucker\u2019s tweet was posted to the main Reddit community for Mr. Trump under the heading: \u201cBREAKING: They found the buses! Dozens lined up just blocks away from the Austin protests.\u201d It quickly generated more than 300 comments, some of which blamed the protests on George Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist, who is a frequent target of the group. Nov. 10, around 9 a.m. Eastern The next morning, the frenzy began. A user on Free Republic, a conservative discussion forum, linked to the Reddit thread about Mr. Tucker\u2019s post, increasing the attention and spreading it further into the online world. Later, Facebook pages like Robertson Family Values, which is named for but not affiliated with the stars of \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d and Donald Trump Commander in Chief 2020, linked to the Free Republic discussion. Those posts were shared more than 5,000 times each, and more than 300,000 Facebook users have linked to the Free Republic thread. Image Credit Nov. 10, late morning through the afternoon Sean Hughes, the director of corporate affairs for the bus company Coach USA North America, said he learned about the rumor involving its vehicles after receiving a couple of curious emails and hearing from a friend in New Jersey who had seen the claim on Facebook and wanted to know if it was true. A reporter at the Fox television station in Austin contacted Mr. Hughes later that day, and he responded with a statement noting that \u201cat no point were Coach USA buses involved in the Austin protests.\u201d But that did little to stem the online furor. \u201cThat reporter said, \u2018You\u2019re probably going to get a lot more phone calls because it\u2019s all over the place,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hughes said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019re the second journalist to actually call me to see what was going on, no bloggers or anything, and we\u2019re easily accessible on our website,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. He added, \u201cI just kind of wish people looked into facts before they go ahead and do something like that, because it could be easily debunked based on a quick phone call or two, or a couple emails.\u201d During this time, Mr. Tucker was replying to queries on Twitter about whether he had proof to support his claim. He confirmed in a post that he \u201cdid not see loading or unloading\u201d but that the buses were \u201cquite near protests at right timing.\u201d That admitted lack of evidence, however, had little effect. By about noon, Mr. Tucker\u2019s initial post had been retweeted and liked more than 5,000 times. There was more to come. @stevendenoon I did not see loading or unloading. There were even more busses than in pics. Quite near protests at right timing. ",

Sherburne County Sheriff's Office via AP Danny Heinrich, a 53-year-old man who admitted to killing 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling in 1989, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. As we've reported , Heinrich admitted to the murder almost three decades after Wetterling went missing. Earlier this fall, Heinrich led police to where he had buried Wetterling's body. As Minnesota Public Radio reports , as part of a plea deal, Heinrich will never face murder charges. He instead pleaded guilty to a federal child pornography charge. MPR reports : While the sentence for Danny Heinrich was as expected, the courtroom scene was gut-wrenching at times as Jacob's family talked about how the 11-year-old's abduction in 1989 and the nearly 30-year quest to find him ripped the fabric of their lives and the lives of the community around their St. Joseph, Minn., home. \"I am truly sorry for my evil acts that I have done against victims and their family, and the shame I brought on myself and my family,\" Heinrich told the court. \"The suffering and pain they have spoke today I will always remember. Mr and Mrs. Wetterling: the heinous acts, the selfishness are unforgivable for what I have taken away from you.\" Article continues after sponsorship After Heinrich's sentence is over, MPR reports, he may still \"be subject to civil commitment as a sex offender.\" ",

    "text": "Trump Says He Will Withdraw from TPP on Day One, Mum on Building the Wall By Candace Smith Nov 21, 2016, 7:28 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Says He Will Withdraw From TPP on Day One 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump has released a video message on social media detailing his plans for the first 100 days of his presidency, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Day One, but staying mum on his signature immigration issue, building a wall on the southern border. Trump, breaking precedent, has not yet held a press conference and has not answered ongoing questions surrounding potential conflicts of interest regarding his business and the presidency. He and his family sat for an interview with CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d the Sunday after the election, but has since forgone any other opportunities to be questioned other than those shouted as visitors came and went from Trump National Golf Club last weekend. \u201cOur transition team is working very smoothly, efficiently and effectively. Truly great and talented men and women, patriots indeed, are being brought in and many will soon be a part of our government,\u201d he says. Trump goes on to discuss policies he championed during his candidacy; his intent to withdraw from the TPP, cancelling restrictions on coal and gas, ethics reform, as well as lobbying bans. \u201cOn ethics reform, as part of our plan to drain the swamp, we will impose a five year ban of executive officials becoming lobbyists after they leave the administration. And a lifetime ban on executive officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government,\u201d Trump said, reiterating a policy his transition team announced earlier this month. He also addresses immigration, one of his hallmark policies during his candidacy. He proposes, not to build the wall he became infamous for suggesting he would construct, but instead an executive action to investigate visa abuse. \u201cOn immigration, I will direct the department of labor to investigate all abuses of visas programs that undercut the American worker,\u201d he adds. The message follows a week of nearly back-to-back meetings as Trump's transition team tries to fill the over 4,000 jobs within the White House and government agencies. He has put his selection process on display; this weekend, at his estate in Bedminster, NJ, applicants entered into the clubhouse in full view of cameras. Before and after interviews Trump himself would come out and greet them, occasionally offering words of praise. \u201cTremendous talent \u2014 we\u2019re seeing tremendous talent,\u201d Trump said Saturday. \u201cPeople that, as I say, we will \u2018make America great again.\u2019 These are really great people. These are really, really talented people.\u201d And Monday Trump took meetings with several individuals including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , former Sen. Scott Brown , and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard . 0 Shares ",

Tulsi Gabbard 'Under Serious Consideration' for Trump Cabinet By Shushannah Walshe Nov 21, 2016, 3:42 PM ET 0 Shares Star Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) places Senator Bernie Sanders name in nomination for President of The United States, during the second day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, July 26, 2016. 0 Shares Email Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , a high-profile Bernie Sanders supporter during the Democratic primaries , is \u201cunder serious consideration\u201d for various Cabinet positions in President-elect Donald Trump 's administration, according to a senior official on the transition team. According to the official, the 35-year-old Hawaii congresswoman is being looked as a candidate for secretary of state, secretary of defense or United Nations ambassador. If selected, Gabbard will be the first woman as well as the youngest pick for Trump's Cabinet. She met with him this morning in his New York City offices at Trump Tower. The Trump transition source said that their sit-down was a \u201cterrific meeting\u201d and that the Trump team sees her as very impressive. Gabbard, a progressive Democrat, has bucked her party in Congress and during the contentious Democratic primaries. In February she left her position as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee to support Sanders. In the House she has broken with Democrats on the Syrian civil war (she supports keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power) and Syrian refugees (she voted for a GOP bill last year to conduct stricter background checks on refugees). This afternoon she released a long statement on her meeting with Trump, saying he asked to meet with her about \"our current policies regarding Syria, our fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS , as well as other foreign policy challenges we face.\u201d She said they had a \u201cfrank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth.\" \"I felt it important to take the opportunity to meet with the president-elect now before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government \u2014 a war which has already cost hundreds of thousands of lives and forced millions of refugees to flee their homes in search of safety for themselves and their families,\" she said in the statement, adding that she would not let politics get in the way of meeting with the president-elect. \"I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives.\" She added that when she disagrees with Trump, \"I will not hesitate to express that disagreement.\" \"However, I believe we can disagree, even strongly, but still come together on issues that matter to the American people and affect their daily lives. We cannot allow continued divisiveness to destroy our country \u2026 I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country and the world,\" she said. \"It would lead to more death and suffering, exacerbate the refugee crisis, strengthen ISIS and al-Qaeda and bring us into a direct conflict with Russia, which could result in a nuclear war. We discussed my bill to end our country\u2019s illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government and the need to focus our precious resources on rebuilding our own country and on defeating al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups who pose a threat to the American people.\" ABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Home buyers' and sellers' interests must be protected when the same firm represents both, state Supreme Court rules Malibu home The Malibu home Hiroshi Horiike bought for $12.25 million in cash. The Malibu home Hiroshi Horiike bought for $12.25 million in cash. (Pictometry) Maura Dolan and Andrew Khouri Contact Reporters Hiroshi Horiike decided to buy\u00a0the Malibu home the day he saw it. The wealthy, Hong Kong\u00a0businessman paid $12.25 million in cash for the Tuscan-style mansion with four\u00a0bedrooms, 5\u00bd\u00a0 bathrooms and an infinity pool that looked out over\u00a0the ocean. Two years later, Horiike\u00a0learned the house he thought was 15,000 square feet was actually recorded as having\u00a0less than 10,000. He\u00a0sued the seller\u2019s agent and the brokerage firm, Coldwell Banker. On Monday, the California Supreme Court ruled unanimously for Horiike, saying the seller\u2019s agent had a duty to disclose relevant\u00a0information about the house because both the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s agents\u00a0worked for the same firm. The case has been closely watched in the real estate industry, and some experts predicted that a ruling for Horiike would cause havoc. The industry\u00a0feared the court might establish\u00a0requirements that would force real estate agents to make disclosures that would hurt the clients who hired them. But brokers and real estate experts said Monday the decision was relatively narrow, and they did not expect any upheaval. They noted that disputes over square footage are common. USC law professor George Lefcoe said the decision\u00a0will require agents to be more careful and may create more paperwork, but the industry will continue to allow such arrangements because a brokerage can collect a commission from both parties. \u201cIt\u2019s too lucrative,\u201d he said. It has long been recognized that real estate agents who represent both the\u00a0seller and the buyer in a transaction\u00a0owe a duty to both clients. The court said agents who work for the same company also have dual obligations, even if they are representing different clients. The California Assn. of Realtors had urged the court to reject Horiike\u2019s arguments, saying the agent for the seller had a special duty only to the seller.\u00a0 If the court found otherwise, the loyalty of agents would be torn, lawyers argued.\u00a0 The court, in a ruling written by Justice Leondra Kruger, acknowledged the potential pitfalls and said the industry could ask the Legislature to change the law. But the court stressed that the issues raised by Horiike did not involve confidential information the seller gave to his agent. The seller\u2019s agent had the same duty as\u00a0the brokerage company that employed both agents \u2014 \u201cto learn and disclose all facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property,\u201d Kruger wrote. Frederic D. Cohen, who represented Horiike\u00a0in the case, said the ruling would help ensure that brokerage companies \u201cactually take their responsibility to represent both sides more seriously.\u201d Horiike,\u00a0born poor in China and educated in Japan, earned his fortune manufacturing electronics\u00a0and now makes documentaries and heads efforts\u00a0to end the consumption of dog meat\u00a0in Asia, a spokeswoman said. He speaks only Chinese and Japanese, and the agent he selected\u00a0out of Coldwell Banker\u2019s Beverly Hills office communicated with him in Japanese. Chris Cortazzo, a top-performing Coldwell agent who works\u00a0out of Malibu, represented the seller.\u00a0 On his website, Cortazzo says he is a Malibu native who has represented \u00a0\u201csome of the biggest names in entertainment and business\u201d\u00a0with more than $1.9 billion in closings since 2000. Horiike charged that Cortazzo and Coldwell Banker breached their fiduciary duty by failing to warn him that he should investigate the actual square footage of the property. Cortazzo had produced a flier saying the Malibu house had about\u00a015,000 square feet of livable space. That\u00a0square footage\u00a0included two garages, a habitable basement and patios and balconies, according to written arguments in the case. Before dealing with Horiike, Cortazzo had advised another potential buyer to investigate the square footage. Cortazzo\u00a0eventually sent\u00a0Horiike\u2019s agent a copy of the original building permit, which said the house was less than 10,000 square feet. Horiike\u2019s agent forwarded the permit\u00a0to him, but Horiike said he never read it. A trial judge ruled that Cortazzo, as the seller\u2019s agent, owed no specific duty to the buyer, and a jury found for Cortazzo and Coldwell Banker. Horiike appealed, and a court of appeal decided unanimously that Cortazzo had been obligated to ensure Horiike\u2019s interests were protected. In upholding that decision, the California Supreme Court revived Horiike\u2019s lawsuit, which can now go to trial again with jury instructions more favorable for Horiike. Nick Segal, chief executive of luxury real estate brokerage Partners Trust, said the kind of relationships covered by the ruling are extremely common.\u00a0 \u201cWe do that fairly often,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But he doubted the case would have far-reaching consequences, in part because agents already represent both buyer and seller in many cases and the ruling would simply expand that relationship to others. \u00a0 Instead, he said the case serves as a notice to real estate agents that they will be \u201cheld accountable\u201d for things they should have been doing anyway. Loyola Law School\u00a0professor\u00a0 Dan Schechter \u00a0said agents won\u2019t be required to disclose potential offers or a seller\u2019s urgency to sell \u2014 though they must now work in the interest of both parties.\u00a0 If a seller has an unpermitted kitchen, for instance, the seller\u2019s agent would be required to disclose that to the buyer. But if the seller was simply unhappy with the quality of a contractor\u2019s work on a kitchen, the seller\u2019s agent probably could withhold that information if they were only working in the best interest of the seller, Schechter said.\u00a0 If an agent has a fiduciary duty to both sides, he or she should tell the buyer about lingering doubts over quality, Schechter said.\u00a0 \u201cThe right thing to do is just disclose and lay it all out,\u201d Schechter\u00a0said.\u00a0 June Barlow, vice president and general counsel of the California Assn. of Realtors, said the group was \u201cheartened\u201d that the court ruled narrowly and did not bar agents or brokerage firms from representing both a buyer and a seller. Horiike said through a spokeswoman that the house had caused him much suffering and he has considered selling it. But he described his court victory as inspiring. \u201cWhile this house brings back a lot of unpleasant memories, now that I have won the lawsuit against Coldwell Banker, the house becomes a landmark for the victory of consumer rights,\u201d Horiike said.

(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) Two new names have emerged as possible candidates for Department of Homeland Security secretary under President-elect Donald Trump, including a retired Marine general who clashed with the Obama administration over women in combat and plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, people familiar with the selection process said Monday. Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, who retired this year as chief of U.S. Southern Command, is under consideration for the critical homeland security post, the people said. Also under consideration is Frances Townsend, a top homeland security and counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush administration, they said. Kelly, a widely respected military officer who served for more than 40 years, opposed the administration\u2019s failed plans to close Guantanamo and has strongly defended how the military treats detainees, telling The Washington Post in 2014 that criticism of their treatment by human rights groups and others was \u201c foolishness .\u2019\u2019 He also publicly expressed concerns over the Pentagon\u2019s order in December that for the first time opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces such as the Navy SEALs. \u201cThey\u2019re saying we are not going to change any standards,\u201d Kelly told reporters at the Pentagon, according to the Marine Corps Times, a weekly newspaper. \u201cThere will be great pressure, whether it\u2019s 12 months from now, four years from now, because the question will be asked whether we\u2019ve let women into these other roles, why aren\u2019t they staying in those other roles?\u2019\u2019 Kelly, whose son died in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban, met with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Sunday. A statement from Trump\u2019s transition team said the three \u201chad a frank discussion about the global national security situation,\u2019\u2019 along with Kelly\u2019s experience running the Southern Command. People familiar with the selection process said Trump\u2019s team is interested in Kelly\u2019s experience with the Southern border, where Trump wants to build his controversial wall to keep out illegal immigrants. Townsend, who served as assistant to Bush for homeland security and counterterrorism, also held senior positions during 13 years at the Justice Department, including counsel to the attorney general for intelligence policy. If selected for DHS, she could also help Trump counter allegations that his Cabinet picks so far have lacked diversity. Kelly and Townsend join a variety of names reported to be under consideration for DHS secretary, a crucial position whose occupant would oversee Trump\u2019s proposed crackdown on illegal immigration. DHS is the third-largest Cabinet department, with more than 240,000 employees whose responsibilities range from fighting terrorism and protecting the president to enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is also a top contender for the post, people familiar with the transition process have said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s name has been floated, though Christie was recently removed from his high-profile role leading Trump\u2019s transition team. Also in the mix but considered less likely to be nominated, sources said, are ousted Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio and Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke. Both are vocal Trump supporters whose strong views have caused controversy. Clarke, who is black, has compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Islamic State, while Arpaio, who just lost his bid for reelection, is known for forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and has long been accused of anti-Hispanic bias. Additionally, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach appeared to be carrying a written plan for DHS into a meeting with Trump on Sunday. According to one page of the plan photographed by the Associated Press, it focused in part on questioning \u201chigh-risk\u201d immigrants over their alleged support for Islamic sharia law. Kobach entered the national spotlight several years ago when he advised Mitt Romney on the idea of \u201cself-deportation\u201d for illegal immigrants during the 2012 presidential campaign. A former chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, Kobach also wrote Arizona\u2019s strict immigration law, and he has helped lead the fight against President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. It is unclear how seriously Kobach is under consideration for DHS, but he is a strong Trump supporter who helped influence the president-elect\u2019s views on immigration. But a readout from the transition team suggested the Kansan was discussing \u201cborder security, international terrorism and reforming federal bureaucracy\u201d with the president-elect. Trump has pledged a crackdown on illegal immigration that would require an exorbitantly expensive \u2014\u00a0and logistically difficult \u2014\u00a0operation to remove millions from the country. Overseeing it all would be DHS, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks primarily to coordinate the battle against terrorism but is now perhaps equally known for its immigration role. A beefed-up U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a DHS component, would be instrumental if Trump follows through on rounding up far more undocumented immigrants. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also part of DHS, would come under increased pressure to better secure the Southwest border. Perhaps the DHS secretary\u2019s most controversial role would be to help oversee the building of Trump\u2019s wall along that border. The wall is the president-elect\u2019s signature proposal, and he told The Washington Post in an interview last year that \u201cbuilding a wall is easy. . . . It\u2019s not even a difficult project if you know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u2019 But experts say the structure would face numerous obstacles, such as environmental and engineering problems and fights with ranchers and others who would resist giving up their land.

    "text": "Suicide Bomber Targets Shiite Mosque in Kabul, Killing 32 By rahim faiez and amir shah, associated press KABUL, Afghanistan \u0097 Nov 21, 2016, 11:05 AM ET 0 Shares Email A suicide bomber struck a Shiite mosque in the Afghan capital on Monday, killing 32 people, the U.N. office said, the second large-scale attack targeting minority Shiites in Kabul in just over a month. Hours later, the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. monitoring service that tracks militant postings. Afghan police said the bomber, who was on foot, had walked into the Shiite mosque in western Kabul where he detonated his explosives among a crowd of worshippers. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said the explosion also wounded more than 50 people, many of them children. Earlier in the day, the Afghan authorities said at least 28 people were killed and 48 wounded. In its statement, IS said the group's martyr hit a gathering of close to 1,000 inside a \"temple of Shiite polytheists\" in Kabul and detonated his vest bearing 16 kilograms (35 pounds) of explosives, SITE said. IS claimed nearly 200 Shiites were killed and wounded. However, militants often exaggerate their claims. Sunni extremists such as the Taliban and IS militants view Shiites as heretics and apostates and frequently target Shiite mosques and public gatherings. \"This appalling attack on worshippers is an atrocity,\" the statement quoted Pernille Kardel, the Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan. \"UNAMA expresses its revulsion at this latest effort by extremists to stoke sectarian violence in Afghanistan.\" Monday's bombing hit during a prayers ceremony commemorating 40 days since the anniversary of the death of Imam Hussein, the slain grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. The ceremony is known as Arbaeen, meaning 'forty' in Arabic. Hussein is a revered Shiite martyr who was killed in 680 A.D. in the city of Karbala in present-day Iraq. In early October, militants attacked another Shiite ceremony at a shrine in Kabul, commemorating the anniversary of Hussein's actual death. That attack killed 17 people, mostly worshippers but also several policemen. A day later, a similar attack struck Shiites in the city of Mazer-e Sharif in northern Balkh province, killing at least 14 people. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan also claimed responsibility for one of those two attacks, the U.N. statement said. Faredoon Obiadi, head of the criminal investigation department for the Kabul police, said the attacker in Monday's bombing walked into the Baqir-ul Ulom mosque and mingled among the crowd on the first floor of the two-story building where he detonated his explosives. \"Suddenly, a huge explosion happened, then everything went dark,\" said Ewaz Ali, 50, who was inside the mosque but suffered only minor wounds. Kardel from UNAMA added in her statement that \"religious and ethnic tolerance are values the Afghan people hold strong.\" \"I urge the Afghan authorities to do everything possible to defend Afghans of all faiths,\" she added. U.S. Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of the U.S.-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, condemned the bombing. \"On behalf of the men and women of Resolute Support, we offer our condolences to the families of the innocent men, women and children killed and wounded in today's attack,\" Nicholson said. \"We will continue to stand with our Afghan partners and do everything possible to secure a peaceful, stable Afghanistan.\" Shiites in Afghanistan make up an estimated 15 percent of the country's population of around 30 million. Their public celebrations and commemorations were largely banned during the five years when the Taliban controlled the country. But Afghanistan's Shiites have become more public since the extremists were overthrown in the U.S. invasion of 2001. In July this year, a suicide bomber targeted ethic Hazaras, who are mostly Shiite, as they marched through central Kabul to protest discrimination. At least 80 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group. In 2011, at least 54 people were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a Shiite shrine in Kabul where hundreds of people had gathered to mark the Ashoura. The Islamic State group emerged for the first time last year in Afghanistan as an offshoot of the militant group fighting in Iraq and Syria. Analysts believe the affiliate in Afghanistan is mostly made up of disenfranchised Taliban fighters. The Afghan group calls itself the Khorasan Province \u2014 following the style of other IS offshoots, such as the one in Egypt which calls itself Sinai Province \u2014 and has battled both Afghan forces and the Taliban. It has attempted to carve out an enclave in Nangarhar, a rugged eastern province bordering Pakistan. The U.S. State Department has added the IS Afghan affiliate to its list of foreign terrorist organizations. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Nov 21 2016, 3:37 pm ET Dementia Rates Might Be Declining, New Study Finds by Maggie Fox advertisement Rates of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia appear to have fallen considerably since 2000, and better education may be partly responsible, researchers reported Monday. Better treatment for diabetes and cardiovascular disease may also be helping, the researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Elderly woman covering face with her hands. Westend61 / Getty Images Dr. Kenneth Langa of the University of Michigan and colleagues studied records from 21,000 people with an average age of 75. While 11.6 percent of Americans aged 65 and older had dementia, based on standardized tests, the rate fell to 8.8 percent in 2012. \"More years of education was associated with a lower risk for dementia, and average years of education increased significantly,\" they wrote. \"Rising levels of education among U.S. adults over the past 25 years may also have contributed to decreased dementia risk.\" In 2000, the average amount of education was 11.8 years \u2014 just short of a full high school education. By 2012, the average was 12.7 years. \"Our study, along with prior studies, supports the notion that 'cognitive reserve' resulting from early life and lifelong education and cognitive stimulation may be a potent strategy for the primary prevention of dementia in both high- and low-income countries around the world,\" they wrote. And while obesity, a lack of exercise and poor diet can all raise the risk of Alzheimer's, rates went down as more people got heavier, developed high blood pressure and diabetes, Langa's team found. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Association says more than 28 million baby boomers will develop the disease between now and 2050, and the cost of caring for them will consume nearly 25 percent of Medicare spending in 2040. Research has shown that increased physical activity, eating a heart-healthy diet, social engagement and keeping the brain active with puzzles or games can help prevent Alzheimer's or at least delay it, and a whole industry has arisen out of that research, with mixed success. The findings fit in with other recent reports that have shown a fall in dementia rates. But the Alzheimer's Association says that doesn't necessarily mean fewer people with Alzheimer's. \"There is an important difference between prevalence rate (number of people with the disease divided by the total population) and the prevalence number (number of people with the disease),\" the group said in a statement. \"Although these recent findings indicate that a person's risk of dementia at any given age may be decreasing slightly, it should be noted that the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically.\" Nonetheless, it's welcome news in an aging world. There is no cure for dementia, and trials of various treatments have been far from successful. Treating other diseases associated with aging may help. There's plenty of evidence that the same damage that happens as blood vessels get clogged and stiff may underlie dementia. Related: Exercise May Help Alzheimer's \"Intensity of treatment for diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol level has increased with more patients achieving treatment goals, and a significant decline in the vascular complications of diabetes such as heart attack, stroke and lower-extremity amputations, suggesting that there could be a 'spill-over' benefit of a decline in the vascular-related risk for dementia,\" Langa's team wrote. \"Intensity of treatment for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol level has increased.\" \"Rising levels of education among U.S. adults over the past 25 years may also have contributed to decreased dementia risk. The proportion of adults 65 years or older with a high school diploma increased from 55 percent in 1990 to 80 percent in 2010, while the proportion with a college degree increased from 12 percent to 23 percent,\" they wrote. It's not clear what better education does, but experts note there may be several effects. Better-educated people may have a better ability to adapt to the lost brain function caused by dementia; they may be healthier in general; and they may have better medical care. People who are underweight had a higher-than-usual risk of dementia, the team found. It's possible that weight loss is an early symptom of dementia, Dr. Sanjay Asthana of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health said in a commentary accompanying the study. \"There is evidence that weight loss may precede the onset of dementia by many years,\" Asthana and his colleague Ozioma Okonkwo wrote. Dementia can affect the sense of taste and smell and may cause people to eat far too little, they said. Maggie Fox ",
