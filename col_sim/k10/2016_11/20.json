Danny Davis and son of Stacey Wilson, was shot and killed Nov. 18, 2016,\u00a0in his home in Englewood.\u00a0(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Jovan Wilson, 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis and son of Stacey Wilson, was shot and killed Nov. 18, 2016,\u00a0in his home in Englewood.\u00a0(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Grace Wong, Rosemary Regina Sobol The 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis was fatally shot Friday night on the South Side of Chicago in a \"dispute over gym shoes,\" according to police.\u00a0 \u201cIt was unbelievable, unbelievable,\u2019\u2019 said Davis, who was reached by phone on his way to the police station to be briefed on the incident. His grandson, Jovan Wilson, was at his home in Englewood with an uncle, his 16-year-old sister, 14-year-old brother and 8-year-old brother when two teenage assailants entered the home and began arguing with Jovan, police and Davis said. The teen's mother had left the home to pick up food.\u00a0 At some point during the argument, one of the assailants, a 15-year-old boy, pulled out a gun and shot Jovan in the head.\u00a0A 17-year-old girl was the other assailant, Davis said.\u00a0 \"There was a history between the young people involved and it was a dispute over gym shoes. This was not random but was egregious and senseless to use a gun over a fight for clothes,\" said Anthony Guglielmi, spokesman for the\u00a0 Chicago Police Department . Rep. Danny Davis U.S. Rep. Danny Davis represents Illinois' 7th Congressional District. U.S. Rep. Danny Davis represents Illinois' 7th Congressional District. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Jovan Wilson was dead on the scene in the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue, said Officer Michelle Tannehill, a\u00a0 Chicago police \u00a0spokeswoman. The attackers still were at large as of Saturday, Guglielmi said.\u00a0 \"It underscores that there's no repercussions for using guns in Chicago and our criminal justice system is not an effective deterrent,\" he added.\u00a0 Jovan, a sophomore at Perspectives Charter High School, loved sports and rap music, Davis said.\u00a0\u201cHe was a typical 15-year-old,\" the congressman said. \u201cHe liked basketball. If you listened to him he was a basketball star, but he liked basketball and music. All those kinds of things. He was an avid sports fan, he knew all about, you know, the stats of different players.\u201d Davis had just returned to Chicago from Washington, D.C., and was in his office when his son, the boy\u2019s father, called him with the news of the shooting.\u00a0 \u201cInitially it was that he had been shot and then actually the police commander called me and indicated that, there during a home invasion, he had been shot and it didn\u2019t look good,\" Davis said. \u201cImmediately I simply left and came out to the area where it had taken place,\" Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally disconcerting.\"\u00a0 When asked what the attack says about crime in Chicago, Davis said: \u201cWell, I think it just reinforces a lot of things we already know. There\u2019s an awful lot of people in Chicago who are in need of help, who need help to heal them and share their ideas and personalities. There\u2019s a need for them to have jobs and employment opportunities and there's a need for young people especially to have more effective instruction.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to improve our schools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that there are enough schools and after-school recreational, job activity to keep young people busy and engaged and all of those things \u2026 and his being shot is just simply a manifestation of the tremendous urban crisis that we are facing in Chicago.\u201d\u00a0 Congressman's grandson killed in Englewood Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune Charles Raymond, 74, of the Hyde Park neighborhood, walks away from the scene in the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue where the 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis was killed\u00a0Nov. 18, 2016, in the Englewood neighborhood. Raymond, a family friend, drove the teen's grandmother to the scene. Charles Raymond, 74, of the Hyde Park neighborhood, walks away from the scene in the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue where the 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis was killed\u00a0Nov. 18, 2016, in the Englewood neighborhood. Raymond, a family friend, drove the teen's grandmother to the scene. (Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) A family friend who was at the scene, Charles Raymond, 74, drove the victim's grandmother from Hyde Park. He described her as distraught and said she cried on their way over, telling him that she had just stayed at the apartment the night before to visit her grandson.\u00a0 \u201cIt's unbelievable,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cI've known the young boy for a long time, and to hear that he got shot in the head, usually when you get shot in the head you don't survive, so I was really disappointed to find out what it was.\u201d Friday night, Davis went to the Area South police headquarters and was whisked upstairs. Family members who were also at the station declined to talk. After spending more than two hours speaking with police, Davis\u00a0emerged to the station's lobby with his son, Stacey Wilson, and vowed to continue his work to combat gun violence. He questioned where and how the 15-year-old boy who is believed to have killed his grandson obtained a gun.\u00a0 He said he might never know the answer to those questions or if there was anything, such as better education, that could have prevented his grandson's homicide.\u00a0 \"I do know that I grieve for my family,\" Davis said at a news conference. \"I grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger. I grieve for his family, his parents, his friends, some of whom will never see him again.\" Davis said gun violence is a problem society deals with every day, reflecting on how he's attended multiple funerals for other slain teenagers. \"I guess that I always knew that the possibility\u00a0existed that it could happen close to me,\" Davis said. \"As a matter of fact, I thought it was so unfortunate because Jovan had just reached a point, 15, his grades had improved at school. His father had just told me about how proud of him that he was because he was catching on and realizing that all of his life was in front of him.\" The family had talked to the teen about staying at home at night. Still, that didn't spare him from violence, Davis said.\u00a0 \"Unfortunately, here he was in the house at home, minding his own business, and some intruders would come and snuff his life away,\" Davis said.\u00a0 The boy's father, teary-eyed, stood next to Davis during the news conference. He had just given his son money to get a haircut, and he thought the next time he would talk to him was about an appropriate haircut to get.\u00a0 \"It's going to take me some time to grieve,\" Wilson said. Violence has spiked this year in Chicago to levels not seen since the 1990s, and several people with prominent connections have been killed in addition to Davis\u2019 grandson.\u00a0 In mid-August, Arshell Dennis, a 19-year-old college student and the son of a Chicago police officer, was shot to death in the Wrightwood neighborhood on the Southwest Side. About two weeks later, Nykea Aldridge, 32, a cousin of Chicago Bulls star Dwyane Wade, was gunned down while pushing her baby in a stroller in the Parkway Gardens neighborhood on the South Side.\u00a0 Davis, a former Chicago alderman and Cook County commissioner, was first elected to the U.S. House in 1996. He was elected to an 11th term earlier this month. His 7th Congressional District covers much of downtown Chicago, the West Side and western Cook County suburbs and parts of the South Side, including the neighborhood where his grandson was killed. \"We are tired of watching families get destroyed by gun violence and are pleading for elected officials to give Chicago police the tools we need,\"\u00a0Guglielmi said.\u00a0 Chicago Tribune's Elvia Malagon contributed.\u00a0 rsobol@chicagotribune.com \u00a0 gwong@chicagotribune.com Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

(AP Photo/Esteban Felix) 0 Shares Email Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged world leaders meeting in Peru on Saturday to help get more people online to improve global living standards while separately announcing new measures to cut down on fake news stories on the social network that some suggest could have helped sway the U.S. presidential election . The Facebook founder took on the role of an evangelist for \"connectivity\" as he spoke at an Asian-Pacific trade summit, lamenting that half the world has no access to the online world and is being deprived of its economic potential as well as advances in science, education and medicine. He urged leaders to work with his company and others to close that gap. \"If we can connect the 4 billion people who aren't connected we can lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty,\" Zuckerberg said as he addressed business and government leaders at the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. But as he was promoting the benefits of the online world in the speech, he took to his Facebook page to address one of the downsides of the internet: the rapid dissemination of bogus news stories on social networks. Zuckerberg said in a post late Friday that his company was taking measures to curb what he said was a \"relatively small\" percentage of deliberately false stories. The measures include developing new tools to detect and classify \"misinformation\" and to make it easier for users to report the material. He said the company also is looking into the possibility of working with established fact-checking organizations to evaluate content and into the feasibility of warning labels for stories flagged as false. Critics have complained that a surge of fake news stories on Facebook may have swayed some voters to back President-elect Donald Trump. The company said on Monday that it was clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won't display ads \u2014 thus cutting revenue \u2014 for sites that run information that is \"illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.\" That followed a similar step by Google, which acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories. \"The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,\" the Facebook CEO said in his post. \"Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. Zuckerberg's comments came after President Barack Obama , who is also attending the APEC summit, and others have been sharply critical of the spread of fake news online. In a news conference Thursday in Berlin, Obama called bogus stories disseminated on Facebook and other social media platforms a threat to democracy. The president decried \"an age where there's so much active misinformation and it's packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television.\" Zuckerberg called the problem \"complex, both technically and philosophically.\" It is also sensitive issue for a company that does not want to censor content such as legitimate political satire that some people find offensive. Facebook sees itself not as a traditional publisher, but as a facilitator of global communication. It was that lofty vision of the company that was on display as Zuckerberg spoke at the APEC forum. He described Facebook efforts in artificial intelligence programs that could lead to advancements in medicine and education, as well as a high-altitude solar-powered drone, still in the development stage, to provide online access to places with none. He also described a program to work with local operators around the world to provide free basic internet. \"We can't afford to leave anyone behind,\" he said. The Facebook CEO said that investment in such infrastructure is necessary to address the gap between rich and poor that has become a source of rising anxiety. \"As we are learning this year in election after election, even if globalization might grow the overall pie of prosperity, it also creates inequality,\" he said. \"It helps some people and it hurts others.\" Investing in \"connectivity,\" he said, can address some of the consequences of globalization. \"We can disconnect, risk less prosperity and hope jobs that are lost come back. Or we can connect more, try to do more great things, try to work on even greater prosperity and then work to aggressively share that prosperity with everyone.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Martin Crutsinger contributed from Washington 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS News Nov 19, 2016 7:28 PM EST Civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center says there have been at least 700 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation since the election. It ranges from swastikas at a baseball field and a playground to Pennsylvania high school students shouting \u201cwhite power\u201d in the hallway and a throwback to the days of segregation at a high school bathroom in Northern California. \u201cI can\u2019t explain to you what it feels like to come to a campus that I\u2019ve loved for four years and not feel safe,\u201d said one student.\u00a0 According to new numbers from the FBI, hate crimes were up almost 7 percent in 2015. That includes a 67 percent jump in crimes against Muslims. Trump addresses reports of violence: \"Stop it\" When the racial tension continued even after Election Day, Lesley Stahl asked President-elect Trump about it on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d . In response, Trump said, \u201cI am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it-- if it helps.

    "text": "CBS News Nov 19, 2016 1:09 PM EST Steve Bannon, the chief strategist and right-hand man to President-elect Donald Trump, denied in an interview that he was an advocate of white nationalism -- and gave hints instead about how his brand of \u201ceconomic\u201d nationalism will shake up Washington. In The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon, the controversial former head of Breitbart News who went on to chair Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, discussed why he believed his candidate won the election. \u201cI\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist,\u201d Bannon told the news outlet earlier this week. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f\u2014ed over.\u201d Bannon\u2019s appointment to the White House has drawn criticism from Democrats and several civil liberties groups, in part because of his (and Breitbart\u2019s) strong association with the alt-right , a political movement with strains of white supremacy. In the past, the former Breitbart CEO has admitted the alt-right\u2019s connections to racist and anti-Semitic agendas. \u201cLook, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,\u201d Bannon told Mother Jones in August. \u201cAre there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that\u2019s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.\u201d In the Reporter interview, Bannon challenged the notion that racialized overtones dominated the Trump campaign on the trail. He predicted that if the administration delivered on its election promises, \u201cwe\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s everything related to jobs,\u201d Bannon said and seemingly bragged about how he was going to drive conservatives \u201ccrazy\u201d with his \u201ctrillion-dollar infrastructure plan.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up,\u201d he proposed. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\u201d Bannon, in the Reporter interview, also gave some insight into how he viewed his political foes (presumably, liberals and the media) -- and the \u201cdarkness\u201d he touts in fighting against them. \u201cDarkness is good,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cDick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That\u2019s power. It only helps us when they...get it wrong. When they\u2019re blind to who we are and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

News that the park named in honor of Yauch had been vandalized caused outrage and heartbreak on social media Friday, with photos shared on social media by New York Councilman Brad Lander and others showing children playing on equipment that had been defaced by spray-painted swastikas and a \"Go Trump\" message.

Yauch had played in the park as a child ; he died of cancer in 2012. Images from Saturday show the park's rightful occupiers \u2014 kids \u2014 playing on the equipment.

    "text": "(Tribune news services) The cordiality that Romney and Trump displayed publicly was a marked change from the way the men spoke about each other during the campaign. Romney told CNN in June that a Trump presidency could bring \"trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny\" to the nation. In a speech, Romney called the real estate developer a \"con man\" and a \"fake.\" Trump said Romney \"blew it\" and \"choked like a dog\" in his failed bid to unseat President Obama in 2012, and he called the former Massachusetts governor \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.\" Trump and Pence are spending the weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in a nearly constant stream of meetings with potential administration hires and others looking to dispense advice. They met Saturday with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, a potential pick for secretary of defense who could be seen as a rebuke to President Barack Obama. Mattis oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East from 2010 to 2013. He was said to have consistently pushed for the military to punish Iran and its allies, including calling for more covert actions to capture and kill Iranian operatives, and for interdictions of Iranian warships. Former defense officials said Mattis' views on Iran caused him to fall out of favor with the Obama administration, which was negotiating the Iranian nuclear deal at the time. Mattis, who also clashed with the administration over its response to the Arab Spring and on how many troops to keep in Iraq, was forced to retire earlier than expected to clear room for his replacement at the U.S. Central Command. Mattis, now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, has publicly criticized Obama's defense and national security policies. When asked whether he would choose Mattis to be defense secretary, Trump said: \"We'll see.\" He called the retired general \"the real deal\" and a \"brilliant, wonderful man.\" Michelle Rhee, a former District of Columbia schools chief who is being floated as a possible education secretary, and her husband, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, also met with Trump and Pence. Rhee served three contentious years as chancellor of the District's schools, where she oversaw a rise in test scores but closed schools, laid off nearly 700 teachers for poor performance, and filled more than 91 principal openings that were created via firings, resignations and retirements. Rhee has been a supporter of the Common Core State Standards initiative, which Trump opposes. Caption Donald Trump selects Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA Director Rep. Mike Pompeo.

Trump also met with donor Betsy DeVos, who also is reportedly being considered for education secretary. DeVos is a proponent of charter schools and school vouchers. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire oncologist who advised Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to combat cancer, also met with Trump and Pence on Saturday afternoon, as did conservative community-development leader Robert Woodson Sr., who told The Washington Post that he is under consideration to be secretary of housing and urban development. The president-elect and vice president-elect also planned to huddle this weekend with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner who is on Trump's transition team, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was ousted as chairman of the transition team. \"These meetings that the president-elect and vice president-elect are having really show . . . the depth to which we're going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration,\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday. Some visitors, he said, are \"potential administration hires,\" while others are coming only to offer advice. \"The president-elect is bringing together folks who have been on the opposite side of him politically,\" Miller said. Questions about Trump's ability to bring Americans together arose onstage Friday night on Broadway. ",

Saudi officials rarely respond to requests for comment, but the sentiments at the highest levels of the kingdom were that Trump and the Republican Party's policies were in line with the kingdom's priorities on Iran and regional security. Secretary of State John Kerry shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif before a meeting in Geneva on Jan. 14, 2015. Rick Wilking / REUTERS Many Republicans opposed the 2015 nuclear deal President Barack Obama struck with Iran \u2014 Saudi Arabia's arch rival \u2014 which Riyadh blames for fomenting unrest throughout the Middle East. Many Saudis felt betrayed and marginalized after Washington signed the pact, which is seen to have empowered Tehran and lent it international legitimacy. Trump has called the agreement \"the worst deal ever negotiated\" and has promised to make scrapping it \"Number one priority.\" Trump's comments on Muslims and his lack of any foreign policy experience have alarmed some Saudis. Related: Meet the Man Fighting to Be King of Solar in Land of Oil However, top officials have expressed confidence that Trump will push for a return to traditional cooperation, after nearly eight years of President Barack Obama, who has been widely seen as withdrawing from the region and some of its longstanding alliances. King Salman's message of congratulations to Trump, sent hours after the election, made explicit mention of the \"historical deep-rooted close relations\" between the two countries. Sadad Al-Husseini, former executive vice president and board member at state-owned oil giant Aramco, reflected the feelings of several senior Saudis spoken to by NBC News this week. \"Without sound leadership provided by the next American president, the whole world, not only the Middle East, will slide toward more tension and confrontations\" George W. Bush \"was a disaster,\" he said. Saudi Arabia was opposed to Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent violence, chaos and increased Iranian influence in the country caused genuine dismay. He added: \"Obama hasn't achieved anything. Trump is a businessman, he knows how to make a deal. And we can make a deal.\" Saudi Arabian political analyst Ahmad Al-Ibrahim was more forceful in his support for Trump, saying Obama had \"betrayed\" the country. He described the president-elect as someone who could be trusted to sit down and negotiate with the kingdom. Trump is \"a genuine man who comes to you and says, 'I hate you but come, let's talk and come to an agreement,'\" according to Al-Ibrahim. He added: \"America was weaker a week ago [before the election] and today it is stronger.\" A flame from a Saudi Aramco oil installation in the desert near Khouris, Saudi Arabia. MARWAN NAAMANI / AFP/Getty Images, file Obama's perceived inaction in Syria has also angered many in the region, including Saudi Arabia, which is backing rebels fighting the Syrian government. In 2012, Obama had said his \"red line\" with the Assad regime was the use of chemical weapons. But months later, Assad's forces reportedly killed close to 1,500 people in a chemical-weapons attack \u2014 but Obama did not retaliate militarily, which angered many in the kingdom. Saudi officials were also dismayed by what they saw as a U.S. betrayal of a long-time ally, the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The now-imprisoned military leader was toppled at the beginning of the Arab Spring in 2011, and many in the kingdom are cautiously optimistic that Trump would be a president more likely to support a long-time ally in need. But while they were hopeful, Saudis were taking a \"wait and see approach\" to the new president's policies regarding international relations, according to Hoda Al-Helaissi, a member of Shura Council and vice chair of its foreign policy committee. Among the outstanding issues is JASTA \u2014 legislation allowing U.S. citizens to sue foreign countries for alleged sponsorship of terrorism that was opposed by Obama, but supported by Republican as well as many Democrats. Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former director of the Saudi Arabia General Intelligence Directorate and ex-ambassador to the U.S., spelled out the concerns many in the kingdom feel in a recent speech in Washington. \"After seven years the Arab-Israeli peace process is at a standstill, al Qaeda terrorism has been replaced by ISIS terrorism,\" he said at the 2016 Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference on Oct. 26. \"The situation in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen are in shambles. Iranian regional bullying is shamelessly escalating.\" He added: \"Without sound leadership provided by the next American president, the whole world, not only the Middle East, will slide toward more tension and confrontations.\" F.

Authorities are searching for the missing week-old baby after her mother was found fatally shot in Wichita. A relative found the woman dead Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, in her apartment. Sgt. Nikki Woodrow says the woman's daughter, Sofia Victoria Gonzalez Abarca, is \"considered missing and endangered.\" (Wichita Police via AP) 0 Shares Email Authorities have found a week-old baby who was reported missing Thursday after her mother was shot to death in Kansas , police said Saturday. Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay said baby Sophia was found alive after authorities executed a search warrant before dawn at a Dallas home, The Wichita Eagle reported ( http://j.mp/2g8ozZK ). He said the baby is in protective custody and is doing well. \"This is the best possible outcome to a very sad case,\" Ramsay said at a news conference. Two adults were in custody and being interviewed Saturday, Ramsay said. He also said more suspects could be identified, but provided few details, saying \"it is still an active investigation.\" No one has been charged. \"It's a complicated case and we want to make sure we get it right,\" Ramsay said. Police said investigators established late Friday that someone who knew the mother had fled to Dallas with the baby. The baby was reported missing, the same day her mother, 27-year-old Laura Abarca-Nogueda, was shot to death in her west Wichita apartment. The FBI had joined the search for the baby, and investigators worked around the clock since Sophia went missing, he said. \"Hard work and the collaboration with the FBI is really what made this (closure) come about,\" he said. Sophia will be reunited with relatives \"as soon as possible,\" he said. Dallas police \"dropped everything\" to assist in the case once investigators learned Sophia was there, Ramsay said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: The Wichita (Kan.)

He added that he\u2019d made similar points directly to Mr. Trump, but declined to share the president-elect\u2019s response. Congressional Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal the law that helped some 20 million Americans gain coverage, but they\u2019ve been unable to coalesce around a replacement. Democrats chose Schumer this week to serve as minority leader , replacing Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring after five terms. In the interview, Schumer also served notice on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill that provided for tougher oversight of financial institutions and created a consumer protection bureau after the 2008 economic crisis. \u201cHe should not even try to think about repealing Dodd-Frank,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe will have enough votes to beat that back.\u201d As leader of a 48-member Senate Democratic Caucus next year, Schumer will command enough votes to block majority Republicans from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on most major legislation. As such, Schumer and his Democrats will be the only backstop against Mr. Trump and the GOP next year when Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the Brooklyn-born Schumer pledged to work with fellow New Yorker Donald Trump when possible, arguing that to do otherwise would amount to a \u201ca dereliction of our responsibility to the millions of Americans who need work, who need protection.\u201d Indeed Schumer argued that on some issues Mr. Trump has more in common with the Democrats than Republicans, suggesting a strategy that would amount to forming alliances with Mr. Trump where possible against the wishes of conservative Republicans and GOP leaders on the Hill. \u201cDonald Trump in his campaign advocated many things or a good number of economic issues that Democrats support and Republicans have opposed,\u201d Schumer said, pointing to trade, spending on infrastructure, and a financial loophole benefiting wealthy Wall Street interests. Schumer blamed Democrats\u2019 election failures on an ineffective economic message , and adopting some of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric he pledged \u201ca bolder, stronger, sharper-edged economic plan aimed at the middle class and those trying to be middle class, and an understanding that the system is rigged against the average person and it\u2019s gotta change, a draining of the swamp if you will.\u201d But he also promised to fight Mr. Trump \u201cwith everything we\u2019ve got\u201d when the new president takes an approach opposed to Democratic values. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do something in name only,\u201d Schumer said. On infrastructure, Mr. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion spending program that some conservatives are already balking at. Schumer said he\u2019d told the president-elect: \u201cIt\u2019ll make a lot of your hard-right people against it, the Freedom Caucus will never go for a large infrastructure bill.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Schumer said of Mr. Trump\u2019s response. And unlike demands from conservatives, Schumer said he didn\u2019t think such an infrastructure bill would have to be fully paid for - meaning it could add to the deficit instead - a position he said he believed Mr. Trump might share. Schumer also signaled a fight over the Supreme Court vacancy, noting that after refusing to act for nearly a full year on Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, for the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, \u201cour Republican colleagues who want to move this quickly don\u2019t come before us with clean hands.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Grace Wong , Elvia Malagon , Rosemary Regina Sobol and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Chicago police Saturday called the shooting of a U.S. congressman\u2019s 15-year-old grandson a targeted attack stemming from an argument over gym shoes. Jovan Wilson, whose paternal grandfather is U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, was killed about 7 p.m. Friday while his mother was out picking up dinner for the family, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. The incident originally was believed to be a home invasion, he said, but police later learned that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cThere was a history between the young people involved and it was a dispute over gym shoes,\u201d Guglielmi said. \u201cThis was not random but was egregious and senseless to use a gun over a fight for clothes.\u201d Jovan, of the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue in the city\u2019s Englewood neighborhood, was a Perspectives Charter High School sophomore. Calls to the school weren\u2019t immediately returned. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, took to Twitter on Saturday morning, saying: \u201cThe murder of Congressman Danny Davis\u2019 15 year old grandson in a Chicago home invasion is reminder we need a federal strategy to save lives.\u201d Guglielmi corrected Gingrich, tweeting: \u201c@newtgingrich not a home invasion but a dispute among teens over gym shoes that ended in senseless shooting.

The teen\u2019s mother had left the home to pick up food. During the argument, one of the assailants, a 15-year-old boy, pulled out a gun and shot Jovan in the head. A 17-year-old girl was the other assailant, Davis said. \u201cHe was a typical 15-year-old,\u201d the Democratic congressman said. \u201cHe liked basketball. If you listened to him he was a basketball star, but he liked basketball and music. All those kinds of things. He was an avid sports fan, he knew all about, you know, the stats of different players.\u201d Congressman's grandson killed in Englewood Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune Charles Raymond, 74, of the Hyde Park neighborhood, walks away from the scene in the 5600 block of South Princeton Avenue where the 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep.

(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Davis had just returned to Chicago from Washington, D.C., and was in his office when his son Stacey Wilson, the boy\u2019s father, called him with the news of the shooting. He said he might never know the answer to those questions or if there was anything, such as better education, that could have prevented his grandson\u2019s homicide. \u201cI do know that I grieve for my family,\u201d Davis said at a news conference. \u201cI grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger. I grieve for his family, his parents, his friends, some of whom will never see him again.\u201d Davis said gun violence is a problem society deals with every day and reflected on how he\u2019s attended multiple funerals for other slain teenagers. \u201cI guess that I always knew that the possibility existed that it could happen close to me,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I thought it was so unfortunate because Jovan had just reached a point, 15, his grades had improved at school. His father had just told me about how proud of him that he was because he was catching on and realizing that all of his life was in front of him.\u201d The family had talked to the teen about staying at home at night. Still, that didn\u2019t spare him from violence, Davis said. \u201cUnfortunately, here he was in the house at home, minding his own business, and some intruders would come and snuff his life away.\u201d The boy\u2019s father, teary-eyed, stood next to Davis during the news conference. He had just given his son money to get a haircut, and he thought the next time he would talk to him would be about an appropriate haircut to get. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take me some time to grieve,\u201d Wilson said. Violence has spiked this year in Chicago to levels not seen since the 1990s, and several people with prominent connections have been killed in addition to Davis\u2019 grandson. Police reported no arrests as of Saturday evening. ",

By Dan Balz November 19 at 4:39 PM Follow @danbalz Viewed through any conventional lens, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy was improbable from start to finish. Today, two things about his victory seem to be in sharper focus: one, that Trump\u2019s victory might best be understood as the success of the country\u2019s first independent president, and second, that the Trump coalition may be even more uniquely his than President Obama\u2019s has turned out to be. Think again about how he prevailed. There are a handful of major events during a general election that give the nominees a chance to showcase themselves, their judgment and their vision. One is the selection of a running mate. Another is the staging of the conventions. A third is performance in the debates. Hillary Clinton did better than Trump on all three tests, though Trump\u2019s team believes the debates did not fall so decisively in her favor. Then there are the other factors that go into producing a successful candidacy. These include resources, the operations and mechanics of campaigning, and the skill with which candidates avoid mistakes and deal with the unexpected setbacks. Clinton raised more money than Trump. She had a larger number of paid staffers on the ground in the battleground states. She ran more television ads by far. He created needless controversies throughout the general election, while her problems were far fewer. Only in the final days did he seem surer of himself. In other words, Trump came out the loser on virtually every aspect of how campaigns are usually evaluated. Yet today he is staffing his administration and Clinton is still absorbing the brutal shock of having lost a race she believed was hers. In Donald Trump's Washington, there are many people vying for the President-elect's attention. The Washington Post's Robert Costa explains how Trump will seek advice during the transition. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Trump owes his success in part to the fact that he ran for president in an environment that favored change over the status quo. But his luck or genius goes beyond that. It has long been noted that the conditions have existed for an independent candidate to run a serious campaign for president. The level of dissatisfaction with Washington, the anxiety over the economy and the generally sour mood about the future provided the foundation for a campaign by someone from outside the system, who is tied to neither political party and with a promise to shake things up. [ Trump security picks point to hardline positions ] What has stood in the way of people running as an independent is that winning the presidency in a system that so clearly favors the two major parties is something of a hopeless cause. That\u2019s a big reason former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg decided not to run several times when he seriously explored the idea. Trump took the elements of an independent candidacy \u2014 the lack of clear ideology, the name recognition of a national celebrity and the personal fortune needed to fund a presidential campaign \u2014 and then did what no one seemed to have thought of before. He staged a hostile takeover of an existing major party. He had the best of both worlds, an outsider candidacy with crosscutting ideological appeal and the platform of a major party to wage the general election. By the time he had finished, he had taken down two political dynasties: the Bush dynasty in the primaries and the Clinton dynasty in the general election. All through the campaign, one big question was whether 2016 would produce a new electoral map. Mostly this was an outgrowth of the idea that demography is destiny. This was shorthand for the hope among Democrats that changing demographics \u2014 rising numbers of Hispanics in particular \u2014 along with a growing proportion of the population with college degrees would move some states from red to purple and others from purple to blue. One example was the way the Clinton team saw Virginia and Colorado as two states that had moved toward the Democrats during the Obama years and now were securely in the party\u2019s column. They also saw an opportunity to win in Arizona this year and believed that Georgia would soon become a true battleground. Even bright red Texas looked more in play during the early fall. The flip side of this \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d concept was that, for a time, the Republicans might have their best opportunity to change the map by focusing on a handful of Northern industrial states, all of which have older, whiter populations and lower percentages of college graduates. But with the exception of Ohio, those states \u2014 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 were all part of what the Atlantic\u2019s Ron Brownstein long ago dubbed the \u201cBlue Wall.\u201d The phrase was shorthand for states that as of 2012 had voted Democratic in six consecutive presidential elections. Despite the demographics, it seemed that wall would be too high an obstacle for Trump to surmount in this election, even though his messages on trade and immigration were tailor-made for voters in that region. What happened was that this map of a new America came true only in part. Trump converted the portion of the map that was suddenly hospitable to his message, and Clinton failed to win the states that someday might lean more Democratic. The northern map was riper for picking by Trump \u2014 barely, given the tight results in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 than the southern map turned out to be for Clinton. For Republicans, the fact that Trump won the presidency while losing the popular vote should remain a concern. It was the second time in five recent elections that the GOP has gotten to the White House with fewer votes, as Clinton probably will emerge with a clear plurality and a raw vote margin significantly higher than Al Gore in 2000. An analysis by Mark Gersh of the National Committee for an Effective Congress looked at the vote in 14 swing states vs. the rest of the country. Trump won the popular vote in those 14 states and got 142 of his electoral votes from them. In the other 36 states, he lost the popular vote by an even larger margin. He found the votes where he needed them. She did not. How did he do it? Take a look at Ohio. For years, the state has been a classic bellwether and, in the three previous elections, ground zero in the battle for the White House. This year it went to Trump by 8 points and shifted from its historical norm by the biggest margin in more than half a century. [ Thanks to Democrats, Trump\u2019s Cabinet could win easy Senate votes ] Mike Dawson, an expert on election statistics in Ohio, did an analysis of the vote last week for the Columbus Dispatch. What he found was that Trump\u2019s percentage was higher than that of Mitt Romney in 2012 in 83 of the state\u2019s 88 counties. Trump\u2019s percentage in rural southeast Ohio was the biggest since Herbert Hoover in 1928. In the Youngstown area, once reliable Democratic turf, Trump got 52 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent that Romney got in 2012. Ohio was not unique. Similar patterns existed in the other Northern industrial states. Yet in the three formerly blue states that Trump converted, Clinton might have won had she not suffered erosion among African American voters \u2014 one key portion of the Obama coalition \u2014 or prevented more white, college-educated voters from moving away from her and returning home to the GOP, the group her team saw as a key element of a new Clinton coalition. Trump redrew the map just as he redrew the rules for running a campaign. For those reasons alone, and despite all the controversy of his campaign and the earlier personnel appointments, he ought not to be underestimated and/or seen through conventional lenses. A personal note: We said a sad but joyful farewell this week to Gwen Ifill, the co-anchor of the \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d and the moderator of PBS\u2019s \u201cWashington Week.\u201d She was both colleague and friend, and one could not have asked for anything better in both. She broke barriers and earned through hard work and strength of character every journalistic award and accolade that came her way.

    "text": "Trump Holds Meetings With Mitt Romney, Michelle Rhee and Others By Katherine Faulders BEDMINSTER, N.J. \u0097 Nov 19, 2016, 3:29 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President-elect Trump Expected To Meet with Mitt Romney 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is at his estate and golf club in Bedminister, New Jersey, this weekend for a string of appointments with high-profile figures, including the former GOP presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney . Romney arrived for his meeting with Trump and members of his transition team at the Trump National Golf Club about 1 p.m. and left shortly before 2:30 p.m. As he and Trump emerged from the meeting, the president-elect did not approach the press, but, responding to shouted questions, told reporters the meeting \"went great.\" Romney made a brief statement to the media, saying the meeting focused on foreign affairs. He said he \"looks forward\" to a Trump administration, but would not comment on whether he wants to be a part of it. \"We had a far-reaching conversation with regard to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance. We discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics,\u201d Romney said. Romney did not respond to shouted questions regarding potential cabinet positions and would not answer questions regarding his previous statements calling Trump a \"con man\" and a \"fraud.\" Sources on Trump\u2019s transition team told ABC News on Thursday that Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is under consideration for secretary of state. One senior-level source directly involved in the transition efforts said that Saturday\u2019s meeting is also about \u201cmending fences,\u201d as Trump and Romney have had a contentious relationship. Trump also met with well-known education activist Michelle Rhee and her husband, Kevin Johnson, mayor of Sacramento; Betsy DeVos, another education activist; and with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis. Meetings were also set with Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts; anti-poverty advocate Bob Woodson; restaurant executive Andy Puzder; Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg; and biotechnology billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, according to transition officials. After the meeting with Mattis, who is viewed as a possible contender to be nominated for defense secretary, Trump said, \"He is the real deal, a brilliant wonderful man, what a career. We'll see what happens. He is the real deal.\" Rhee is a possible contender for nomination as education secretary. Mike Segar/Reuters President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence stand together as they arrive at the the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Nov. 19, 2016. President-Elect Donald Trump Taps Michael Flynn for National Security Adviser Trump is meeting with people under consideration for cabinet posts and individuals from whom the president-elect is simply seeking advice and counsel, transition officials said. ABC News was told that senior members of Trump\u2019s transition team will join him in the meetings at the Trump National Golf Club, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence; Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , who will be Trump's chief of staff; Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway; Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer; transition team communications director Jason Miller; and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. Transition officials also said there may be an announcement this afternoon on a nomination for a cabinet post in the area of national security . When Trump and Pence arrived at the golf club at around 11 a.m., a reporter shouted a question asking if the president-elect was looking forward to the meetings today. Both Trump and Pence answered in the positive. It was the first question from the press that Trump has answered since his interview on CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" on Nov. 10, two days after the election. Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo The clubhouse of Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, New Jersey, is pictured, Nov. 18, 2016, before the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s meetings are expected to continue Sunday with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, among others, transition officials said. Kobach, one of the president-elect\u2019s advisers on immigration, is known as an immigration hardliner. He told Reuters recently that Trump's policy advisers had discussed drafting a proposal for the president-elect\u2019s consideration that would reinstate a national registry for visitors and immigrants from Muslim countries. Kobach also said in the interview that Trump's immigration team has discussed drafting executive orders \"so that Trump and the Department of Homeland Security hit the ground running.\" But on Friday, the spokesman for the transition team on Friday emphasized that Trump is not advocating any kind of broader registry for Muslims. \u201cPresident-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false. The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama Administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the president-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in,\u201d said Jason Miller, the transition team's communications director. ABC News\u2019 John Santucci and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Young Immigrants Who Came Out of Shadows Now Fear Having to Go Back In By Serena Marshall Nov 19, 2016, 9:57 AM ET 0 Shares Star Juan Gallegos Juan Gallegos, center, participating in non-violent civil disobedience outside the Federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, CA, June 2012. 0 Shares Email They remember exactly where they were when it was announced. President Obama in the Rose Garden on June 15, 2012, talking directly to the camera as he gave young people who were brought to the U.S. as undocumented immigrant children a way to get free of the constant fear of deportation. \u201cIt makes no sense to expel talented young people, who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans -- they\u2019ve been raised as Americans; understand themselves to be part of this country -- to expel these young people\u2026because of the actions of their parents -- or because of the inaction of politicians,\u201d Obama said. He then announced the program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) under which, in the president's words, \"eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.\u201d Trump said on the campaign trail that he plans to reverse Obama\u2019s executive actions and orders, which would include DACA. A Fateful Day \u201cI just stopped everything I was doing and was fixated on the news and then I went back into the kitchen and started crying,\u201d recalled New Jersey resident Renata Muariz of that day. Muariz, now a student at Brown University in Rhode Island, was 12 when she was brought to the U.S from Brazil by her mother who had fallen into financial hardship in her home country and could no longer provide for her family. Juan Escalante also vividly recalls the day of Obama's announcement. \"I remember turning on the TV and watching the ticker and remember thinking my life was about to change,\u201d said Escalante, of Tallahassee, Florida, who was 11 when his parents brought him to the U.S. from Venezuela. Escalante, now 27, said his parents arrived legally in the U.S. on work visas and were in line to follow a legal path toward citizenship but were forced out of the process after the family lawyer gave them incorrect advice that left them undocumented and with no legal mechanism forward. \u201cI had just finished my degree and was very uncertain about my future,\u201d Escalante said of when his family suddenly became undocumented. \u201cIn the country that refused my contributions and talents, when deferred action was announced I felt immediately validated. It allowed me to demonstrate I am going to work hard I am going to contribute to my economy.\u201d Juan Gallegos of Denver also knows where he was on that fateful date -- protesting for immigration reform on what became \"one of the most amazing days of my life.\" Gallegos remembers just as clearly the day he arrived in the U.S. \u201cI was 12 years old, it was the 4th of July, 2001. I remember so vividly there were fireworks. Children outside playing sports. It felt like such a welcoming space,\u201d he said. But as time passed in his new home country, the feeling of being welcomed faded. As an undocumented immigrant, Gallegos found that after he graduated college he couldn't get jobs in his field. \"I worked as a waiter or anywhere that would take me,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the summer, I was building irrigation pipes in the cornfield. And I remember thinking -- with every turn of the wrench -- I have a college degree and can\u2019t make use of it.\u201d Coming out of the Shadows Gallegos, Escalante and Muariz are among roughly 750,000 young people given temporary protected status and, separately, work authorization under DACA. Applicants to the program had to prove they were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012; came to the U.S. before age 16; lived here for at least five years continuously; attend or graduated from high school or college; and have no criminal convictions. Undocumented youth who had learned to be careful about calling attention to themselves thought twice about applying to the program out of fear of making themselves vulnerable to deportation. But ultimately many decided to take the risk. \u201cI figured the government already had most of [this information] since I had gone to school and been part of the public school system,\u201d Gallegos said. Muariz said, \u201c[It\u2019s a] scary thought to know the government now has your information and has access to \u2026 to deporting you. But the benefits of it just sounded like it surpassed whatever consequences and seemed safe.\u201d Before the deferred-action program, Muariz didn\u2019t think college was possible for her. She had avoided even talking to her high school guidance counselor and did not take college-entrance exams so as to not draw attention to herself. But on the day of Obama's announcement, she decided to \u201cjust try a little harder and see what happens.\u201d Now, the 23-year-old is a student at Brown University. \u201cDACA made me more confident in terms of dreaming of higher goals,\u201d she said. But Trump's election \"has brought a lot of uncertainties for me ... The thought of having DACA revoked -- it will completely change the path I take.\u201d New Fears Muariz plans to apply to law school, but now is uncertain if the future she imagined for herself is possible. She, like others who had come out of the shadows under DACA, now has, as Escalante said, \u201ca lot of anxiety and a lot of questions and a lot of concern.\" \"We are operating under the assumption that the Trump administration is surrounding itself with names of people\u2026that are anti-immigrant -- [Kris] Kobach, [Jeff] Sessions, all of these players coming together to advise the Donald Trump administration,\u201d Escalante, who works as digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, an immigrant rights group, told ABC News. Kobach, known as the architect of a stringent and controversial immigration enforcement law in Arizona, SB 1070, has been brought on to the Trump team as an immigration adviser. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who on Friday was named as the president-elect's pick for U.S. attorney general, was a vocal critic of a comprehensive immigration reform bill by a bipartisan group of eight senators in 2013. Matt McClain/ The Washington Post via Getty Images Supporters of DACA/DAPA outside the Supreme Court, April 18, 2016 in Washington, DC. They and others were there to show support of Obama's immigration policy as the court heard a case that focuses on the President's executive action on immigration. Now as the future Trump administration takes shape, Escalante said many undocumented young people who applied to the deferred action program are concerned about the personal information they released that could now possibly be used against them. \u201cWhen we as a community decided to move forward and apply for this program we did it with good will \u2026 also understanding information wasn\u2018t going to be used as a massive database to target our community,\u201d Escalante said. \u201cA lot of people bracing for what may come next.\u201d Muariz said she can't imagine what she would do if the program were terminated and she was deported to Brazil. \u201cAt this point my English is better than my Portuguese,\u201d she said. \u201cA life back there is really hard to imagine at this point, especially after everything we\u2019ve built here. It would be starting from scratch, which is a scary thought.\u201d Gallegos has similar fears. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most afraid of is going to a Mexico where the economy is worse and worse every day,\u201d he said. But he said that through the deferred action program, \u201cI lived the American dream. I was able to go to school and do a lot of things with my life that don\u2019t think would have been possible in Mexico. All of those experiences, the education that I got, nobody is going to be able to take away from me.\u201d Hoping for the Best While Bracing for the Worst Short of deportation, if the program is eliminated and Gallegos has to go back to living the tenuous life of an undocumented immigrant in the U.S., he said he can deal with it. \u201cI grew up undocumented in this country,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cI remember living in Hastings, Nebraska, and there was a raid at the meatpacking plant. I remember seeing all those children left at school with nobody to pick them up from school. It\u2019s not new. It\u2019s happened before. We deal with it; we cope.\u201d But he said no one should expect young undocumented immigrants to stop fighting for the right to live freely and without fear. \u201cYou can lash at us you can detain us. Do whatever you want to us but we are going to come back and stronger every time,\u201d he said. Muariz echoed this, saying she's not pinning her hopes on possible new legislation or action by the incoming Trump administration. \u201cMy hope comes from, really, the community and people power that I\u2019ve witnessed in the past week,\" she said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Meet the new think tank in town: 'Alt-right' comes to Washington to influence Trump Richard Spencer Richard Spencer, chairman of the National Policy Institute, a prominent alt-right organization. Richard Spencer, chairman of the National Policy Institute, a prominent alt-right organization. (Joshua Roberts) Lisa Mascaro Inside a\u00a0beige meeting room at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead. Like countless others who travel to Washington, they had come\u00a0to position their interests at the forefront of the political agenda. Their sponsor\u00a0had a\u00a0wonky and\u00a0nondescript name, National Policy Institute. They cradled cups of morning coffee. But on closer look, this group Saturday\u00a0was different:\u00a0They were almost entirely young men, many sporting\u00a0the same haircut of\u00a0short sides and back with a familiar flop on top. The agenda topics: \u201c Trump and the New White Voter,\u201d \u201cAmerica and the Jewish Consciousness,\u201d \u201cThe Future of the Alt-Right.\u201d \u00a0 This was the white nationalist lobby \u2014 the alt-right \u2014 \u00a0coming to town for a victory lap after Donald Trump\u2019s election, assuming what they see as their rightful place influencing\u00a0the new administration. \u201cAn awakening among everyone has occurred with this Trump election,\u201d Richard Spencer, president of the white nationalist think tank,\u00a0said during opening remarks. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite the establishment now, but I think we should start acting like it.\u201d The National Policy Institute held a conference Saturday in Washington. Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times The National Policy Institute held a conference Saturday in Washington. The National Policy Institute held a conference Saturday in Washington. (Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times) Several hundred pro-white nationalists showed up for the day-long confab, buoyed by Trump\u2019s popularity and the role they now intend to play in bringing white identity politics to Washington. Sitting around conference tables, the formally dressed\u00a0men more resembled Washington lobbyists \u00a0than\u00a0the robed Ku Klux Klansmen or skinhead toughs that often represent white supremacists, though they share many familiar views. This new generation is aiming to influence Washington in Washington\u2019s own\u00a0ways: churning out position papers, lobbying lawmakers and, and perhaps most importantly, removing the cloak of anonymity to fully join the national political conversation. Heidi Beirich, who monitors hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said today\u2019s nationalists are picking up where David Duke left off when the former Klan imperial wizard shed his robes to enter politics in the early 1980s. \u201cThis is how you sneak these ideas into the mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guys in the suits are the ones we have to worry about.\u201d Spencer looks like many young staffers on Capitol Hill. And Beirich noted that even the newer white nationalist label, \u00a0alt-right, removes the reference to \u201cwhite,\u201d while positioning the nationalists on the \u201cright\u201d as part of the conservative movement. \u201cBeneath the benign-looking guy and the benign-sounding name, the purpose of the National Policy Institute is to push the idea that all men are created unequal,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cSadly, in American history, there\u2019s nothing new with that idea.\u201d Trump has said he \u201cdisavowed\u201d support from white supremacists, but many in the alt-right believe his tough talk on immigrants and Muslims shows that their efforts to preserve a white majority in the United States are ready for a wider audience. They were heartened by his selection of Breitbart News executive Stephen K. Bannon, who has called his site a platform for the alt-right. \u201cWe are the epicenter of the right now in terms of intellect,\u201d said 30-year-old Nathan Damigo\u00a0of California. \u201cWe are the culture creators of the right.\u201d Nathan Damigo, right, at a National Policy Institute conference in Washington. Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times Nathan Damigo, right, at a National Policy Institute conference in Washington. Nathan Damigo, right, at a National Policy Institute conference in Washington. (Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times) At Saturday\u2019s event, organizers were holding an \u201cask us anything\u201d news conference inside the Reagan building downtown as protesters filled the streets outside\u00a0on Pennsylvania Avenue. Vendors were hawking T-shirts and stickers as conferees milled about between sessions. A band was scheduled for entertainment.  Hors d\u2019oeuvres would be served before a\u00a0social hour at\u00a0a local bar \u2014\u00a0though some said they were accosted by protesters at a restaurant the night before.\u00a0 As the up-and-coming intellectual voice of the movement, Spencer is credited with popularizing\u00a0 the term \u201calt-right.\u201d Twitter banned his account and those of other leaders last week in a clampdown on hate speech. A father who splits his time between his home in Montana and an office in the Washington suburbs, he organized the conference before Trump won the election.\u00a0 But now, with Trump preparing for the White House, the National Policy Institute is planning to seize the opening with a series of policy papers on immigration, foreign and domestic policy to offer pro-white ideas.\u00a0 The\u00a0views span left and right. The group advocates\u00a0paid family leave, for example, but also requiring immigrants in the country illegally to leave and giving preference to white arrivals from Europe. \u201cIn terms of policy, Trump\u2019s movement was a little bit half-baked,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cMoving forward, the alt-right as an intellectual vanguard can complete Trump.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

New York housing police Chief James Secreto says one male and one female officer encountered the man around 1 p.m. Saturday on the ninth floor of the Van Dyke Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood. The New York Police Department's Housing Bureau officers were responding to a 911 call reporting a suspicious person. When they asked for his ID, a scuffle ensued during which Secreto says the man grabbed one officer's collapsible, metal baton and struck both in the head. The chief says the officers fired, killing the man. One officer suffered a gash, the other suffered contusions. Authorities did not immediately release the names of those involved. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Nov 19, 2016 8:13 PM EST VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis warned against what he called a \u201cvirus of polarization\u201d and hostility in the world targeting people of different nationalities, races or beliefs, as he led a ceremony Saturday giving the Roman Catholic Church 17 new cardinals from six continents. Pope Francis names three new American cardinals The consistory ceremony in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica formally inducted the churchmen into the cardinals\u2019 ranks. Francis used his homily to also caution the new \u201cprinces of the church,\u201d as cardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into the church as well, saying \u201cwe are not immune from this.\u201d The pope spoke of \u201cour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose and condemn\u201d and cautioned somberly against those who \u201craise walls, build barriers and label people.\u201d Earlier this year, when asked about the plan by Donald Trump, then a Republican U.S. presidential candidate and now president-elect, to build a wall to keep Mexicans and others from illegally entering the U.S., the pope replied that anyone advocating building walls isn\u2019t a Christian. Francis, in a message a few days earlier to U.S. bishops, had urged them to help heal a society facing growing polarization. Pope Francis speaks as he leads a consistory ceremony to install 17 new cardinals in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican Nov. 19, 2016. Close Reuters/Stefano Rellandini On Saturday, after receiving his red hat, Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, archbishop of Tlalnepantla, expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, including deporting large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, soon after assuming the presidency. \u201cYou can\u2019t divide a family. You can\u2019t divide a community. You can\u2019t divide the world,\u201d the prelate said in reply to a question by The Associated Press about Trump. The Mexican churchman added: \u201cOne thing is the election campaign. Another thing is reality.\u201d In Saturday\u2019s homily, Francis commented on how \u201cwe see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. An enemy because of the color of their skin, their language, or social class.\u201d He added: \u201cThe virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.\u201d Francis also lamented the tendency to \u201cdemonize\u201d one\u2019s opponents, \u201cso as to have a \u2018sacred\u2019 justification for dismissing them.\u201d Cardinals serve as papal advisers and someday elect popes\u2019 successors. Popes look to cardinals who share their approach to the church\u2019s mission in the world. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin is among the newly made cardinals. Tobin defied the governor of the U.S. state of Indiana, Mike Pence, by welcoming Syrian refugees. Tobin in January will become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, while Pence will be installed as U.S. vice president. CBS News correspondent Seth Doane asked Tobin if the pope\u2019s message was a political statement aimed at America. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with the U.S. election because I think you can see similar movements in many parts of the world,\u201d Tobin told Doane. Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, after being made a cardinal at Saturday\u2019s ceremony, said the church has a special role in trying to bring people together across the political spectrum. He noted that on Sunday, Masses are celebrated in 26 languages in his diocese. \u201cPeople feel disenfranchised\u201d from sharing in the common good, the cardinal said in an interview with The Associated Press. Another American in the latest crop of cardinals is Irish-born Archbishop Kevin Farrell, who led the Dallas diocese before Francis appointed him to head the Vatican office dealing with family issues. At a post-ceremony reception, Farrell acknowledged that polarization is felt within the church, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve become gods on both sides - gods on the left, and gods on the right, and neither one of these are correct,\u201d Farrell told an AP reporter. The clash of mentalities between the conservative camps and the so-called progressives chosen by Francis has played out publicly in recent days. Four prominent, disgruntled cardinals, including a U.S. prelate, Raymond Burke, who is one of Francis\u2019 most vocal critics, in a letter to the pope aired their doubts about his more compassionate approach to the contentious issue involving divorced Catholics. They fear his approach could sow confusion among the faithful. Church teaching forbids divorce, and says Catholics who remarry without annulments of their earlier marriage are essentially adulterers who can\u2019t receive communion. In a document earlier this year, Francis suggested that clerics could decide case-by-case if these Catholics could receive Communion. Farrell, asked about the tensions over the divorce issue, appeared to be open toward the pope\u2019s prescription for more compassion. \u201cThere is no situation in life that\u2019s black and white. Anybody that\u2019s lived in this world will have encountered those situations in their personal lives,\u201d Farrell said. The new cardinals, who pledged loyalty to the pope, come from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. One of them, an 88-year-old Albanian priest, Ernest Simoni, spent 18 years in prison because of his faith during the communist regime in his homeland. Since cardinals are usually bishops already, Francis bestowed a rare honor in giving that rank to Simoni, a simple priest. When Francis visited Albania in 2014, he was brought to tears when Simoni told him how he was persecuted. The pope\u2019s envoy to Syria is now Cardinal Mario Zenari. The Italian archbishop remarked how the bright crimson hue of the cardinals\u2019 cassocks and of the square, peaked headgear evokes the color of the blood spilled by innocent children killed in the five-year-old civil war there. Also among the new cardinals is Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga, of Bangui, Central African Republic. Last year, Francis visited Nzapalainga\u2019s country, bloodied by sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militants. Thirteen of the 17 new cardinals are under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in a secret conclave for the next pope. Francis has now appointed 44 of the 120 cardinals young enough to elect his successor. The others were named by the previous two pontiffs, John Paul II, whom Francis made a saint, and Benedict XVI, who retired in 2013, and generally reflect a more conservative leaning on church issues. After the ceremony, the new cardinals and Francis took minibuses to the monastery on Vatican grounds where Benedict lives so they could greet him. One of the cardinals, an 87-year-old bishop from Lesotho, Africa, was too frail to come to Rome for the ceremony. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

He said he will convene a hearing at the earliest opportunity. \"Since Admiral Rogers was appointed as NSA Director in April 2014, I have been consistently impressed with his leadership and accomplishments,\" Nunes said in the letter, adding \"I know other members of Congress hold him in similarly high esteem.\" Current and former intelligence officials have previously told NBC News that Rogers is extremely unpopular among the NSA workforce because of a re-organization he has implemented, and also because he is frequently away from the office. Morale at the spy agency, which was crushed by the Snowden leaks, slipped further over the last year, say people familiar with the situation. The NSA director took personal leave and traveled to Manhattan on Thursday, where he met with Trump at Trump Tower. Afterward, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was a leading candidate to be the next director of national intelligence. Related: Top Officials Want to Split Cyber Command From NSA NBC News has reported that Carter and Clapper are in favor of a plan to split NSA from Cyber Command. It's unclear whether the Obama administration will seek to carry out that split in the time it has remaining. While the CIA gets more attention, the majority of intelligence that goes to the president each day, officials have long said, comes from NSA eavesdropping and hacking around the world.

    "text": "Amid an uptick in reported hate crimes across the country following the presidential election, a New York City playground named for late Beastie Boys star Adam Yauch was vandalized Friday with swastikas and the words \"Go Trump.\" Photos show the swastika and words were spray-painted on playground equipment in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Swastikas and the message 'Go Trump' appeared on playground equipment at Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn. \"Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn Heights was left defaced with ugly symbols of hate today. This cannot be the new normal!\" Karen Wang, a Tribeca Film Institute programming associate, tweeted with a photo. The city named the park after the late rapper, who was Jewish, in 2013. He died of cancer in 2012 at the age of 47. New York City Councilman Brad Lander said police were investigating and the city parks department would remove the messages. Lander also attacked Trump on Twitter for refusing to acknowledge the hate crimes incited by his supporters, and focusing instead on asking the hit Broadway musical, \"Hamilton,\" for an apology for Friday night's incident in which Vice President-elect Mike Pence was booed by the audience. \"Trump took time to condemn the thoughtful plea of the @Hamilton cast. But not the swastikas in his name in a Brooklyn playground,\" Lander tweeted. Trump took time to condemn the thoughtful plea of the @HamiltonMusical cast. But not the swastikas in his name in a Brooklyn playground. https://t.co/3Qiibsm1wa \u2014 Brad Lander (@bradlander) November 19, 2016 Police are still looking for a suspect in connection with the incident after a local resident filed a complaint, the NYPD told NBC News. \"There is zero tolerance for hate crimes in our beautifully diverse city. The NYPD takes these reprehensible crimes very seriously and the mayor's office closely monitors them,\" said a spokesman for the Office of the Mayor. The vandalism was removed and painted over Friday night after the offices of New York Sen. Daniel Squadron and Lander informed the city parks department, a spokesman confirmed. Residents also filled the playground space with flowers and love hearts in show of their support. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) The graffiti is one of several recent instances of the Nazi symbol being found around New York and in other parts of the country. Thirteen swastika incidents have been reported citywide since the Nov. 8 election. Squadron, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, city council members Lander and Stephen Levin, alongside other community leaders, plan to hold an event Sunday to condemn the incident. . @realDonaldTrump -- hope you join us Sunday, 11:30, at Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn to denounce. https://t.co/WhOdwYX10j \u2014 Daniel Squadron (@DanielSquadron) November 19, 2016 Dakshayani Shankar ",

(Photo: Getty Images) If there was one thing General Motors' old Saturn car company had going for it, it was its no-haggle pricing policy. You simply paid the price on the sticker, and you couldn't go across town to another dealer and try to get something better. That was a popular policy, except it was applied to subpar cars such as the Outlook, Sky\u00a0and Vue, which all got low reliability ratings from consumer-survey outfits such as Consumer Reports. Car buyers don't like haggling, but they're willing to do it if it means they'll save money on a good quality car. Still, car companies haven't made the car shopping experience a pleasant one. A few years ago, Ipsos Public Affairs conducted a study for used-car retailer CarMax to discover what was their greatest car-buying regret. The No. 1 decision they made that they ultimately wished they could get a mulligan on was paying too much for a car that didn't hold its value. Other mistakes car buyers made include: Not doing enough research. Buying one from an untrustworthy dealer. Not getting an extended warranty. Not reading the fine print on the contract they signed. For certain, there are very few cars that can retain their value over the years, and every car buyer has heard the saying that a new car drops in value as soon as it's driven off of the dealer's lot. Let your fingers do the walking But it doesn't have to be this way. Car shoppers have a number of tools readily available to them to determine the value of a vehicle, new or used, and whether those values will hold up over time. Kelley Blue Book (KBB) and Edmunds.com may be two of the most recognized names in the industry that consumers turn to when shopping for a car, but the National Automobile Dealers Association trade group has its own \"book\" that used to be available exclusively to dealers, though it's since created a website consumers can peruse, too. Recently, Kelley released its third-quarter 2016 survey on retention values for manufacturer-suggested retail prices when a car that's anywhere from one to three years old goes to auction. The results are not encouraging. According to KBB analyst Sean Foyil, even though the cost of such vehicles has remained stable over the past few years, retention values fell by almost 5% in the third quarter, or by roughly $807. Even though the cars come loaded with better equipment packages than vehicles in the past, prices are still falling. He says this is a sign \"buyers at auction are not willing to pay a premium for these vehicles due to the saturation of vehicles available in the market.\" While 4% or so is the average decline in MSRP at auction, some cars performed much worse than average. Here are the five worst cars for model years 2013 to 2015 for retained value in the third quarter, as compiled by KBB. \u00a0(Photo: Flickr via Petey) 5. Acura RDX (-14.3%) The RDX was Acura's first compact luxury crossover SUV that showed up on dealer floors in 2006. While the vehicle has earned top ratings for safety from places such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sites such as Consumer Reports found it to be something of a mixed bag, highlighting its safety features such as lane-departure warnings, but also saying its dashboard controls are \"an exercise in needless stupidity.\" 4. Lexus HS (-14.6%) Another compact luxury vehicle, the Toyota (NYSE: TM)-family Lexus HS is a dedicated hybrid vehicle first introduced in the U.S. in 2009 with a goal of selling as many as 30,000 cars a year. Despite being seen as an upscale version of the Toyota Prius, it never really caught on with car buyers despite its popularity in Japan, perhaps because of its much lower highway MPG ratings than its rival. \u00a0After selling about 6,700 cars in 2009 and over 10,000 the following year, in 2011 Lexus sold fewer than 3,000 of them and officially killed the car off in 2012. 3. Ford C-MAX Hybrid (-14.7%) \u00a0(Photo: Flickr via Jason Lawrence) Ford\u00a0(NYSE: F) introduced the C-Max as its first hybrid-only line of vehicles in 2003, but only to European car buyers. It wasn't until the 2013 model year that U.S. buyers had a chance to drive one. Its most notable feature was its gasoline-electric powertrain that had a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine working in conjunction with an 88-kilowatt permanent magnet AC synchronous motor.\u00a0It's gotten mixed reviews, however, with KBB and Edmunds giving it four stars, but\u00a0Car & Driver\u00a0giving it just three. 2. Infiniti Q60 (-14.7%) A Nissan(NASDAQOTH: NSANY)-family vehicle,\u00a0the Q60 was the\u00a0successor to Infiniti G-series, but it never really caught on with buyers of high-end luxury cars. Models such as the 2013 lineup earned only three stars or so from the price-guide services, though later models did better. But it also offered upgrades to it that served to confuse people. The IPL model, for example, which stands for \"Infiniti Performance Line,\" charged more for what seemed like very little actual or even practical increase in performance. 1. Mitsubishi Galant (-17.8%) \u00a0(Photo: IFCAR) The granddaddy of the group, the Mitsubishi Galant was first introduced back in 1969, but much like the Lexus HS, it saw its lineage come to an end with the 2012 model year. It was originally sold in the U.S. in 1971 as a Dodge Colt and ended its existence as Mitsubishi's ninth-generation sedan built on a midsize front-wheel-drive platform. While it might not have earned stellar reviews from professional car sites, owners seemed to like it, and on Cars.com the 2012 model year actually has a 4.5-star rating. The loss in value the Galant suffered, like the Lexus, probably has more to do with the fact the cars have been discontinued, meaning it becomes much more difficult to get parts for a vehicle. Regular service and routine maintenance may be easy enough, but when a manufacturer stops making a Saturn, Saab, or Galant, it means the time involved and expense in tracking down replacement parts is going to increase. That will serve to undermine any residual value a car may hold. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends CarMax.

(Photo: MARTIN BERNETTI, AFP/Getty Images) President Obama said he doesn't expect major changes in Latin American policy under the Trump administration, and urged people to \"not make immediate judgments\" until the president-elect puts his team together. \"Don't just assume the worst. Wait until the new administration\u00a0is in place, is putting its policies forward, and then you can make your own judgments,\" Obama told a group of 1,000 young leaders from around the Americas in Peru on Saturday. \"There are going to be tensions that arise, probably more about trade more than anything else,\" he said. But even there, Obama said he's not convinced Donald Trump would tear up trade deals, as the president-elect promised on the campaign trail. \"Once they look at how it's working, I think they\u2019ll conclude that it\u2019s working both for the United States and its trading partners.\" Obama urges Trump not to cut deals with Russia Obama's comments Saturday, during his final stop on what's scheduled to be the last foreign trip of his presidency, followed a pattern of trying to give Trump space to adopt what Obama hopes are more conventional policies. In Europe this week, Obama reassured allies Trump would maintain the U.S. commitment to NATO, and he'll likely have a similar message for Pacific Rim leaders at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru on Sunday. Obama reassured NATO allies over Trump. So why aren't they buying it? \"How you campaign is not always the same as how you govern,\" Obama said. \"When you\u2019re campaigning, you're trying to stir up passions. When\u00a0you govern, you have reality in front of you, and you have to figure out how to make this work.\" On trade, for example, Obama said the 2009 Peru Trade Promotion Agreement has benefited the United States by ensuring that workers aren't undercut by abusive labor practices in Peru, but also allowing Peruvian workers to be customers for U.S. products. \"We did it also because that will help lift\u00a0the wages and benefits and protections that workers here in Peru have,\" he said. \"Then they have more money in their pockets, then they go\u00a0out an spend that money, which is good for business and everybody is better off.\" Trump's new tone needs to be reflected in staff picks, Obama says Obama also met Saturday with the 11 other leaders from countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement in limbo now that its largest signatory, the United States, appears unlikely to ratify. But the White House said Obama used the meeting to urge the other countries to press forward on \"high-standard trade agreements.\" 166 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 79 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g8RnBv ",

    "text": "Northwestern fails to start or finish, falls 29-12 to Minnesota Photos from the Northwestern-Minnesota game on Nov. 19, 2016, in Minneapolis. Pat BorziChicago Tribune Northwestern came to TCF Bank Stadium needing one victory to become bowl eligible for the second consecutive season. After yet another sluggish start Saturday, the Wildcats left without it. For the fifth time in six games, the Wildcats fell behind by double digits in the first half and lost 29-12 to Minnesota on a cold, windy afternoon. Now the Wildcats (5-6, 4-4 in the Big Ten) must beat Illinois at Ryan Field next Saturday in their final regular-season game to extend their season. \"We came out slow in the first half, and then we didn't finish strong the second half,\" middle linebacker Anthony Walker said. \"It's on us as captains and on me as middle linebacker. We've got to get that going.\" Rodney Smith ran for a 5-yard touchdown on Minnesota's first drive, and Emmit Carpenter shook off a missed extra point to kick three field goals as the Gophers (8-3, 5-4) took a 15-0 lead. Northwestern finally scored in the third quarter on Justin Jackson's 4-yard run, but Gophers quarterback Mitch Leidner ended the Wildcats' comeback hopes with a pair of touchdowns in the final 6 minutes, 46 seconds \u2014 a 9-yard touchdown pass to Drew Wolitarsky and a 12-yard run. Clayton Thorson threw 9 yards to Flynn Nagel for the final Wildcats score with 2:46 left to make it 22-12. Northwestern went for two points after both touchdowns and failed. Jackson ran for 90 yards on 22 carries, and Thorson threw for 276 yards. But the Wildcats allowed seven sacks and struggled for yardage in key situations all day, going 2-for-15 on third down and 1-for-4 on fourth. Two missed opportunities summarized the inefficiency. Late in the first half, with the Wildcats trailing 9-0, coach Pat Fitzgerald went for it on fourth-and-1 from the Gophers 16. Minnesota stopped Jackson for a 3-yard loss. Carpenter then connected from 42 yards with 21 seconds left in the half for a 12-0 lead. \"I felt points were at a premium,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Something-and-1, you think you can get it. When you don't execute, it's kind of a moot point.\" And on the kickoff after Jackson's touchdown, Walker wrestled the ball from returner Jalen Myrick at the Minnesota 22. Northwestern again came away with nothing, turning the ball over on downs. \"We've gone where our offensive line has taken us,\" Fitzgerald said. \"We have six defeats. Not trying to put it squarely on their shoulders, but we've been pretty inconsistent up there. Today was one of our more inconsistent games of the year.\" Wideout Austin Carr had five catches for 68 yards before leaving in the third quarter. He was leveled by a helmet-to-helmet hit from Minnesota safety Duke McGhee. McGhee was ejected for targeting, his second such penalty of the season and the seventh by the Gophers. Pat Borzi is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune. Wildcats 2-minute drill Carr OK? Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said wideout Austin Carr, felled by Duke McGhee's helmet-to-helmet hit in the third quarter, \"seemed to be doing well\" postgame but would not confirm if he was being treated for a concussion. Fitzgerald also declined comment on Minnesota's seven targeting penalties this season, two by McGhee, saying: \"Those are great questions for\" Minnesota coach Tracy Claeys. Keeping cool: Fitzgerald gathered the Wildcats on the sideline after the Carr hit and again before the fourth quarter, heading off possible retaliation. \"Coach pulled us together and talked about being disciplined and not losing focus because of what happened,\" defensive end C.J. Robbins said. Out of balance: The Wildcats edged the Gophers in total offense 339 yards to 328 after spotting Minnesota an early 90-10 advantage. But Northwestern averaged just 1.9 yards on 33 rushing attempts and twice failed to covert on fourth-and-1 in the red zone. \"We just didn't get it done, in their half of the field especially,\" wideout Andrew Scanlan said. \"It's been the story of the year, not just today.\" Looking ahead: Northwestern hosts Illinois on Saturday needing a victory to become bowl eligible.

John McCain, R-Arizona, speaks during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol Feb. 5, 2015, in Washington, D.C.</p> Close Win McNamee/Getty Images HALIFAX, Nova Scotia\u00a0-- A leading Republican voice on national security matters says he doesn\u2019t care what President-elect Donald Trump says, the United States will not reinstate waterboarding. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Saturday at the Halifax International Security Forum that any attempt to bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court.\u00a0 McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, says extreme interrogation techniques are banned under U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding used against suspected terrorists during the George W. Bush administration. Donald Trump: We need to change law to allow torture, waterboarding \u201cWe have an enemy in the Middle East that\u2019s chopping off heads and drowning people in massive steel cages,\u201d Mr. Trump\u00a0 said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in March , speaking of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very tough to beat enemies that don\u2019t have any, that don\u2019t have any restrictions, all right? We have these massive restrictions. Now, I will always abide by the law, but I would like to have the law expanded.\u201d \u201cI happen to think that when you\u2019re fighting an enemy that chops off heads, I happen to think that we should use something that\u2019s stronger than we have right now,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now, basically, waterboarding is essentially not allowed, as I understand it. ... I would certainly like it to be, at a minimum, at a minimum to allow that.\u201d In another interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in July, Mr. Trump and then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence doubled down on enhanced interrogation techniques, saying that they have \u201csaved lives.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThose techniques get information,\u201d Mr. Trump told \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat I can tell you is enhanced information gleaned information that saved American lives and, I was informed, prevented incoming terrorist attacks on this country from being successful,\u201d Pence added at the time. \u201cThe American people expect the president of the United States to be prepared to support action to protect the people of this nation, and I know Donald Trump will.\u201d McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, says waterboarding doesn\u2019t work and makes it hard for the U.S. to claim moral superiority. The president-elect has publicly derided McCain for his capture during the Vietnam War.\u00a0 During the Republican primary campaign last July, Mr. Trump said the Arizona senator was only considered \u201ca war hero \u2018cause he was captured.\u201d\u00a0 At the time, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

A bit of Mars also arrived, courtesy of a Frenchman who brought along a small piece of a Mars meteorite.

The Soyuz delivered NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. They joined three men already on board, one American and two Russians. This image obtained from NASA TV shows a view from a camera on the International Space Station before the Soyuz MS-03 spacecraft docks to the Rassvet module on November 19, 2016. AFP PHOTO / NASA TV This is the third space station mission for Whitson, who at 56 is older than each of her crewmates. She already holds the record for most time in space for a woman: nearly 400 days during her various missions. By the time she returns next spring, she should break the record for any American, man or woman. A biochemist by training, Whitson will celebrate her 57th birthday at the orbiting lab in February. Until Thursday, no woman older than 55 had flown in space. Pesquet, meanwhile, is making his first spaceflight and Novitskiy his second. Before rocketing away, Pesquet told reporters he was taking up a piece of a Mars meteorite to illustrate the necessary union between human and robotic explorers. He intends to bring the stone back with him to Earth in six months. It then will launch aboard a Mars rover and return to its home planet. \"So it's going to be the most experienced space traveler there is in the world,\" Pesquet said Wednesday at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

    "text": "By Valerie Strauss November 19 at 1:44 PM Follow @valeriestrauss President-elect Donald Trump embraces son in law Jared Kushner, as his daughter Ivanka Trump stands nearby, after Trump delivered his acceptance speech on the morning of Nov. 9, following his election to the presidency. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Daniel Golden is the editor of ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. In 2004, he won the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting for a series of Wall Street Journal articles exposing how some wealthy white families can use assets \u2014 cash and political connections \u2014 to get their children into top colleges and universities. Then in 2006, he wrote a book on the same subject, \u201c The Price of Admission: How America\u2019s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges \u2014 and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, \u201d adding\u00a0to his earlier revelations about how elite institutions of higher education talk incessantly about merit-based admissions but don\u2019t always walk that walk. In the book, Golden told stories about how specific families maneuvered to get their children into schools they otherwise might not have gotten into without their names, bank accounts and access to power. This is from a Washington Post review of the book when it was published: A tough investigative reporter, Golden does not hesitate to name names \u2014 not only of specific institutions (including Harvard, Duke, Brown, Notre Dame, the University of Virginia, Princeton, Stanford and Amherst) and administrators, but also of individual students (including the sons of Al Gore and Sen. Bill Frist) whom he deems to be beneficiaries of preferences for the privileged. The result is a disturbing expos\u00e9 of the influence that wealth and power still exert on admission to the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities. Another one of the families he writes about are the Kushners, which includes 35-year-old Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump and confidant\u00a0to\u00a0his father-in-law, President-elect Donald Trump. In a new piece for ProPublica , Golden answers why the Kushners were part of the book and details why he believes Harvard accepted Jared Kushner. Golden notes: Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said in an email Thursday that \u201cthe allegation\u201d that Charles Kushner\u2019s gift to Harvard was related to Jared\u2019s admission \u201cis and always has been false.\u201d His parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner, \u201care enormously generous and have donated over 100 million dollars to universities, hospitals and other charitable causes. Jared Kushner was an excellent student in high school and graduated from Harvard with honors.\u201d (About 90 percent of Jared\u2019s 2003 class at Harvard also graduated with honors.) He also wrote this about his book: It reported that New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5 million to Harvard University in 1998, not long before his son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school. At the time, Harvard accepted about one of every nine applicants. (Nowadays, it only takes one out of twenty.) I also quoted administrators at Jared\u2019s high school, who described him as a less than stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvard\u2019s decision. \u201cThere was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard,\u201d a former official at The Frisch School in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. \u201cHis GPA did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought for sure, there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not.\u201d You can read Golden\u2019s full report, co-published with the Guardian , here. There are other reports, too, of how wealthy families attempt to buy admissions for their children into a top college or university. In 2015, the London Review of Books published a piece by Deborah Friedell about the release by WikiLeaks of hacked emails from Sony. She wrote: In 2014, a senior executive emailed an Ivy League vice-president of philanthropy: he\u2019d like to endow a scholarship, anonymously, \u2018at the $1mm level\u2019. In another email, he tells a development officer that his daughter is applying to the college as her first choice. It\u2019s all very decorous. The development staff arrange a \u2018customised\u2019 campus tour for his daughter and a meeting with the university\u2019s president; but he asks for no favours and nothing is promised. An email from the president says that his daughter\u2019s application will be looked at \u2018very closely\u2019. She gets in. He writes to his sister: \u2018David\u2026 called me. he is obsessed with getting his eldest in Harvard next year.\u2019 She replies: \u2018If David wants to get his daughter in he should obviously start giving money.\u2019 Obviously. Jared Kushner is President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law but he's also one of his key advisers. Here's a closer look at the man who may play a central role in Trump's administration.

(Nov. 19) AP President-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect Mike Pence welcome Mitt Romney as he arrives for a day of meetings at the clubhouse of Trump National Golf Club Nov. 19, 2016 in Bedminster, N.J. (Photo: Don Emmert, AFP/Getty Images) Mitt Romney, who for months told\u00a0the American public Donald Trump was unfit for the White House, spent more than an hour Saturday discussing global affairs with\u00a0the president-elect. The meeting began around 1 p.m. at\u00a0Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence greeting the 2012 GOP presidential nominee at the clubhouse door. It ended\u00a0around 2:20 p.m. with Trump seeing him off, and Romney making a brief statement to reporters. \"We had a\u00a0far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world\u00a0where there are interests of the United States of real significance,\" Romney said. \"We discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics \u2014 a\u00a0very thorough and in-depth discussion in the time we had and, I appreciated the chance\u00a0to speak with the president-elect\u00a0and look forward to the coming administration.\" As Romney approached reporters, Trump cupped his hands around his mouth and said \"it went great,\" according to a pool report. There was no confirmation or suggestion of a job offer despite\u00a0reports of\u00a0Romney's interest\u00a0in the secretary of State post. Analysts say it\u2019s doubtful Trump would offer a job in his administration or that Romney would accept it given the verbal jabs they exchanged on the trail. Former Arkansas Governor\u00a0and Trump confidante Mike Huckabee said it \"doesn't make any sense\" to give someone who was such a vocal critic a top cabinet post. \"To give a guy a job who basically said all his supporters were\u00a0following a con man, I just think that would be an insult to the voters,\"\u00a0Huckabee told Fox\u00a0News Saturday. \"You don't entrust one of the of the\u00a0most important parts of your administration and your entire presidency to people\u00a0who fundamentally don't think you have any business sitting in that chair offering them the job.\" Trump to meet with one of his biggest critics: Mitt Romney During the campaign, Romney called Trump a \u201cphony ... a fraud ...(and) a con man,\u201d among other pointed criticisms. He also wrote on Facebook that Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax records was \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Trump responded that Romney was \u201cirrelevant (and) a choke artist.\u201d He tweeted often about Romney, at one point calling him a \u201cdope!\u201d Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2016 Romney was the first of several high-profile visitors meeting with Trump and Pence this weekend. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are expected to meet with the incoming president Sunday. By 6 p.m. Saturday, Trump had also ended a meeting with Chicago Cubs owner and GOP fundraiser\u00a0Todd Ricketts.\u00a0 Asked by reporters whether\u00a0Ricketts would be in his cabinet, Trump replied, \"we\u2019re going to see, we\u2019re going to have a lot of great talent.\" Twenty minutes later, Trump concluded a meeting with fast food CEO Andy Puzder, who runs CKE Restaurants (which operates\u00a0Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s), followed by\u00a0Republican National Committee finance chair and businessman Lew Eisenberg (Commerce). Saturday evening Trump told gathered press he was\u00a0\"getting close\" to making new cabinet\u00a0decisions.\u00a0\"We\u2019re seeing tremendous talent. People that, like I say, we will \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 These are really great people,\" he said.\u00a0\"These are really, really talented people.\" On a brief break, Trump resumed tweeting about Pence's visit to Broadway's\u00a0Hamilton.\u00a0\"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!\" the president-elect tweeted. But minutes later, he deleted the jab. Also on Trump's weekend\u00a0schedule are: Former Washington D.C. Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee, School voucher advocate Betsy DeVos, retired U.S. Marine Corps general James Mattis, , Center for Neighborhood Enterprises President Bob Woodson, and surgeon and businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong. Early Saturday evening Trump added that he expected the cabinet to be \"partially\" shaped overnight, but would not confirm if Mattis\u00a0would be named secretary of defense, calling the general a \"great man.\" Aside from Giuliani and Christie, Sunday\u2019s lineup of visitors includes: conservative writer John Gray, immigration hardliner Kris Kobach, venture capitalist Wilbur Ross, BET founder Robert Johnson, and global investor David McCormick. Who has Trump appointed to his cabinet so far? Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said the roster of visitors \u201cshows the reach and the depth to which we\u2019re going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspective as we form this administration.\u201d Some of the visitors are potential administration hires and some \u201care coming purely to offer their advice,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut I think this also shows that the president-elect is even bringing folks together when they have been on the opposite of him politically.\u201d Trump has already begun forming his national security team, selecting retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn as national security adviser,\u00a0Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, and Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., as his pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. Sean Spicer, another Trump spokesman, said it\u2019s possible at least one more member of that team gets named Saturday. 392 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 126 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g8muNo ",

Apologize!\" He also tweeted that Pence was \"harassed\" by the cast as theatergoers had their \"cameras blazing.\" The theater erupted with clapping and booing when Pence, surrounded by Secret Service, went to his seat near the front of the stage before the show started. The commotion quickly spread on social media as audience members captured the awkward moment. The president-elect's tweets later turned into an all-out duel with members of the \"Hamilton\" cast. Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 Actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the show, shot back at Trump's tweet, arguing that \"conversation is not harassment sir.\" @realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen. \u2014 Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016 \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who left the show in July and was nominated for a Tony Award for playing Alexander Hamilton, tweeted that he was \"proud\" of Dixon for speaking up. Proud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016 Miranda got backup from former co-star Christopher Jackson, who originated the role of George Washington and tweeted that it's Trump who should apologize following a divisive presidential election. The countless Americans that have been Insulted, Degraded, Marginalized, Harassed, Intimidated. APOLOGIZE for that! APOLOGIZE for your HATE! \u2014 Christopher Jackson (@ChrisisSingin) November 19, 2016 Some on social media said Pence was widely panned by the audience, while others said he received a mixed reaction when he walked in. \"There was definitely more of a mixed reaction, but boos did drown out the clapping,\" a theatergoer who was in the audience told NBC News. \"But there was no doubt his presence was felt throughout the show.\" Pence's presence also didn't go unnoticed by the cast, and Dixon used the opportunity in a rare move after the show to address the Indiana governor directly during curtain call, reading from a statement that appeared to have been prepped backstage. \"Vice President-elect Pence, I see you're walking out, but I hope you will hear just a few more minutes,\" Dixon said. Pence stopped to listen. \"We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our friends, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\" Dixon said, reading off a piece of paper. \"But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\" Tonight, VP-Elect Mike Pence attended #HamiltonBway . After the show, @BrandonVDixon delivered the following statement on behalf of the show. pic.twitter.com/Jsg9Q1pMZs \u2014 Hamilton (@HamiltonMusical) November 19, 2016 \"We truly thank you for sharing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men, women of different colors, creeds and orientation,\" Dixon said. \"We don't have to agree, but we have to live here,\" the actor concluded to cheers from the crowd before Pence abruptly left. He was seen waving to people outside. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, top center, leaves the Richard Rodgers Theatre after a performance of \"Hamilton,\" in New York on Nov. 18, 2016. Andres Kudacki / AP \"Hamilton,\" the red-hot hip-hop musical that tells the reimagined story of founding father Hamilton and the historic duel he had in 1804 with Vice President Burr, has a diverse cast \u2014 and has taken pride in having actors who are part of the LGBTQ community or come from immigrant families. Related: LGBTQ Community Fears Backlash After Trump Victory Seth Stewart, who plays the Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson, said the cast didn't encourage the booing. \"Why? Because you cannot change hate with hate, or fight darkness with itself. Only love can change that!\" he tweeted. \"I thought it was a very positive message from the cast and they actually told the crowd not to boo,\" an audience member at the performance told NBC News. \"The cast didn't harass him, they were asking the crowd to stop.\" But Trump supporters lashed out at the uproar prompted by Pence's attendance. The president-elect's senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, tweeted that he \"deserves respect and a peaceful night out with his nephew and daughter.\" The hashtag #boycotthamilton was fueling the feud on social media, with some people saying people shouldn't watch the musical, which is going for hundreds of dollars a seat , because the cast called out Pence. But that didn't stop the throngs of people who waited hours in long lines to get tickets to the show Saturday afternoon. \"I just think it's ludicrous that the Trump supporters want to boycott a show,\" said Robert Sambbl, who was waiting for tickets outside the \"Hamilton\" box office. \"It would be disingenuous to have somebody who opposes what you believe in and you not saying anything about it,\" Sambbl said of the cast responding to Pence. \"So they had the platform, literally and figuratively, and that's what they chose to do. And I support them 100 percent.\" Erik Ortiz ",

Taking a softer tone, Trump and Romney seemed to bury the hatchet at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey \u2014 where the businessman-turned-politician moved his White House transition team for the weekend \u2014 in a meeting that lasted about an hour and a half. Trump is considering Romney for secretary of state, a source close to Trump told NBC News , although the president-elect has not publicly said what role, if any, Romney could play. Related: Analysis: Trump Charges Ahead With Hard Line With Sessions, Flynn Picks \"It went great,\" Trump told the press after walking the former governor of Massachusetts outside. Romney, also addressing the press, added that \"we had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the U.S.\" He said it was a \"very thorough and in-depth discussion in the time we had and appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and look forward to the coming administration.\" Play Romney arrives for meeting with Trump 4:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161120014121if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/813207107628\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The 2012 Republican presidential nominee ignored questions from reporters about whether he would take a position in the administration if offered one, and if he and Trump apologized for their months-long war of words. Romney was then whisked away by his white Buick. Trump returned outside and greeted former Washington, D.C., schools chancellor Michelle Rhee for another private meeting. Related: Mike Flynn, Jeff Sessions, Mike Pompeo: Meet Trump's Latest Top Picks Such a move to incorporate Romney would be a stark reversal following the name-calling over the past year \u2014 and one that would build out Trump's inner circle that includes retired Gen. Mike Flynn in a national security adviser post, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as head of the CIA. On Friday, members of Trump's transition team arrived in Washington, D.C., to begin working with the State Department.

Drew Angerer / Getty Images Before the meeting started, Romney shook hands with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and entered what was sure to be a difficult and awkward meeting. The two sides came together after feuding during the presidential election. Romney had ripped Trump as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud,\" and said a presidential nominee should be disqualified for not releasing his tax returns \u2014 criticism he wrote in a Facebook post in May. The former governor also wrote that given Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, there was certain to be a \"bombshell\" within them. Post by NBC News . Trump responded on the campaign trail, claiming that Romney was \"irrelevant\" and \"a choke artist.\" The president-elect also routinely took to Twitter to share his blustery criticism. Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2016 The president-elect shared on Twitter, his favored social media platform, that he planned to work through the weekend: Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Trump is scheduled to meet with more than a half-dozen people Saturday, including: Retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis; Center for Neighborhood Enterprise president and founder Robert L. Woodson Sr.; Chicago Cubs owner and director of the Ending Spending Super PAC Todd Ricketts; chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Andy Puzder;and RNC finance chief Lew Eisenberg.

The New York Attorney General announced the $25 million settlement Friday. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President-elect Donald Trump has agreed to pay $25 million to settle three lawsuits that targeted his now-defunct Trump University real-estate seminars. As part of the settlement, he admits no wrongdoing. NPR's Ina Jaffe has been following the case. Thanks for being with us, Ina. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi, Scott. SIMON: President-elect Trump said - did not admit wrongdoing. So what are the indications as to why the suit was settled? JAFFE: Well, Alan Garten, the general counsel for the Trump organization, released a statement saying that there was, quote, \"no doubt that Trump would have won a trial.\" But he said the resolution of the lawsuits allows the president-elect to devote his full attention to the important issues facing the nation. SIMON: Where does that $25 million go? JAFFE: $1 million will go to the state of New York, which brought one of the lawsuits. The rest of the money will go to the plaintiffs. All of them are former students of Trump University. Now, these are class-action suits. And there could potentially be thousands of plaintiffs. But the attorneys for the two other lawsuits said in the statement that they won't be taking any fees, so that all the money can go to their clients. SIMON: Ina, bring us back to what these cases were all about, if you could. JAFFE: Well, they were about whether Trump University really did what Donald Trump said it would. In videos and print ads, he said that the instructors would be, quote, \"the best of the best,\" all of them hand-picked by Trump himself. And potential students were told they would learn his real-estate investing secrets. SIMON: Now, Mr. Trump often points out that the school, at least on the website, had an overwhelmingly favorable rating from former students. But the plaintiffs say that it wasn't like that at all. JAFFE: Really, that's exactly what they say. They argue that the whole point to this school was to keep selling students increasingly expensive seminars. First, there was a free introductory course where students were told they could make tens of thousands of dollars in just a couple of months using Trump's investment techniques. But to learn those, they had to sign up for another seminar that cost about 1,500 bucks. And at that seminar, they were sold another course that cost as much as $35,000. They claim that students were encouraged to go into credit-card debt and even cash out their 401(k)s to pay for these top-level courses. SIMON: The settlement was reached. Well, one of these suits was about to go to trial on Monday, wasn't it? JAFFE: Yeah, it was, though attorneys for Trump wanted it delayed because he was too busy with the transition. But, clearly, his schedule wasn't going to get any easier once he became president. So the judge in the case was urging both sides to settle. SIMON: Donald Trump, Ina, has said in a number of interviews that he doesn't like settling lawsuits, that he prefers to see things through. JAFFE: Right. He says settling only encourages people to sue him, which is why earlier attempts to settle had been fruitless. And if you want to know what the process was like, here's a statement from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman which gives you an idea of what the process was like. He wrote, Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. SIMON: Well - and now they'll get $25 million, right? JAFFE: I guess. SIMON: NPR's Ina Jaffe, thanks so much for being with us. JAFFE: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

    "text": "Donald Trump duels with cast of 'Hamilton' Nov. 19, 2016, 6:33 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now:Trump does not appreciate how Mike Pence was received at 'Hamilton'White nationalists in jackets... (W.J. Hennigan) Trump also met with Rhee, presumably to discuss\u00a0education issues. Rhee\u00a0was the controversial chancellor of the public schools in Washington, D.C., and now lives in Sacramento where her husband, former basketball star Kevin Johnson , is the\u00a0city\u2019s mayor. Rhee declined to speak to reporters as she left the club.\u00a0 Among others on Trump\u2019s dance card for the day was\u00a0retired Gen. James Mattis, a former war commander who has been critical of some Obama administration policies and has the nickname of \u201cMad Dog Mattis\u201d and is being considered to lead the Pentagon. Patrick\u00a0Soon-Shiong, who made his fortune developing an anti-cancer drug, also met\u00a0with Trump. Soon-Shiong, a vice chairman of the Los Angeles Times\u2019 parent company Tronc,\u00a0has been closely involved with Vice President Joe Biden 's cancer moonshot initiative, which is designed to accelerate scientific efforts to find cures for cancers. The meetings were designed to highlight\u00a0the administration\u2019s efforts \u201cto pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration,\u201d said Trump spokesman Jason Miller. Trump, however, started the day off on a different note \u2014 by sparking\u00a0a feud on social media over what happened when his vice president-elect attended the critically acclaimed\u00a0Broadway musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d When Pence arrived at the Richard Rodgers Theatre\u00a0on Broadway for the night\u2019s performance of \u201cHamilton,\u201d he was both cheered and loudly jeered by the audience. After the show, actor Brandon Victor Dixon spoke to Pence from the stage: \u201cWe, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.\" Pence had\u00a0left the auditorium before Dixon finished, but reportedly heard all the remarks over speakers in the hallway. Trump didn\u2019t appreciate the lecture. \u201cOur wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d Dixon responded on the social media platform:\u00a0\u201cconversation is not harassment sir,\u201d adding that he appreciated Pence for showing up. Trump also took to Twitter in the morning to brag\u00a0about settling fraud claims aimed at\u00a0his defunct university. A day earlier, Trump had settled two class-action lawsuits filed in San Diego and a third suit brought by the New York state attorney general for $25 million, something he had repeatedly said he would never do. The lawsuits alleged that Trump had defrauded customers into thinking they would learn real estate secrets from professors he had \u201chandpicked\u201d at his for-profit Trump University. The students said they learned little and instead were subjected to hard-sell tactics urging them to spend thousands of dollars on classes. \u201cI settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

But he's scored a win with Donald Trump RNC in Cleveland 2016 Brian Blanco / European Pressphoto Agency Radio host Alex Jones speaks to crowds near Quicken Loans Arena, the venue for the 2016 Republican National Convention. Radio host Alex Jones speaks to crowds near Quicken Loans Arena, the venue for the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Brian Blanco / European Pressphoto Agency) Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Steve Padilla Contact Reporter Alex Jones was telling his listeners on YouTube about his visit to scenic Mt. Bonnell, the highest point in Austin, Texas, where he had gone to record a message about the dark forces threatening the republic \u2014 one of his favorite topics. As is often the case, he got sidetracked \u2014 this time by the president-elect of the United States. \u201cOn my way here, Donald Trump gave me a call ,\u201d Jones recounted on one of his latest videos, posted last week. \u201cAnd I told him, \u2018Mr. President-elect, you\u2019re too busy;\u00a0we don\u2019t need to talk.\u2019 But we still spent over five minutes [on the phone], and he said, \u2018Listen, Alex. I just talked to the kings and queens of the world, world leaders, you name it.\u2019 But he said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter. I want to talk to you to thank you and thank your audience. And I\u2019ll be on in the next few weeks to thank them.\u2019\u201d These are heady times for Jones, the Austin-based documentarian, radio and online television host known for his epic rants about the new world order and efforts by powerful globalists to enslave the masses. His \u201cInfowars\u201d program is a mainstay of the far-right media landscape, gaining new currency as the Trump campaign has sidelined the mainstream press in favor of more receptive outlets. Jones takes Trump\u2019s \u201csome people say\u201d style of interpreting the world and doubles down. The Texas Internet host likes to talk about secret armies. Mind control. \u201cKleptocrat corporate-run media.\u201d The 9/11 attacks, he says, were carried out by the U.S. government. Six days\u00a0before the Nov. 8 election, Jones uploaded another scoop: \u201cThe Truth About the Clinton\u00a0Pedophile Ring Exposed.\u201d When officialdom and the media are calling him crazy, that\u2019s when Jones figures he\u2019s hit his stride. \u201cWhen they\u2019re attacking you,\u201d he said in a 2013 interview with The Times, \u201cyou\u2019re winning.\u201d Trump\u2019s rise, Jones says, can be attributed to \u201cliberty and freedom\u00a0and common sense.\u201d \u201cWe finally have people in Washington that actually listen to the people and don\u2019t buy the propaganda of the big mainline corporations that are using weaponized media to mind-control simple-minded people,\u201d Jones told his listeners. Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead. Like countless others who travel to Washington, they had come\u00a0to position their interests at the forefront... Inside a\u00a0beige meeting room at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead. Like countless others who travel to Washington, they had come\u00a0to position their interests at the forefront... (Lisa Mascaro) Like most successful purveyors of conspiracy theories, Jones gets it right just enough to keep people listening. He early on warned the public about National Security Agency cellphone spying, domestic drones and the perils of genetically modified food. He is a Texan with enough of an accent to prove it, and his baritone voice commands attention in person and on the air. Jones broadcasts from his headquarters in an unmarked building at a location he prefers not to disclose. His default setting is distrust. When a reporter visited his studio in 2013, a staff member alerted Jones during a commercial break that the FBI had just foiled a bomb plot in Wichita, Kan. Jones ducked out of the studio to scrutinize a bank of network television monitors, then scoffed at the FBI\u2019s announcement. \u201cExplosion plot \u2014 like they\u2019re so pleased to have something to run around and get people excited about,\u201d he said. One caller that day, a man who identified himself as Ryan from Kentucky, said he had witnessed nearly 3,000 Russian troops and United Nations forces secretly training nearby. Jones appeared unfazed. Over the years he has shared similar reports of covert armies preparing to subjugate the American people. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the place \u2014 they\u2019re just acclimating us for occupation,\u201d he replied, \u201cYou should shoot video of that \u2014 post it on YouTube.\u201d During his show, he has been known to sing along to Black Sabbath, Johnny Cash, Blue Oyster Cult and George Strait. He loves \u201cStar Wars\u201d and peppers his commentary with references to \u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d He\u2019s friends with Dave Mustaine, former lead guitarist for the heavy metal band Metallica, now with Megadeth. The band named its 12th studio album after one of Jones\u2019 films, \u201cEndgame.\u201d Jones graduated from Austin\u2019s Anderson High School in 1993 \u2014\u00a0the same year the FBI\u00a0raided the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, a confrontation that left dozens of sect members dead and sparked endless debate over the FBI\u2019s account of events. He went on to attend Austin Community College, where he hosted a show on the college\u2019s public access channel that became the basis for his current radio show and website. Jones is not without detractors. Glenn Beck has accused him of being a fascist madman (Jones dismisses Beck as an effeminate globalist lackey). The Southern Poverty Law Center , which monitors extremist groups, said Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was among Jones\u2019 listeners; Southern Poverty Law Center spokesman Mark Potok has called Jones \u201cthe single most prolific patriot conspiracy theorist in the country.\u201d\u00a0 On Wednesday, a woman whose mother died in the 2012 massacre\u00a0at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut released an open letter calling on Trump to disavow Jones , saying he \u201chas fanned the flames of a hateful conspiracy theory claiming that the shooting that took my mother never happened.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable. It\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Erica Lafferty wrote to Trump. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to denounce it immediately and cut ties with Alex Jones and anyone who subscribes to these dangerous ideas.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday met with an eclectic mix of potential Cabinet picks, including a high-profile Republican foe, even as he launched a Twitter storm boasting about settling a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and criticizing the cast of a hit Broadway musical for lecturing his vice... President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday met with an eclectic mix of potential Cabinet picks, including a high-profile Republican foe, even as he launched a Twitter storm boasting about settling a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and criticizing the cast of a hit Broadway musical for lecturing his vice... (Del Quentin Wilber) In a video released Friday, \u201cAlex Jones\u2019 Final Statement on Sandy Hook,\u201d Jones denied saying that no one died. He then went on to suggest, however, that the official account by police and everyone else who has looked into the tragedy \u2014\u00a0that a single gunman had slaughtered six adults and 20 first-graders at the school \u2014 was open to question. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I\u2019m not sure about what really happened,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anomalies. And there has been a coverup of whatever did happen there.\u201d For all the people Jones infuriates, he also draws enthusiastic audiences. That was vividly on display three years ago when he and listeners gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy\u2019s assassination. On\u00a0a Dallas street, he gestured wildly with his free hand to his camera crew and the crowd surrounding him at the foot of the grassy knoll that had become such a famous landmark associated with the shooting. \u201cA year ago the mayor said we won\u2019t have any conspiracy theorists [at the anniversary observance] \u2014 that means anyone who questions the official story,\u201d Jones shouted. \u201cThis is an act of defiance!\u201d Supporters wearing Infowars T-shirts cheered, while others carried signs Jones had made bearing Kennedy\u2019s image and the words: \u201cThe establishment killed me 50 years ago, now they\u2019re killing free speech.\u201d As he hit his stride, Jones\u2019 gravely voice rose to an urgent crescendo. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a bunch of offshore corporations running our country and trying to get rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution, and banker bailouts of trillions of dollars, trying to take our guns and impoverish us for political control!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018OK, you want a fight? You\u2019re going to get one, you bastards!\u2019\u201d The crowd erupted in cheers. \u201cHe\u2019s counterintuitive. He shines a light in the darkness,\u201d said Joe Krupa, a retired teacher from San Pedro who had come for the anniversary and stumbled upon Jones. Jason Phillips, an engineer from San Diego, thought Jones sounded pretty wild when he first saw his show on YouTube. But the more he listened, he said, the more he believed. \u201cThe official story,\u201d he said, \u201cis a farce.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

    "text": "AP November 19, 2016, 3:10 PM Donald Trump opponents try to beat him at the Electoral College A small group protest outside the courthouse in opposition of President-elect Donald Trump, Friday, Nov., 11, 2016, in Fort Worth, Texas.\u00a0 Brandon Wade, AP Email BOISE, Idaho \u2014 Grassroots campaigns have sprung up around the country to try to persuade members of the Electoral College to do something that has never been done in American history \u2014 deny the presidency to the clear Election Day winner. Activists are circulating online petitions and using social media in hopes of influencing Republican electors to cast their ballots for someone other than President-elect Donald Trump and deprive him of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next occupant of the White House. \u201cYes, I think it\u2019s a longshot, but I also think we\u2019re living in strange times,\u201d said Daniel Brezenoff, who created a petition in favor of Hillary Clinton and is asking signers to lobby electors by email or phone. \u201cIf it was ever plausible, it\u2019s this year.\u201d Mr.\u00a0 Trump has won 290 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 232 , with Michigan undecided, but Clinton is on pace to win the popular vote by at least 1 million ballots. Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents are motivated by the outcome of the popular vote and by their contention that the businessman and reality TV star is unfit to serve as commander in chief. Just one elector so far has wavered publicly on supporting Trump. Hillary Clinton now leads President-elect Donald Trump by about a million people in the popular vote. But that won't change the outcome of the el... Texas Republican Art Sisneros says he has reservations about the president-elect, but not because of the national popular vote. He told The Associated Press he won\u2019t vote for Clinton under any circumstance. \u201cAs a Christian, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is not biblically qualified for that office,\u201d he said. He said he has heard from ecstatic Clinton supporters and even supportive Republicans, but also from outraged Trump backers writing \u201cthreatening and vile things.\u201d Sisneros signed a state party pledge to support the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer, but that was before Mr. Trump was the official nominee. He said one of his options is to resign, allowing the state party to choose another elector. Electors are chosen by party officials and are typically the party\u2019s most loyal members. Presidential electors are not required to vote for a particular candidate under the Constitution. Even so, the National Archives says more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged throughout the nation\u2019s history. Some state laws call for fines against \u201cfaithless electors,\u201d while others open them to possible felony charges, although the National Archives says no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged. In North Carolina, a faithless elector\u2019s vote is canceled, and he or she must immediately resign and be replaced. Layne Bangerter and Melinda Smyser, two of Idaho\u2019s four Republican electors, said they have been flooded with emails, telephone calls and Facebook messages from strangers urging them to reconsider their vote. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to work,\u201d Bangerter said. \u201cI hope it dies down, but I don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d The volume and tone of the messages caught the attention of Idaho\u2019s secretary of state, who urged the public to remain civil as electors prepare to cast their ballots on Dec. 19 while meeting in their states. Republican Party officials in Georgia and Michigan said their electors also have been bombarded with messages, and Iowa reported increased public interest in obtaining contact information for electors. Michael Banerian, 22, one of Michigan\u2019s 16 Republican electors, said he has received death threats from people who do not want him to vote for Mr. Trump. But he said he is undeterred. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just a lot of angry people who don\u2019t completely understand how the process works,\u201d said Banerian, a political science major at Oakland University. P. Bret Chiafalo, a Democratic elector in Washington state, said he and a small group of other electors from the party are working to contact their Republican counterparts and ask them to vote for any GOP candidate besides Mr. Trump, preferably Mitt Romney or John Kasich. Under the Constitution, the House \u2014 currently under Republican control \u2014 decides the presidency if no candidate reaches the required electoral vote majority. House members choose from the top three contenders. This isn\u2019t the first time electors have faced pressure to undo the results of Election Day . Carole Jean Jordan, a GOP elector from Florida in 2000, recalled the \u201cunbelievably ugly\u201d aftermath of the recount battle between George W. Bush and then-vice president Al Gore, a dispute that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court leaving Bush\u2019s slim margin intact and handing him the presidency. Jordan said Florida\u2019s electors were inundated with nasty letters from people saying they should not vote for Bush. Police kept watch over her home until the electors convened in Tallahassee to cast their votes. They stayed at the same hotel, guarded by security officers who also escorted them to cast their ballots at the state Capitol. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The Farmington Daily Times ( https://goo.gl/9r4nwG ) reports that terms of the settlement signed Monday by a federal judge are confidential. However, the tribe said it and Urban Outfitters plan to collaborate on American Indian jewelry. Urban Outfitters claimed during the litigation that the tribe knew or should have known the \"Navajo\" name had been used in clothing, jewelry and other merchandise for years and delayed legal action. Court documents didn't quantify the amount the tribe could recover if it won the lawsuit, but a ruling in the case said a federal law allowed a minimum $1,000 a day for each type of good sold or on display for sale. 0 Shares ",

Same-sex marriage In 2004 and 2006, Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, voted in favor of advancing the failed Federal Marriage Amendment , which would have amended the Constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman. When same-sex marriage finally became the law of the land in 2015, after the 5-4 Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision, Sessions did not hold back his displeasure. \"I think what this court did was unconstitutional. I don't think they had the power to do what they did. There's nothing in the Constitution that requires such a result, no mention of marriage in the Constitution,\" Sessions told WKRG in Mobile, Alabama, shortly after the Supreme Court decision. Hate crimes and discrimination Same-sex marriage is not the only pro-LGBTQ legislation Sessions has opposed. He voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which expanded federal hate-crimes law to include bias-motivated violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity. He also voted against the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in 2010, and in 2013 he declined to vote in favor of the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would have protected LGBTQ employees from workplace discrimination. One bill he does favor is the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which was introduced last year. Many believe the so-called \"religious liberty\" bill, of which Sessions is a co-sponsor, would open the door to anti-LGBTQ discrimination . FADA seeks to prohibit the federal government from \"taking discriminatory action\" against a person who believes \"in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.\" Sessions' track record on LGBTQ issues has consistently earned him low marks from the Human Rights Campaign. The group gave him a zero on its Congressional scorecard and gave him a spot on its \" Hall of Shame \" in 2014, which included just 19 members of Congress. Brooke Sopelsa ",

His opponent was President-elect Donald Trump , who had taken umbrage at how his vice president-elect had been\u00a0treated the previous night at the hit Broadway musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d Trump and Burr then squared off and opened fire on the business mogul\u2019s dueling ground of choice: Twitter. \u201cHamilton,\u201d which has won 11 Tony awards, depicts the life of Alexander Hamilton and Burr, early American leaders and onetime friends. Their lives intersected a final time during a duel in 1804 that pitted Burr, a sitting vice president, against Hamilton, a former Treasury secretary. Flash-forward to Friday night: Vice President-elect Mike\u00a0Pence was taking his seat at the Richard Rodgers Theatre\u00a0to see the critically acclaimed smash hit, which is sold out until August, when the audience showered him\u00a0with\u00a0cheers and loud jeers.\u00a0 After the show, actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Burr, took the highly unusual step of standing on stage with\u00a0the entire cast behind him\u00a0 to deliver a lecture to the vice president-elect on \u201cAmerican values.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cWe truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.\" Pence left the auditorium before Dixon had finished his soliloquy, but reportedly heard all of the remarks over speakers in the hallway. Though Pence did not make an issue of the audience\u2019s boos or Dixon\u2019s spiel, Trump was having none of it, clearly upset that the honor of his vice president-elect had been besmirched. Saturday morning,\u00a0Trump chastised the show\u2019s cast on Twitter and demanded an apology. \u201cOur wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d Trump is not usually one to demand \u201csafe spaces\u201d \u2014\u00a0something Republicans in his mold\u00a0typically mock as a byproduct of political correctness run amok. \u00a0 Dixon wasted little time firing back at Trump, Tweeting that \u201cconversation is not harassment sir,\u201d before adding that he appreciated Pence for showing up. The dispute \u2014\u00a0 and videos of Dixon\u2019s speech \u2014\u00a0spread across social media, sparking the hashtag #boycotthamilton.\u00a0\u201cCompletely inappropriate for the cast of #Hamilton to address Mike Pence like this,\u201d tweeted the GOP Report, which identifies as a \u201cconservative blogger\u00a0helping to unify the USA under Donald Trump, the one person who can end corruption in Washington.\u201d Celebrities were quick to respond, as were\u00a0liberal theatergoers hoping their conservative friends might unload the hard-to-get tickets.\u00a0 \u201cBoycott Hamilton? Good luck with that,\u201d tweeted actor Jeffery Wright (\u201cWestworld\u201d). \u201cTickets are already sold-out past President-elect Troll\u2019s impeachment.\u201d Wright later messaged that Pence probably should have chosen another show to attend: \u201cThis one\u2019s called Hamilton. About an American political leader, outspoken firebrand. Oh & an immigrant.\u201d Actor-comedian Patton Oswalt joked that a boycott of \u201cHamilton\u201d would be greatly appreciated, particularly if it comes at the right time. \u201cYou know what?\u201d tweeted the entertainer. \u201cI support #Boycott Hamilton. I hope it intensifies \u2014 especially that first week of March, maybe that Sunday matinee?\u201d Celebrity trainer Jillian Michaels tweeted, \u201cFor everyone who is going to #Boycott Hamilton, my family, friends and I will fall on the sword and take your tickets #wegotyou.\u201d Wilber reported\u00a0from Washington and Braxton from Los Angeles.

He's seen here speaking Saturday at the APEC CEO Summit, part of the broader Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Lima. Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says his company is responding to sharp criticisms over fake stories appearing in its news feeds. He's seen here speaking Saturday at the APEC CEO Summit, part of the broader Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Lima. Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images Facebook could start labeling stories that might be false, company founder Mark Zuckerberg says, laying out options for how the site handles what he calls \"misinformation.\" Other ideas include automatic detection of potentially false stories and easier flagging by users. \"While the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a posting to his Facebook profile last night. Zuckerberg outlined seven projects his company is working on that could undermine fake news stories. The approaches range from consulting with journalists and fact-checking organizations to disrupting the flow of money in the often-lucrative online fake news business. \"We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed,\" Zuckerberg wrote of one initiative. Of another, he said, \"A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.\" The idea of using software to classify misinformation is sure to generate discussion. Zuckerberg says it would bring \"better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.\" He didn't specify what the effects of that determination might be \u2014 whether it would mean the removal of the content from certain news feeds or from the site altogether. Article continues after sponsorship Several of the highest-rated comments on Zuckerberg's post were positive, with this idea from George Papa ranking near the top: \"If people had a bit of brain and did some research on their own when they read something that does not sound right...we would not have this problem.\" Together, the projects signal another step in Facebook's evolution from its start as a tech-oriented company to its current status as a complex media platform. The company has come under criticism that its news feeds and ad payment systems are too welcoming of fake news, particularly after a contentious presidential campaign season that culminated in last week's upset win by Donald Trump. Trump's Nov. 8 election left many pollsters and pundits mystified. It also prompted social media users to complain that Facebook and other sites had kept people in bubbles of like-minded opinion; some also said that fake news had influenced the vote. Days after the election, Zuckerberg sought to allay those complaints, saying that fake news makes up a \"very small volume\" of the content on Facebook, as NPR's Aarti Shahani reported. And he said hoaxes existed long before his site went online. \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news,\" Zuckerberg said last week. As Aarti reported Thursday , Facebook has long relied on users to flag suspicious or offensive stories \u2014 and it relies on subcontractors in the Philippines, Poland, and elsewhere to make quick yes-no rulings on those cases, often within 10 seconds. With last night's announcement, Zuckerberg gave a glimpse of how Facebook is wading into an area that's often fraught with controversy: verifying or censoring content. \"The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,\" he wrote. \"Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information.\" Here's the list of steps Zuckerberg laid out (here we're quoting his post): \"- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. \"- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. \"- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. \"- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. \"- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. \"- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. \"- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.\" Several items on the list hint at how daunting the task of silencing fake news may be. Exclusive breaking news stories, for instance, could have trouble getting the green light from either an algorithm or an independent fact-checker; and both the reporting and warning features could become new tools in advocates' fights to push their own views \u2014 and reinforce the bubbles that have prompted Facebook users' complaints. Zuckerberg has spoken about the difficulty of bursting those bubbles in the past. As Aarti reported last week, \"The problem, he says, is that people don't click on things that don't conform to their worldview. And, he says, 'I don't know what to do about that.' \" ",

    "text": "World Leaders at APEC Summit Take Aim at Trump Over Trade By joshua goodman and ben fox, associated press LIMA, Peru \u0097 Nov 19, 2016, 5:38 PM ET 0 Shares Email Several U.S. allies took aim at Donald Trump's views on global trade, while China's president made an impassioned call against the sort of protectionism favored by the president-elect at a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders on Saturday The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is taking place in Peru as world leaders are on edge over Trump's campaign pledges to protect U.S. jobs by backing out of the not-yet-implemented Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said NAFTA benefits workers and companies on both sides of the border. Still, he expressed concern that the U.S. could be turning its back on a bilateral trade relationship responsible for moving $1 million worth of goods every minute. \"In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,\" Pena Nieto told business leaders. \"Mexico, like the entire world, is about to initiate a new stage with the U.S. and in commercial terms we want to give the right value to this strategic relationship between Mexico and the U.S.\" New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key spoke more bluntly, saying the \"tremendous despair\" triggered by Trump's trade views can't be allowed to slow down economic integration by the rest of the world. \"Even if the United States doesn't want to engage in free trade, President Trump needs to know other countries do,\" said Key. He said it's still possible to save the 12-nation TPP negotiated by the Obama administration by introducing cosmetic changes making it acceptable to Trump or carving out a less ambitious pact among TPP signatories that leaves out the U.S. \"I personally think that President Trump will be very much like chairman of the corporation Trump is,\" he said. \"He's a flexible business guy. He's going to realize he has a role to play.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered perhaps the most-forceful defense of free trade, given the size of his economy. In his kickoff speech from Peru he said the best response to rising protectionism would be for APEC's 21 members to negotiate a free trade area encompassing the entire Pacific Rim. \"Closed and inclusive arrangements are not the right choice,\" Xi said, taking a veiled stab at the TPP, which excludes China and is widely seen as an attempt to reassert U.S. dominance in Asia. \"Building a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for long-term prosperity.\" Xi's remarks came as Chinese state media blasted Trump for \"trade-bashing\" rhetoric that threatens global economic stability. \"The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,\" official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary piece published Saturday. President Barack Obama warned against a rush to judgment on Trump, saying at a town hall on the margins of the summit that it's too early to conclude that the new administration will wipe out trade deals and create international problems. \"Don't just assume the worst,\" he said. \"Wait until the administration's in place\" before drawing conclusions. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Franklin Briceno and Paul Traynor contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Afterward, both men exited the clubhouse and shook hands for the cameras. \u201cWent great,\u201d Mr. Trump said, cupping his hands at his mouth to project his voice. Mr. Romney then briefly addressed reporters, declining to say whether he was interested in a cabinet position. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe had a far-reaching conversation with regard to the various theaters of the world with interest to the United States of real significance,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cWe discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics. A very thorough and in-depth discussion over the time we had. I appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and look forward to the coming administration.\u201d Mr. Romney did not answer reporters\u2019 questions about whether he had apologized to Mr. Trump for his criticism of him during the campaign. Photo Reporters on Friday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., where the president-elect was spending the weekend. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Among the others who sat down with Mr. Trump were Michelle A. Rhee, a Democrat who served as the chancellor of public schools in the District of Columbia from 2007 to 2010, and Robert L. Woodson, an African-American conservative who works on community-based anti-poverty programs. Mr. Trump also met with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general who headed United States Central Command and is being considered for the post of defense secretary. The president-elect strongly praised General Mattis, who was an assertive presence on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, after talking with him for about an hour. \u201cAll I can say is he is the real deal \u2014 the real deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Asked whether General Mattis would join the administration, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s just a brilliant, wonderful man. What a career \u2014 we are going to see what happens, but he is the real deal.\u201d On Sunday, the president-elect is scheduled to meet with a similarly wide-ranging group, including Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whom he removed as the chairman of his transition team days after the election; Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has also been a contender for the secretary of state post; and Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, who has pressed aggressive measures to crack down on undocumented immigrants. The meeting schedule, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said on Saturday, \u201creally shows the reach and the depth to which we are going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAs we\u2019re working to bring the country together and move forward,\u201d Mr. Miller added in a conference call with reporters, \u201cthis shows really where his head is as the next leader of our country.\u201d On Friday, Mr. Trump moved to install Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general bent on destroying Islamic extremism, as his national security adviser, and he selected Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an immigration hard-liner, as his attorney general. Both were early supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Photo James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, after meeting with Mr. Trump on Saturday.

Earlier this year, he said that if Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, \u201cthe prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,\u201d and he suggested that Mr. Trump was dangerous and unstable. He deplored Mr. Trump\u2019s personal qualities: \u201cthe bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics.\u201d But if he took a cabinet post, Mr. Romney could serve as a moderating influence on the hard-liners Mr. Trump has already selected, including Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas as C.I.A. director and Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist. It could also force Mr. Romney to defend administration policies he did not believe in. John Feehery, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Trump was showing \u201cgreat magnanimity\u201d by talking to Mr. Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 nominee and a former governor of Massachusetts. \u201cI think it is meant to reassure some of the establishment that he is going to reach out to them, and that\u2019s an important part of healing the party.\u201d First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

But no, the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d had to demonstrate they were self-centered left-wingers without courtesy or discretion when they stepped forward after a Friday night performance to have one of their number directly address Vice-President Elect Mike Pence, who had attended the show. It was ironic that that Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor portraying Vice President Aaron Burr, who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, delivered the rebuke. Burr was later suspected of having conspired to traitorously divide the western states and territories from the nascent United States. \u201cWe, sir,\u201d Mr. Dixon said, \u201cwe are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.\u00a0 We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\u201d It is a measure of Mike Pence\u2019s basic decency that after being booed by a few self-righteous New Yorkers in the audience, who probably don\u2019t know anyone who voted for Trump except maybe their doorman, that Mr. Pence stayed, patiently listened to Mr. Dixon\u2019s supercilious lecture, and then gently took his leave. Imagine if Mr. Dixon has not displayed such anger at the election but instead found just a few ounces of grace and delivered something along these lines. \u201cWe, sir, are the part of the diverse nation that is America. With the election now past, we all hope for your administration\u2019s success in defending our planet, our children, and the inalienable rights of every American. We are grateful you came and hope this show inspires you as you work on behalf of all the people of our common country.\u201d Mr. Dixon would have made his point but without being condescending or rude. It is a measure of Mike Pence\u2019s basic decency that after being booed by a few self-righteous New Yorkers in the audience, who probably don\u2019t know anyone who voted for Trump except maybe their doorman, that Mr. Pence stayed, patiently listened to Mr. Dixon\u2019s supercilious lecture, and then gently took his leave.

The rocket is scheduled to launch at 5:42 p.m., on Saturday. (Malcolm Denemark / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The most advanced weather satellite ever built rocketed into space Saturday night, part of an $11 billion effort to revolutionize forecasting and save lives. This new GOES-R spacecraft will track U.S. weather as never before: hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, lightning storms, even solar flares. Indeed, about 50 TV meteorologists from around the country converged on the launch site \u2014 including NBC's Al Roker \u2014 along with 8,000 space program workers and guests. \"What's so exciting is that we're going to be getting more data, more often, much more detailed, higher resolution,\" Roker said. In the case of tornadoes, \"if we can give people another 10, 15, 20 minutes, we're talking about lives being saved.\" Think superhero speed and accuracy for forecasting. Super high-definition TV, versus black-and-white. \"Really a quantum leap above any satellite NOAA has ever flown,\" said Stephen Volz, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's director of satellites. \"For the American public, that will mean faster, more accurate weather forecasts and warnings,\" Volz said earlier in the week. \"That also will mean more lives saved and better environmental intelligence\" for government officials responsible for hurricane and other evacuations.

Improved forecasting will help pilots avoid bad weather and help rocket scientists know when to call off a launch. The first in a series of four high-tech satellites, GOES-R hitched a ride on an unmanned Atlas V rocket, delayed an hour by rocket and other problems. NOAA teamed up with NASA for the mission. The satellite \u2014 valued by NOAA at $1 billion \u2014 is aiming for a 22,300-mile-high equatorial orbit. There, it will join three aging spacecraft with 40-year-old technology, and become known as GOES-16. After months of testing, this newest satellite will take over for one of the older ones. The second satellite in the series will follow in 2018. All told, the series should stretch to 2036. GOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The first was launched in 1975. GOES-R's premier imager \u2014 one of six science instruments \u2014 will offer three times as many channels as the existing system, four times the resolution and five times the scan speed, said NOAA program director Greg Mandt. A similar imager is also flying on a Japanese weather satellite. ",

Danny Davis, D-Ill. announces that he will run for re-election to this 7th congressional seat in Chicago. \u00a0(AP) A dispute over shoes led to the fatal shooting of the grandson of Illinois U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, Chicago police said Saturday. At least two attackers went to the home of 15-year-old Jovan Wilson in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago on Friday night and shot him in the head after an argument, police said. \"This stems from a dispute over shoes, basketball shoes,\" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Guglielmi said Wilson knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point. The shooting was not, as previously reported, a home invasion. \"Young people are using guns to settle petty disputes over clothes,\" Guglielmi said. Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides, with August being the deadliest month in the city in two decades. There have been 673 homicides so far this year, including the fatal shootings of the cousin of Chicago Bull Dwyane Wade, a Chicago police officer's son and the son of a famed percussionist. Davis said in a statement that Wilson's mother was not at home, but Wilson's uncle and three siblings were. \"I grieve for my family. I grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger,\" Davis said in a statement. \"I grieve for his family, his parents, his friends.\" Police have not arrested anyone or named any suspects, but Guglielmi said investigators have good leads. Davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th Congressional District and is a former Chicago alderman, was in Chicago on Friday and spoke with reporters after talking to police. He wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he'd continue to try to combat gun violence. Davis described his grandson to the newspaper as a \"typical 15-year-old\" who liked music and basketball, someone who \"knew all about ... the stats of different players.\" But Davis also said he recognized that Chicago's violence problem could affect his family.

Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful) On Friday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended a performance of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d triggering\u00a0a firestorm. First, Pence was greeted by both cheers and boos upon his arrival at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York. After the show, the famously diverse cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d paused during its curtain call to deliver a message to Pence. \u201cWe, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,\u201d said\u00a0Brandon Victor Dixen, the actor who portrays Aaron Burr, to raucous applause. \u201cBut we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations.\u201d [ Trump demands apology from \ufffd?Hamilton\u2019 after cast\u2019s message to Pence ] Pence reportedly left the auditorium before Dixon finished speaking, but a show spokesman told the Associated Press that the vice president-elect stood in the hallway and heard the full message. Social media accounts for \u201cHamilton\u201d posted the address online shortly after the end of the show, and videos of Dixon\u2019s speech soon went viral, getting shared tens of thousands of times.

The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 The responses were, well, nonstop. Some\u00a0cheered the cast for voicing their concerns so directly. Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) responded to Trump and said \u201cthe reality is that LGBTQ people, people of color, women and others have faced harassment since the election.\u201d That isn't harassment. The reality is that LGBTQ people, people of color, women and others have faced harassment since the election. \u2014 Sarah Kate Ellis (@sarahkateellis) November 19, 2016 The American Civil Liberties Union, which has been on high alert since Trump won the presidency last week , also chimed in on Twitter , saying Americans did not need to apologize \u2014 \u201cnot even to presidents or vice presidents\u201d \u2014 when lawfully exercising their constitutional rights. Americans don't need to apologize-not even to presidents or vice presidents-for the lawful & proper exercise of their constitutional rights. https://t.co/daN147yjkM \u2014 ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016 \u201cPresident-elect Trump needs a refresher on his high school civics class,\u201d ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero told The Washington Post in an email. \u201c\u2026 The First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy, and Democratic and Republican presidents alike have understood that freedom of speech makes our country stronger \u2014 even if it sometimes make our leaders uncomfortable. The apology should instead come from\u00a0President-elect Trump for calling into question the appropriateness of the Hamilton cast\u2019s statements.\u201d [ Why Trump gets theater completely and utterly wrong ] Still others found the incident \u201crude\u201d and argued that the theater was not an appropriate place \u2014 the modern-day equivalent of crying out, \u201c For shame! \u201d (Peter Marks, theater critic for The Post, offered his take \u00a0on that argument.) Many of Trump\u2019s top supporters \u2014 including a press aide, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \u2014 joined the chorus of those who derided the cast\u2019s speech.

The irony of the #BoycottHamilton movement is that it's mostly folks who already boycott both hip-hop and knowledge of history. \u2014 John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) November 19, 2016 I love that #BoycottHamilton is trending as if that show hasn't been sold out for more than a year.

Three crew members and a patient were killed in the Friday night crash in Elko, American Medflight said Saturday in a statement. Elko police Lt. Rich Genseal said the twin-engine plane apparently \"experienced mechanical problems\" as it was climbing after taking off on a flight for Salt Lake City, then lost altitude and crashed, the Elko Daily Free Press reported. Flames rise from the wreckage of an American Medflight plane, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, after it crashed in Elko, Nev., on Friday, Nov. 18, 2016. Toni R. Milano / The Daily Free Press via AP The identities of the victims were not released by authorities, but Debbi and Jim Urresti of Elko, said their 29-year-old daughter, Tiffany, was killed in the crash. The twin-engine plane crashed in a mining company's parking lot near a casino and other businesses near Elko Regional Airport and Interstate 80. American Medflight, which is based in Reno, Nevada, did not immediately respond to email and telephone requests for comment. But President John Burruel said in a statement that the company was cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration as they investigated the crash. \"As an air medical family, we are mourning the loss of our crewmembers and patient. Their families have been notified, and they are in our thoughts and prayers,\" Burruel said. Tiffany Urresti's parents said she was a former hospital ER nurse who dreamed for years of working as a flight nurse. Urresti achieved her dream, starting work for American Medflight two months ago, and she was engaged to be married in May, Debibi Urresti said. \"She found the love of her life.\" Local authorities did not immediately respond to email and phone requests for comment, but Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said nobody on the ground was hurt. \"There was not a lot left of the aircraft,\" Elko Fire Chief Matt Griego said after the flames were extinguished. A photograph published by the Elko Daily Free Press showed mostly burned wreckage on pavement in front of a line of vehicles, including at least one charred pickup. The plane's tail was one of the few recognizable parts. The wreckage of an American Medflight plane sits in the Barrick Gold Corp. parking lot  in Elko, Nev., Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. Jeffry Mullins / The Daily Free Press via AP Hillary Walker, a manager at a grocery store about 200 yards from the crash, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that the crash caused parked vehicles to catch fire and then dozens of rounds of ammunition to go off. Walker noted that said a number of vehicles in the parking lot for mine workers likely had ammunition in them. \"It's hunting season out here,\" she said. Dr. Rodney Badger of Northeastern Nevada Cardiology told the Daily Free Press that the plane had just taken off from the nearby airport to transport a patient to the University of Utah Medical Center. Badger said his patient suffered from coronary artery disease and was experiencing chest pains and rapid heartbeat around 5:30 p.m., after which the decision was made to transport him to Utah.

(KOVR-TV) The father of an Army soldier killed in Afghanistan says he and his family were booed as they flew to meet his son\u2019s body coming home. Sgt. John Perry, 30, was killed in a suicide attack at Bagram Airfield on Saturday, along with Pfc. Tyler Iubelt and two American contractors. Stewart Perry told\u00a0 KOVR-TV \u00a0his son stopped the suicide bomber short of his target and may have saved hundreds of lives. Perry told the\u00a0 Army Times \u00a0the booing took place on an American Airlines flight that landed in Phoenix Monday. Perry and his family were flying from Sacramento to Dover Air Force Base. The captain told everyone to remain seated to let the Perry family leave first to make their connection. Expand / Contract U.S. Army Sgt. John W. Perry of Stockton, Calif. (AP Photo/Department of Defense)) \u201cWhen he made that announcement, there was some hissing and some booiing behind us,\u201d Perry told the Army Times. Perry, a Marine veteran, doesn\u2019t remember the captain telling everyone the reason they had to stay seated. He recalled the captain mentioned \u201cmilitary personnel.\u201d But he said he believes the passengers knew there was a Gold Star family on board. \u201cThe woman sitting directly behind us touched me on the shoulder and asked if I was the father of the soldier killed in Afghanistan,\u201d he told the Army Times.\u00a0 However, Perry told\u00a0 The Stockton Record \u00a0that he didn\u2019t know if the passengers knew there was a Gold Star family on board. He did say the captain told passengers a\u00a0\u201cspecial military family\u201d had to leave first. Perry added, \u201cIt was just disgusting behavior from people in first class. It was terrible to see.\u201d 4 AMERICANS KILLED IN SUICIDE BOMBING AT US BASE IN AFGHANISTAN Perry said the pilot of the plane that would take them east made sure he and his family made the connection. \u201cTo hear the reaction of the flight being delayed because of a Gold Star family, and the first class cabin booing that was really upsetting, and it made us cry some more,\u201d he told KOVR.

Gerry Broome/AP hide caption toggle caption Gerry Broome/AP Democratic challenger Roy Cooper has a lead of more than 6,000 votes over Gov. Pat McCrory. He's seen here with his wife, Kristin, at an election night rally in Raleigh. Gerry Broome/AP More than a week after initial returns showed him narrowly beating Gov. Pat McCrory, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper has added to his lead, while several counties have rejected Republicans' complaints and calls for a recount. The final tally is ongoing. Cooper, a Democrat, leads the Republican incumbent by 6,600 votes \u2014 2,288,867 to 2,282,267 \u2014 with both candidates hovering just below the 49 percent mark, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections . Libertarian Lon Cecil captured 101,574 votes, for just over 2 percent. The elections board in Durham County rejected McCrory's call for a hand recount of 94,000 early ballots, and two other counties rejected complaints that included an allegation that computer issues had created improper voting conditions, member station WFAE reports . WFAE spoke to reporter Jeff Tiberii (of another member station, WUNC), who said, \"We should note that all local boards across the state are comprised of two Republicans and one Democrat.\" Before a winner is declared, more counties will have to certify their final tallies \u2014 and roughly half of North Carolina's 100 counties are also contending with election complaints registered by Republicans. Article continues after sponsorship For now, the race has the same status it gained on Nov. 8: too close to call. But citing Cooper's lead, Marc Elias, an election specialist for the Democratic challenger, tells the Raleigh News Observe r that Cooper will likely lead the state. While Cooper's lead has grown since election night, the tally has fluctuated, and it may not surpass the 10,000-vote threshold that would prevent McCrory from calling for a recount, Elias tells the newspaper. Voter turnout was relatively strong in North Carolina, where Donald Trump edged Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Before midnight on Election Day, the state election board reported more people had voted in 2016 than in 2012. North Carolina has been in national headlines this year for its controversial HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms. The law prompted businesses, sports groups and celebrities to boycott the state; McCrory dropped a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice in September, \"after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state.\" Now voters are awaiting word on who won the governor's race. As WUNC's Tiberii reports : \"Meanwhile, nearly 60,000 provisional ballots are being considered and thrown out or counted by local election boards. These ballots are cast when there are questions about voter eligibility. Political scientists say about half of all provisional ballots are thrown out and those counted tend to lean Democratic or mirror the general election outcome.\" \"This has been a hard-fought race,\" Cooper said on election night. \"But the people of North Carolina have spoken, and they want a change in leadership.\" He concluded that speech by saying that he was \"confident these results will be certified, and that they will confirm victory.\" But at nearly the same time, McCrory told supporters, \"The process is continuing right here in North Carolina; the election is not over in North Carolina.\" ",

James Mattis eyed as Trump's possible pick for defense secretary Published               November 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 In a sign that Donald Trump was zeroing in on his choice for defense secretary Saturday, a senior transition team official told Fox News the retired Marine Gen. James Mattis was a \"very strong candidate\" for a Cabinet post. TRUMP, ROMNEY MEET FOR 'FAR-REACHING CONVERSATION' AFTER LOBBING SHOTS DURING CAMPAIGN The retired general was one of several people who met with Trump in New Jersey during the day on Saturday.\u00a0Trump wouldn't say whether he was offering Mattis a job, saying \"we'll see.\" But as they posed for cameras before sitting down for their meeting, Trump pointed to Mattis and called him \"a great man.\" Earlier, an official with the transition team confirmed the retired general was under consideration to lead the Pentagon. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 If nominated and approved,\u00a0Mattis would be the highest-ranking officer to become defense secretary in more than half a century. When asked about a rule prohibiting those who served in active duty within the past seven years, the senior official told Fox News, \"There are waivers around that.\" Known as \"Mad Dog Mattis,\" the retired general was credited with a string of colorful quotes over the years, including: \"Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\"\u00a0 Also:\u00a0\"You are part of the world's most feared and trusted force. Engage your brain before you engage your weapon.\" The president-elect also was considering retired Army Gen. David Petraeus to serve as defense secretary, The Wall Street Journal reported .\u00a0 Trump is said to have a strong interest in having a former general run the Pentagon, with the interest in Mattis coming after retired Army General Jack Keane, citing personal reasons, withdrew his name from consideration. The Trump team is also weighing options for pairing the general with a CEO-like figure as deputy secretary, an individual who could bring needed reform to the Pentagon's spending and management systems. Trump also met with Mitt Romney and Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, among others, at the billionaire's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., during the day on Saturday. Trump signaled a sharp rightward shift in U.S. national security policy Friday with his announcement that he would nominate Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism. Sessions and Flynn were ardent Trump supporters during the campaign, and their promotions were seen in part as a reward for their loyalty. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for \"ending our interrogation program\" and said intelligence officials \"are not torturers, they are patriots.\" Fox News' Serafin Gomez, Doug McKelway, John Roberts, James Rosen and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Danny Davis speaks to the media on Nov. 19, 2016, about his 15-year-old grandson, Jovan Wilson, who was shot and killed during a home invasion in Chicago.</p> Close Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images CHICAGO -- The grandson of Illinois U.S. Rep. Danny Davis was fatally shot in a home invasion in Chicago, the Democratic congressman and police said. Jovan Wilson, 15, died Friday night at the scene in the Englewood neighborhood on the city\u2019s South Side, CBS Chicago reports . Davis said in a statement that a 17-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy forced their way into the home and after an argument the 15-year-old shot Wilson in the head. Davis said Wilson\u2019s mother was not at home, but Wilson\u2019s uncle and three siblings were. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune Saturday that it was not a random incident, and that Wilson and the two people being sought had a history. Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides, with August being the deadliest month in the city in two decades. There have been more than 600 homicides this year, including the fatal shootings of the cousin of Chicago Bull Dwyane Wade, a Chicago police officer\u2019s son and the son of a famed percussionist. Davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th Congressional District and is a former Chicago alderman, was in Chicago on Friday and spoke with reporters after talking to police. He wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he\u2019d continue to try to combat gun violence. \u201cI do know that I grieve for my family. I grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger,\u201d he said. Davis described his grandson to the newspaper as a \u201ctypical 15-year-old\u201d who liked music and basketball, someone who \u201cknew all about ... the stats of different players.\u201d But Davis also said he recognized that Chicago\u2019s violence problem could affect his family. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "By David Weigel November 19 at 5:54 PM Follow daveweigel Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, visits Trump Tower in New York on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute and popularizer of the term \u201calt-right,\u201d told reporters in Washington on Saturday that Donald Trump could achieve some of the white nationalist movement\u2019s goals by making Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) his attorney general. \u201cJeff Sessions is someone who is not alt-right but seems to see eye-to-eye with us on the immigration question,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe fact that he is going to be at such a high level is a wonderful thing. What Jeff Sessions is not going to do, in terms of not prosecuting federal diversity and fair housing, I think is just as powerful as what he might do.\u201d Sessions, who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after the Senate heard testimony about his criticism of the NAACP, has been a resilient foe of the Obama administration\u2019s housing and legal priorities. He led a group of Republicans opposing the\u00a0Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing plan, which encouraged more development of public housing and transportation in cities. At his 1986 hearing, he admitted calling the Voting Rights Act \u201cintrusive legislation,\u201d and since the 2013\u00a0Shelby County v. Holder decision he has dismissed calls for a restoration of the act\u2019s pre-clearance provision. [ Trump signals intent to keep hard-line promises with choices for senior national security posts ] Spencer made the remarks at an afternoon news\u00a0conference in a ballroom of the Ronald Reagan Building, where NPI had gathered more than\u00a0100\u00a0activists for a postelection conference. The \u201cask anything\u201d presser began with a request for journalists not to photograph attendees without express permission, and for the news media to stand up when alt-right figures were harassed by protesters or banned from social media. \u201cTwitter has much more power than any government on earth,\u201d Spencer said. Over the next hour, journalists sat in front of Spencer and other alt-right figures to ask questions. The conference attendees sat behind them, jeering the names of outlets such as NPR and Mother Jones. One attendee could be heard shouting \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse\"\u00a0(\"lying press\"), a German insult inspired by the Nazis, as one reporter repeatedly asked if \u201calt-right\u201d was just a way to rebrand racism. \u201cTrump was called a racist for the entire campaign, and it didn\u2019t have an effect,\u201d said Kevin B. MacDonald, a California academic widely read on the alt-right. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the big pluses here.\u201d \u201cWhen Glenn Beck is crying and calling you a racist, it\u2019s kind of fun,\u201d Spencer said. Spencer said the alt-right had been a \u201chead without a body\u201d before the Trump campaign, and the campaign arrived as a \u201cbody without a head.\u201d Spencer promised that the alt-right would propose six policy ideas for the Trump administration in coming months, and the first was a 50-year moratorium on immigration, with white Europeans as the only group allowed to attain new citizenship. Pressed by reporters, Spencer could name only a few allies in Congress \u2014 such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) -- who might get on board with such a major policy shift. More promising, in the short term, were Trump selections such as Sessions and, as chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, of the\u00a0far-right website\u00a0Breitbart News. \u201cBreitbart didn\u2019t get sucked into the drain of Never Trumpism and saw the promise of populism,\u201d Spencer said. politics ",

By Peter Marks November 19 at 12:07 PM Follow @petermarksdrama The cast of \"Hamilton\" delivered a message to Vice President-elect Mike Pence from stage after he watched the show at Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful) \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 I\u2019m not sure what kind of \u201csafe and special\u201d theater\u00a0the president-elect is alluding to in his tweet on Saturday, following the imbroglio involving Vice President-elect Mike Pence at the Friday night performance of Broadway\u2019s \u201cHamilton.\u201d Maybe by \u201csafe and special\u201d he means the theater is supposed to be docile,\u00a0an innocuous\u00a0landscape filled exclusively with chorus girls and holiday pageants. But let\u2019s be clear:\u00a0\u201cSafe\u201d theater is dead theater. Conflict is what drives drama, and sometimes, emotions in that public space become intense and things get messy. Some of that exuberance spilled over into the peanut galleries Friday night: As he returned to his orchestra seat after intermission, Pence was greeted with applause \u2014 and boos. Broadway protocol would dictate that\u00a0an incoming vice president go backstage after a performance and greet the cast. In this case, though, Pence reportedly was being ushered out of the theater as Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor portraying Aaron Burr in the acclaimed musical about the life of Alexander Hamilton, began his curtain-call remarks. According to media reports, Pence stood just outside the auditorium door, listening to the full speech. It is rare indeed for a company of actors\u00a0\u2014 and especially those in what amounts to one of the biggest hits in Broadway history\u00a0\u2014 to address a single public official at the end of a performance. [ Trump demands apology from \u2018Hamilton\u2019 after cast\u2019s message to Pence. ] \u201cThank you so much for joining us tonight,\u201d\u00a0Dixon said, on behalf of the production. \u201cYou know, we had a guest in the audience this evening. And Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments. There\u2019s nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There\u2019s nothing to boo here. We\u2019re all here, sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir, and we hope that you will hear us out. And I encourage everybody to pull out your phones and tweet and post, because this message needs to be spread far and wide, okay? Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us at \u2018Hamilton: An American Musical.\u2019 We really do.\u00a0We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir.\u00a0But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of all\u00a0of us. All of us.\u00a0Again, we truly thank you for sharing this show, this wonderful American story, told by a diverse group of men, women, of different colors, creeds and orientations.\u201d Some observers on social media see Trump\u2019s tweet as an attempt to grab hold of a minor\u00a0culture-war\u00a0issue and deflect attention from objections being lodged against several of his initial appointments. Indeed, he seems to be trying to make the case here that it\u2019s not the incoming administration that poses the greatest threat; it\u2019s the dissenters who are threatening him. Still, the\u00a0challenging words by the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast and the contretemps surrounding them portend a contentious\u00a0relationship between the Republican-led government and an arts community that may be preparing to take it on publicly. In the context of\u00a0a musical about a revolution, the events of Friday night look like life imitating art. \u00a0 ",

Musician Adam Yauch attends a special evening to honor artist Ross Bleckner's appointment as Goodwill Ambassador with a special exhibition 'Welcome To Gulu' at the United Nations on Tuesday, May 12, 2009 in New York. (Evan Agostini / Associated Press) A Brooklyn playground named for the late Beastie Boys' star Adam Yauch had been vandalized with swastikas and the words \"Go Trump!\" Photos show the swastika and words were spray-painted on playground equipment in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. The city named the park for the late rapper, who was Jewish, in 2013. He died of cancer in 2012 at the age of 47. New York City Councilman Brad Lander said police were investigating and a Parks Department spokesman said Saturday the graffiti was removed. It was one of several recent instances of the Nazi symbol being found around New York and in other parts of the country. The playground includes basketball courts, a community garden, a greenhouse, fitness area, an open play space, drinking fountains and a dog run.

(Photo: WZZM-TV) HART, Mich. \u2014 A pile of dead deer left on state land near a Michigan home was roadkill left there by a county employee, officials say. When she discovered the pile of eight decomposing deer about 200 yards from her house in Weare Township, Tami Smith says she at first wasn\u2019t able to get an explanation from the state Department of Natural Resources or the Oceana County Road Commission. But after an article and picture were published by the Oceana County Press, she says an apologetic person at the Road Commission called to say a new employee left the deer there by mistake and the carcasses were removed. \u201cThe deer are gone and that's the only thing I wanted,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI don't want any of the coyotes or the creepy crawlies that would have drawn. Or the smell and stench. \"I\u2019m a happy girl.\u201d Smith says the area where the deer were left is a former dumping ground in Weare Township, but she says a representative from the Road Commission told her their policy is to only leave one carcass at a time, and farther away from the road.

(Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images) James Rufus Koren Contact Reporter A federal regulator has tightened restrictions on Wells Fargo & Co., requiring it to get approval to replace or hire new executives and make other changes, in the latest fallout over the San Francisco bank\u2019s fake-accounts scandal. Late Friday, the\u00a0Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the regulators that reached a $185 million settlement with the bank over the creation of unauthorized customer accounts, issued a brief statement saying it was revoking some of the terms of that Sept. 8 deal. Specifically, the OCC said it was canceling parts that had shielded Wells Fargo from some oversight usually reserved for troubled banks. The OCC did not issue a statement explaining the cancellation, but Wade Francis, a former OCC bank examiner, said the move amounts to a regulatory vote of no-confidence in the bank\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis is the OCC saying, \u2018We don\u2019t trust you to run your business,\u2019 \u201d said Francis, president of Long Beach bank consultancy Unicon Financial Services. \u201cThey\u2019re questioning \u00a0the judgment of management.\u201d Wells Fargo will have to provide the OCC with written notices if it plans to replace board members or bank executives. The changes appear to apply only to Wells Fargo Bank, which has a separate board from corporate parent Wells Fargo & Co. It\u2019s not clear whether the change would have had any impact on Wells Fargo\u2019s appointment of new Chief Executive Timothy Sloan\u00a0last month.\u00a0 The bank will also no longer be entitled to expedited regulatory\u00a0reviews of applications for basic practices, including\u00a0opening or relocating bank branches. The regulatory order further\u00a0prohibits the bank from making so-called golden parachute payments \u2014 compensation paid to executives when they step down or are fired. Such bans are typically imposed only on banks that are troubled or insolvent. \u201cIt\u2019s the OCC saying they don\u2019t trust the bank to be prudent,\u201d Francis said. Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, bank spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said the new order \u201cwill not inhibit our ability to execute our strategy.\u201d For the bank, the new OCC scrutiny could be a comedown after what\u2019s been a hopeful few weeks for Wells Fargo and other financial institutions. Banks and industry analysts expect\u00a0the administration of President-elect Donald Trump to take a lighter regulatory approach, and that\u2019s sent bank shares soaring since Trump\u2019s unexpected victory. Wells Fargo shares\u00a0closed Friday \u2014\u00a0before the OCC\u2019s announcement \u2014 at $52.82, up 16% since election day and well above where shares traded before the bank\u2019s settlement with regulators in September. Still, even if bank regulators back off in the long term, the OCC\u2019s tighter restrictions for now add to a still-growing list of regulatory woes for the lender, which is under investigation by a handful of state and federal agencies. Earlier this month, Wells Fargo confirmed it is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission . That\u2019s on top of other inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice , Department of Labor, congressional committees and state attorneys general. The California Department of Justice is investigating the bank for possible criminal identity theft related to unauthorized accounts. And the bank is also facing a handful of private lawsuits stemming from the bank\u2019s admission that thousands of bank employees opened as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts over the past several years. That includes suits brought by former employees who say they were improperly fired for refusing to engage in fraudulent sales activity and by customers who say they were harmed. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Wells Fargo estimated that its \u201creasonably possible\u201d potential losses from litigation are $1.7 billion, up from $1 billion in litigation risk the bank reported in June. The scandal has started to cut into the bank\u2019s business, too, with fewer customers opening new accounts. Bank executives reported Thursday that Wells Fargo opened about 300,000 new checking accounts last month, down 27% from September and down 44% from October 2015. The number of credit card applications during the month fell even more sharply, declining by 50% compared with October of last year. The bank acknowledged that the decline was the result of \u201ccustomer reaction to the sales practices settlement.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .

The easiest way to forge ahead, many are finding, is to disassociate the man from the policy. \u201cI will do everything I can to help him,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina, who has refused on numerous other occasions to help Mr. Trump, including voting for him or attending the Republican National Convention . Mr. Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill this week that he believed he could work with Mr. Trump on issues like the military budget, which both men support expanding. Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group supported by David and Charles Koch that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help Mitt Romney in 2012, is also cracking the door to Mr. Trump. The group, however, declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the Republican Congress working with the new president,\u201d said Tim Phillips, Americans for Prosperity\u2019s president, citing the prospect of repealing some of President Obama\u2019s energy policies along with the Affordable Care Act. But as with any period of grief, acceptance comes in different ways. Some find catharsis in writing. Others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong. Then there are those who still talk as if they are in mourning: They have good days and bad days. \u201cLife goes on,\u201d said Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor and leading \u201cNever Trump\u201d stalwart, who has written columns about his coming to terms with President-elect Trump. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Any given day, Mr. Kristol said in an interview, he feels a range of competing sentiments. \u201cI\u2019m sort of somewhere between \u2018trust but verify\u2019 and \u2018distrust but verify,\u2019 \u201d he said, using modified versions of Reagan\u2019s famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the Soviets.

And they are already preparing for battles over Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cunleash\u201d coal, oil and gas production \u2014 much of it on public land. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the unknowns and political variables are huge, too. Mr. Trump himself, while promising to push resource extraction, has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations. History also suggests that changing lands policy is not so easy. President George W. Bush, a Republican, tried to change direction with new agency rules, only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions. Automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their blue-collar glory. And the cost of managing federal lands, especially in fighting wildfires \u2014 $2.1 billion last year , a record total, matched by the most acres burned in at least 30 years \u2014 continues to soar, threatening communities even as many of them look for new direction from the White House in how those lands are managed. \u201cWe have a huge and growing inventory of timber in the forests, and they\u2019re going to decompose or burn, and nobody has addressed that,\u201d said Robert H. Nelson, a professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and a former economic analyst for the Interior Department. \u201cThere\u2019s bipartisan consensus that the federal lands system is dysfunctional,\u201d he said. Photo A lumber yard outside Sweet Home, Ore. Logging industry officials said that employment could grow under a Trump administration, but that changes at the federal level would have to be profound to make a difference. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times But the hopes, and the fears, about how that system might now change are boundless. \u201cMy big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in San Juan County and these rural areas,\u201d said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner in southern Utah, where antigovernment feelings run as deep as the slot canyons. \u201cYou just feel like everything has been stifled with regulations.\u201d At the Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group focusing on the Rocky Mountain region, legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready for an onslaught of anti-environmental policy, and we\u2019re arming up to litigate,\u201d said Erik Molvar, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe Trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past 40 years.\u201d In the decades-long struggle for control of America\u2019s public lands, the Obama years were a flush time for conservation groups. The administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the Grand Canyon and blocked new coal leases. Public lands were also adapted for new uses on Mr. Obama\u2019s watch, notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical significance, and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in Nevada. Conservatives who loathed those regulations \u2014 or new uses \u2014 are now hoping Mr. Trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor. Republicans in Congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect wilderness, water quality, endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments. Some conservatives hope Mr. Trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to states, which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals. To see where change may come the quickest, look to the edges of Glacier National Park in Montana, at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. In March, the Obama administration capped a three-decade fight over oil and gas drilling in the area, called the Badger-Two Medicine, by canceling a Louisiana energy company\u2019s lease on 6,000 acres.

A New York federal jury found Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, 30, and his cousin, Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas, 31, guilty on one charge each of conspiracy to smuggle drugs. The jury of seven women and five men heard less than two weeks of testimony and returned their verdict after about six hours of deliberation. The men face a maximum sentence of life in prison. The two Venezuelan citizens were arrested in Haiti in November 2015 a few days before a planned air shipment of cocaine from Venezuela to Honduras, where prosecutors said they contacted a Drug Enforcement Administration informant for help in transporting the drugs to the United States. As reported by the Two-Way , the men were traveling with diplomatic passports, but didn't have diplomatic immunity. Their defense lawyers argued that they were victims of a U.S. government sting operation and that the case against them was based on the testimony of the longtime DEA informant who was also dealing drugs. Article continues after sponsorship In his closing statement , U.S. Attorney Brendan Quigley said, \"The defendants thought they were above the law. They thought they could operate with impunity in Venezuela because of who they were and who they were related to.\" ",

Bannon looks on as Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Denver on Nov. 5. The former Breitbart News chairman has been appointed senior White House counsel in the president-elect\u2019s administration. (Evan Vucci/AP) In the fall of 2015, before Stephen K. Bannon became a trusted adviser to the next president, he launched a daily three-hour radio show that catered to what he called \u201cthose \u2018low-information\u2019 citizens who are mocked and ridiculed by their \u2018betters\u2019 \u2014 the clueless elites.\u201d Bannon welcomed guests whose views, he often said, had been suppressed by the left\u2019s political correctness. He gave regular airtime to Milo Yiannopoulos, who was banned from Twitter after cheering on supporters who barraged \u201cGhostbusters\u201d actor Leslie Jones with racist and sexist tweets. Bannon described an anti-Islamic activist who campaigns against what she calls \u201ccreeping sharia\u201d in the United States as \u201ca voice in the wilderness.\u201d A former Heritage Foundation staffer who had argued that Hispanic immigrants have lower IQs was \u201cone of the smartest brains out there in demographics, demography, this whole issue of immigration,\u201d Bannon said. From his perch as chief of the Breitbart News empire, which produced the satellite radio show, Bannon cemented his role as a champion of the alt-right, an anti-globalism movement that has attracted support from white supremacists and helped power Donald Trump\u2019s populist White House victory. Bannon\u2019s appointment as Trump\u2019s senior White House counselor is an early sign that the incoming president intends to continue promoting the hard-line approach to issues such as immigration and Islam that galvanized nationalist enthusiasm for his candidacy. How Bannon rose from provocateur to Oval Office confidant is the story of a man who, like Trump, now rages against the system from which he benefited for years. Bannon and Trump participate in a roundtable with the Republican Leadership Initiative at Trump Tower in New York in August. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) As a graduate of Harvard Business School, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker and a Hollywood movie producer, Bannon is in many ways an example of the bicoastal elite that he now disdains. Although Bannon and those close to him have said he is not racist, he has nonetheless shown a willingness to accommodate \u201cfringe organizations,\u201d as he described the extremists attracted to populism in a 2014 address unearthed by BuzzFeed . Eventually, those elements would fall away, he assured the audience: \u201cOver time, it all gets kind of washed out, right?\u201d Under Bannon\u2019s hand, Breitbart articles offered dire warnings of the threats posed by immigrants. Bannon\u2019s radio show provided a steady diet of apocalyptic warnings about radical Islam\u2019s rise, asserting that Europe had been subject to a \u201cquasi-invasion.\u201d Breitbart stories ridiculed feminists, and Bannon once angrily denounced a female colleague as a \u201cbimbo\u201d in the 1990s, according to court records. An ex-wife\u2019s allegations that Bannon said he did not want his children to attend school with Jews \u2014 comments he denied making \u2014 have spurred accusations that he is anti-Semitic. Friends, family and even now-critical former colleagues said the image of Bannon as a bigot is wrong, and miss what really drives the 62-year-old, who was infuriated when people like his father, a longtime phone company worker, saw their retirement funds shrink because of the 2008 financial crisis. Bannon\u2019s longtime personal assistant is an African American woman, and he has extended family members who are Jewish, they note. Bannon backstage during a campaign event on Nov. 1 in Eau Claire, Wis. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) For Bannon, the mission is to ignite a broader populist movement \u2014 even if that means tolerating extremist viewpoints, associates say. \u201cHe is not a racist,\u201d said Julia Jones, a self-described \u201cBernie Sanders liberal\u201d who was Bannon\u2019s screenwriting partner for 16\u00a0years. \u201cI think he is using the alt-right for political purposes.\u201d In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Friday, Bannon said: \u201cI\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist.\u201d He predicted Trump could create a new populist political movement that would win significant black and Hispanic support and \u201cgovern for 50\u00a0years.\u201d Bannon did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article, but friends and family spoke about his views. His older brother, Martin J. \u201cMike\u201d Bannon III, strongly rejected the idea that he held any prejudices. \u201cSteve and I and others were taught by our parents that if a woman came on the bus, you gave up your seat \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter if they were black or white or Asian or whatever,\u201d Mike Bannon said. What guides his brother, Mike Bannon added, is a belief that the rules should be fair to give everyone a chance to participate \u2014 including those of all ethnicities and faiths. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter for those people,\u201d said Mike Bannon, who works in finance and still lives in their home town of Richmond. \u201cHe\u2019s a man for the forgotten man.\u201d Bannon is known for becoming consumed with whatever endeavor is before him. When something goes awry, he is quick with an expletive. At times, colleagues said, he would remind those around him that he had a Harvard degree. Brazenness, canny intuition and luck drove Bannon to a series of unexpected successes. When he ran a boutique investment bank, a bet on the library of Castle Rock Entertainment in the 1990s scored him a lucrative royalties stream from a then-little-known show called \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d His direction of a glowing biopic of former President Ronald Reagan in 2004 brought him into contact with the late conservative media agitator and entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart and through him the wealthy Mercer family. \u2018He believed what he believed\u2019 The middle sibling of five children, Bannon grew up in a tightly knit Irish Catholic family in Richmond, on a street of big shade trees and eclectic old houses in the Ginter Park neighborhood. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, now lives about seven blocks away. Bannon\u2019s pugilistic character was apparent at an early age. \u201cHe\u2019s a son of Richmond and a son of the South, and that\u2019s who he\u2019ll always be,\u201d Mike Bannon said. \u201cHe was always a guy that would get in an argument or get in a fight, and you weren\u2019t going to change his mind about something. He believed what he believed.\u201d Bannon attended Catholic schools throughout childhood and graduated in 1972 from Benedictine High School, an all-boys military academy. Students were not exposed to much of the counterculture of the time. \u201cWe had to take Latin and logic \u2014 everyone had to take a classical education program and a heavy dose of values,\u201d said Patrick McSweeney, an old family friend. \u201cAt that time, most of the teachers were monks. It was very definitely a religious education.\u201d McSweeney, a lawyer who went on to be chairman of the state Republican Party, said Benedictine was racially integrated long before Richmond public schools, which did not integrate until the 1970s. Bannon\u2019s first foray into his brand of disruptive politics came in 1975, during his junior year at Virginia Tech, when he launched an upstart bid for student body president, challenging the established order. He chose as his running mate a woman, Susan Oliver, at a time when campus leadership positions were dominated by men. \u201cHe had as much respect for me and my ideas and my contributions as anybody possibly could,\u201d said Oliver, who is now a lawyer in Lynchburg, Va. The race got nasty. Bannon had participated in student government for only five months. His opponent, Marshall DeBerry, had toiled for more than two years in the organization and was the handpicked heir of the outgoing president. Bannon used DeBerry\u2019s establishment credentials against him. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018This administration, these guys . . . they\u2019re all part of this old crowd. They haven\u2019t done jack for you,\u2019 \u201d DeBerry recalled. A Bannon-Oliver campaign flier belittled other candidates for offering only \u201cPlatitudes, Promises and Slogans.\u201d Bannon was a 21-year-old junior at Virginia Tech, running an upstart campaign to be student body president. Bannon had only participated in student government for five months as chair of a committee. He said he better understood the needs of the student body, engaging supporters with emotional appeals he would hone over four decades. (Provided by Susan Oliver) The old guard struck back. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by Bannon. He has immense charisma, but lacks the ability to keep his head geared in any one particular direction long enough to accomplish anything,\u201d warned Gary Clisham, whom Bannon was running to replace, in a letter to the editor of the student newspaper. Clisham, who is deceased, added that during his brief tenure in student government, \u201cMr. Steve Bannon has run amok every assignment given him.\u201d The letter infuriated Bannon\u2019s supporters, including Bannon\u2019s then-roommate Darrell Nevin, who shoved Clisham when he spoke up to blast Bannon during a debate. \u201cScuffle Occurs at Great Debate\u201d read the headline in the student newspaper. \u201cI was young. I just thought, well, let\u2019s push him off the stage,\u201d Nevin recalled sheepishly. \u201cIt was a bitter campaign.\u201d Bannon won with more than 60\u00a0percent of the vote. A shift to the right Bannon\u2019s political tilt deepened in the Navy, when he observed President Jimmy Carter\u2019s handling of the Iran hostage crisis from a destroyer in the north Arabian Sea. \u201cI come from a blue-collar, Irish Catholic, pro-Kennedy, pro-union family of Democrats,\u201d he told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2015. \u201cI wasn\u2019t political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter f---ed things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer.\u201d After Harvard Business School, he scored a job at Goldman Sachs in the middle of the heady 1980s, eventually moving to Los Angeles to focus on media mergers and acquisitions. In the late 1980s, he and some Goldman colleagues broke off and formed their own investment bank, Bannon & Co., housed in an office on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif. They quickly gained traction by drilling into the details of a media company\u2019s library, outmaneuvering goliaths such as Goldman in the process. \u201cWe were two guys trying to buck the system, not being the traditional establishment investment bank,\u201d said Scot Vorse, a close friend since business school who joined Bannon in the enterprise. \u201cWe were of an attitude that we\u2019re going to do something different.\u201d During this time, Bannon was hired by investors including Texas billionaire Edward Bass to turn around the financially struggling Biosphere\u00a02, an experiment in the Arizona desert to build an entirely self-sufficient community. Bannon\u2019s temper flared as he became embroiled in a management dispute, according to court records. One scientist described as part of subsequent litigation how Bannon pulled up in a limousine on Easter weekend of 1994, accompanied by police officers and armed with a court order that gave him control of the facility. The scientist said that Bannon changed all of the office locks and switched out computer and telephone codes. The project\u2019s chief engineer hid a microcassette recorder in his underwear and secretly taped Bannon, court records show, capturing Bannon angrily calling a female scientist a \u201c29-year-old bimbo.\u201d The woman had broken into the Biosphere to warn other scientists of Bannon\u2019s actions. On the recording, a copy of which has been published by Buzzfeed , Bannon promised to take a document she had written outlining safety problems at the site and \u201cram it down her f---ing throat.\u201d In a deposition filed in the case, obtained by The Washington Post, Bannon said the \u201cbimbo\u201d insult was said \u201cin the heat of the moment, in a monologue of which I am blowing off steam.\u201d At trial, he defended the word, saying it meant a person of low intelligence. He said he had concluded the woman was \u201cdetached from reality, deluded and acting like a bimbo.\u201d While Bannon\u2019s work as an investment banker consumed him, he was growing increasingly intrigued with the creative side of the entertainment business. In the early 1990s, he and Jones, a screenwriter, struck up a conversation in a restaurant and decided to try their hand at adapting Bannon\u2019s idea for a version of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cTitus Andronicus\u201d set in space. That script went nowhere, but the two went on to work on dozens of film and television projects together. One of them, the 2004 Reagan movie \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d introduced Bannon to Breitbart, who was making a name for himself as an editor at the Drudge Report. \u201cWe screened the film at a festival in Beverly Hills,\u201d Bannon told Bloomberg, \u201cand out of the crowd comes this, like, bear who\u2019s squeezing me like my head\u2019s going to blow up and saying how we\u2019ve gotta take back the culture.\u201d By then, Bannon had sold his company to the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He shed the expensive suits he wore for Hollywood business meetings, sticking with cargo shorts and polo shirts. \u201cThe moment he left that world, there was a physical transformation,\u201d said conservative author Peter Schweizer, whom Bannon approached in 2002 about turning his Reagan book into a documentary. \u201cThe uniform of those elite institutions was gone.\u201d Bannon told Bloomberg that he was disgusted by how the banking industry handled the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cI turned on Wall Street for the same reason everybody else did: The American taxpayer was forced to cut mook deals to bail out guys who didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d he said in the interview. From left, Bannon, executive producer Trevor Drinkwater and producer Jason Netter pose together at the premiere of \u201cSweetwater\u201d during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in 2013. (Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP) Bannon increasingly turned his lens on political issues, directing and producing documentaries such as \u201cGeneration Zero,\u201d an examination of the global economic crisis; \u201cBattle for America,\u201d which hammered an \u201carrogant, and ever-expanding central government\u201d; and a film celebrating 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin called \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d He said his approach was influenced by liberal filmmaker Michael Moore and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl. \u201cLeave the politics aside, you have to learn from those past masters on how they were trying to communicate their ideas,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. Jones, Bannon\u2019s longtime writing partner, said she was dismayed by his turn toward conservative politics \u2014 particularly his focus on Islam as a threat. Jones said she was taken aback when Bannon added a coda to the Reagan film warning of the threat of \u201cthe beast\u201d over images of Muslims praying, terrorist camps and people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center on 9/11. A few years later, Jones said, she declined to work on a project he pitched about the rise of \u201cIslamic fascism\u201d in the United States that would have opened with an image of the American flag dissolving into the Islamic crescent and star. \u201cIt offended me,\u201d Jones said. \u201cEverything about what he\u2019s become baffles me.\u201d In recent years, Bannon has expanded his efforts to influence the political debate by setting up nonprofits to spearhead independent research, most notably through the Florida-based watchdog group Government Accountability Institute. Bannon served as chairman of the group, whose directors included Rebekah Mercer , a daughter of hedge fund executive and conservative megadonor Robert Mercer. Schweizer, the president of GAI, authored \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d a book that lacerated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her ties to wealthy interests. Bannon turned it into a documentary that was released earlier this year. It was produced in part by a company called Glittering Steel, which shared a Beverly Hills address with both Breitbart News and the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica \u2014 both of which have financial backing from Mercer, who also financed a super PAC supporting Trump. Cambridge Analytica also worked directly for the Trump campaign this year. The first rule of \u2018Fight Club\u2019 Bannon joined the board of Breitbart News in 2011. The following March, the site experienced an unexpected transformation when the 43-year-old Breitbart collapsed and died near his California home. Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s longtime friend, took over as chief executive, while Bannon was appointed executive chairman. Bannon was hands-on, hosting two daily calls with the staff. Reporters talked up news \u2014 about immigration, refugees and crime \u2014 that they said the rest of the media was ignoring. Conservative stalwarts such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \u2014 nominated Friday to be Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 had a welcoming forum to explain their immigration and terrorism views, and Breitbart embraced Republican insurgents while blasting party leaders. \u201cWe call ourselves \u2018the Fight Club.\u2019 You don\u2019t come to us for warm and fuzzy,\u201d Bannon told The Washington Post early this year, adding, \u201cWe think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly \u2018anti-\u2019 the permanent political class. We say Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation.\u201d The site\u2019s tone and the reactions it drew from readers alarmed some staffers, including former editor-at-large Ben Shapiro, who later wrote that the comment section turned into \u201ca cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.\u201d Bannon told the Wall Street Journal this past week that Breitbart provided \u201can outlet for 10 or 12 or 15 lines of thought,\u201d of which the alt-right was only \u201ca tiny part.\u201d He acknowledged the movement had \u201csome racial and anti-Semitic overtones\u201d that he rejected, defining it for himself as \u201cyounger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment.\u201d In November 2015, Bannon assumed a more prominent public role as host of the daily satellite radio talk show \u201cBreitbart News Daily.\u201d He led the show until August, when he became chief executive of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Before Stephen K. Bannon became a close adviser to Donald Trump, he hosted \u201cBreitbart News Daily,\u201d a radio show, on which he interviewed the eventual president-elect nine times. The Washington Post\u2019s David A. Fahrenthold discusses what those interviews tell us about their relationship. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Bannon\u2019s show became a key platform to promote Trump , who appeared regularly. During one interview, Bannon likened the reality TV star\u2019s ability to negotiate with networks about the terms of the primary debates to the skills needed to negotiate international treaties. \u201cThe same logic applies whether it\u2019s China, or Mexico, Iran or the E.U.,\u201d Bannon told the candidate. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushed around by everybody. \u201d Still, Bannon had reservations. Trump is a \u201cblunt instrument for us,\u201d Bannon told Vanity Fair this summer, before joining the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he really gets it or not.\u201d One thing Bannon had no doubts about, however, was the strength of the nationalist sentiments bolstering the candidate. The day after Trump\u2019s Election Day upset, Bannon took a victory lap on his old radio show, chiding the media elite for failing to anticipate the outcome. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand the underlying desire for people to have control over their own lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThis victory,\u201d Bannon told his listeners, \u201cis your victory.\u201d Alice Crites, David Weigel, Richard Chumney in Blacksburg, Va., and Evan Wyloge in Florence, Ariz., contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Kim, Chicago Tribune) Protesters march toward Trump International Hotel and Tower Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016, in Chicago. (John J. Kim, Chicago Tribune) Marwa Eltagouri , William Lee and Grace Wong Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune More than a week after Donald Trump was elected president, at least 200 protesters and onlookers crowded Federal Plaza at noontime ahead of a milelong march to Trump Tower as families waited for the evening's Festival of Lights parade on the Mag Mile. Speakers said demonstrations are important after the election, and that it's vital their voices be heard so what they view as racist, sexist and xenophobic rhetoric of Trump's campaign would not become a new normal. Those who led reminded protesters of the importance of demonstration even after the election, and how vital it was that their voices be heard, so that what they believed was the racist, sexist and xenophobic rhetoric of Trump's campaign would not become a new normal. Trump's presidency and recent Cabinet appointments, they promised the crowd, would be met by resistance and organization every day. People march through Chicago on the weekend of Nov. 18, 2016 to protest the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.\u00a0 While most of the protesters\u2019 ire was focused on the president-elect, whom speakers denounced as a racist and homophobe, the crowd also spoke out against Democrats who they said took them for granted. \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests rose up largely against Democratic mayors and then you have an open racist running on the other side against a woman who played a key role in the mass incarceration boom \u2014\u00a0what sort of choice is that,\u201d said local activist Andy Thayer, who was one of the speakers at Federal Plaza. \u201cMy point is we don't just have to take this crap,\u201d he said, adding that activists can force change when they unite. Chanting in unison, they pumped the air with handmade signs, and passers-by downtown often stopped to read the messages: \u201cOur voices are stronger than Trump's hate.\u201d \u201cI deserve a president who leads by example.\u201d \u201cPrivilege: Thinking something is not a problem because it's not a problem to you personally.\u201d One sign was crafted by 5-year-old Johanna Gierut, and its pink scribbled letters formed a simple message, reading, \u201cDonald Trump is mean.\u201d Trump protesters in Federal Plaza Marwa Eltagouri / Chicago Tribune A young protester holds up a sign in Federal Plaza on Nov. 19, 2016. A young protester holds up a sign in Federal Plaza on Nov. 19, 2016. (Marwa Eltagouri / Chicago Tribune) Johanna said she thinks Trump is selfish, too \u2014\u00a0something she conveyed to her father, 35-year-old Nick Gierut, during a lesson on selfishness. Gierut said the protest offers his daughter a valuable lesson: That a hateful attitude toward minority groups, even if displayed by her future president, is not acceptable. Gierut said he personally tried to give Trump a chance when he realized he would be the nation's next president. But Trump's recent Cabinet appointments, such as his choice for attorney general, Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, set Gierut back. Sessions is an anti-immigration crusader deeply disliked by civil rights activists. \u201cI was hoping (Trump would) name more moderate Republicans to this Cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we march and only a couple people read about it, they might go and read about (Stephen Bannon) and Sessions. And that helps.\u201d Other speakers talked of opposing Trump and his agenda at every turn in his fledgling presidency.

    "text": "Nov 19 2016, 1:49 pm ET Putin and Duterte Want to Bail on the ICC \u2014 Here's Why That Matters by Aliyah Frumin The Philippines and Russia became the latest countries this week to announce their plans to turn their backs on the International Criminal Court \u2014 a move that's worrying experts who say it delegitimatizes the institution's quest for justice. What happened? Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 who continues to face intense scrutiny over airstrikes in Syria and the annexation of the Ukrainian territory Crimea two years ago \u2014 signed a decree on Wednesday to remove his country from the court. Russia had signed the Rome Treaty in 2000 that established the court, but never officially ratified it. A day later, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte called the Hague-based tribunal \"useless\" before leaving for the Asian-Pacific economic summit in Lima, Peru. Duterte \u2014 who many observers believe should face charges at the ICC for the thousands killed in his country as a result of his declared war on drugs \u2014 added, \"They are useless \u2014 those in the International Criminal [Court]. They [Russia] withdrew. I might follow. Why? Only the small ones like us are battered.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses new ambassadors to Russia after the credential receiving ceremony in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Nov. 9, 2016. Sergei Karpukhin / AP Alex Whiting, a former prosecutions coordinator at the ICC who now is a professor at Harvard Law School, said Duterte's rationale is likely to avoid prosecution himself. For Russia, it's a signal that the country will not be supportive of any potential court investigation having to do incursions in Ukraine or Georgia. But Russia and the Philippines are just the latest to leave or potentially ditch the ICC, which began fully functioning in 2002 in an effort to go after people who committed international offenses, including genocide and crimes against humanity. Last month, three African countries \u2014 South Africa, Burundi and Gambia \u2014 said they were pulling out, arguing that their continent's leaders have been unfairly targeted. Many other major powers \u2014 like the U.S., China and India \u2014 never joined the ICC in the first place. The U.S., in particular, was concerned its soldiers could face unfair prosecutions. But up until this point, no countries that had joined had then left the tribunal. And the court has consistently gained new member countries, seeing its membership peak at 124 nations. That's why some experts say the new flurry of departures is alarming. \\Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte speaks at the Philippines - China Trade and Investment Fourm at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 20. WU HONG / Pool via EPA The potentially 'dangerous' consequences In order to be considered legitimate, \"the court ultimately depends on getting as close to as universal acceptance as possible,\" said Whiting. A dangerous precedent has been set in that \"countries that come under the scrutiny of the court are now pulling out \u2026 there doesn't seem to be a diplomatic price to pay.\" \"Almost every year the court was getting new members. There was a feeling that slowly but surely it would become a universal institution. Now that view has taken a real hit,\" said David Bosco, an associate professor at Indiana University's School of Global and International Studies and author of \"Rough Justice: The International Criminal Court in a World of Power Politics.\" He added: \"It's looking less like an institution that will become universal in the future.\" Practically, the countries' departures means it becomes impossible for the ICC to prosecute cases in those places. \"It's a free pass for crimes that have been committed and potentially for crimes in the future,\" said Whiting. Since it began operating, the court has indicted 39 people, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, and former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo. It's faced criticism, including alleged bias against Africa and not having its own police force to go after suspects, and not having as much support as it could from the United Nations. The ICC is clearly imperfect. But that doesn't mean it's not important, say experts. The future of the ICC So what will happen to the ICC, especially if more countries follow Russia and the Philippines out the door? \"The court is going to have a few very difficult years,\" said Whiting, predicting the ICC may have to work on smaller cases to show it can be successful. \"Countries will inevitably return to international engagement in the future, but the court will have to wait for that turn.\" \"It's hard to kill an international organization,\" added Bosco, surmising a few more African countries with withdraw and the court may play more of an assistant role to national court systems in the future. \"But I think the court will hold on to a core membership\u2026It will be a reduced and humbled court, but a court that still operates.\" Aliyah Frumin ",

Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News hide caption toggle caption Freida Lockaby says she has benefited from access to health care coverage through Medicaid. Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News For Freida Lockaby, an unemployed 56-year-old woman who lives with her dog in an aging mobile home in Manchester, Ky., one of America's poorest places, the Affordable Care Act was life altering. The law allowed Kentucky to expand Medicaid in 2014 and made Lockaby \u2013 along with 440,000 other low-income state residents \u2013 newly eligible for free health care under the state-federal insurance program. Enrollment gave Lockaby her first insurance in 11 years. \"It's been a godsend to me,\" said the former Ohio school custodian who moved to Kentucky a decade ago. Lockaby finally got treated for a thyroid disorder that had left her so exhausted she'd almost taken root in her living room chair. Cataract surgery let her see clearly again. A carpal tunnel operation on her left hand eased her pain and helped her sleep better. Daily medications brought her high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol level under control. But Lockaby is worried her good fortune could soon end. Her future access to health care now hinges on a controversial proposal to revamp the program that her state's Republican governor has submitted to the Obama administration. Article continues after sponsorship Next year will likely bring more uncertainty when a Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress promise to consider Obamacare's repeal, including a potential reduction in the associated Medicaid expansion in 31 states and the District of Columbia that has led to health coverage for an estimated 10 million people . What Happens If Kentucky Dismantles Its Health Insurance Exchange? Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015, has argued his state can't afford Medicaid in its current form. Obamacare permitted states to use federal funds to broaden Medicaid eligibility to all adults with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, now $11,880 for individuals. Kentucky's enrollment has doubled since late 2013 and today almost a third of its residents are in the program. The Medicaid expansion under Obamacare in Kentucky has led to one of the sharpest drops in any state's uninsured rate, to 7.5 percent in 2015 from 20 percent two years earlier. Kentucky's achievement owed much to the success of its state-run exchange, Kynect, in promoting new coverage options under the health law. Kynect was launched under Bevin's Democratic predecessor, Steve Beshear, and dismantled by Bevin this year. Bevin has threatened to roll back the expansion if the Obama administration doesn't allow him to make major changes, such as requiring Kentucky's beneficiaries to pay monthly premiums of $1 to $37.50 and require nondisabled recipients to work or do community service for free dental and vision care. Budget pressures are set to rise next year in the 31 states and the District of Columbia where Medicaid was expanded as the federal government reduces its share of those costs. States will pick up 5 percent next year and that will rise gradually to 10 percent by 2020. Under the health law, the federal government paid the full cost of the Medicaid expansion population for 2014-2016. In a state as cash-strapped as Kentucky, the increased expenses ahead for Medicaid will be significant in Bevin's view \u2014 $1.2 billion from 2017 to 2021, according to the waiver request he's made to the Obama administration to change how Medicaid works in his state. Trump's unexpected victory may help Bevin's chances of winning approval. Before the election, many analysts expected federal officials to reject the governor's plan by the end of the year on the grounds that it would roll back gains in expected coverage. A Trump administration could decide the matter differently, said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voice for Health, an advocacy group that opposes most waiver changes because they could reduce access to care. \"I think it's much more likely that a waiver could be approved under the Trump administration,\" she said. \"On the other hand, I wonder if the waiver will be a moot point under a Trump administration, assuming that major pieces of the [Affordable Care Act] are repealed.\" Lockaby is watching with alarm: \"I am worried to death about it.\" Life already is hard in her part of Kentucky's coal country, where once-dependable mining jobs are mostly gone. In Clay County where Lockaby lives, 38 percent of the population live in poverty. A fifth of the residents are disabled. Life expectancy is eight years below the nation's average. Clay's location places it inside an area familiar to public health specialists as the South's diabetes and stroke belt . It's also in the so-called \" Coronary Valley \" encompassing the 10-state Ohio/Mississippi valley region. About 60 percent of Clay County's 21,000 residents are covered by Medicaid, up from about a third before the expansion. The counties uninsured rate for nonelderly adults has fallen from 29 percent to 10 percent. Still, the increase in insurance coverage hasn't made Clay's people healthier yet. Local health officials here say achieving that will take a decade or more. Instead, they cite progress in smaller steps: more cancer screenings, more visits to mental health professionals and more prescriptions getting filled. Harder lifestyle changes that are still ahead \u2014 such as eating better, quitting smoking and regular exercise \u2014 will take more than a couple years to happen, said Aaron Yelowitz, associate professor of economics at the University of Kentucky. At the Grace Community Health Center in Manchester, Ky., psychologist Joan Nantz meets with patient Ramiro Salazar, who gained Medicaid under the expansion. Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News hide caption toggle caption Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News At the Grace Community Health Center in Manchester, Ky., psychologist Joan Nantz meets with patient Ramiro Salazar, who gained Medicaid under the expansion. Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News One hopeful spot is the Grace Community Health Center in downtown Manchester, where patient visits are up more than 20 percent since 2014. Those without insurance pay on a sliding scale, which can mean a visit costs $50 or more. That was too much for Ramiro Salazar, 47, who lives with his wife and two children on a $733 monthly income. With Medicaid, he sees a doctor for his foot and ankle pain, meets regularly with a psychologist for anxiety and gets medications \u2014 all free to him. Medicaid even covers his transportation costs to doctors, vital because a specialist can be 40 miles away. Salazar is worried about Bevin's plans, especially the additional costs. \"I probably couldn't afford it as I'm unemployed,\" he said. \"It would hurt me pretty bad.\" Any development that could take away health coverage from people with mental health issues worries Joan Nantz, a psychologist who works part time at Grace and whose appointment calendar is booked three weeks out because of patient demand. More than 90 percent of her clients are on Medicaid. \"If something happens to this program, I can't begin to think what impact it would have on society,\" she said. Without counseling, people with mental health issues will resort to illegal drugs and be more likely to commit crimes and domestic violence, Nantz said. Just five primary care doctors in Manchester treat adults in Clay and surrounding counties. Manchester Memorial Hospital has tried to recruit more without success. \"We had a painful primary care shortage here five years ago and now it's worse,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Newswanger, an emergency room physician and chief medical officer at the hospital. \"Just because they have a Medicaid card doesn't mean they have doctors.\" The emergency room is busier than ever seeing patients for primary care needs, he said. Newswanger sees both sides to the debate over Medicaid. The hospital gained because more patients are now covered by insurance, and the ER's uninsured rate dropped to 2 percent from 10 percent in 2013. \"Eliminating the expansion altogether would be painful for the hospital and a disaster for the community,\" he said. But, Newswanger also appreciates some of Bevin's proposals. \"No one values something that they get for free,\" he said, and incentives are needed to make people seek care in doctors' offices instead of expensive ERs. Christie Green, public health director of the Cumberland Valley District Health Department that covers Clay County, said making the poor pay more or scrapping Medicaid's expansion would be a setback to improving people's health. Last year, Green helped Manchester build a three-mile trail along a park and install a swinging bridge across a small creek. Both additions were intended to promote physical fitness in a place where more than a third smoke \u2014 both far above national averages. Progress is slow. The path is used regularly. But drug addicts congregate daily by the bridge and it rarely gets traffic. \"There is a lot to overcome here,\" Green said.

(Photo: AP) Not since Ford's Theater has so much furor erupted from a politician attending a play. With Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage who has supported diverting federal funding from HIV and AIDS groups to conversion therapy, seated in the audience for Friday night's performance of Hamilton, certain lines resonated even more than usual. Trump asks 'Hamilton' cast who 'harassed' Mike Pence to apologize Audience member Christy Colburn tweeted that when Alexander Hamiton and the Marquis de Lafayette quipped, \"Immigrants, we get the job done during The Battle of Yorktown , the crowd gave them a standing ovation. And later, during the song What Comes Next? , King George III actor Rory O'Malley had to stop the song briefly after the crowd \"went nuts\" at the line \"When your people say they hate you, don't come crawling back to me\" and ask them to stop booing. I'm at #Hamilton and so is Mike Pence. Crowd booed him like crazy, and gave a standing O at the line \"immigrants we get the job done\" 1/2 By now, you've likely seen the video from the curtain call, when\u00a0Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr,\u00a0 addressed\u00a0Pence on behalf of \"diverse Americans \u00a0who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us\" and asked the vice president-elect\u00a0to\u00a0 \"uphold our inalienable rights and work on behalf of all of us.\" President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump demanded the cast apologize for harassing Pence, but by all accounts, both Dixon and the vice president-elect were respectful of one another. In fact, Dixon even\u00a0 thanked the Indiana governor for listening \u00a0to what he had to say. @realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen. \u2014 Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016 Mike Pence actually stood and listened.  It is Trump who took to Twitter with his foolishness - typical. #BoycottHamilton \u2014 Ella-Writer (@Ella_writer) November 19, 2016 None of it persuaded Trump, who jumped on Twitter again Saturday night after a day of meetings with his transition team and high-profile guests \u00a0at his golf club in New Jersey. \"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!\" Trump wrote.\u00a0But within minutes, he deleted it. The president-elect of the United States just deleted a tweet going after a Broadway play for the 12th hour straight https://t.co/SU17q2pMBd pic.twitter.com/DPTyZsG2Q8 \u2014 Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) November 20, 2016 Even creator Lin-Manuel Miranda weighed in during a break from doing\u00a0Moana interviews in the U.K., complimenting the cast for how they handled the situation and agreeing with Trump that everyone should be welcome at the theater. Proud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016 And original cast member Christopher Jackson, who gives his last performance as George Washington Sunday , summed up his cast's statement as \"citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS with respect and clarity.\" Just LISTEN to the words!

WITH RESPECT and CLARITY! #AMENandAMEN https://t.co/J6UhrwW1FP \u2014 Christopher Jackson (@ChrisisSingin) November 19, 2016 But social media has not settled down since, erupting with hashtags like\u00a0 #BoycottHamilton . (Proponents of that movement will have to be very patient: the show is sold until September 2017.) Here is a sampling of the most viral comments on Twitter. Desperate times, desperate measures Frozen star Josh Gad , who originated the role of Elder Cunningham in The Book of Mormon, provided some context in a Twitter statement. \"I know the booing upsets some of you,\" he wrote. \"But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.\" While he says he personally wouldn't boo someone at a theater, \"this feels different. There are swastikas popping up everywhere, a cabinet of civil-rights offenders and deniers being built, and a leader who has placed a white nationalist by his side. These aren't attempts at unity. These are warning shots to everyone who isn't white, straight and extreme.\" If we're talking about apologies ...

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduces\u00a0a new messenger platform at the F8 summit in San Francisco, California on\u00a0March 25, 2015. (Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images) Abby OhlheiserThe Washington Post A week after trying to reassure the public that it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election,\" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg outlined several ways the company might try to stop the spread of fake news on the platform in the future. \"We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Friday night post on his own Facebook page. He then named seven approaches the company was considering to address the issue, including warning labels on false stories, easier user reporting methods and the integration of third-party verification. \"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" he cautioned, repeating the company's long-standing aversion to becoming the \"arbiters of truth\" -- instead preferring to rely on third parties and users to make those distinctions. \"We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content,\" he said. While none of the listed ideas are particularly specific, Zuckerberg's post does provide more details on the company's thinking about the problem of fake news. Facebook's concern with fake news predates the 2016 elections. Hoaxes have long plagued the site's algorithms, which incentivize the creation of content that its users would like to share, true or not. But fake news - and specifically, Facebook's role in spreading it - became a story of wide interest just after the elections, when critics accused the platform of influencing voters by allowing political hoaxes to regularly go viral - particularly those favorable to the now President-elect Donald Trump . Zuckerberg has strongly denied that this was true, saying last week that the idea that Facebook influenced the elections in this way is \"pretty crazy,\" and that fake news \"surely had no impact\" on the outcome. Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site. The company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,... Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site. The company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,... (Sarah Frier) Zuckerberg did not contradict this denial on Friday, but his post reflects Facebook's growing acknowledgment that it's going to have to do a lot more about the plague of hoaxes and fake stories on the platform. On Monday, Facebook announced it was going to crack down on fake news sites that use its ad services to profit off hoaxes. One of the ideas Zuckerberg presented on Friday indicates that the company wants to go further in \"disrupting fake news economics,\" and is considering more policies like the one it just announced, along with stronger \"ad farm detection.\" Another promises stronger detection of misleading content. \"This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,\" Zuckerberg wrote. News Feed can already make some guesses about whether a post is authentic or not based on the user behavior around it. On Friday, Zuckerberg specified that Facebook currently watches for things like \"people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes\" to determine whether a post might be misleading or false. Zuckerberg didn't go into specifics about what more Facebook might be looking to do on this front. David Pierson Hillary Clinton was the choice of nearly every American newspaper editorial board.

(David Pierson) Facebook also indicated that it's trying to find ways to rely more on users and third parties to help flag and classify fake stories. Zuckerberg listed \"stronger reporting\" methods for users, and listening more to \"third party verification\" services like fact checking sites. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was considering how to use third-party and user reports of fake news as a source for displaying warnings on fake or misleading content. The site would also improve the quality of articles that appear in \"related articles\" under news stories that are posted to Facebook. And, Zuckerberg said, Facebook would \"continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry\" on the issue. While Facebook has attracted the majority of scrutiny this week, the platform is hardly the only company struggling to address the spread of fake news on the Internet. On Monday, the top Google hit for the search \"final election count\" was a site falsely reporting that Trump had won the popular vote. Like Facebook, Google has also taken steps this week to try and stop fake news writers from using their ad services to make money. ",

Rhee served three contentious years as chancellor of the District\u2019s schools, where she oversaw a rise in test scores but shuttered some schools, laid off nearly 700 teachers for poor performance and filled more than 91 principal openings that were created via firings, resignations and retirements. Rhee has been a supporter of Common Core, which Trump opposes. Trump also met with donor Betsy DeVos, who is also reportedly being considered for education secretary. DeVos is a proponent of charter schools and vouchers. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire oncologist who advised Vice President Biden\u2019s efforts to combat cancer, also met with Trump and Pence on Saturday afternoon, as did conservative community development leader Robert L. Woodson Sr., who told The Washington Post that he is under consideration to be secretary of housing and urban development. The president-elect and vice president-elect are also planning to huddle this weekend with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner who is on Trump\u2019s transition team, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was ousted as chairman of Trump\u2019s transition team . [ Trump demands apology from \u2018Hamilton\u2019 after cast\u2019s message to Pence ] \u201cThese meetings that the president-elect and vice president-elect are having really show . . . the depth to which we\u2019re going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration,\u201d Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday. Some visitors, he said, are \u201cpotential administration hires,\u201d while others are coming only to offer advice. \u201cThe president-elect is bringing together folks who have been on the opposite side of him politically,\u201d Miller said. Questions about Trump\u2019s ability to bring Americans together arose onstage Friday night on Broadway. In a morning tweetstorm \u2014 a communication method that Trump often used as a candidate but that is unprecedented for a president-elect \u2014 Trump claimed that Pence was \u201charassed\u201d Friday night at a New York theater, where he went to see \u201cHamilton,\u201d a Tony Award-winning musical about Founding Father Alexander Hamilton that features a diverse cast and crew. \u201cOur wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!\u201d Trump tweeted. [ Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet ] At the show\u2019s curtain call, the cast stood onstage as actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who portrays Hamilton nemesis Aaron Burr, addressed Pence, who apparently was walking out of the theater. \u201cWe sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,\u201d Dixon said during his remarks. \u201cBut we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us \u2014 all of us.\u201d A spokesman for the show told the Associated Press that Pence stood outside the theater to listen to Dixon. Later, Trump took to Twitter, saying the cast should apologize for addressing Pence. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d Dixon tweeted back to Trump: \u201c@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.\u201d Trump also used Twitter to address a $25\u00a0million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against Trump University, a defunct real estate seminar program. Trump, who had repeatedly claimed that he never settled lawsuits, despite doing so for years, now will likely not face the prospect of testifying in court during his presidential transition. \u201cI settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,\u201d Trump tweeted. He added: \u201cThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\u201d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Friday that the settlement includes a $1\u00a0million penalty paid to the state for claiming the program was a \u201cuniversity\u201d even though it did not offer degrees, violating New York education law.

    "text": "Got it The cast of \"Hamilton\" delivered a message to Vice President-elect Mike Pence from stage after he watched the show at Richard Rodgers Theatre on Nov. 18. Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful) By Philip Rucker November 19 at 8:32 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Mike Pence was elected vice president by a coalition of mostly white voters nostalgic for what they thought of as the good old days in America and galvanized by promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. On Friday night, Pence came face-to-face with a symbol of the new America: A hit musical called \u201cHamilton\u201d that celebrates the principles of the nation\u2019s founding but reimagines the revolutionary period with multiracial actors playing the statesmen and the contributions of immigrants central to the story. As he took his seat in New York\u2019s Richard Rogers Theatre, Pence heard an impassioned, sustained boo. He sat through a performance celebrating the country\u2019s multiculturalism. And when the show was over and he headed for the exits, the cast was not quite finished. \u201cWe, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,\u201d said Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who played Aaron Burr, reading a statement the cast members had drafted together. \u201cBut we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us,\u201d he continued. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, top center, leaves the Richard Rodgers Theatre after a performance of \"Hamilton\" in New York on Friday. (Andres Kudacki/AP) The remarkable moment crystallized the cleavage wrought by a toxic presidential campaign, in which millions of aggrieved white Americans propelled Donald Trump and Pence to the White House and left millions of others \u2014 blacks and Latinos, gays and lesbians, Muslims and Jews \u2014 fearful of what might become of their country. \u201cIt was this collision of two different Americas and two different visions and two different sets of experiences, happening at once, and happening in a rather dramatic way,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter to President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. By Saturday morning, Trump decided to respond. He could have chosen to offer assurances that he would be a president for all Americans \u2014 that he would respect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed. But Trump being Trump, the president-elect punched back. \u201cThe Theater must always be a safe and special place,\u201d Trump tweeted . \u201cThe cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d There was a certain irony to Trump\u2019s demand, considering that as a candidate he rarely if ever apologized for the blizzard of insults he sprayed across the country. \u201cHave you ever apologized? Ever? In your lifetime? Close your eyes, think back to Baby Donald . . . ,\u201d Jimmy Fallon asked Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d in September 2015. President-elect Donald Trump, left, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, right, with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis at the Trump International Golf Club in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Saturday. (Aude Guerrucci / Pool/European Pressphoto Agency) \u201cI fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,\u201d Trump replied. He added, with a laugh, \u201cI will absolutely apologize sometime in the hopefully distant future, if I\u2019m ever wrong.\u201d Trump did apologize in October for the comments he made in 2005 to \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush bragging about having grabbed women by their genitals. As a candidate, Trump set off hand grenades with provocative tweets at moments of his choosing to attract the attention of the news media. Regardless of whether this was Trump\u2019s intent Saturday morning, his shot at the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast served to distract from a negative news story that broke late Friday: The president-elect had agreed to a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against Trump University, his defunct real estate seminar program. Trump tweeted Saturday that he had settled the case because he had to \u201cfocus on our country.\u201d \u201cThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\u201d Trump tweeted, although there was no clear indication whether he would have prevailed had the case gone to trial. In many ways, \u201cHamilton\u201d has become a touchstone in America\u2019s ongoing culture wars. Hillary Clinton embraced the musical \u2014 its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, openly supported her candidacy \u2014 and recited its lyrics in her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. Talk about \u201cHamilton\u201d is different in Trump\u2019s orbit, however. Last Thursday at Trump Tower, when a reporter asked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) how long he intended to be in New York, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway interjected: \u201cHave you seen \u2018Hamilton\u2019?\u201d \u201cI have not,\u201d replied Sessions, who the next day would be announced as Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee. Trump\u2019s handling of the Pence incident is in keeping with how he confronted past cultural controversies and could presage how he will act in the White House. Although he is a billionaire who lives in a three-story apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, he long has felt excluded and shunned by the New York and Washington elite. Trump is sensitive to perceived snubs \u2014 and has mastered the art of snapping back at criticism from coastal liberals as a means of ingratiating himself with his middle-America base. On Saturday, Trump\u2019s defenders rushed to condemn the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast and voice outrage at perceived disrespect. His supporters started a \u201c#BoycottHamilton\u201d campaign on Twitter \u2014 although \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets are such a hot commodity that the production is sold out well into next year. \u201cThe arrogance and hostility of the Hamilton cast to the Vice President elect (a guest at the theater) is a reminder the left still fights,\u201d tweeted former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser. Gingrich went on to liken Trump to former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher: \u201cLady Thatcher aroused the same bitter hostility because like Trump she was a threat to the establishment\u2019s claim to moral superiority.\u201d Presidential historian Robert Dallek said Trump\u2019s Twitter retort was a striking act of divisiveness by an incoming president struggling to heal the nation after a bitter election. \u201cInstead of doing what a Franklin Roosevelt or a John Kennedy or a Lyndon Johnson would have done, he\u2019s exacerbating the differences by saying they owe him an apology,\u201d Dallek said. \u201cFor what? What were they asking for? They were asking for a kind of regard for minorities. It wasn\u2019t as if they were asking him to give up the office.\u201d Said Wehner: \u201cHe\u2019s not the sole reason that the campaign was ugly and divisive, but he\u2019s the main reason it was. . . . And now, having won, it falls on him to bind up the wounds. Even if you feel what happened by the cast of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 was wrong or inappropriate or indecorous, he\u2019s the leader of the country.\u201d Although Trump won a clear majority in the electoral college, he garnered just 47 percent of the popular vote \u2014 more than 1 million votes short of Clinton, with millions of votes still to be counted in primarily liberal states. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump understands that beneath the surface of his electoral college victory, there\u2019s a lot of people who simply are not willing to accept the rhetoric of his campaign as the language of government,\u201d veteran Democratic strategist Tad Devine said. \u201cTrump has opened Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re looking for hope at the bottom.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Email ELKO, Nev. \u00a0-- An air-ambulance plane taking a heart-disease patient to a Utah hospital crashed in a parking lot in northern Nevada, killing all four people aboard and sending up explosions and flames. Three crew members and a patient were killed in the Friday night crash in Elko, American Medflight said Saturday in a statement. According to Elko cardiologist Dr. Rodney Badger, the plane was carrying a heart patient to the University of Utah, CBS affiliate KTVN reports .\u00a0 A plane crashed in northern Nevada, killing four, late on Friday, Nov. 18, 2016.\u00a0 KTVN \u201cThere was not a lot left of the aircraft,\u201d said Elko Fire Chief Matt Griego. Elko police Lt. Rich Genseal said the twin-engine plane apparently \u201cexperienced mechanical problems\u201d as it was climbing after taking off on a flight for Salt Lake City, then lost altitude and crashed, the Elko Daily Free Press reported.\u00a0 The identities of the victims were not released by authorities, but Debbi and Jim Urresti of Elko, said their 29-year-old daughter, Tiffany, was killed in the crash. The twin-engine plane crashed in a mining company\u2019s parking lot near a casino and other businesses near Elko Regional Airport and Interstate 80. American Medflight, which is based in Reno, Nevada, did not immediately respond to email and telephone requests for comment. But President John Burruel said in a statement that the company was cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration as they investigated the crash. \u201cAs an air medical family, we are mourning the loss of our crewmembers and patient.  Their families have been notified, and they are in our thoughts and prayers,\u201d Burruel said. Tiffany Urresti\u2019s parents said she was a former hospital ER nurse who dreamed for years of working as a flight nurse. Urresti achieved her dream, starting work for American Medflight two months ago, and she was engaged to be married in May, Debibi Urresti said. \u201cShe found the love of her life.\u201d Local authorities did not immediately respond to email and phone requests for comment, but Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said nobody on the ground was hurt. \u201cThere was not a lot left of the aircraft,\u201d Elko Fire Chief Matt Griego said after the flames were extinguished. A photograph published by the Elko Daily Free Press showed mostly burned wreckage on pavement in front of a line of vehicles, including at least one charred pickup. The plane\u2019s tail was one of the few recognizable parts. Hillary Walker, a manager at a grocery store about 200 yards from the crash, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that the crash caused parked vehicles to catch fire and then dozens of rounds of ammunition to go off. Walker noted that said a number of vehicles in the parking lot for mine workers likely had ammunition in them. \u201cIt\u2019s hunting season out here,\u201d she said. Dr. Rodney Badger of Northeastern Nevada Cardiology told the Daily Free Press that the plane had just taken off from the nearby airport to transport a patient to the University of Utah Medical Center. Badger said his patient suffered from coronary artery disease and was experiencing chest pains and rapid heartbeat around 5:30 p.m., after which the decision was made to transport him to Utah. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

There is no indication how he will fare in by the president-elect, he said. However, experts say it's also become clear with agency leaks of the investigation that Comey's lost control of the FBI. That could erode confidence on both sides of the aisle. Further, the FBI, which has historically tried to steer clear of the optics of politically motivated decisions, appeared to take an unprecedented step in the direction, Charles said. \"The FBI was seen as separate from the discourse of politics,\" said Athan Theoharis, an emeritus professor of history and the FBI at Marquette University, \"with Comey thrusting himself into a political election, that reputation is now tarnished.\" FBI Director James Comey is sworn-in before a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on July 7, 2016. YURI GRIPAS / AFP - Getty Images Democrats skewered Comey for his poor timing on rehashing the Clinton investigation while Republicans questioned if any of his investigations were ever conducted in good faith. But there was no political malice involved with Comey's decision to re-examine Clinton's emails, said Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who has been a close friend of Comey's for 30 years and was a former colleague of his at the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York.

Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP \"When you have an obligation to disclose or to qualify, you do it full-stop. You don't worry about timing, you don't worry about how it will be read or spun by others,\" Richman told NBC News before the election. \"And in this case, when he learned that what he said to Congress about the review of emails being complete turned out to be dated and requiring correction, he did it. There's no calculus involved.\" Safia Samee Ali ",

    "text": "Florida Surfer Dies Fulfilling Southern California Dream By The Associated Press HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. \u0097 Nov 19, 2016, 4:03 PM ET 0 Shares Email A Florida surfer who dreamed of riding Southern California waves has died doing what he loved. Dana Brown, 60, was paddling near the Huntington Beach pier near sunset on Nov. 6 when he was slammed into a pier pillar. He was underwater for several minutes before other surfers saw him and towed him to shore, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for his funeral expenses. He died at a hospital four days later. Brown lived in a van with his father, George. Racheal Katz met them about four years ago in Cocoa Beach, Florida. \"Dana and his dad were innocent,\" she told the Los Angeles Times ( http://lat.ms/2g8oRj9 ). \"You don't see innocent people any more, and you definitely don't find innocent 60-year-olds.\" Brown, who wore a long white beard, was deeply religious and wouldn't surf on the Sabbath, she said. He took care of his ailing father, bathing, feeding and reading to him. \"When his dad got sick, he spent probably every day with him,\" Katz said. \"Dana carried him in and out of that van every day. He didn't want him in any kind of an adult caring facility.\" His father's death in March dealt Brown emotional and financial blows, and he spent many weekends at his father's gravesite, according to the GoFundMe page. \"They had a journey together, him and his dad,\" Katz said. \"The death kind of ruined what Dana believed.\" About six months later, Brown left Cocoa Beach on his dream trip to Huntington Beach. The Orange County city is known for its excellent surfing and has trademarked the title \"Surf City USA.\" Brown was expected to be buried next to his father in Cocoa Beach on Dec. 3. \"I hope he caught one great wave,\" Katz said. \"He died doing what he loved.\" 0 Shares ",
