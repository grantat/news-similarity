She shouldn't be allowed to run. Hillary has engaged in a massive criminal enterprise & cover-up.\" pic.twitter.com/9Q8G2N0cig \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) November 4, 2016 Donald Trump calls this a rigged election, because it is \u2013 against Hillary. https://t.co/8hEmDkYg0f \u2014 Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) November 4, 2016 And it turns out that a lot of people think it\u2019s possible that the election actually is being rigged \u2014 especially Millenials. According to a new poll released by web agency Rad Campaign and analytic research firm Lincoln Park Strategies , 40% of Millennials think the election is vulnerable to fradulent fixing. And more young people worry about voter suppression (45%) than about voter fraud (33%). Hillary Clinton supporters and Donald Trump supporters are split on views about election tampering. (Rad Campaign) If you\u2019re one of the people concerned about election rigging or voter fraud, you can probably relax . \u201cA person is more likely to be struck by lightning than for voter fraud to occur,\u201d Allyson Kapin, the co-founder of Rad Campaign, said in a press release. \u201cVoter fraud rarely happens. There have only been a handful of verified cases of ineligible voters attempting to cheat the election system.\u201d Voter suppression , on the other hand, does seem to be happening . And there\u2019s a marked difference between Hillary Clinton supporters and Donald Trump supporters when it comes to beliefs around election tampering. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s rhetoric around a \u2018rigged\u2019 election is not resonating with most Americans,\u201d Stefan Hankin, founder of Lincoln Park Strategies, said in the release. \u201cHowever, it is certainly working with his supporters. The fact that two-thirds of them feel the election could be rigged does not bode well for our democracy or our country.\u201d ",

The magazine said in a statement Friday that its intentions were good when it published the article, \"A Rape on Campus\" by reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely, based on Jackie's alleged story. University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo leaves federal court after closing arguments in her defamation lawsuit against Rolling Stone magazine in Charlottesville, Va., on Nov. 1. Steve Helber / AP \"In our desire to present this complicated issue from the perspective of a survivor, we overlooked reporting paths and made journalistic mistakes that we are committed to never making again,\" the statement said. \"We deeply regret these missteps and sincerely apologize to anyone hurt by them, including Ms. Eramo.\" The story about Jackie's rape set off a firestorm at the university and in schools nationwide. Related: Rolling Stone Defamation Trial Over Rape Article Begins Eramo received hundreds of angry letters and emails calling her the \"dean of rape,\" among other things, and faced protesters outside her office. The story crumbled after other news outlets began asking questions and police found no evidence to back it up. The article was officially retracted in April 2015. Over the course of the more than two-week trial, the jury of eight women and two men watched 11 hours of video testimony, heard from a dozen live witnesses and examined nearly 300 exhibits. At issue were three statements made about Eramo in the article and several comments Erdely made about the \"university\" and \"administration\" in media interviews before the article was retracted.

    "text": "Rolling Stone Controversy 'Retraumatizing' for Victim 'Jackie': Attorney Eramo said the magazine portrayed her as a villain. She is seeking $7.5 million from the magazine for defamation, which will be decided at a later time. The next phase of the trial will determine monetary penalties and starts on Monday at 8 a.m. Eramo sobbed in her chair in the courtroom after the verdict was read. The jury took issue with statements made about Eramo, who was previously in charge of the university's sexual assault program, in the 2014 article. The jury also ruled some of the comments Erdely made about the administration and the University of Virginia that appeared in media interviews prior to the article's being retracted in April 2015 were defamatory and made with actual malice. In a statement, Rolling Stone said it has \"aimed to produce journalism with the highest reporting and ethical standards, and with a strong humanistic point of view,\" for more than 50 years. \"When we published \u2018A Rape on Campus\u2019 in 2014, we were attempting to tackle the very serious and complex topic of sexual assault on college campuses, a subject that is more relevant today than ever,\" said Rolling Stone Communications Director Kathryn Brenner. \"In our desire to present this complicated issue from the perspective of a survivor, we overlooked reporting paths and made journalistic mistakes that we are committed to never making again. We deeply regret these missteps and sincerely apologize to anyone hurt by them, including Ms. Eramo.\" Rolling Stone said it would continue to \"publish stories that shine a light on the defining social, political and cultural issues of our times, and we will continue to seek the truth in every story we publish.\u201d Rolling Stone also faces a defamation suit in a Virginia state court that was filed by the fraternity involved in the story. In a statement, the fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, said it is \"pleased\" the jury held Erdely, Rolling Stone and Wenner Media responsible for the \"defamatory story.\" \"We look forward to presenting our case in court in 2017 to receive justice for the damage caused by their irresponsible actions.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Harvard University The Harvard men's soccer team has been suspended for the remainder of the season after the school discovered the team had repeatedly written and circulated vulgar, sexually explicit \"scouting reports\" about new recruits on the women's team, in a practice that continued up to this year. \"The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential,\" Harvard President Drew Faust said in a statement Thursday. She wrote that \"both the team's behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community.\" Men's soccer coach Pieter Lehrer said the team was \"beyond disappointed\" to see the season end this way, but would respect the decision. \"Actions have consequences, and character counts,\" Lehrer said in a statement. \"We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.\" The suspension follows a story by The Harvard Crimson, the university's student newspaper, revealing that in 2012, the soccer team had circulated a \"scouting report\" on the new freshman recruits for the women's soccer team. Article continues after sponsorship The document \u2014 which appeared to be part of an annual tradition \u2014 described the female players in graphic, frequently degrading terms. It ranked their attractiveness with numerical values, assigned them sexual positions, theorized about their sexual behavior and described their physical attributes in terms that were variously crude and insulting. After that story, Harvard ordered a review of the team's behavior. The review found that the \"scouting report\" was, indeed, a tradition. \"I understand that this practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016, and that current students who participated were not immediately forthcoming about their involvement,\" Athletics Director Bob Scalise wrote in an email to the student body on Thursday. He said that \"immediate and significant action is absolutely necessary.\" The university has \"zero tolerance\" for such behavior, he wrote, and the team will be forfeiting its remaining games this season and will not participate in the Ivy League championship or the NCAA tournament. \"The decision brings to a sudden halt the season of a team that had a record of 10 wins, three losses and two ties, and was likely to win a championship berth if it won a scheduled Saturday game against Columbia University,\" Reuters reports. We'll give the last word on this story to those players from the women's team who were described so graphically in the 2012 document uncovered by the Crimson. Brooke Dickens, Kelsey Clayman, Alika Keene, Emily Mosbacher, Lauren Varela and Haley Washburn, the incoming recruits that year, wrote a response to the story that ran in the newspaper a few days later. It read in part: \"We do not pity ourselves. More than anything, we are frustrated that this is a reality that all women have faced in the past and will continue to face throughout their lives. We feel hopeless because men who are supposed to be our brothers degrade us like this. ... \"Having considered members of this team our close friends for the past four years, we are beyond hurt to realize these individuals could encourage, silently observe, or participate in this kind of behavior, and for more than four years have neglected to apologize until this week.\" The women said they read their classmates' lewd and mocking words in their entirety and were \"deeply hurt,\" but that they hoped this story would catalyze a change in culture. They concluded: \"Finally, to the men of Harvard Soccer and any future men who may lay claim to our bodies and choose to objectify us as sexual objects, in the words of one of us, we say together: 'I can offer you my forgiveness, which is \u2014 and forever will be \u2014 the only part of me that you can ever claim as yours.' \" ",

Baroni and Bridget Kelly were found guilty of scheming to use traffic jams to punish a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie in 2013. Julio Cortez/AP hide caption toggle caption Julio Cortez/AP Bill Baroni (right), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's former top appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, arrives at federal court in Newark, N.J., on Friday. Baroni and Bridget Kelly were found guilty of scheming to use traffic jams to punish a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie in 2013. Julio Cortez/AP Two former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have been found guilty of all counts against them in connection with the \"Bridgegate\" scandal. Bridgegate Trial: Aide Says Christie Knew Of Traffic-Snarling Plan Well In Advance The case involved a scheme to intentionally cause traffic problems on the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, as political retaliation against a mayor who did not endorse Christie for re-election. A total of four former top Christie aides have now either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of federal crimes \u2014 three of them related to Bridgegate. The two former aides found guilty on Friday were Bridget Kelly, who was Christie's deputy chief of staff, and onetime Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni. The charges against them included conspiracy and fraud. Kelly wept silently as the verdict was announced, WNYC's Matt Katz reports, while Baroni smiled and hugged his family. Their sentencing is set for Feb. 21, and they will be on probation until then, Katz says. WNYC reports that the two could face sentences of up to 86 years in prison. \"The federal jury took five days to reach a verdict in the scandal that helped sink Christie's Republican campaign for president,\" The Associated Press reports. \"The verdict came before the judge ruled on a request by defense attorneys to declare a mistrial in the case.\" Kelly and Baroni both plan to appeal, according to statements made by their lawyers after the verdict was announced. The defense lawyers sharply criticized prosecutors for going after Christie's aides without charging Christie, who has not been indicted in connection with this case and did not testify in the trial. Article continues after sponsorship Kelly's lawyer described her as a \"scapegoat.\" \"[Federal prosecutors] should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people,\" said Michael Baldassare, Baroni's attorney. \"And they did not.\" U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman defended the decision not to prosecute Christie, saying that prosecutors did not have enough evidence to build a case against him when they made indictments in the case. During the trial, Kelly testified that Christie knew about the scheme. She said he was told in advance about the plan that would cause traffic nightmares in Fort Lee, N.J., and responded by asking about his relationship with the local mayor. That contradicted public statements from the governor, who said after the scandal that he had \"no knowledge or involvement\" in the traffic snarl. He reiterated that position in a statement Friday afternoon, saying, \"I'm saddened about the choices made by Bill Baroni, Bridget Kelly and [former aide] David Wildstein. ... But let me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them. No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.\" If you could use a refresher on what went down in \"Bridgegate,\" Matt Katz told the story on Fresh Air earlier this year: \"There was a Democratic mayor in the town of Fort Lee \u2014 which is at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, the busiest bridge in the world \u2014 and the mayor didn't endorse Christie's re-election. The next thing he knew ... he woke up one Monday morning in September and there were lanes that go from his town to the George Washington Bridge that were closed. \"And the result was this massive, massive traffic jam in his town because all these cars from all over North Jersey use those lanes. Ambulance workers had to get out of their vehicles and run to the scene of an emergency. It was the first day of school, so new kindergartners were sitting on their buses for hours. And he couldn't figure out why the Port Authority that runs the bridge that's controlled by Christie would have closed these lanes. \"So he starts making calls, doesn't get a call back. This traffic jam went on for five days including ... the anniversary of Sept. 11, which caused further distress because the bridge is a terrorist target. It went on for five mornings in a row before somebody from the New York side of the Port Authority \u2014 because this is a bi-state agency \u2014 discovered what had been going on and decided to reopen the lanes. And the explanation initially from Christie officials was that they were just doing a traffic study.\" An email from Kelly to former Port Authority official Wildstein was a key piece of evidence suggesting that the closure was, in fact, political. It read: \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" \"Got it,\" Wildstein said in reply. Wildstein pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy earlier this year . David Samson, a close friend of Christie's, is the fourth Christie aide who has pleaded guilty to a federal crime; he admitted promising special treatment from the Port Authority to bribe United Airlines. Correction Nov. 4, 2016 A previous version of this story said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had been re-elected at the time of the Bridegate scheme. In fact, the George Washington Bridge traffic problems occurred in September 2013 and Christie was re-elected that November. ",

    "text": "Evan Vucci/AP | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images WATCH The Final Push Before Election Day 0 Shares Email Support for Donald Trump has slipped to its lowest in 10 days and enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton has recovered from its apparent damage by the latest FBI email investigation. Yet the race between them remains close in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll. Forty-seven percent of likely voters support Clinton with 43 percent for Trump in the latest four-night results. Whether it holds is an open question: Monday night\u2019s results, the best for Clinton in the series, will roll out tomorrow. While the shifts have been within the survey\u2019s margin of sampling error, the contest has gone from +1 Trump, 45-46 percent, Oct. 30, to +4 Clinton today. Trump\u2019s support now is numerically its lowest since Oct. 25. See PDF with full results here. Other shifts, all slight, are in sync. With the controversial FBI email announcement fading back a bit, Clinton has regrouped on strong enthusiasm -- up 6 points in just two days, and now essentially even with Trump for the first time since before the Comey letter. Moreover, Clinton\u2019s deficit on who\u2019s more honest and trustworthy has eased in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates . It was Trump +8 points immediately post-Comey, Trump\u2019s first significant lead on this attribute, but has narrowed to a non-significant Trump +4 now. These results signal how, with so much reluctant support for both unpopular candidates, vote intention and preferences are vulnerable to events. Trump suffered after the height of sexual misconduct allegations against him, then recovered; initial signs of damage to Clinton after the FBI announcement, now, likewise, seem to be pulling back. There\u2019s a little time for further influence, but not for 30 percent of likely voters: They\u2019ve already voted, by 50-44 percent, Clinton-Trump, in the ABC/Post tracking estimate. Enthusiasm Enthusiasm has followed a far more variable path in Clinton\u2019s case than in Trump\u2019s. As few as 36 percent of her supporters, in mid-September, were very enthusiastic about their choice. That advanced to 52 percent by the start of tracking, apparently motivated by controversy over Trump\u2019s sexual conduct. Clinton\u2019s strong enthusiasm then lost 7 points after the Comey letter announcing a renewed email investigation, only to rebound now. Strong enthusiasm for Trump among his supporters has followed a steadier path recently, after peaking at 55 percent, in mid-September and sliding to 47 percent three weeks later. It\u2019s held between 49 and 53 percent since. Groups Support for Trump has weakened a bit among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, down to 82 percent support in this group, near his low; 6 percent are going to Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Clinton, by contrast, has support from 87 percent of leaned Democrats, with just 2 percent to Johnson. By region, Clinton is unusually competitive in the South, 46-45 percent, a region Mitt Romney won by 10 points in 2012 and John McCain won by 9 in 2008. Women and minorities are boosting there. (Bill Clinton ran about evenly in the South with his opponents in 1992 and \u201996.) It\u2019s also close in the Midwest, 43-46 percent, Clinton-Trump; Obama won this region by 10 points in 2008, and ran evenly there with Romney in 2012. Notable, too, is that Trump\u2019s advantage among white women who don\u2019t hold a four-year college degree has advanced to 29-63 percent, Clinton-Trump, his widest margin in this group since mid-October, and even numerically exceeding his margin among his mainstay group, non-college white men, 29-59 percent. Clinton, for her part, has a 25-point lead among college-educated white women, 58-33 percent, while the contest among college-educated white men is essentially a tie. In all, it\u2019s a 38-52 percent race, Clinton-Trump, among whites, while it\u2019s 75-17 percent among nonwhites. Also of note is the battleground suburbs, now 47-43 percent overall, with Clinton boosted by suburban women, 54-38 percent. Finally, given its size, the tracking poll -- now with 4,613 interviews of likely voters since Oct. 20 -- can be used to evaluate preferences in groups too small for analysis in most surveys. One such group is nonwhites who are neither black nor Hispanic, 6 percent of likely voters. After a lukewarm result for Clinton earlier in tracking, they\u2019ve moved to 62-28 percent support for her, nearer where they were for Obama in the 2012 exit poll. Another is Jews, just 2 percent of likely voters. They favor Clinton by 73-18 percent, a wider gap for the Democrat than in 2012 (69-30 percent) but about the same as in 2008. That\u2019s fairly similar to results among non-religious voters, 63-25 percent, with evangelical white Protestants across the spectrum, 16-78 percent, Clinton-Trump. Sample sizes are inadequate for other small religious groups, e.g. Mormons and Muslims. Methodology This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 31-Nov. 3, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,419 likely voters.

    "text": "Fox News anchor apologizes for false report of 'likely' Clinton indictment William Cummings , USA TODAY 6:16 p.m. EDT November 4, 2016 2.3k Shares Share The host had been referring to an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Newslook Fox News anchor Bret Baier apologized on air Friday for his report that Hillary Clinton faces a \"likely\" indictment as the result of a \u00a0federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation and for his report that Clinton's private email server had been hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies. Both of Baier's mistaken reports were made\u00a0Wednesday night in an appearance with Fox News Channel's Brit Hume. At the time, Baier said the information was based on \"two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation.\" Baier \"clarified\" his reporting Friday on the Fox News show\u00a0Happening Now,\u00a0hosted by Jon Scott. \"On the hacking of Clinton's private, unsecured server: While multiple sources believe and are operating\u00a0under the working assumption that the server has been hacked, and some had specific quotes to that belief, there are to this day no digital fingerprints of such breaches,\" Baier said Friday on the Fox News show\u00a0Happening Now, hosted by Jon Scott. Baier admitted the report was based on a single, anonymous source. He then said his statement that an indictment was \"likely\" in the investigation into the Clinton Foundation was a \"mistake.\" Baier had already backtracked somewhat the previous night, calling the wording \"inartful.\" \"Well, that just wasn't inartful, it was a mistake and for that I'm sorry,\" Baier said. \"I should have said they will continue to build their case. Indictment obviously is a very loaded word, John, especially in this atmosphere and no one knows if there would or would not be an indictment no matter how strong investigators feel their evidence is.\" Several news organizations reported Thursday that Baier's assertion was incorrect. Baier stood by his report that there is an ongoing FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation that began more than a year ago. Republican nominee Donald Trump has used Baier's incorrect reporting in his campaign speeches. He repeated the claim that \"FBI agents says their\u00a0investigation is likely to yield an indictment\" on Friday, despite Baier's apology. The FBI has drawn heavy criticism for repeated leaks about the Clinton investigations, including from President Obama who said Thursday, \"we don't operate on innuendo, we don't operate on incomplete information, we don't operate on leaks.\" ",

    "text": "Clinton is seeing early turnout among the women and Latinos she is counting on in crucial states Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton speaks Friday at a rally in Detroit. Hillary Clinton speaks Friday at a rally in Detroit. (Paul Sancya / Associated Press) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Donald Trump and his campaign surrogates have been banking that a cadre of voters who rarely surface at the polls will show up and buoy his campaign as it drives toward Tuesday\u2019s election. Yet while reliably Republican voters are showing up at early-voting sites, they are being met there by a countering army: women, Latinos and other supporters of Hillary Clinton. The early vote is an imperfect measure of results, but two points seem clear. The first is that an election whose negativity seemed destined to drive away more voters than it attracted has so far done the reverse, prompting a record deluge of early voting in many of the states that will decide the presidency. By Tuesday, experts estimate, as many as 40% of the eventual ballots may have already been cast. The second is that Trump has been helpful to Clinton \u2019s efforts to increase voting among women and Latinos. Hillary Clinton supporters and Donald Trump supporters can agree on: If their candidate loses on election day, they want the victor put under a microscope by Congress . The simmering hostility and hyperpolarized electorate may, at the very least, provide... In California, there\u2019s at least one thing that Hillary Clinton supporters and Donald Trump supporters can agree on: If their candidate loses on election day, they want the victor put under a microscope by Congress . The simmering hostility and hyperpolarized electorate may, at the very least, provide... (Phil Willon) In key states like North Carolina, Nevada and Florida, gains among women and minorities have bolstered the Democrat\u2019s efforts to block Trump\u2019s avenues to victory. Trump, too, has seen big turnout increases among his targeted voters, but they have not overwhelmed the Democratic forces as some in his party had hoped. In Nevada, a giant get-out-the-vote operation by Culinary Union Local 226, which represents casino workers, has contributed to a dominant showing for Clinton in early voting. Half of the local\u2019s 32,500 registered voters have cast votes. Shuttles cart workers to and from voting sites. Nine hours a day, 300 volunteers knock on doors and others call voters from the union hall. The operation, which began with citizenship and voter registration drives, is aimed at union workers, their relatives and the public. The intensity is driven in part by distaste for Trump, who has made derogatory comments about women and Latinos throughout the campaign. \u201cHe created a climate where the election became very personal,\u201d said the local\u2019s political director, Yvanna Cancela. When measured, enthusiasm among Democrats in Nevada ranked higher than that of Republicans, said Tom Bonier, chief executive of TargetSmart, which analyzes voter data. This is a reversal of what many polls have shown throughout the year\u00a0and suggests that both candidates can count on an intensely motivated base. David Lauter, Kyle Kim and Armand Emamdjomeh Early voters are valued by both campaigns, and particularly so in this scandal-tossed year; once cast, the verdict cannot be changed if the voter\u2019s sentiment shifts, except in rare instances unlikely to affect the election\u2019s outcome. And they are also protection, particularly in the Midwestern and Northern states, against weather than might complicate efforts to get to the polls on election day. There is no certain connection between the early-vote winners and the ultimate results. Until election day, it will be impossible to assess whether those who cast ballots early are the same ones who otherwise would have shown up on Tuesday, or whether they dramatically expanded the pool of voters. And at least one key state, Pennsylvania, has little early voting, meaning that the results will rest on Tuesday\u2019s turnout. Clinton officials said in a conference call Friday that their early-voting efforts\u00a0had targeted those who don\u2019t always show up, so that they would broaden their overall number of voters. \u201cOur strategy all along was not just to bank the biggest lead that we could, but to bank the voters who have the lowest propensity to turn out,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. Locking those voters down also helped free Clinton to concentrate in the final days of the race on places where the majority of votes are cast on election day. She was in Detroit and Pittsburgh on Friday and headed to New Hampshire and Philadelphia in coming days. \u201cMichigan is one of these states that doesn\u2019t have early voting,\u201d she pointed out at Detroit\u2019s Eastern Market. \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the country going to states that are already voting \u2026 but Michigan votes on Tuesday.\u201d KYLE KIM AND EDMUND SANDERS Trump campaigned in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on Friday, emphasizing his contention that Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency due to corruption. As he has in recent days, he also encouraged early voting. Those studying the numbers say there has been an uptick in voters who rarely cast ballots, or who never have. The latter category is particularly valuable to Clinton, since younger voters side with her lopsidedly. Mook portrayed the Democratic effort as a blazing success and took to task the decidedly lower-profile effort by Trump to draw out early voters. \u201cWe have so far not seen a surge from the Trump camp and his voters,\u201d Mook said. \u201cAnd if he hasn\u2019t banked his votes by this point, he\u2019s going to have an even taller task.\u201d But if Democrats are bragging about an advantage, the numbers paint a more nuanced picture: Voting is up among many groups, including those who would be reliably considered Trump voters. Looking at the vote in North Carolina, for example, University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald said that the women\u2019s vote had increased 11.8% over the 2012 totals. That would aid Clinton, based on her fairly strong standing among women. Yet at the same time the men\u2019s vote had increased by 10.4%, McDonald said. That would accrue to Trump. Both candidates have tried to boost early voting in the last several weeks. Clinton arrived in Ohio the day before the close of registration in mid-October, and two days before the start of early voting, a travel pattern she has kept up in other states. Ohio remains one of the campaign\u2019s biggest challenges; although Democrats were catching up in early votes as the final weekend before the election neared, Republicans had outdistanced them early on. Clinton has sent President Obama ; his wife, Michelle; former President Bill Clinton; Vice President Joe Biden ; and two senators \u2014 Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts\u2019 Elizabeth Warren \u2014 to battleground states to increase early voting. Obama won the White House twice on the strength of a muscular get-out-the-vote effort, building a coalition of African Americans, the young and women. Clinton\u2019s desired coalition is somewhat different. The turnout rate for African Americans slumped early on, a circumstance the president\u2019s visits to important states has been meant to address. Turnout by black voters seems to have increased over the last few days. Clinton is far more dependent than was Obama on women and Latinos \u2014 the latter a group that has not always shown up for their favored candidates. This year, however, they are. In Florida, according to officials there, Latinos already have obliterated their turnout for the entire 2012 election. In Nevada, Cancela says she expects Latinos to make up at least 20% of the electorate, 2 points above the 2012 mark. The results among women are striking as well. Of the 21 states studied by TargetSmart, women accounted for more than 55% of the electorate in 15. In North Carolina, women had cast almost 57% of the early votes, several points above their strength in voter registration. The same was true in Ohio, and in two states worrying Democrats \u2014 Wisconsin and Michigan. Women do make up the majority of voters in those states, but in each case were showing up in proportions that exceeded their registration advantage. In Florida, women made up 60% of the Democratic early-voting sample to less than 38% for men, a factor of 5 points over the registration gap. Women also had a gender gap of more than 4 points among Republicans and independents. \u201cThe nearly 23-percentage-point gap among Democrats is eye-popping,\u201d said Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida professor who analyzes voting. The question is what proportion of the votes of different subgroups is aligning with either candidate. Clinton has made a big pitch for the support of suburban Republican women in key states, a vote that usually goes to the Republican nominee. Until the election day ballots are counted, it won\u2019t be known how successful her efforts have been. Similarly, a boost in Democratic early voters would be a strong sign for any other party nominee. But this year, Trump has attracted many blue-collar Democrats, particularly in the Midwest, so he too could benefit from a surge in the opposite party. In any case, by the time the polls close Tuesday, many more voters may have cast ballots than anyone might have predicted. \u201cThere\u2019s been this theory that since the election has been so overwhelmingly negative, that would depress turnout,\u201d said Bonier. \u201cThe early-vote data suggests so far that\u2019s not the case, that we are headed toward a high-turnout election.\u201d Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty.

The 58-year-old Carlisle camps out with friends who go by the names Cactus, left, and Cowboy. (Alex Halperin / For The Times) Alex Halperin Larry Carlisle was down on his luck, stricken with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and injuries from having been beaten up when he was a cab driver. So six months ago he left Oklahoma City and set off for a new life in Pueblo, Colo. It was, he said, \u201can oasis.\u201d \u201cIn my ailments, I\u2019ve turned to cannabis,\u201d he elaborated. His plan is to start a fish farm. But for now, the 58-year-old Carlisle camps out with friends who go by the names Cactus and Cowboy, eating what they can scrape together from food stamps , soup kitchens and dumpsters. They are part of a homeless population that has grown dramatically since the county embraced the pot industry. More than anywhere else in Colorado, Pueblo tied its future to the marijuana\u00a0 jobs, tax revenues and other economic benefits touted by legalization advocates around the country. But almost three years after legalization took effect in Colorado, Pueblo is reconsidering that strategy. On Tuesday, voters will decide whether to ban recreational marijuana businesses. There are two essentially identical measures up for vote \u2014 one for the city of Pueblo, the other for outlying Pueblo County, where all of the recreational businesses are currently located. Backers of the proposals say the industry has oversold the economic benefits and become a drain on local hospitals and law enforcement. The companies and their supporters say those problems have been overblown and that any issues are\u00a0 easier to address when regulated enterprises rather than criminals are selling the drug. How the measures will fare is a mystery, because there haven\u2019t been any public polls. With marijuana initiatives on the ballot in several states, the drug could soon be legal for recreation or medicinal use in as many as 29 states . As the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, Colorado is being closely watched by other places trying to decide how to regulate pot. The Colorado law, approved by voters in a 2012 referendum, left it up to each of the 335 cities and counties to decide what sort of businesses to allow. More than 70% banned pot business outright, according to CannaRegs, a firm that tracks local marijuana laws. Some municipalities held citizen referendums. In Pueblo, decision-making fell to local officials. The county commissioners saw marijuana as an opportunity to revive the fortunes of a place that never recovered from the closure of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company steel mill in the 1980s. \u201cWe all got real poor, real quick,\u201d said Lucinda Gallegos, a marketing consultant whose father and other relatives worked at the mill. \u201cWe went from wearing Nikes and Levi\u2019s to Pro-Wings and Sassoons.\u201d Besides industry-friendly regulations, Pueblo also offered marijuana growers cheap and abundant land and labor, access to water and enough sunshine to cultivate in greenhouses rather than in far more expensive, artificially lit indoor spaces. While Denver, about 100 miles to the north, is the hub of the state\u2019s marijuana industry, Pueblo has become its second city. The county is now home to nearly 200 growing operations, processors and shops that supply marijuana for recreational use. In a county of just over 150,000 people, the industry employs about 1,300, according to a local trade group called Growing Pueblo\u2019s Future. Among the businesses is Los Sue\u00f1os Farms, which claims to be the largest legal cannabis farm by acreage in North America. It employs 80 people, about a third of whom have college degrees, with a payroll of about $2 million. That money is going to \u201crents, cars, housing and food,\u201d said one of its major investors, Bob DeGabrielle, a real estate developer from North Carolina. Pot taxes have helped fund construction at the local high school, road improvements, scholarships for local students and the new Institute of Cannabis Research at Colorado State University Pueblo. Sal Pace, a county commissioner, said that as legalization spreads across the country he hoped Pueblo could one day become the \u201cNapa Valley of Cannabis.\u201d But proponents of getting rid of the recreational marijuana industry say any benefits are far outweighed by its burdens. \"I don't believe it's even paying its own way,\u201d said Charlene Graham, a former deputy chief of the Pueblo police and head of Citizens for a Healthy Pueblo, which wants to ban pot businesses. Rising homelessness has become a key campaign point. Posada, a homeless services organization, has assisted 5,486 people this year, up from 2,444 for all of 2013, the year before legalization for recreational use took effect. \u201cWe\u2019re importing poverty,\u201d said Anne Stattelman, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThis is already a vulnerable community,\u201d and now the new arrivals from out-of-state want to use \u201cColorado like their mother\u2019s\u00a0basement.\u201d Many arrive on Interstate 40 from Texas, Oklahoma and other conservative states in the Southeast without legal marijuana or state-subsidized Obamacare for the poor. Pueblo isn\u2019t the first town where drivers can legally buy marijuana, but it\u2019s the first one large enough to offer social services. And its cost of living is among the lowest in the nation. Other proponents of banning pot businesses say the industry has damaged the reputation of the town. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a negative for our community to be regarded as a center for a drug culture,\u201d the Pueblo Chieftan editorialized in its support of the measures. Proponents also point to concerns about organized crime. Police have conducted several raids this year on homes where pot is being grown to illegally ship and sell out of state. But the marijuana industry and it backers say that banning businesses would have no bearing on whether people grow weed in their own homes. The accuse marijuana opponents of saying anything in an effort to turn back legalization. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting a group of prohibitionists,\u201d said Jim Parco, an economics professor at Colorado College who owns a local dispensary. Pro-pot forces also downplay concerns about rising homelessness. Pace, the county commissioner, said the new arrivals are to some degree to be expected in a boom town and not a problem that\u2019s worth killing the county\u2019s newest industry. If voters ban marijuana businesses, it could create new problems for Pueblo. DeGabrielle said he and other investors in the industry are prepared to sue the county to recoup their money. \u201cI\u2019m participating in a legal, authorized, state approved industry,\u201d he said.

Tony Briscoe , Dan Hinkel and Genevieve Bookwalter Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Chicago transformed into a sea \u2014 and a river \u2014 of Cubbie blue Friday as the city celebrated the Cubs ' historic, if still somewhat surreal, World Series triumph. A massive crowd turned out for a parade and rally \u2014 dubbed \"Cubstock 2016\" by manager Joe Maddon \u2014 that finally rewarded the loyalty of the team's long-suffering fans. It was a party 108 years in the making, a three-hour bash in which players choked back tears and repeatedly paid tribute to a fan base that no longer has to wait until next year. \"We've asked a lot of you and put you through a lot,\" Cubs President Theo Epstein said. \"Let's be honest, for a while there, we forgot the 'not' in try not to suck.\" The city that works apparently took a collective day off as city officials estimated about 5 million people attended the World Series celebration. For that number to be accurate, it would mean a crowd nearly twice the city's population took part, and that it dwarfed the estimates for the 2005 White Sox party and 2015 Blackhawks parade. It was just the third parade in Cubs history. Though they did not have a procession after winning the 1908 World Series, there were parades after the team won National League pennants in 1932 and 1938. \"I have had so many emotions,\" fan Allie Kutrubis said of the Cubs victory celebration. \"Most of the time it doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm being punked.\" Caption A city's love for the Cubs at parade and rally Chicago came out to support the 2016 World Series champion\u00a0Cubs during a parade and rally on Nov. 4, 2016.

(Grace Wong / Chicago Tribune) Cubs fans crowd the Great Hall at Union Station and rush for trains on the platform after relishing a world championship in Chicago on Nov. 4, 2016. (Grace Wong / Chicago Tribune) The rally, at Grant Park, marked the team's first public appearance since defeating Cleveland on Wednesday to win the World Series, not including left fielder Ben Zobrist 's impromptu autograph session Thursday outside his North Side home. A native of downstate Eureka and the series' most valuable player, Zobrist told the crowd that the team pushed through the postseason's tougher moments for the city's sake. \"This team answered the bell,\" he said. \"This ballclub pulled through for all of you.\" The celebration was pushed back about 50 minutes as some players were late arriving at Wrigley Field because of the snarled traffic near the ballpark. The crowd accepted the delay with relatively good cheer, a byproduct, no doubt, of already having to wait more than a century for a championship. \"People from all corners of the city are coming together for something good,\" longtime fan Marie Leaner said. \"It's been a long time coming, and I don't mean just 108 years either.\" When the rally finally began, first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who caught the final out in Game 7 after third baseman Kris Bryant fielded the ball, gave the game ball to team co-owner Tom Ricketts in what has become somewhat of a Chicago tradition. Former White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko made the same gift to owner Jerry Reinsdorf at the team's 2005 celebration. \"He sacrificed everything to make this happen for this city,\" Rizzo said of Ricketts. \"It only seems right to hand it over to him.\" Rizzo also struggled to control his emotions when he introduced catcher David Ross, who plans to retire. He credited Ross with teaching him \"how to become a real winner\" and said he was grateful the catcher was \"going out a champion forever.\" Indeed, Ross came out to the day's loudest applause and promptly took a picture of the crowd. \"How about a selfie?\" he asked. \"Everybody, hands up!\" Dropping into the crowd Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune A fan falls from the light pole as they celebrate the World Series champion Chicago Cubs a rally in Grant Park in Chicago on Nov. 4, 2016.

(Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) The rally ended with country singer and Illinois native Brett Eldredge leading the crowd in a joyful version of \"Go Cubs Go\" in what was arguably the happiest singalong in Grant Park history. Ross, Rizzo, and center fielder Dexter Fowler served as enthusiastic backup singers, while pitcher Travis Wood ripped off his sleeveless camouflage shirt and sang bare-chested for the crowd. \"You are like extended family to me,\" Fowler told the crowd. \"I'll love you all forever.\" Along the 6-mile parade route, people lined rooftops and stood a dozen deep on sidewalks to catch a glimpse of the team, which traveled from Wrigley Field to Grant Park atop double-decker buses. The crowds chanted, \"Let's go, Cubs!\" and waved to the players as the city bid farewell to the longest drought in professional baseball and the team's reputation as lovable losers. En route to the park, the team buses crossed over the Chicago River, which was dyed blue in tribute to the historic championship. \"This is the biggest sports event in Chicago,\" said Jim Murphy, of Glenview. \"This is the one we've been waiting on.\" Fans packed public transit before dawn in an effort to make their way downtown for the celebration. Metra trains faced delays as they tried to accommodate suburban passengers on what the commuter rail service said was one its busiest days in history. The Grant Park gates opened at 8:30 a.m., with a tide of blue rolling into the rally site. Fans who waited for hours ran toward the staging area just south of Balbo Drive, where radio highlights from the Cubs' historic championship run played over the public address system. But Peter Torres, 28, and Colin Hines, 27, both from Elk Grove Village, devised a plan to skip the crowds and secure themselves a spot in the front row. The two woke up at 4:30 a.m. and caught the first train they could to the Loop. ",

About a half-hour later, it sent another alert saying a suspect was in custody and the area was safe. The three people were being treated at a hospital, but it was unclear how badly they were hurt. According to CBS New York , one of the people being treated was the suspect.\u00a0 No charges had been filed by Friday evening, according to the Middlesex County prosecutors\u2019 office and Rutgers\u2019 police department. The names of the three people weren\u2019t released. Eyewitnesses described pools and trails of blood at the scene.\u00a0 Two students claim they jumped into action after hearing a woman\u2019s cries for help, CBS New York reports .\u00a0 \u201cIt sounded like a struggle, so I thought maybe there was a fight, but it sounded like a girl screaming in pain,\u201d Stephen Mourad said. \u201cI saw a girl sitting in a chair and professors bringing towels to put on her wound somewhere around here, if I remember, and she was sitting in a chair with paramedics around her,\u201d Nathan Gabriel added. Gabriel said he believes the girl is a professor\u2019s assistant at the business school. Ultan Cullen said he was walking into the business school when the first police officer arrived on the scene. \u201cHe was flooring it through and just like going straight to the other side of the road and just runs right out of the car and into the building,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cJust cop car after cop car started showing up.\u201d Cullen said he soon saw an ambulance pull up and paramedics carry a man out on a stretcher. \u201cThere was a lot of blood,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cHe had one of his arms propped up in the air. It was really messy.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump is favored by men (+11 points), whites (+19), and whites without a college degree (+33). \u00a0 Clinton leads among women (+13 points), blacks (+74), and voters under age 30 (+17). \u00a0She\u2019s also ahead by 11 points among the one-in-five who have already voted (50-39 percent). They split the support of whites with a college degree: \u00a0Trump gets 45 percent to Clinton\u2019s 42 percent. \u00a0 In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney won this group by 14 points (56-42 percent).\u00a0 Both candidates are consolidating their bases, but Clinton outperforms Trump: \u00a0she gets 90 percent among Democrats and he gets 85 percent of Republicans. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract Trump has an 8-point edge over Clinton among independents (41-33 percent). \u00a0That\u2019s down from his 13-point advantage last week (41-28 percent). \u00a0Johnson takes 11 percent. Trump has a six-point strength-of-support advantage, as more of his backers (71 percent) say they \u201cstrongly\u201d support their candidate than Clinton supporters (65 percent). \u00a0In addition, his folks (63 percent) are more likely than hers (54 percent) to be \u201cextremely\u201d interested in the race. \u00a0 That enthusiasm gap may be one consequence of the renewed FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. \u00a0How much damage has the scandal really done to her campaign? Some 74 percent of voters say the FBI investigation won\u2019t make a difference to their vote, and four percent actually say it makes them more likely to support her. \u00a0Yet 21 percent say it makes them less likely to vote for her, including 37 percent of Republicans and 21 percent of independents. \u00a0Among Democrats, 5 percent say it makes them less likely to support Clinton, while 7 percent say it makes them more likely. \u201cThe FBI action forced Clinton to play defense in the closing week,\u201d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. \u00a0\u201cBut the number of voters who will move out of her column to someone else will likely be minimal. \u00a0If the election really comes down to the wire, perhaps it makes a difference in a battleground.\u201d \u00a0Anderson conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. Then again, the 59 percent who are bothered by Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server is actually down a touch from 60 percent who felt that way at the end of September. \u00a0 For 39 percent it\u2019s \u201cno big deal.\u201d \u00a0The emails bother almost all Republicans (92 percent), most independents (69 percent), but just one in five Democrats (22 percent). While over half of voters, 51 percent, doubt the FBI will find anything that will lead to criminal charges against Clinton, some 47 percent think it will -- including 42 percent of independents and 16 percent of Democrats. Related Image Expand / Contract So it\u2019s not surprising that by a 16-point margin, more voters are concerned scandals would have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on a Clinton administration (70 percent) than a Trump administration (54 percent). \u00a0Moreover, nearly half (46 percent) are \u201cvery\u201d worried about scandals if Clinton were elected, up from 37 percent three weeks ago. Then there\u2019s Clinton\u2019s honesty rating. \u00a0It ticked up one point to 31 percent. \u00a0It was a record-low 30 percent among likely voters last week. \u00a0For Trump, 38 percent say he\u2019s honest and trustworthy. \u00a0Honesty is one of the only personal traits where he bests her. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract \u201cMuch of the recent commentary misses the big picture here,\u201d says Shaw. \u00a0\u201cThe specific charges matter less than the fact that they reinforce the broad sense that Clinton\u2019s dishonest. \u00a0If late-breaking voters decide to make a leap of faith with Trump, it will be because of this feeling.\u201d Fifty-eight percent say Clinton has the temperament to serve effectively as president, compared to just 40 percent for Trump. While both candidates remain unpopular, Clinton\u2019s lost her advantage here. \u00a0Her net negative rating is 13 points (43 favorable vs. 56 unfavorable). \u00a0Last week she was underwater by 8. \u00a0At the same time, Trump\u2019s net negative 12 points (43 favorable vs. 55 unfavorable) improved a bit from negative 14 a week ago. Roughly 15 percent of likely voters dislike both Clinton and Trump. \u00a0Who are they backing? \u00a0Clinton and Johnson garner 25 percent each from this group, and 23 percent go for Trump. The number who think Clinton will win the election is down, yet a majority still thinks she\u2019ll be the next president: \u00a056 percent, down from a high of 66 percent three weeks ago (October 10-12). \u00a0Still, only 35 percent expect a Trump victory. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract Most of her supporters remain confident in their candidate, as 90 percent think it will be Madame President, down slightly from 93 percent in mid-October. \u00a0At the same time, Trump\u2019s supporters are feeling more confident: 69 percent think he\u2019ll win, up from 56 percent. \u00a0 Meanwhile, 80 percent of Clinton supporters say they\u2019ll accept the election outcome if Trump wins. \u00a0That\u2019s down from 88 percent last week. \u00a0That number holds steady among Trump supporters, as 58 percent say they\u2019ll accept the outcome if Clinton wins. \u00a0 Nearly three-out-of-four will go to the voting booth unhappy with Uncle Sam: \u00a046 percent are \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the way the federal government is working and another 27 percent are \u201cangry.\u201d \u00a0Trump backers are four times as likely as those supporting Clinton to say they\u2019re angry (44 vs. 11 percent). \u00a0 Clinton\u2019s lost ground on the issues. \u00a0For example, the new poll finds likely voters trust her over Trump on making decisions about using nuclear weapons by 16 points. \u00a0That\u2019s down from a 25-point lead in mid-October. \u00a0 The two candidates tie on nominating the next Supreme Court justice and handling terrorism. \u00a0Clinton has consistently been preferred on the court, and in five of the six previous polls she had the edge on terrorism. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract And Trump\u2019s current 8-point advantage over Clinton on handling the economy is his largest yet. \u00a0 The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,211 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from November 1-3, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 1,107 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for results among registered voters and plus or minus 3 points among likely voters. \u00a0 ",

Slager, who is white, is accused of killing Scott, an unarmed black man, at a traffic stop on April 4, 2015, in North Charleston, South Carolina, when Slager was a North Charleston Police Department officer. Witness video that surfaced shortly after appears to show the moment Slager fatally shot Scott as he ran away. The video garnered national attention, propelling Slager into the spotlight. Slager, 34, has pleaded not guilty to murder. Slager told investigators he shot Scott because, while they were on the ground, he said Scott grabbed his Taser and pointed it at him. Feidin Santana, 25, who filmed the video, was called to testify by the prosecution today, recounting the moments before, during and after he witnessed the deadly shooting. Santana said he was walking to work when he saw \"a man in a green shirt, identified as a black man, running towards me.\" He said a \"few seconds later I saw a second person, an officer, chasing the guy.\" \"I froze. Because I didn't know what was going on,\" he said. \"I decided to stop and see what was happening.\" Dash Cam Video Shows Moments Before Deadly South Carolina Shooting \"I decide to walk a little bit more and they enter to an empty lot,\" he said. \"And that's when I ... start running to get there.\" Santana said he went to the alley and could see the two men. Scott was on the ground, he noted. Santana said an \"electric sound\" caught his attention as he approached, \"and a punch from the officer to the person that was on the ground.\" He said Scott was making \"an uncomfortable sound.\" He said he decided to approach the scene and start recording. \"It was a lot of movement from both men,\" he said. \"I continued hearing the electric sound as I was approaching to the fence. They were moving a lot. The black man ... he just tried to get away from the Taser that I was hearing. But I didn't know [at the time] that it was a Taser -- I just knew that it was something electric sound.\" Santana said the officer's left hand was trying to control Scott and the officer was on top of him. He said he never saw Scott on top. Then both men stood up, Santana said, and he saw \"the black man trying to get away and the officer trying to control the person.\" \"Both men get up very quick,\" he said. He said the officer was holding onto Scott but Scott was able to get away. \"After he got away ... it's been something that I didn't expect,\" Santana said. \"[The officer] shoot the man running from him. And he shoot until he gets on the ground.\" Santana said he continued recording and when the shooting was over, he walked toward Scott's body. When asked by the prosecution if he noticed an object on the ground dropping between the two men, Santana said, \"I saw something fell. I didn't know anything what it was.\" When asked by the prosecution what the officer did, Santana said, \"He went there and arrested him. I hear him saying 'put your hands on the back.'\" But Scott wasn't moving, Santana said. \"He handcuffed him,\" Santana said. Then the officer bent down and picked up the object, Santana said. The officer who shot Scott, who Santana identified in court as Slager, then walked back toward Scott, Santana said, and more officers showed up at the scene. Santana said another officer started checking on Scott. Santana said he stopped recording and talked to a black officer at the scene to find out if Scott was OK. \"I went over there and asked the black officer if he was OK. And he gave me, I would say, a positive response,\" Santana said. He said the officer told him Scott was OK and told him to leave. Santana continued recording for about a minute, he said, as other officers arrived. He said he told police that he witnessed what happened. Santana's footage was played in court, showing Scott running away, Slager firing multiple shots and Scott falling to the ground. As the video was played, the families of Scott and Slager both appeared calm. Santana told the court he did not alter his videos. \"I'm a barber, not a technician,\" he said. The prosecution asked if Santana saw Scott going toward Slager with a Taser and Santana said no. Slager's attorneys have said the video doesn't show the whole struggle between Slager and Scott and does not give the perspective of events from Slager's point of view. During cross-examination, the defense asked if Santana heard Slager yell \"Taser\" and Santana said no. \"As soon as I got there, the electric sound is what made me locate them,\" he said. The defense asked if he saw a fight between Slager and Scott. \"There was no fight,\" Santana testified. He said he saw the officer on top controlling Scott. \"Scott was trying to get away from the Taser and the officer was in position of control,\" he explained. The defense asked Santana who -- Slager or Scott -- was holding the Taser. Santana said he didn't see the Taser in Scott's hands. He said he could clearly see one of Slager's hands even though there was a lot of movement. The defense asked Santana if he heard Slager announce that shots were fired and if Slager had called out that the suspect was down. Santana responded that he heard talking but he did not know what was said. The defense asked Santana if any more shots were fired after Scott was shot and fell to the ground. Santana replied, \"When he got on his knees and he fell down completely I didn't hear any shots.\" Santana did say that after the shooting Slager had told Scott to put his hands on his back. When the defense asked Santana if he tried to alert emergency services to help Scott, he said no because he thought police would be doing that as part of their job.

(AP Photo/John Locher, File) (Photo: John Locher, AP) Election Day could be doomsday \u2014 or just another day \u2014 for Wall Street. With just days until the presidential election, Wall Street remains on high alert. Investors are in risk-watch mode thanks to a bitter campaign punctuated by narrowing polls, candidates with low likability ratings, and unexpected bombshells like claims of Donald Trump groping women and the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Here are three shocks that could rock markets: A TRUMP WIN It would be a big surprise, one\u00a0few investors saw coming. Even Trump says if he pulls off the upset it would equate to \u201cBrexit times 10,\u201d or way bigger than the shock waves the United Kingdom sent through markets in June when it voted to exit the European Union. Stocks will likely sell off if Trump triumphs. Barclays says the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index has downside risk of 11% to 13% if the billionaire businessman wins. Declines could be as big as \"10% to 15%,\u201d according to a paper by University of Michigan's Justin Wolfers, Dartmouth's Eric Zitzewitz and the National Bureau of Economic Research. And don\u2019t rule out a bear market if Clinton loses, warns Don Luskin, chief investment officer at financial research firm TrendMacro.\u00a0\u201cIf Trump wins \u2026 stocks will drop at least 20% just like that,\u201d Luskin told USA TODAY. \u201cBecause markets hate to be surprised\u00a0and hate it when the conventional wisdom is dead wrong. Just look at the reaction to Brexit.\u201d Why are investors so averse to Trump? Too many unknowns and too little political experience, says Thomas Block, Washington policy strategist at FundStrat Global Advisors. Will holiday hiring save U.S.from another weak month for job growth? \u201cI don't see how investors can envision what his administration would look like,\u201d Block told USA TODAY. \u201cPlus I don't see his harsh rhetoric and take-no-prisoners negotiating style working with strong-willed legislators.\u00a0Relations with allies in Europe and Asia could seriously deteriorate, and China, with its large U.S. Treasury holdings, would be very anxious.\u201d A DEMOCRATIC SWEEP Financial pain would also likely be felt if Clinton takes the White House and Democrats retake control of the Senate and House of Representatives, although odds still favor the GOP holding the House.\u00a0\u201cA Democratic sweep is a tail risk,\u201d says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. Policy Research for Cornerstone Macro. An election hat trick would enable Democrats to take fuller control of the legislative process, making\u00a0it easier for Clinton to push through her less business-friendly platform of higher taxes on the rich and investors, more regulation of businesses and spending programs. Wall Street prefers political \"gridlock\" where legislative decisions related to trade, immigration, taxes, health care and regulation are made with input from both parties. \u201cA split chamber probably delivers the gridlock the market prefers,\u201d says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney. POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE OR SCANDAL Since World War II stocks have risen 2%, on average, from Election Day until year-end, thanks to the lifting of election uncertainty, according to\u00a0CFRA,\u00a0an independent stock and fund research firm. But what happens if uncertainty doesn\u2019t lift once the votes are counted? Or if violence breaks out, as 51% of voters fear, according to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll? How would investors react if Clinton wins but her legal troubles related to use of a personal email server while secretary of State worsen and spark a post-election crisis. What if Trump wins and the more than six dozen pending lawsuits now open against him and his company are tried\u00a0while he's president, or if his controversial policies on trade and immigration get fast-tracked, or his claims of a rigged election gain traction? Here's how much the average American spends on child care \u201cConsumer confidence often increases after a presidential election, but perhaps not this time since both candidate are viewed as so flawed and unlikable,\u201d says Gregory Valliere,\u00a0chief strategist at Horizon Investments. \u201cIf Trump (loses and) proclaims the election is rigged, perhaps a quarter of all Americans may agree with him. That's hardly a prescription for higher consumer confidence.\u201d Violence in the aftermath of the election, if it occurs, is viewed as a short-term hiccup. \u201cIf it (violence) was widespread and had economic consequences, such as consumers staying home and not spending, it could (impact markets),\u201d says Luschini. Adds Luskin: \u201cMarkets are not typically rattled by violence in the streets. Remember 1968 \u2014 riots, assassinations, shootings all over the world \u2014 stocks just went higher and higher, through it all.\u201d 219 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 69 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2feK8Yb ",

David Becker/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption David Becker/Getty Images Samsung is recalling nearly 3 million top-load washers \u2014 but not front-load machines \u2014 following reports of excessive vibration that could cause the lids to blow off. David Becker/Getty Images Samsung is offering repairs, refunds and replacements for about 2.8 million top-load washers after receiving hundreds of reports of machines vibrating excessively \u2014 in some cases, so much that the lids became detached. The consumer electronics company, still reeling from a total recall and halt of its Galaxy Note 7 phone, is recalling 34 models of its top-load washing machines, manufactured as far back as March 2011. (Front-load washers are not affected by the recall.) This is one of the YouTube videos in which people say a Samsung top-load washer effectively exploded. Micah Martin YouTube \"The washing machine top can unexpectedly detach from the washing machine chassis during use, posing a risk of injury from impact,\" according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission . The agency says Samsung has received 733 reports of \"excessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassis\" \u2014 and nine reports of people injured from being hit or falling, including a broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The company says the issues typically occur when bedding, water-resistant or bulky items are washed on a high-speed cycle. As people wait to fix, exchange or return affected washers, Samsung and the CPSC say they should use the delicate or waterproof cycles when washing such items. Amid a growing number of reports of machines shaking, falling over and sending parts flying, Samsung said in September that the cases were rare and recommended using lower-speed spin cycles for bulky items. Owners of the recalled top-load washers qualify for one of three options: free repair with extended warranty; a rebate toward any new washing machine, including free installation; or a full refund if the machine was bought within the past 30 days.

Robert Durst in March 2015 after his arraignment in a federal weapons case in New Orleans. (Gerald Herbert / Associated Press) Richard Winton Contact Reporter New York real estate heir Robert Durst arrived in Los Angeles on Friday and will be arraigned next week on a murder charge in the 2000 slaying of\u00a0his friend Susan Berman, the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office said. The arrival of Durst, who is scheduled to appear\u00a0at the Airport Courthouse Monday afternoon, marks the latest chapter in a legal saga that was reinvigorated last year when the New York aristocrat was featured in the HBO documentary series\u00a0\u201cThe Jinx.\u201d Durst, 73, had been due to be transferred to Southern California\u00a0by Aug. 18 from a federal prison in Louisiana, where he had pleaded guilty to a weapons charge. \u201cWe have been ready for some time. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re going to start proceedings,\u201d Durst\u2019s attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told The Times on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get his day in court.\u201d DeGuerin said he expected a preliminary hearing in the case to take place in the spring and for the trial later in 2017. Durst was booking into the Los Angeles Police Department jail Friday at 1:20 p.m. Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss See the \"Jacuzzi of Despair,\" \u00a0 the Pentagon's proposed recruiting rules \u00a0and Wilshire Blvd's urban development .

(Molly Hennessy-Fiske / Los Angeles Times) Caption Street Vendors protest Street Vendors protest Durst has\u00a0insisted he had nothing to do with Berman's fatal shooting. The six-part HBO series explored the disappearance of Durst\u2019s first\u00a0wife, Kathie, who went missing in New York\u00a0in 1982,\u00a0and the slaying of\u00a0Berman, a writer\u00a0who was found dead in her Benedict Canyon home in 2000. Police believe\u00a0Durst killed Berman because she planned to speak to New York prosecutors about Kathie\u2019s disappearance. In 2003, a Texas jury acquitted\u00a0Durst even after he admitted killing his neighbor, chopping the body into pieces and then dumping them  into Galveston Bay. Durst at the time was living in Galveston under an assumed identity as a mute woman in a threadbare apartment that cost $300 a month. At the sensational trial, Durst's legal team, spearheaded by DeGuerin, laid out an elaborate argument of self-defense. \"Morris Black died as a result of a life-and-death violent struggle over a gun that Morris Black had threatened Bob Durst with,\u201d DeGuerin told jurors and they would believe him. Before the series\u00a0finale of \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d Durst disappeared from his Houston condo, prompting a manhunt that ended in New Orleans. Federal prosecutors filed a\u00a0weapons\u00a0case\u00a0against him after FBI agents found a loaded revolver in his hotel room\u00a0there.\u00a0 Durst pleaded guilty to a\u00a0weapons charge and\u00a0was sentenced in April to seven years and one month in federal prison In a letter to a Times reporter, Durst wrote that he is eager to come to Los Angeles to defend himself. \u201cI\u2019d rather be going to California on my own, but I\u2019m anxious to get to trial to prove I didn\u2019t kill Susan Berman,\u201d Durst wrote.\u00a0\u201cYou couldn\u2019t print what I think about \u2018The Jinx.\u2019 I didn\u2019t kill Susan Berman, and I don\u2019t know who did.\u201d ",

By John Wagner , Sean Sullivan and Abby Phillip November 4 Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @WaPoSean Follow @abbydphillip Democrat Hillary Clinton will spend the final days of the election trying to protect her lead in key battlegrounds, reflecting a tightening, unusually volatile race against Republican Donald Trump. Trump, whose electoral college prospects are narrower, is banking on a late-hour attempt to win at least one blue-leaning state \u2014 and to dramatically drive up turnout in rural areas in a collection of battlegrounds where he must prevail on Tuesday. With four days left on the campaign trail, both candidates and surrogates blitzed across the country Friday, making stops in states where polls have narrowed in recent days. The frenzied final days also include celebrity appearances \u2014 Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 headlined a get-out-the-vote show with Clinton in Cleveland, and Stevie Wonder played a \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d show on her behalf in Philadelphia \u2014 and endless ads airing in battleground states. Clinton stopped on Friday in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two states where she has consistently led Trump, as well as Ohio. She brought a new urgency to her message at a rally in Pittsburgh, focusing on the danger that she said a Trump presidency would present to the country and asking supporters to imagine Trump taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol and being in charge of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cThink about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cImagine how easy it would be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war, not just a Twitter war at 3 in the morning.\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called on supporters to vote and volunteer in the final days of the election. Rapper Jay Z closed the concert by performing his 1998 single \"Hard Knock Life.\" (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Clinton urged supporters to stage \u201can intervention\u201d with friends and family members who plan to vote for Trump by explaining to them that \u201canger is not a plan.\u201d \u201cSometimes the fate of the greatest nations comes down to a single moment,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. This is in your hands.\u201d [ Clinton up 47-44 in Post-ABC News Tracking Poll, despite Trump\u2019s 9-point edge on dealing with corruption ] Trump continued a tour of small towns in rural counties on Friday, first stopping at a country club in Atkinson, N.H. He continued to Wilmington, Ohio, between Cincinnati and Columbus. He planned to end the day in Hershey, Pa. Besides reminding supporters of Clinton\u2019s scandals, Trump focused on promises to return lost manufacturing jobs, protect residents from what he described as dangerous undocumented immigrants and get rid of crime in faraway major cities. \u201cDon\u2019t let the pundits, the politicians or the media tell you what kind of a country you have,\u201d Trump said in Wilmington. \u201cDon\u2019t let them limit your dreams because they want to limit your dreams. You can have any future you want.\u201d The final-days travel schedules of Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, reflect a dire need to win vote-rich swing states including Florida and North Carolina, where Trump is to campaign on Saturday. The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a dead heat nationally. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Lately, Trump has made many stops in out-of-the-way places, most of which are already certain to break heavily for Republicans. His advisers say they think he can win over rural white voters by a much bigger margin than Republican nominee Mitt Romney did in 2012 \u2014 and come away with significantly more votes, which they gamble will offset his weakness among suburban Republicans in battleground states. As part of a bid to steal a blue-leaning Midwestern state, Trump is also set to return on Sunday to Wisconsin, a state that a Republican nominee has not won since 1984. The many white blue-collar voters in the state have raised hopes among Trump and his allies that he has a chance there. Although Clinton, in contrast, needs only to hold on to leads in the states where she is ahead, she intends to fight for votes beyond those, her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said Friday. \u201cWe built our operation for a wide map from the beginning of the campaign,\u201d Mook said in a phone call with reporters. And while Trump is trying to drive up turnout among white voters, Clinton is putting a premium on minority voters, who polls suggest are likely to break heavily in her favor. Mook touted what he called \u201cthe Hillary coalition\u201d \u2014 Latinos, Asians, African Americans, suburban women and millennials \u2014 that he said has on the whole been turning out in strong numbers in battleground states where there is early voting. Mook said the campaign is confident that its early-voting totals will amount to a \u201cfirewall\u201d on Election Day, or, as he described it, \u201ca lead that Donald Trump is incapable of overcoming.\u201d He cited several states where Clinton stands to benefit from the strong early-voting turnout, particularly among Latinos, including Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. In Michigan on Friday, Clinton made a pitch aimed at boosting African American turnout in a state where her advisers have suggested Trump could be doing better, given its manufacturing losses and large population of \u00adworking-class whites, Trump\u2019s strongest constituency. At a rally in Detroit, Clinton talked about issues including criminal justice reform, college affordability and systemic racism, all of which are of particular importance to black voters. She also criticized Trump for portraying the lives of black people as being \u201call about crime and poverty and despair.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure that we get the numbers that we need,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, told reporters earlier Friday. \u201cMichigan is a state that we feel like we\u2019ve got a lead, and we want to make sure that we hold that lead. \u201cWe want to make sure that we get the vote out and make sure people are enthusiastic. We want to end with a crescendo of enthusiasm,\u201d he said. The Clinton campaign also began airing television ads in Michigan for the first time in the general election this week. Trump will make one last swing through two Western battleground states: Colorado and Nevada. He also plans to campaign in Iowa, a state where he has performed consistently well in the polls in recent months. And Trump is slated to hold his final event before Election Day on Monday night in New Hampshire, the state where he notched his first primary win. Polls have shown Clinton leading in New Hampshire for a long time, but recent surveys signal a turn in Trump\u2019s direction. New Hampshire\u2019s many white \u00adworking-class voters \u2014 as well as its independent streak \u2014 make it a volatile place where Republicans hope voters will break late toward Trump. Clinton\u2019s schedule is being driven in part by a desire to make stops in states that have not had early voting, in hopes of providing a burst of momentum ahead of Tuesday. The schedule of Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, illustrates the campaign\u2019s dual focus on trying to protect leads as well as contest close states. On Monday, Kaine is to return to his home town of Richmond to rally voters in Virginia, a state where Clinton\u2019s lead has dwindled in recent weeks. The plans of the two tickets also highlight a Democratic advantage that will be on full display in coming days: a much stronger and deeper bench of surrogates that can fan out across the country. Besides Clinton and her running mate, the Democrats are also dispatching a sitting president, a former president, a sitting vice president, a popular first lady and Clinton\u2019s former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Obama campaigned on Clinton\u2019s behalf Friday at two rallies in North Carolina, a state that could go either way on Tuesday and where early-voting participation has lagged among African Americans, a key part of the president\u2019s coalition in 2008 and 2012. And on Monday, a full slate of Democratic stars plans to join forces in Philadelphia for a final push of Clinton\u2019s candidacy. Joining her, the campaign says, will be Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and Bill and Chelsea Clinton. Wagner reported from Washington.

By Matt Zapotosky and Amber Phillips November 4 at 7:25 PM Follow @mattzap Follow byamberphillips New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s political career sustained a serious blow Friday after two of his former allies were found guilty of conspiring to shut down the nation\u2019s busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to support the governor\u2019s reelection bid. While Christie wasn\u2019t charged in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d trial, the case produced a steady stream of new allegations against the governor that probably will haunt him as he tries to position himself as a significant player in a potential Donald Trump administration. Christie has been a forceful advocate of the Republican presidential candidate and serves as head of Trump\u2019s transition team. On the first day of the trial, which began early last month, prosecutors alleged that Christie knew about the plan to tie up traffic on the George Washington Bridge as it was happening. A key witness who admitted his own role in the affair would later testify that when he told Christie about the plot, Christie laughed. Christie has said that he did not know about the bridge plan and repeated that claim in a statement Friday. The New Jersey governor said he was \u201csaddened\u201d by the choices those close to him made. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict does not change this for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them. No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.\u201d Two former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, say they will appeal their conviction for their roles in the \"Bridgegate\" lane closure scandal. (Reuters) But Christie, once a rising Republican star with aspirations to win the White House, has been stained by the scandal, which suggested a darker side to his tough-guy image. \u201cIt taints his legacy,\u201d said Brigid Harrison, a political science and law professor at Montclair State University. \u201cNo one will be able to think about Gov. Christie\u2019s tenure in office without having it be colored by these convictions.\u201d Christie\u2019s job-approval ratings are already at their lowest point. A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll released in mid-October found that just 21 percent of residents approved of the job he was doing, down from 26 percent in June. And more than half of voters \u2014 52 percent \u2014 said they thought there was \u201csufficient proof\u201d that Christie was aware of the lane closures and didn\u2019t try to stop them. William E. Baroni Jr., the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, were both convicted of all the counts against them, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in New Jersey said. During the trial, the defense for Kelly and Baroni tried to pitch them as Christie\u2019s scapegoats. Prosecutors described them as the governor\u2019s \u201cloyal lieutenants\u201d intent on helping their boss run for president. In an interview Friday with Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier, Trump was asked whether he still has confidence in Christie. His answer was lukewarm. \u201cWell, I have great confidence in him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have not been following the trial. I don\u2019t know really.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens. But I do like him very much, and I do have confidence in him, and I hope it all works out well for him.\u201d In the past Trump had been critical of Christie over the matter, saying last December, during the Republican primaries in which the two were rivals: \u201cHe totally knew about it.\u201d Speaking at the Peterson Fiscal Summit in Washington, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) predicted that the widely covered traffic scandal involving former aides and appointees will not harm his political future as he weighs a run for president in 2016. (Associated Press) It is unlikely that Christie will be charged in the case, unless new evidence were to emerge to help bolster the assertions of witnesses. Baroni and Kelly were\u00a0charged with conspiring to misuse Port Authority property by fraud and conspiring to deprive people of their civil rights. The way federal prosecutors told it, the two Christie allies were seeking to punish Mark Sokolich, the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, for refusing to support Christie\u2019s reelection bid. Working with David Wildstein,\u00a0a former Port Authority executive, they orchestrated a shutdown of the lanes and toll booths on the George Washington Bridge and tried to cover their tracks by claiming that the closures were part of a traffic study. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty, testified as a witness for prosecutors in the case, claiming that he told Christie what was happening during a 9/11 memorial service, and that Christie laughed. \u201cWe were all very relaxed,\u201d Wildstein testified, according to an account of the trial by the New York Times . The Times said a prosecutor asked Wildstein if he was bragging, and Wildstein responded: \u201cVery much so.\u201d NJ.com reported that she also said that officials in the governor\u2019s inner circle were aware of what was happening and seemed unconcerned. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d she said, according to NJ.com. Attorneys for Kelly and Baroni did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Read more: ",

Wochit Darel Sterner held court in his barber shop in West Liberty for decades, talking the Cubs. (Photo: Special to The Register) Darel Sterner held on through the dramatic ending\u00a0because he had waited for decades for the Chicago Cubs to win a World Series. On Wednesday night during Game 7, his family surrounded him, whispering the score in his ear. Three hours later, he died. They believe he is in heaven celebrating. Sterner, 85, of West Liberty was a well-known barber in town, running his shop for 61 years. A Cubs banner hung on the wall and many ballgames of near misses and stubborn hopes were analyzed between the snaps of the shears. \u201cHe was an ornery cuss. He played pranks on everybody that came in there,\u201d said his son Durk, of Sterner Barber Shop, in downtown West Liberty. \u201cThe stories that came in and out of that place \u2013 a lot of \u2018em we\u2019ll never hear.\u201d He took his family to games in Chicago through the years and they adopted his passion. The family of uncles and cousins and kids would regularly gather on Sunday afternoons to watch the Cubs game. Sterner brought his 1900 barber\u2019s chair and Cubs banner to his West Liberty home when he closed the downtown shop and continued to cut hair in his basement for the last 20 years. Darel Sterner's century-old barber's chair is draped with a Chicago Cubs banner after the West Liberty barber died shortly after the Cubs won the World Series. \u00a0(Photo: Special to The Register) Each year, Sterner hoped for better for the Cubs while lowering ears. He suffered a stroke the day before Christmas last year, and while it slowed his work, it didn\u2019t squelch his enthusiasm for this year\u2019s team. He really liked those boys, especially Ben Zobrist. His health faded as the playoffs wore on, and the family gathered in his home as he took hospice care. By Game 7 of the World Series, he was drifting in and out. Donna Sterner, his wife of 62 years, was there to watch the deciding game, as were children Durk and Darla, Durk\u2019s wife Jill and their two adult children, Holli and Nick. A few feet away in the bedroom, Darel had his own TV near the bed, the Cubs game against the Cleveland Indians roaring in his ears. The broadcast on his TV was delayed a few seconds, so the family silently cheered each pitch in the next room. They checked on Sterner as he drifted out, whispering the score in his ear. Hospice workers told them that hearing was the last thing to go. RELATED: ",

By Paul Farhi November 4 at 2:40 PM Follow @farhip Fox News anchor Bret Baier apologized Friday for reporting that federal investigators had determined that Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server had been hacked and that an investigation would lead to an indictment of Clinton after the election. In fact, Baier said, after checking with his sources, there is no evidence at this time for either statement. Baier, the anchor of Fox\u2019s evening newscast \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d went on the air Wednesday to report that the FBI had determined that Clinton\u2019s private server, which she used while serving as secretary of state, had been hacked by \u201cfive foreign intelligence agencies.\u201d He further said on Thursday, during an interview with Fox\u2019s Brit Hume, that a separate FBI investigation \u2014 of the charitable Clinton Foundation \u2014 was \u201clikely\u201d to lead to an indictment of Clinton after Tuesday\u2019s election. Both statements, if true, would be explosive developments in the late stages of the presidential campaign between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly invoked the alleged atmosphere of corruption around the Clinton Foundation and the security risks involved in Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state as reasons not to vote for Clinton. The Post\u2019s Rosalind Helderman breaks down the latest developments of the controversies involving the FBI less than a week from Election Day. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) But neither of his reports about Clinton were accurate, Baier acknowledged Friday morning in a \u201cFox News alert\u201d conversation with Fox News anchor Jon Scott. Baier said he relied on a single anonymous source within the FBI for his report about an alleged hack of the server: \u201cI was quoting from one source about his certainty that the server had been hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies. . . . As of today there still are no digital fingerprints of a breach, no matter what the working assumption is within the bureau.\u201d He added, \u201cAll the time, but especially in a heated election, on a topic this explosive, every word matters no matter how well sourced.\u201d He went on to describe his comment to Hume about an indictment \u2014 which he has previously called \u201cinartful\u201d \u2014 as more than that. \u201cI explained the phrasing of one my answers to Brit Hume on Wednesday night, saying it was inartful the way I answered the last question about whether the investigations would continue after the election. And I answered that yes, our sources said it would, they would continue to, likely, an indictment. \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t just inartful. It was a mistake. And for that I\u2019m sorry. I should have said they will continue to build their case. \u201c\u2018Indictment,\u2019 obviously, is a very loaded word, Jon, especially in this atmosphere, and no one knows if there would or would not be an indictment no matter how strong investigators feel their evidence is. It\u2019s obviously a prosecutor who has to agree to take the case and make that case to a grand jury.\u201d As an addendum, he added, \u201cWe stand by the sourcing on the ongoing, active Clinton Foundation investigation and are working to get sources with knowledge of the details on the record and on camera, hopefully today.\u201d lifestyle ",

Among the 13 battleground states that will decide the election Tuesday, Clinton\u00a0 leads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Virginia. But  other states vital to victory are now \u201cneck-and-neck.\u201d They include Florida, North Carolina and Colorado. And Trump has a lead in Ohio.\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Nancy Cordes reports on the Clinton campaign.\u00a0 \u201cDo we want a president who doesn\u2019t know when to shut up,\u201d billionaire Mark Cuban said at a campaign event Friday. It was two against one in Pittsburgh today with Clinton and Mark Cuban both pelting Trump\u2019s lack of filter. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you some of what I heard coming from my opponent it was really hard not go, \u2018whaaaaaat did you just say?!\u2019\u201d Clinton said. Clinton campaigned in Pittsburgh on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016.\u00a0 CBS News As they spoke, the campaign\u2019s massive, long-planned get-out-the-vote effort was kicking into gear across the country. \u201cIt is tedious but we do it with great love,\u201d said one campaign worker. Clinton aides say nearly 1 million people have signed up to volunteer over the next four days. \u201cHi, my name Barth I\u2019m calling from the Hillary Clinton campaign,\u201d says one caller as he cold-calls. \u00a0\u00a0 The operation is run by veterans of the vaunted Obama turnout effort in 2008 and 2012. Using public data, the campaign has already rated every potential voter on two sliding scales of 1 to 100 - one scale for the likelihood they will vote, another for their level of support. High support, low-propensity voters get the most visits. \u201cYou would be doing yourself and your family and the country, Florida, all of the above a huge service if you get out to vote early for her,\u201d one campaign worker says as she goes door-to-door.\u00a0 In the south, Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis has been leading hundreds of early voters on what he calls a \u201cmarch to the polls.\u201d Clinton aides insist their ground game advantage is enough to repel a late Trump surge in some battleground states and even Democratic states like Michigan, where Clinton was today after polls showed Trump getting a little too close for comfort here.

With his arm around a tearful Kelly, Critchley said, \"This is the first step in a process...This is not over.\" \"I am innocent of these charges and I am very, very looking forward to this appeal,\" said Baroni. Prosecutors primarily relied on their star witness, David Wildstein, another former Christie former ally and a Port Authority official who has already pleaded guilty. Wildstein went as far as to say that top Christie allies used the Port Authority, which controls the George Washington Bridge, as a \"goody bag\" to sway local Democratic politicians to endorse Christie's re-election bid in 2013. Wildstein also painted Kelly \u2014 who wrote the now-infamous Aug. 13, 2013 email in which she declared, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" \u2014 as a mastermind of the plan. Wildstein had described in great detail a 9/11 memorial ceremony at Ground Zero in 2013, when Wildstein and Baroni spoke to the governor about the plan. Baroni and Kelly have maintained that they believed the lane closures were for a traffic study and not a political retribution plot. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said outside of the court, \"We are gratified that the jury saw the evidence the same way we did\" but he was also peppered with questions from reporters about why Christie was never charged. Fishman seemed to suggest that there was not enough evidence. \"I'm not gonna answer the question why I did or didn't pursue anybody in particular,\" he said. \"What I will say is exactly what I said at the news conference that we had when the indictment was returned in May of 2015. Which is at the time, we indicted people-- only the people who we believed we had evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, which as you know is the constitutional standard, evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to convict in this courthouse.\" Democratic Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, who previously co-chaired a state legislative panel investigating the scandal, called on lawmakers to once again look into Gov. Christie's actions in the aftermath of Friday's verdict. \"With two of the highest ranking members of the Christie administration found guilty of criminal conduct, it is time to find out what the governor knew, when he knew it, and what actions he took in relation to the shutdown of the lanes on the George Washington Bridge. During the trial, numerous witnesses offered testimony under oath that directly contradicts Governor Christie's public statements,\" said Wisniewski, who is considering a bid for governor. He added that Christie \"will not tell the truth unless compelled under oath.\" Mayor Sokolich, meanwhile, called for political reform. \"It is now proven this was retribution aimed at me. There was a complete disregard for thousands of others put in harm's way. This can never happen again. This trial shed a very bright light on a sad set of circumstances in NJ. If reform does not come from this, we should all be ashamed.\" Aliyah Frumin ",

    "text": "FILE -- \u00a0(iStock) Monday was chicken nugget day in the cafeteria at Tennessee\u2019s Farragut High School. \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with nugget day at high school,\u201d senior Carson Koller told me. \u201cThe nuggets were great.\u201d Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! Carson, an Eagle Scout, was so hungry he got six nuggets instead of five. The 17-year-old had no idea that extra nugget would result in a trip to the principal\u2019s office and make headlines across the fruited plain. Carson, who has a spotless academic record, was accused of stealing and was suspended for \u201ctheft of property\u201d \u2013 all over a single chicken nugget that he had actually paid for. \u201cI got a text from my son saying he had been suspended for one day for taking a chicken nugget,\u201d Carson\u2019s mom, Carrie Koller Waller told me. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d She immediately checked online and discovered that not only had he paid for the extra nugget, but the school had added an additional charge. Mrs. Waller alerted her Facebook friends to the Great Nugget Controversy of 2016 and posted a screenshot showing her son was no thief. \u201cMy Eagle Scout, Captain of the drumline, all-around hardworking and well-rounded teenager just got suspended from a day of school (and after school band practice) for taking an extra chicken nugget from the lunch line. Maybe I'm missing parts of the story, but in the past, the cafeteria has never hesitated to charge Carson double for the amount of food he's taken/eaten. Today he gets taken to the Principal's office for this. When I questioned the need to suspend over such an offense, I was told that they have to be consistent with people who take extra food and that somewhere in the Knox County Handbook there is something to this effect. I almost don't have words here.....but aren't there kids who get free lunches? Does my son really deserve suspension over hunger, especially when they have the ability to charge his lunch account for the items (which they did!!!!)? How is it theft if he paid for it??? It's food. FOOD!!! Not weapons. Not drugs. Not alcohol. Not cheating on a test. Not inappropriate clothing or profanity. Not fighting. Not calling in threats. Not vandalism. I am shaking my head over this and not sure what to do....laugh, punish, argue, dress him up as a nugget bandit, or let it go. Does the suspension matter on his records?\u00a0 #justnow #cantmakethisstuffup \u00a0 #mylife \u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be talking to the principal over a chicken nugget,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not something a parent ever imagines.\u201d After the school district investigated Mrs. Waller\u2019s evidence they realized they had made a terrible mistake. \u201cPrincipal Siebe reviewed the matter and found there was some misinformation about the details, and after further investigation, corrected the situation,\u201d a district spokesperson told USA Today. Carson was allowed to return to school and his official school record was expunged of the Great Nugget Controversy of 2016. \u201cMy main concern was they suspended him so quickly before getting all the facts,\u201d Mrs. Waller said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy with how the principal reacted.\u201d By the way, Carson was charged $2.75 for that extra nugget. That\u2019s a mighty pricey nugget, folks. It is unfortunate the school not only overreacted, but falsely accused a good teenager of wrongdoing. But they made things right and they deserve credit for that. And Carson deserves a little credit, too. So I reached out to the local Chick-fil-A in Knoxville and arranged to provide Carson with a gift card -- so he can eat as many chicken nuggets as his heart desires. \u201cSounds like I\u2019m going to have to treat my principal to lunch \u2013 on me,\u201d Carson said. That\u2019s one mighty good kid, America. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

By Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake November 4 at 12:59 PM Follow @thefix Follow @aaronblake The Fix's Chris Cillizza breaks down the state of the 2016 election with just a few days to go. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The last week has been a tough one for Hillary Clinton. Last Friday's announcement by FBI Director James Comey that emails considered \u201cpertinent\u201d to the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server had been discovered accelerated a bump in Donald Trump's poll numbers that had begun before that news hit. National polling was the first to tighten \u2014 the WaPo-ABC Tracking Poll showed the Democratic presidential candidate up three points on Friday \u2014 but swing-state polling has followed suit. CNN, as of Friday morning, even had Clinton below 270 electoral votes for the first time in a long time. CNN\u2019s new electoral map shifts in Donald Trump\u2019s favor, but Hillary Clinton still holds the advantage https://t.co/aFG8b8TeOA pic.twitter.com/d3wBeqrbXT \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 4, 2016 We at The Fix aren't there just yet. But we are making three changes in our electoral-map ratings \u2014 all of which favor Trump. The biggest move is Ohio \u2014 from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Republican.\u201d The Buckeye State, which went for Barack Obama in each of his two races, has long been one of the friendlier swing states for Trump, thanks in large part to its older and whiter (as compared with the country as a whole) population. The last two polls in the state have shown Trump up five points, and the\u00a0 RealClearPolitics polling average gives the Republican nominee a 3.3-point edge. That fits more with our \u201clean\u201d category than our \u201ctoss-up\u201d one. Clinton isn't giving up on the state, however \u2014 she'll be in Cleveland on Sunday. [ Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win ] We're also moving Arizona from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Republican.\u201d The state appears to have reverted back to its default partisanship in the aftermath of the Comey announcement; Trump has led in the last five polls in the state , including leads of five points in the last two surveys: Finally, we are moving New Hampshire from \u201clean Democratic\u201d to \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Like Ohio and Arizona, the Granite State has inched toward Trump over the past week and is now among the closest races in the country. Two of the three most recent polls conducted in New Hampshire have shown a dead heat. Even with these changes, however, Clinton still has 290 electoral votes leaning toward her or solidly for her, while Trump has 209. And, even if Trump sweeps the states we currently rate as toss-ups, he is only at 248 electoral votes \u2014\u00a022 short of what he needs to be elected president. Our full ratings of the battleground states are below. Stay tuned for one final update to our electoral ratings on Monday. Toss-up (39 electoral votes) ",

Perez , USA TODAY 7:41 p.m. EDT November 4, 2016 Ezekiel Elliott. 12252 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE The woman who accused Dallas Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliott of abusing her for five days in July also called police on him months before the NFL Draft, alleging she suffered left shoulder pain from the force of Elliott pushing her up against a wall during an argument that turned physical. An incident report obtained Friday by USA TODAY Sports from the Aventura (Fla.) Police Department said there were no visible signs of injury and that the accuser declined to go to the hospital after police responded to a call about an altercation at Elliott\u2019s apartment Feb. 12. Elliott wasn\u2019t arrested. Terry Chavez, spokesperson for the Miami-Dade State Attorney's office, told USA TODAY Sports the case was not forwarded to prosecutors for review. Chavez said there's no record the accuser pursued charges on her own. USA TODAY Sports does not identify alleged victims of domestic violence. It\u2019s unclear whether the NFL, which continues to investigate the July allegations against Elliott that were reported to police in Columbus, Ohio, is aware of the previous allegation in Florida and whether it could influence a decision on potential discipline under the personal conduct policy, given the report was filed before Elliott was drafted in April. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league doesn\u2019t comment on active and ongoing investigations. Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott, accuser had violent incidents, prosecutor believes Elliott, who was in South Florida training for the draft at the time of the February allegation, told police the woman \u201cbecame angry over a social media incident and upset because she was asked to leave his apartment, and go back to Ohio,\u201d according to the incident report. When the woman refused, the situation escalated, Elliott told police, according to the report. He said he attempted to go to his room and lock the door but the woman prevented him from doing so by grabbing him around the waist, and he pushed her to get her off him, the report said. With no physical signs of injury and no independent witnesses, a report was taken and the woman was advised how to file charges, the report said. The woman received an icepack for her injury and left the scene in an Uber without further incident, the report said. In the report, Elliott is referred to as a friend \u201cWith Benefits\u201d of the woman, who told authorities in Ohio in July that Elliott was her ex-boyfriend and they had lived together for three months. In a statement made as part of the Ohio case, Elliott denied he dated the accuser or lived with her, though he acknowledged the two had a sexual relationship and he helped her with rent and co-signed a car lease with her. The Columbus City Attorney\u2019s Office declined to file criminal charges in the July case, citing conflicting and inconsistent information across all incidents. Robert S. Tobias, principal assistant city attorney in Columbus and director the department\u2019s prosecution resources unit, recently told USA TODAY Sports in emails he believes there were a series of interactions between Elliott and the woman \u201cwhere violence occurred,\u201d but he couldn\u2019t conclude exactly what happened between them. In response to a question this week about the allegation in Florida, Tobias told USA TODAY Sports his office had no prior knowledge of a police report and didn\u2019t attempt to acquire it or look into the matter at all. However, the alleged incident did come up in the woman\u2019s intake interview, in which she claimed Elliott \u201chas lost control\u201d and injured her in the past. Attorney for Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott blasts media, says NFL should end probe Elliott's attorney, Frank Salzano, declined comment Friday on the Florida allegation. Salzano released a statement Monday stressing his client wasn't charged in Ohio, criticizing the media for focusing on the NFL's investigation and implying the league's probe only remains open because of recent controversy surrounding its handling of the Josh Brown case. \"We firmly believe that the NFL should promptly close its investigation which is only open because of their apprehensiveness stemming from the recent scrutiny it has come under for its handling of other domestic violence matters,\" Salzano's statement said. \"Notwithstanding the forgoing, we remain firm that the NFL will clear Mr. Elliott of any wrongdoing and this matter can be finally put to rest.\" Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told USA TODAY Sports last weekend Elliott\u2019s dealings with women didn\u2019t come up in the team\u2019s evaluations before it drafted him No. 4. The NFL applies a lower burden of proof than the justice system. Even absent criminal charges, a player can be placed on paid leave if an investigation leads the commissioner to believe a violation may have occurred, and disciplined further \u2013 including a suspension \u2013 if \u201ccredible evidence establishes\u201d a violation did occur. Prohibited conduct includes \u201cactual or threatened physical violence against another person.\u201d Elliott leads the NFL with 799 rushing yards this season for the Cowboys, who are on a six-game winning streak entering Sunday\u2019s game at Cleveland.

Arkin and Cynthia McFadden Share advertisement U.S. military hackers have penetrated Russia's electric grid, telecommunications networks and the Kremlin's command systems, making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the U.S. deem it necessary, according to a senior intelligence official and top-secret documents reviewed by NBC News. American officials have long said publicly that Russia, China and other nations have probed and left hidden malware on parts of U.S critical infrastructure, \"preparing the battlefield,\" in military parlance, for cyber attacks that could turn out the lights or turn off the internet across major cities. It's been widely assumed that the U.S. has done the same thing to its adversaries. The documents reviewed by NBC News \u2014 along with remarks by a senior U.S. intelligence official \u2014 confirm that, in the case of Russia. Watch Cynthia McFadden on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt for More U.S. officials continue to express concern that Russia will use its cyber capabilities to try to disrupt next week's presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials do not expect Russia to attack critical infrastructure \u2014 which many believe would be an act of war \u2014 but they do anticipate so-called cyber mischief, including the possible release of fake documents and the proliferation of bogus social media accounts designed to spread misinformation. On Friday the hacker known as \"Guccifer 2.0\" \u2014 which U.S. officials say is a front for Russian intelligence \u2014 tweeted a threat to monitor the U.S. elections \"from inside the system.\" Related: Exclusive: White House Readies to Fight Election Day Cyber Mayhem As NBC News reported Thursday, the U.S. government is marshaling resources to combat the threat in a way that is without precedent for a presidential election. The cyber weapons would only be deployed in the unlikely event the U.S. was attacked in a significant way, officials say.

James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that U.S. hacks into the computer infrastructure of adversary nations such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea \u2014 something he says he presumes has gone on for years \u2014 is akin to the kind of military scouting that is as old as human conflict. \"This is just the cyber version of that,\" he said. In 2014, National Security Agency chief Adm. Mike Rogers told Congress that U.S. adversaries are performing electronic \"reconnaissance\" on a regular basis so that they can be in a position to disrupt the industrial control systems that run everything from chemical facilities to water treatment plants. \"All of that leads me to believe it is only a matter of when, not if, we are going to see something dramatic,\" he said at the time. Rogers didn't discuss the U.S.'s own penetration of adversary networks. But the hacking undertaken by the NSA, which regularly penetrates foreign networks to gather intelligence, is very similar to the hacking needed to plant precursors for cyber weapons, said Gary Brown, a retired colonel and former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command, the military's digital war fighting arm. \"You'd gain access to a network, you'd establish your presence on the network and then you're poised to do what you would like to do with the network,\" he told NBC News. \"Most of the time you might use that to collect information, but that same access could be used for more aggressive activities too.\" Play ",

Health and Human Services Secreta... \u201cWe need to act now to better understand, contain and stop the spread of this drug-resistant fungus,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in an agency news release. \u201cThis is an emerging threat, and we need to protect vulnerable patients and others.\u201d Of the 13 U.S. cases reported between May 2013 and August 2016, seven are described in the CDC\u2019s Nov. 4\u00a0Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The other six remain under investigation. The seven cases described in the report occurred in four states: Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. All of the patients had serious underlying medical conditions and had been hospitalized an average of 18 days when diagnosed with\u00a0C. auris\u00a0infection. Four patients died, the CDC said, but whether the fungal infection was the direct cause of the deaths remains unclear. Two patients had been treated in the same hospital or long-term care facility and had nearly identical fungal strains. This suggests that\u00a0C. auris\u00a0can be spread within health care facilities, investigators said. In June, the CDC issued a clinical alert about the global emergence of\u00a0C. auris. It requested that laboratories report cases and send patient samples to state and local health departments and the CDC. Since then, CDC has been investigating reports of\u00a0C. auris\u00a0with several state and local health departments. Further investigations of possible cases are expected as awareness of the infection increases. Without specialized laboratory testing,\u00a0C. auris\u00a0infection is easily misidentified as another type of\u00a0Candida\u00a0infection, the report said. This means patients may not receive appropriate treatment. Also, 71 percent of the\u00a0C. auris\u00a0strains from U.S. patients had some resistance to antifungal drugs, the agency noted. This makes it difficult to treat. While the strains in the U.S. patients were related to strains in South Asia and South America, none of the patients had traveled to or had direct links to those regions. This means they likely acquired their infections locally, according to the CDC. \u201cIt appears that\u00a0C. auris\u00a0arrived in the United States only in the past few years,\u201d said Dr. Tom Chiller, chief of the CDC\u2019s Mycotic Diseases Branch. \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.

The statement came shortly after the Spartanburg County Coroner confirmed to NBC News that an unidentified body had been found on the same property where Kala Brown, 30, was found chained by the neck and ankle in a large metal storage container. The owner of the property, Todd Kohlhepp, a registered sex offender, was arrested Thursday morning and charged with kidnapping, jail records show. At a bond hearing for Kohlhepp Friday afternoon, 7th Circuit Solicitor Barry Barnette said Brown told authorities that on August 31st, she and her boyfriend, David \"Charlie\" Carver, went to Kohlhepp's 95-acre property. It was there that she witnessed Kohlhepp shoot Carver, according to Barnette. Authorities found numerous guns on Kohlhelpp's property. Barnette said it was \"unbelievable how much ammo [Kohlhepp] had in his building.\" Todd Christopher Kohlhepp South Carolina SAVIN Barnette said he is confident there will be a murder warrant in connection with the case. Kohlhepp is expected back in court on January 19, 2017.

The Carver family released a statement Friday afternoon that reads, in part, \"At this time we know no more than what has been reported within the media or statements made by law enforcement. We ask that you continue to pray for Kala's healing and for David's safe return as well. In the meantime, we ask for some time to ourselves as we process events as they unfold.\" A massive investigation continued on the property. The body discovered in a shallow grave Friday morning has not yet been identified. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright told reporters at a press conference Friday afternoon it would be some time before that information is available. When asked how Brown is doing, the sheriff responded that \"she seems to be doing much better today.\" Rachael Trost ",

Brad Nelson Winters, artistic director of Terrapin Theatre, who was found murdered in his home Aug. 20, 2003. (Handout) After a 2003 night out drinking in the Boystown area, theater director Brad Nelson Winters kissed a friend good night, put her in a cab and stopped at a convenience store near his apartment to buy cigarettes, friends say. No one ever heard from the up-and-coming theater director again. After he didn't show up at his job at Northwestern University, Winters was found dead in his bloodied apartment two days later with stab wounds to his naked, decomposing body. The 38-year-old had also been strangled. On Friday, more than 13 years later, authorities alleged Winters was killed by Ramon Smith, a laborer now living in Dallas who has an extensive criminal history with convictions for aggravated robbery, assault, prostitution and theft. Smith, 48, was linked to the killing by DNA after he was required to submit a sample of his genetic material to authorities after being convicted of a drug offense in Texas, prosecutors said. The DNA matched blood found on Winters' living room floor and bathtub, and his DNA was found underneath Winters' fingernails, said Assistant State's Attorney Jullian Brevard. A Cook County judge ordered Smith held on $1 million bail. He used a wooden cane during his appearance at the Leighton Criminal Court Building. At the hearing prosecutors offered no motive for Winters' slaying but said police did not find any signs of forced entry at his apartment. Prosecutors gave no indication that Smith made any admissions to investigators. Winters' family still lives in Ohio, where he grew up on a dairy farm, raising cows before discovering theater. Reached by the Tribune on Friday, his brother, Brian, said the family had long wondered if his slaying would ever be solved. Seeing the packed Wrigleyville bars on TV during the World Series had made him think of how much Winters \u2014 a huge Cubs fan \u2014 would have loved seeing the team's drought end, his brother said. Then a day after the team won, the family heard Chicago police had made an arrest in his killing. It came more than a year after Winters' mother died. \"There's still a big hole there,\" Winters said of his brother's loss. \"We're in a whole nother generation now, and he is a picture on the mantel \u2014 that's it.\" Five years before his death, Winters, a smart, witty man who started in Second City, had been named artistic director of the Terrapin Theatre, a low-budget but long-established troupe with a reputation for carefully crafted productions of progressive new works. A play he directed that spring had been nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Awards prize, and the theater had plans for two more plays that season, including a dark comedy in which Winters was set to act. \"He was doing exactly what he was put on this earth to do, to steer a theatrical company,\" said James Freund, who just had been named the company's managing director at the time. Terrapin decided to forge ahead after an emotional meeting after Winters' death and a memorial service at Steppenwolf Theater that drew more than 150 people. The troupe staged his final two plays at the Athenaeum Theatre but didn't survive long. \"At the end of that season, we were pretty much emotionally spent,\" said Scott Letscher, who directed the final play. \"We just couldn't go on without him \u2014 he was that powerful of a figure,\" said Carrie Chantler, a close friend now living in upstate New York. His death had a dramatic impact on friends, altering their career paths. Chantler left theater and earned a journalism degree, while Freund opted for a more behind-the-scenes role and now works as Steppenwolf's social media director. \"It was sort of a reckoning if you will for many of us,\" Chantler said. \"From his death forward, life did change for all of us.\" \"Brad was an up-and-comer and a shining light,\" she said. \"It just feels so good to know this case may finally have some justice come to it.\" sschmadeke@chicagotribune.com ",

Effective immediately and until the voting is done, they are barred from hindering or delaying a prospective voter from reaching the polling place and casting a ballot. The order, issued by U.S. District Judge James Gwin, also applies to pro-Trump operative Roger Stone. It forbids questioning voters \"under the guise of the purported 'exit polling' or 'citizen journalist' operations organized and encouraged\" by Stone and a group called Stop the Steal. The judge acted after Ohio Democrats complained that Stone was planning to engage in his own version of exit polling, which they claimed was intended to hassle voters Gwin's order specifically bans unauthorized poll watching inside polling places as well as within a 100-foot buffer zone around the polls. It prohibits coming closer than ten feet to voters in line outside the zone. Banned practices include \"challenging or questioning voters or prospective voters about their eligibility to vote, or training, organizing, or directing others to do the same.\" In an apparent desire to be even-handed, the order also applies to \"groups associated with the Clinton for Presidency campaign.\" Similar lawsuits have been filed by Democrats in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, and Nevada.

Trey Gowdy delivers some expert-level self-deprecating humor in a new campaign ad filmed in a barbershop. Gowdy, a Republican running for a fourth term from Upstate South Carolina's 4th District, is being challenged by Chris Fedalei, a Democrat who is also from Spartanburg. With the tag line \"consistent conservative, inconsistent haircuts,\" Gowdy mocks his own ever-changing hairstyles, from youthfully spiky to the Draco Malfoy slick back. Gowdy's hair has even inspired a parody Twitter account and a Buzzfeed profile : This Man Has the Most Confusing Hair in Congress.

Prosecutors say Dani Mathers secretly photographed a 70-year-old woman in the nude while she was in the shower area of a Los Angeles fitness center. Privacy Policy In a pioneering prosecution against \u201cbody-shaming,\u201d the Los Angeles city attorney\u2019s office\u00a0on Friday filed criminal charges against a former Playboy playmate, alleging she\u00a0secretly photographed a 70-year-old woman in the nude while she was in the shower area of a Los Angeles fitness center. Prosecutors often use invasion of privacy charges against peeping Toms and people who conceal cameras to take sexually suggestive photos of women. But legal experts said this marks a rare time authorities have brought charges against someone over photos making fun of someone\u2019s weight. It comes amid growing awareness and outrage about \u201cbody-shaming\u201d \u2014\u00a0particularly common on social media. Prosecutors charged Dani Mathers, 29, with one misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy. Mathers is accused of posting an image of the woman on her Snapchat social media account in early July with a mocking caption about the woman's appearance, sparking a widespread public outcry. Mathers later\u00a0 apologized for taking a photo of the\u00a0woman in\u00a0a locker room shower at an LA Fitness\u00a0exercise center and posting\u00a0it online. \u201cThat was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that body-shaming is wrong. That is not the type of person I am.\u201d She said the photo was meant to be sent as a private message, but was posted publicly. Mathers\u2019 attorney, Thomas Mesereau, said his client did nothing illegal. \u00a0\u201cI am disappointed that Dani Mathers was charged with any violation,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never tried to invade anyone\u2019s privacy and never tried to violate any laws.\u201d City Atty. Mike\u00a0Feuer said Friday that it was important to send a message with the criminal charges filed against Mather. \"Body-shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences,\" he said. \u201cIt mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of 'perfect.' What really matters is our character and humanity. While body-shaming, in itself, is not a crime, there are circumstances in which invading one's privacy to accomplish it can be.\u00a0And we shouldn\u2019t tolerate that.\" Los Angeles police began an investigation in July after receiving a report of\u00a0\u201cillegal distribution\" of the image. LA Fitness officials reported the posting to police as well, officials said. Mathers shared the photo of the naked woman on July 13 with the caption: \u201cIf I can\u2019t unsee this then you can\u2019t either.\u201d Leonard Levine, a veteran Los Angeles defense attorney who has defended cases involving gym photos, said all those cases involved alleged voyeurs. This case is different because the motive for sharing the photo appears to be solely mocking the woman. \u201cI am not aware of any case where it was done other than where prosecutors alleged it a prurient interest,\u201d he said. Former prosecutor Dmitry Gorin agreed the circumstances here are unique. \u201cMost have some lascivious intent. In this case, the aspect of the shaming is a very unusual motive that I have not seen prosecuted before,\u201d he said. Lawyers for Mathers could say the alleged victim did not have an expectation of privacy, said Loius Shapiro, a Los Angeles defense attorney. \u201cMathers can argue, though, that a person has no expectation of privacy in the locker room when they are undressed and that the prosecution is simply trying to stick a square peg in a round hole because they don\u2019t have the evidence for the charge they really want to prove\u2026,\u201d he said. Digital technology has made it easier to secretly\u00a0capture\u00a0others\u00a0in their most private moments. Last year, a\u00a0prominent Washington, D.C., rabbi was sentenced to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to secretly recording 52 women as they prepared for a religious bathing ritual. In California, a U.S. Border Patrol supervisor admitted in federal court that he secretly recorded seven female co-workers in the bathroom of the Chula Vista office. Some states have increased the penalties for taking secret images, making it a felony. In New York, offenders can receive up to four years in prison for a first offense. Dr. Robyn Silverman, a body image \u00a0expert, said body-shaming is kind of an act of bullying. \"While the body-shaming aspect of this case is inexcusable, the main issue here is not that Ms. Mathers denigrated another woman online with rude or unflattering remarks,\" she said. \"Rather, Ms. Mathers, with both forethought and intent to humiliate and compare, photographed a naked woman, without her knowledge or consent, and then distributed it online for everyone to see and evaluate.\" \u00a0 ",

The same source said Obama, though, is \u201cworried about the consequences of taking such an action \u2013 the tsunami of outrage that would come his way, and possibly become a major footnote, or worse, in the history of the presidency.\u201d\u00a0 The outrage from Democrats in recent days has been matched by applause from Republicans, in a reversal from the summer -- when GOP lawmakers were grumbling about Comey's decision not to pursue charges in the Clinton case and Democrats praised Comey's professionalism.\u00a0 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, called Comey a \"hero\" and ripped Jarrett.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think Valerie Jarrett has any credibility here,\u201d he told Fox News. \u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Comey notified Congress last Friday that during an investigation of Clinton confidant Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband Anthony Weiner, FBI agents found indications that a laptop used by the disgraced congressman contained some emails related to the FBI\u2019s earlier probe of Clinton\u2019s private computer server. The disclosure, coming 11 days before the election, roiled the presidential campaign as top Democrats sprung into damage control. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNN, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s not in the right job.\u201d She added, \u201cI think that we have to just get through this election and just see what the casualties are along the way.\u201d New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called Comey\u2019s actions \u201cappalling,\u201d adding that he has lost \u201cconfidence\u201d in the director. Schumer\u2019s comments come on the heels of outgoing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accusing Comey of possibly violating federal law. In an Oct. 30 letter to Comey, Reid said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits government officials from using their positon of power to influence an election. Republicans blasted Reid for the letter.\u00a0 Meanwhile, as Democrats pile on the criticism, a new report in The Guardian seems to indicate many FBI agents are backing Donald Tump. \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d one agent told the paper. The unnamed agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel\u201d and is the reason why so many leaks about the investigation have been anti-Clinton and pro-Trump. FoxNews.com has not independently verified the claims made by the FBI agent. \u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement ",

(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) By Jenna Johnson , Abby Phillip and John Wagner November 4 at 9:08 PM Follow @wpjenna Follow @abbydphillip Follow @WPJohnWagner HERSHEY, Pa. \u2014 Declaring \u201cour country\u2019s gone to hell,\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday pledged to secure the borders, rebuild inner cities and end government corruption during a raucous rally here four days before the election. Trump boasted of tightening poll numbers in key battleground states as he laid out his vision for the country, which he said would include fixing \u201cinner cities,\u201d which he said are \u201cso bad.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re unsafe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou get shot walking to the store for a loaf of bread. They have no jobs. I say, \u2018Give me a chance, I will fix it.\u2019 \u2026 It will be a great thing. We have to fix it.\u201d Trump also knocked Clinton for staging a concert last week in Miami with pop star Jennifer Lopez and for planning another one Friday night in Cleveland with Jay Z, which also is expected to feature his wife, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles Carter, according to a person familiar with the details of the event. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to bring JLo or Jay Z,\u201d Trump told his crowd of more than 10,000 people. \u201cI am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar. No piano. No nothing.\u201d At a rally in Pittsburgh, Nov. 4, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton portrayed Republican rival Donald Trump as someone who would hurt low-income and middle class Americans economically. (The Washington Post) Trump appeared earlier Friday in Atkinson, N.H., and Wilmington, Ohio, part of a recent string in rural areas, where he is trying to boost turnout by white working-class voters. Besides reminding supporters of Clinton\u2019s scandals, Trump focused on promises to return lost manufacturing jobs, uplift mitary veterans and protect residents from what he described as dangerous undocumented immigrants. \u201cDon\u2019t let the pundits, the politicians or the media tell you what kind of a country you have,\u201d Trump said in Wilmington. \u201cDon\u2019t let them limit your dreams because they want to limit your dreams. You can have any future you want.\u201d [ Clinton up 47-44 in Post-ABC News Tracking Poll, despite Trump\u2019s 9-point edge on dealing with corruption ] Clinton, meanwhile, brought a new urgency to her message at a rally earlier Friday in Pittsburgh, focusing on the danger that she said a Trump presidency would present to the country and asking supporters to imagine Trump taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol and being in charge of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal. 1 of 8 Eight of the most memorable moments from the 2016 presidential campaign View Photos A look at some of the historic, amusing and cringe-inducing events of the race between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Caption A look at some of the historic, amusing and cringe-inducing events of the race between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Entering the race In June of 2015, Donald Trump entered the presidential race with a bang. After arriving to make the announcement on an escalator at Trump Tower, he would go on to make several explosive statements, including calling Mexicans rapists and promising to build a border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Richard Drew/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cThink about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cImagine how easy it would be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war, not just a Twitter war at 3 in the morning.\u201d Later, at a rally in Detroit, Clinton talked about issues including criminal justice reform, college affordability and systemic racism, all of which are of particular importance to black voters. She also criticized Trump for portraying the lives of black people as being \u201call about crime and poverty and despair.\u201d Clinton also dispatched her most potent surrogates around the country Friday. President Obama, Vice President Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders all stumped for Clinton. In Denver, former president Bill Clinton talked about everything \u2014 from his wife\u2019s work on special education to the credit ratings of millennials \u2014 assuring around 500 Democrats that they were on track to win. Obama appeared at a pair of North Carolina rallies, including one Friday night in Charlotte. \u201cThis should not be a close race, but it\u2019s going to be a close race,\u201d Obams said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be especially close in North Carolina. ... We\u2019ve got to work like our future depends on it, because you know what, our future depends on it.\u201d [ Hillary Clinton\u2019s retro ad strategy: apocalyptic Cold War pitches, updated ] Earlier in Fayetteville, N.C., Obama continued to assert that Trump is \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to be commander in chief and has a long track record of insulting minorities, the disabled, women and others. \u201cIf you disrespected women before you were in office, then you will disrespect women once you take office. If you accepted the support of Klan sympathizers, if you don\u2019t denounce them right away because you\u2019re not sure, well that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do once you\u2019re in office,\u201d Obama said. At Clinton\u2019s stop in Pittsburgh, businessman and reality television star Mark Cuban relentlessly needled Trump for potentially not being as wealthy as he claims and for lacking the temperament to be president. Cuban also claimed Trump could be bribed. \u201cIf Donald Trump, who rips off people for thousands, gets offered by some dictator somewhere, some despot somewhere $20 billion, do you think he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right for the country or do you think he\u2019s going to take the money?\u201d Cuban asked. \u201cDo you think he cares about you or his bank account?\u201d [ At Trump rally, former N.H. governor jokes about the Clintons\u2019 sex life ] Trump\u2019s surrogates continued to create headaches for his campaign. At the New Hampshire rally, former New Hampshire governor John H. Sununu joked that Clinton\u2019s husband does not want to have sex with her. \u201cDo you think that Bill was referring to Hillary when he said: \u2018I did not have sex with that woman?\u2019\u201d Sununu said, referring to former president Bill Clinton. A small crowd gathered at a country club laughed at the joke. One man shouted: \u201cYou mean Bill the rapist?\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign has yet to respond to the comment. Sununu was governor of the state in the 1980s and was later White House chief of staff under President George H.W. Bush. He is the father of former senator John E. Sununu and Christopher Sununu, who holds a local office and is running for governor. [ A Donald Trump adviser just called Clinton the c-word in a tweet ] While talking about how he plans to win Texas, Trump called the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, a \u201cwonderful guy.\u201d Miller called Clinton the c-word in a tweet. Also on Friday, two former aides to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who is chairing Trump\u2019s transition team, were convicted of all charges related to a plot to create a mammoth traffic jam on the nation\u2019s busiest bridge as political retribution. Three people, including the traffic jam\u2019s admitted mastermind, testified in federal court that Christie knew about it as it was happening. Christie, on Friday, continued to deny he knew about the plan. [ Chris Christie allies convicted in \u2018Bridgegate\u2019 trial ] The convictions are a coda to a huge scandal in a state where political misdeeds are as common as the traffic jam that started this one. Known as \u201cBridgegate,\u201d the scheme hobbled Christie as his national star was rising and imperiled his presidential campaign, which ended in February. Since then his approval rating has nose-dived in New Jersey, where only about 20 percent of residents surveyed believe he is doing a good job. But all of this has had little impact on Christie\u2019s standing within the Trump campaign, where the governor is tasked with spearheading Trump\u2019s transition to the White House should he win. On Thursday, Christie hosted a $5,000 a person fundraiser for Trump\u2019s transition team at a law firm office in Washington. [ Want to learn about the Trump transition? You\u2019ll have to pay $5,000 ] Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said Christie should step down from the campaign. \u201cRather than just crisscrossing the country and hop-scotching, talking about cleaning up the swamp, he might start by draining his own swamp and asking Mr. Christie to resign as the head of his transition,\u201d Podesta said of Trump. At a rally in Ohio, Trump said Clinton should fire Podesta and longtime aide Huma Abedin. The FBI said it found additional emails possibly pertinent to the Clinton investigation on a computer belonging to Abedin\u2019s estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner. Trump\u2019s campaign, which has said it will pass massive ethics reform, did not return a request for comment. Meanwhile, a federal judge on Friday ordered elections boards in three North Carolina counties to restore voter registrations canceled through a so-called \u201cindividual challenge law\u201d after the state NAACP sued over thousands of the challenges. U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs issued the ruling after an emergency hearing earlier in the week on NAACP allegations that at least three counties purged voter rolls through a process disproportionately targeting blacks. The ruling could affect several thousand voters in the swing state. Katie Zezima in Washington and David Weigel in Denver contributed to this article.

    "text": "A sheriff in South Carolina is trying to determine if a missing woman found alive could be linked to other disappearances. Suspect Todd Kohlhepp ... Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said they were pinging Brown\u2019s phone 2 days after she was reported missing. He says it pinged on the property where Brown was found. The Phone went dead after two days. Two weeks before they were able to get a search warrant for the property the sheriff\u2019s office flew over the property and saw it was extensive and need to get on the ground. Anderson Police say from early on they had no indication there was foul play, even with the cell phone pings. Brown left the hospital late Thursday and is staying with family, Herren said. The property includes grassy areas, some covered in waist-high weeds, as well as stands of trees. Most or all of it is surrounded by a chain-link fence 6 to 7 feet tall. In the middle was the cargo container, which measured about 30 feet by 15 feet. It was next to a two-car garage that had a living space on top, Barnette said. During Friday\u2019s search efforts, officers using all-terrain vehicles and a backhoe came and went while a law enforcement helicopter circled overhead. Investigators began excavating after cadaver dogs signaled the possible presence of remains. Acting on a tip, deputies found Brown after hearing her banging inside the container, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said computer and cellphone records led authorities to the property near Woodruff, 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia, because it was the last place that a cellphone pinged. Records indicate Kohlhepp is a licensed real estate agent and licensed pilot. As a teenager, he was convicted and sentenced to prison in Arizona for kidnapping and dangerous crimes against children. Guns and a large amount of ammunition were seized from Kohlhepp, the prosecutor said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much he had,\u201d he said. South Carolina\u2019s sex offender registry lists a 1986 kidnapping as the reason Kohlhepp is in the database of sex offenders. Matching online prison records from Arizona show that Kohlhepp served about 14 years for the felony and was released in 2001. In court Friday, Barnette said the Arizona case occurred when Kohlhepp kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, took her to his house and raped her after binding her with duct tape. A real estate agent who worked at a firm run by Kohlhepp said she had known him for 10 years after they met at a university in the Spartanburg area and were study partners in a statistics class. She said she was in disbelief. \u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of person to do something like this,\u201d Cherry Laurens said by phone. \u201cWorking with him he was an excellent boss. He stood up for us whenever we needed him.\u201d She said it was widely known that he was registered as a sex offender, but he told people that it was based on trumped-up charges after he \u201chad gone joyriding with a girl\u201d and upset her father, who was a prominent local official. Kohlhepp also had a house in Moore, on the outskirts of Spartanburg, about 15 minutes from the rural property where Brown was chained. His neighbor there, 76-year-old Ron Owen, said Kohlhepp was private but pleasant. \u201cTodd was --in my opinion -- a likable guy,\u201d Owen said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "State Department Releases 285 Pages of Former Secretary Clinton's Emails By Elizabeth McLaughlin Nov 4, 2016, 4:39 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Attacks Clinton Over Emails, Melania Trump Addresses Bully Culture 0 Shares Email The State Department today released 285 pages of Hillary Clinton 's emails from when she was secretary of state. The emails were given to the State Department by the FBI after the bureau uncovered them in its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary. The State Department said most are near duplicates of emails that have been already released, meaning that they are identical except that, for example, a top email in the chain says \"Please print,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in an statement. But today's release includes two emails from November 2010 that have now been upgraded in classification to \"confidential,\" the lowest level of classification. One of the two regarded a call sheet for a phone call with Afghan President Hamid Karzai . The other was a call sheet for a phone call with United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. The portion of the emails that would show the details of the call sheet is blacked out and marked as \"confidential.\" \"We were ordered by the court to process 350 pages of material received from the FBI by today, Friday, Nov. 4 and have met that requirement. We are releasing 285 pages of the approximately 350 pages we processed,\" Kirby's statement said. The remaining 65 pages were not released because the State Department found they were exact duplicates of emails that they had already processed. New Email Between Clinton and IT Staffer Who Pleaded Fifth Yesterday, the State Department published an additional 1,280 pages of official email found on the private server as part of a court-ordered effort to produce some of Clinton's more recently discovered correspondence before the presidential election . These emails were also from the FBI investigation into Clinton's private server, but were part of a separate court order. 0 Shares ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe thought it was bad under eight years of Obama, but the gun-grabbing is going to get a whole lot worse if Hillary gets elected,\u201d said Chris Hill, 42, a blond-bearded paralegal who goes by the code name Blood Agent and commands the militia. He wore combat fatigues and packed a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol on his hip. When Mr. Trump says he wants to make America great again, a message that has appealed to a broad segment of the electorate, Mr. Hill and his roughly 50 local militiamen are particularly enthralled. They long for an America they believe has been stolen from them by liberals, immigrants and \u201cthe P.C. crowd.\u201d Their America is one where Christianity is taught in schools, abortion is illegal and immigrants hail from Europe, not faraway Muslim lands.

Liles These weekend warriors form the obdurate bedrock of Trump Nation: white, rural and working class. They vote, and they are heavily armed, right down to the .22-caliber derringer fired by Nadine Wheeler, 63, a retiree who calls her tiny gun \u201cthe best in feminine protection.\u201d During two days of conversations, grievances poured forth from the group as effortlessly as bullets from a gun barrel. On armed excursions through sun-dappled forests, they spoke of a vague but looming tyranny \u2014 an amalgam of sinister forces to be held at bay only with a firearm and the willingness to use it. They are machinists and retirees, roofers and factory line workers, all steeped in the culture of the rural South. They say Mr. Trump, a Manhattan billionaire and real estate tycoon, speaks for them. \u201cWithin the extreme right, many of Trump\u2019s most passionate backers come from the militia movement,\u201d said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cThe militia movement is overwhelmingly behind Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d For militias, Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-establishment views \u201cplay right into their paranoid style of politics,\u201d said Ryan Lenz, editor of the Hatewatch blog at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Georgia Security Force is noteworthy among militias for its acute Islamophobia, Mr. Pitcavage said. Its members are so-called 3 percenters, who believe that only 3 percent of colonists fought in the Revolutionary War. That is \u201ca historical myth,\u201d said Mr. Pitcavage, a historian, but useful for those who believe a few people with guns can defeat tyranny. Photo Mr. Hill, center, celebrated Thanksgiving with fellow militiamen and potential recruits last year. Credit Kevin D. Liles At least 330 such 3 percenter groups have formed, in all 50 states, by Mr. Pitcavage\u2019s count. There were 276 active militias in 2015, Mr. Lenz said. The number includes some 3 percenter groups.

In September, some Georgia Security Force members paraded with guns while protesting plans for a local mosque ; one wore a T-shirt that read, \u201cIslam Is of the Devil.\u201d Last year, armed Security Force militiamen rallied in support of the Confederate battle flag. At their campground, militia members squeezed off several dozen rounds before breakfast. Then they sat down to scrambled eggs and sausage amid the lingering scent of cordite. Mr. Hill asked who was voting for Mr. Trump. Everyone shouted a unanimous \u201cOorah!\u201d The militia members seem comfortable inside the same sort of echo chamber of self-confirming arguments they ascribe to the liberal elites they say denigrate and demean them. They repeat tropes gleaned from militia websites and social media. They seem convinced that either the Islamic State, or agents sent by Mrs. Clinton, or both, may soon descend on the woods of central Georgia.

This session was held on 14 acres owned by Devin Bowen, a machinist who was having a miserable day even before the deputies forced him to drop his pistol. The door of his trailer \u2014 the one with a sign that reads, \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Live Here, Don\u2019t Come Here\u201d \u2014 was smashed in that day. Three rifles, a crossbow, 13,000 rounds of ammunition and an 800-pound gun safe were taken \u2014 not by federal agents, but by local thieves. Worse, Mr. Bowen was coughing up blood from an unknown malady. He soothed his throat by chugging cold Coca-Colas. Mr. Bowen\u2019s comrades urged him to see a doctor, prompting a sour discussion about yet another conspiracy they see: the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Bowen waved them off. He was more concerned about Muslim immigrants\u2019 imposing Shariah law . \u201cYou cannot come to my country and shove your religion down my throat,\u201d he said, coughing. Phillip King, 25, who builds ductwork for a living, was outfitted in camouflage fatigues and a tactical vest holding ammunition clips.

Surveillance video showed Brandon Vandenburg helping to carry the woman into his dorm room, where testimony showed he handed out condoms to three of his teammates and egged them on. The 23-year-old former player also took cellphone videos of the June 2013 dorm room rape and emailed them to friends in California while the crime was ongoing. He was found guilty in 2015 but that verdict was overturned after lawyers learned that the jury foreman had not revealed that he had been a victim of statutory rape. Vandenburg was convicted again in June, on five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of unlawful photography. He faced a sentence of 15 to 25 years in prison, and his victim had asked for the maximum punishment. The woman, whom Vandenburg had begun dating shortly before the attack, did not appear in court Friday, but a prosecutor read her statement to Davidson County Criminal Court Judge Monte Watkins. \u201cPlease do not use my absence as an excuse for leniency, as it in no way diminishes the profound and insidious impact of Mr. Vandenburg on me and my life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI still ask that he receive the full sentence allowed under the law for orchestrating a sustained 30-minute gang rape against me, a defenseless woman who trusted him. The minimum sentence is not enough for what this man did to me.\u201d Vandenburg, already in jail since his second conviction, was also added to the state sex offender registry. The Associated Press does not normally identify victims of rape or sexual assault. The woman, who has since graduated from Vanderbilt and is pursuing a Ph.D. at another school, has tried to preserve her anonymity despite being forced to testify at multiple trials. Vandenburg apologized to her Friday. He told Judge Watkins that he was ashamed of what he had done and blamed it on alcohol. \u201cMy judgment was severely impaired and I\u2019m sad for everyone involved,\u201d Vandenburg said. The judge reiterated that this has been one of the saddest cases he has ever heard. He said Vandenburg abused the woman\u2019s trust in the man she was dating. \u201cBut for him, it would not have happened,\u201d Watkins said. Cory Batey, Vandenburg\u2019s former teammate, was convicted in a separate retrial and sentenced to 15 years . The cases of two other former teammates facing rape and other charges - Jaborian \u201cTip\u201d McKenzie and Brandon Banks, who remain out on bond - have yet to be resolved. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Colin Powell warned Clinton aide 'not to get me' into email scandal Published               November 04, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Former Secretary of State Colin Powell issued an unmistakable warning last year to senior Hillary Clinton aides not to drag him into the burgeoning scandal involving her use of a private email server, according to an email released Friday by WikiLeaks.\u00a0 \u201cCheryl, Good talking to you. See link. You really don't want to get me into this. I haven't been asked nor said a word about HRC and won't unless you all start it,\u201d Powell wrote to Clinton\u2019s personal attorney Cheryl Mills.\u00a0 Mills then forwarded the March 7, 2015 email to Clinton's now-Campaign Chairman John Podesta and other associates with a suggestion to \u201csee below as reminder of early conversation.\u201d The email, hacked from Podesta's personal account, included a link to a Breitbart report on attempts to protect Clinton by stoking an email scandal for Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The article noted it is a \u201ctrick attempted with carping about former Secretary of State Colin Powell\u201d and his use of a personal email account when he was secretary of state. The warning from Powell came at a time when the Clinton campaign and State Department were struggling to respond to the revelation that Clinton had used a private server in her residence for official business. Clinton would make her first formal comments on the scandal in a March 10, 2015 press conference at the United Nations. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 A day later, Powell declined to comment on the Clinton controversy, telling ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopolous that it \u201cwould be inappropriate.\u201d\u00a0 Campaign Manager Robby Mook noted that same morning that Powell\u2019s no comment \u201cstrengthens our case.\u201d While the Powell warning note had not been published before, it is no secret he did not want the Clinton campaign to drag him into the email controversy by equating his use of personal email with her use of a special private server. The Intercept previously reported that in an Aug. 28, 2016 email, Powell wrote to a friend that Clinton \u201ccould have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton\u2019s [sic] party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these \u2018character\u2019 minefields,\u201d Powell added.\u00a0 Powell had previously accused Clinton of trying to \u201cpin\u201d the scandal on him after Clinton told authorities in July that Powell had detailed to her his email practices as secretary of state under George W. Bush, according to a New York Times report in August. The paper cited a passage from a book about Bill Clinton\u2019s post-presidency that read, \"Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer.\" But Powell did not have a private server -- and officials would later find hundreds of emails with classified material from Clinton's server.\u00a0 Despite the tensions between them, Powell nevertheless endorsed Clinton in October.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "(Tribune news services) State Board of Elections spokesman Pat Gannon said the board is \"working quickly to establish the procedures necessary to fully comply with the court order.\" However, board attorney Josh Lawson said the state has not yet decided whether it will appeal facets of the ruling, potentially after the election. The Rev. William Barber, president of the state NAACP, said the judge's decision \"will help make sure not a single voter's voice is unlawfully taken away.\" The group, he added, \"will not back down and allow this suppression to continue.\" State elections officials said earlier this week that their database shows eight counties removed nearly 6,700 challenged voters statewide in the past two years. The state said Cumberland County removed the most \u2014 nearly 5,600 \u2014 and currently has about 200,000 registered voters. Moore County removed 790 of about 65,000 total voters. Beaufort removed 63 in the two-year period. In most cases cited by the lawsuit, mail to a voter has been returned as undeliverable, which county boards can accept as evidence that the voter doesn't live there. Tribune news services Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. The... Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. The... (Tribune news services) Under state law, any voter can challenge another county resident's registration, resulting in a hearing at which the challenger presents evidence, according to a state legal filing. If local officials find probable cause, the challenged voter is given notice of a subsequent hearing. A voter who doesn't rebut the evidence can be removed. During the emergency hearing Wednesday, Biggs described the process as antiquated and \"insane.\" In her ruling Friday, she noted that \"in all three counties, a few individuals submitted mailings marked undeliverable to the County Boards, sometimes in batches up to hundreds at a time.\" Biggs said she was limiting Friday's preliminary injunction to the three cited in the lawsuit because she didn't have enough evidence on the others. The State Board of Elections sent guidance to all counties late Friday noting that although the restoration of challenged voters applies only to Beaufort, Cumberland and Moore counties, no county board of elections may consider residency challenges before Election Day. Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina Executive Director Jay DeLancy said late Friday he wasn't surprised by the ruling but said \"the state did nothing wrong with following the (state) law. We did nothing wrong in following the law.\" He hopes the federal voting rules that Biggs cited in her ruling are ultimately challenged. DeLancy said the group partly wanted to draw attention to local voter rolls bloated with names of people no longer living in counties, leading to greater risk for someone to use another person's identity to vote. The NAACP lawsuit comes during a protracted battle over voter access in the state. In July, a federal court struck down much of a 2013 elections law, saying the GOP-controlled General Assembly had disproportionately targeted black voters. The ruling lengthened in-person early voting by a week and eliminated a provision requiring photo ID for in-person voting. That ruling sparked disagreements among local Democratic and Republican election officials about the number of sites and hours for early voting. Associated Press ",

    "text": "advertisement President Obama announced the early release of 72 more nonviolent federal prisoners on Friday, bringing the already record-breaking number of commutations that have happened on his watch to nearly 1,000. \"With today's grants, the President has now commuted the sentences of 944 individuals, including 324 life sentences,\" White House spokesman Neil Eggleston said in a statement. President Barack Obama arrives aboard Air Force One, en route to a nearby campaign event, at Pope Army Airfield in Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S. Nov. 4, 2016. JONATHAN ERNST / Reuters That 944 figure is more than the past 11 presidents combined and represents yet another attempt by Obama \u2014 in his final months in office \u2014 to ease the pain of low-level offenders who were hit with decades-long sentences during the war-on-drugs era. \"The President is committed to reinvigorating the clemency authority, demonstrating that our nation is a nation of second chances, where mistakes from the past will not deprive deserving individuals of the opportunity to rejoin society and contribute to their families and communities,\" Eggleston said. Most of the prisoners on the list will be sprung starting in March of next year, according to the White House list. But one of them, Mandy Martinson, could be home in Mason City, Iowa in time for Christmas. Martison was hit with a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison after she was convicted of drug possession and illegal gun possession. Both were found in a duffle bag stashed inside the house she shared with a drug dealer who then testified against her at trial, according to the Families Against Mandatory Minimums organization. FAMM general counsel Mary Price, which has helped recruit lawyers for Obama's clemency initiative, said they anticipate more prisoners will get early releases before the president leaves office. \"Our understanding is they are going to work up to the last minute on this issue,\" said Price. \"They certainly have picked up the pace.\" Nearly half-million people estimated to be incarcerated in federal, state and local jails on drug offenses today. Price said that Obama's move falls short of the sentencing reform they have been seeking, \"but the message the president is sending is that there are still too many people serving sentences that are unjust.\" \"The long term solution still lies with our lawmakers,\" Price said. A little over two years ago, prisoners began applying in droves after Obama unveiled a new initiative to free drug offenders who were sentenced to prison before the notoriously harsh mandatory minimum laws were eased in 2010. Working with the nation's bar associations, the Obama administration recruited thousands of lawyers for the Clemency Project 2014. Their job is to screen application before they were submitted to the Office of Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice. More than 11,000 prisoners have applied and are awaiting word of their fates, according to the Justice Department. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump have indicated whether they would continue Obama's initiative. Corky Siemaszko ",

Ben Margot/AP hide caption toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Contra Costa District Attorney Mark Peterson announced in Martinez, Calif., that he will charge a retired police captain with a misdemeanor prostitution count. Ben Margot/AP Another law enforcement officer will be charged in the ongoing investigation of dozens of San Francisco Bay Area police officers who allegedly had sex with a teen sex trafficking victim. Contra Costa County District Attorney Mark Peterson said he is filing a single misdemeanor charge against an 81-year-old retired Oakland police captain who allegedly paid the victim for sex. According to Peterson, the victim was 18 at the time. The name of the retired officer was not announced, and NPR generally does not name individuals who are the alleged victims of sexual assault. The charges follow the news Thursday that a former Oakland police officer , Terryl Smith, 30, will face five misdemeanor counts of \"unauthorized furnishing of local criminal records.\" Smith allegedly ran the victim's name through a confidential police database and shared the information with her. The victim has said that she engaged in sex with police officers for money or for information about police activities. In September, the district attorney of neighboring Alameda County, Nancy O'Malley, announced criminal charges against seven police officers , five of them past or current members of the Oakland Police Department. Article continues after sponsorship As of last week, four police officers in the Richmond Police Department who were linked to the widespread scandal had been fired. An attorney for three of the officers, Michael Rains, said the firings were unjustified , in part because the contact between the officers and the victim was consensual. She allegedly said her contact with the Richmond officers occurred after she turned 18 years old. Contra Costa DA Peterson said he will not be charging any current police officers, including those from Richmond, based on a lack of evidence . The police sex scandal surfaced in June when a local newsweekly reported that the victim had been involved with an Oakland officer who had killed himself last year. That revelation led to the resignation of the police chief and then the rapid departures of two successors, all in the course of two weeks. ",

Steve Helber/AP hide caption toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely (left) and Rolling Stone Deputy Managing Editor Sean Woods (far right) walk with their legal team as they head into federal court Tuesday in Charlottesville, Va. Steve Helber/AP A federal jury has found that Rolling Stone, a reporter and the magazine's publisher are liable in a defamation lawsuit over a retracted article about an alleged rape at the University of Virginia. The trial centered on a November 2014 piece by reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely that told the story of a student, identified as \"Jackie,\" who said she was brutally gang raped at a fraternity party in 2012. The shocking article quickly went viral and opened a national debate about how colleges handle allegations of rape. A U.Va. administrator sued Erdely, the magazine and publisher Wenner Media for $7.85 million over how she was portrayed in the piece. She later reduced that amount to $7.5 million. Shortly after its November 2014 publication, it became apparent that there were significant issues with the story, titled \"A Rape on Campus.\" \"Several outlets, including The Washington Post, identified major inconsistencies in the reporting,\" as The Two-Way has reported . Rolling Stone retracted the piece the following April, \"saying the magazine had relied too much on 'Jackie's' account and did not adequately work to confirm her story.\" Article continues after sponsorship An independent report commissioned by Rolling Stone found \"repeated, fundamental errors in the magazine's reporting and editing process,\" NPR's David Folkenflik reported . \"The thing that most struck us was how avoidable it was and how there were several paths not taken \u2014 paths that you would associate with basic tradecraft, and any one of which might have caused Rolling Stone to pause and go the other way,\" Steve Coll, the author of the 12,000-word report, told David. Nicole Eramo, the former associate dean of students who filed the defamation lawsuit, \"said the article painted her as the 'chief villain' of the story, full of indifference toward a sexual assault allegation,\" as we reported. The trial lasted just over two weeks, and the jury came to its verdict on the third day of deliberations. The jury was asked to assess a series of statements upon which Eramo based her defamation claim \u2014 some from the text of the magazine article and others in comments to journalists after the story was published. For all three defendants, the jury found instances in which the statements were \"actionable\" as defamation and also where they were made \"with actual malice.\" Damages have yet to be assessed, and according to Charlottesville's Daily Progress , the jury will return on Monday to begin that process. After the verdict, Rolling Stone released a statement apologizing to Eramo, the Daily Progress reported: \"In our desire to present this complicated issue from the perspective of a survivor, we overlooked reporting paths and made journalistic mistakes that we are committed to never making again. ... It is our deep hope that our failings do not deflect from the pervasive issues discussed in the piece, and that reporting on sexual assault cases ultimately results in campus policies that better protect our students.\" In addition to Eramo's lawsuit, three U.Va. graduates who belonged to the fraternity cited in the 2014 article also sued for defamation. A judge dismissed that suit because they weren't named in the story. Rolling Stone still faces another defamation suit filed by the fraternity where the alleged rape was said to have taken place.

    "text": "By Anthony Mirhaydari MoneyWatch November 4, 2016, 5:40 PM As Trump keeps rising in polls, stocks keep falling Email U.S. equities fell for the ninth consecutive session on Friday -- the longest losing streak since 1980 -- as investors grew increasingly nervous about the rising odds of GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump prevailing over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Fresh polls show him taking the lead in New Hampshire , which could be enough to push him to victory, given polling in other battleground states (assuming he gets Nevada, Florida, and Maine\u2019s Second Congressional District). \u00a0 A Trump win next Tuesday could upend the three-year calm in the stock market: Citigroup analysts believe the result could be a 5 percent sell-off for stocks. Trump is seen as the anti-establishment candidate whose aggressive nationalist policies could roil the global trade, monetary policy and immigration policies that have fueled this bull market by bolstering corporate profits. He could make an all-in effort, according to his supporters, to reverse the multidecade slide in labor\u2019s share of income and middle-class vitality. \u201cOur September client survey showed that the Street convincingly believes that Hillary Clinton will be the next American president,\u201d wrote Citi\u2019s Tobias Levkovich. \u201cHowever, if Donald Trump were to win, that outcome would have been unexpected and thereby may cause a jump in the equity risk premium.\u201d In other words, stocks would suddenly look riskier and thus, less valuable. While stocks have been rattled, the bulk of the drama has been in the currency markets where the Mexican peso (chart above) has been roiled by worries that Trump\u2019s demand for a border wall and a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement could imperil Mexico\u2019s economy. This recalls currency market volatility surrounding China\u2019s devaluation in late 2015 and the scare over the U.K.\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum results in June. But stocks are feeling the pressure now too: The chart above from the Institute of International Finance shows a growing correlation with Trump\u2019s rising poll numbers and the CBOE Volatility Index ( VIX ), known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d because it measures the cost of protecting a portfolio against further market declines. Significant technical support levels have been taken out. The Dow Jones industrials index is falling away from the 18,000 level -- first reached in 2014 -- that had sustained a tightening trading range since September. The Russell 2000 small-cap index has returned to April-July lows. Seemingly unstoppable rallies in big-tech glamour stocks like Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) -- which pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 to a new high on Oct. 25 -- have given way to the selling pressure as well. Apple is down nearly 8 percent over the last two weeks. Amazon is down nearly 11 percent from its early October high. And moves in other assets, from weakness in crude oil to strength in gold, reflect growing concern about the path of the economy and the health of the financial system as the electoral outcome becomes more uncertain. Whether this is merely another buying opportunity on the path to ever-higher prices -- as the scares over China and Brexit proved to be -- or the start of a correction, or even something worse, depends on who the American voters pick to lead the country on Tuesday. But the context for all this is worrisome: Corporate earnings remain tepid, the economy is growing at just above stall speed, the Federal Reserve seems ready to raise interest rates again in December and the NYSE Composite Index (which peaked in May 2015) is on the verge of falling below trendline support that has carried it out of the lows seen at the start of the year.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Prosecutors say Dani Mathers secretly photographed a 70-year-old woman in the nude while she was in the shower area of a Los Angeles fitness center. Richard Winton and Veronica Rocha Contact Reporters In a pioneering prosecution against \u201cbody-shaming,\u201d the Los Angeles city attorney\u2019s office\u00a0on Friday filed criminal charges against a former Playboy playmate, alleging she\u00a0secretly photographed a 70-year-old woman in the nude while she was in the shower area of a Los Angeles fitness center. Prosecutors often use invasion of privacy charges against peeping Toms and people who conceal cameras to take sexually suggestive photos of women. But legal experts said this marks a rare time authorities have brought charges against someone over photos making fun of someone\u2019s weight. It comes amid growing awareness and outrage about \u201cbody-shaming\u201d \u2014\u00a0particularly common  on social media. Prosecutors charged Dani Mathers, 29, with one misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy. Mathers is accused of posting an image of the woman on her Snapchat social media account in early July with a mocking caption about the woman's appearance, sparking a widespread public outcry. Mathers later\u00a0 apologized for taking a photo of the\u00a0woman in\u00a0a locker room shower at an LA Fitness\u00a0exercise center and posting\u00a0it online. \u201cThat was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that body-shaming is wrong. That is not the type of person I am.\u201d She said the photo was meant to be sent as a private message, but was posted publicly. Mathers\u2019 attorney, Thomas Mesereau, said his client did nothing illegal. \u00a0\u201cI am disappointed that Dani Mathers was charged with any violation,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never tried to invade anyone\u2019s privacy and never tried to violate any laws.\u201d City Atty. Mike\u00a0Feuer said Friday that it was important to send a message with the criminal charges filed against Mather. \"Body-shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences,\" he said. \u201cIt mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of 'perfect.' What really matters is our character and humanity. While body-shaming, in itself, is not a crime, there are circumstances in which invading one's privacy to accomplish it can be.\u00a0And we shouldn\u2019t tolerate that.\" Los Angeles police began an investigation in July after receiving a report of\u00a0\u201cillegal distribution\" of the image. LA Fitness officials reported the posting to police as well, officials said. Mathers shared the photo of the naked woman on July 13 with the caption: \u201cIf I can\u2019t unsee this then you can\u2019t either.\u201d Leonard Levine, a veteran Los Angeles defense attorney who has defended cases involving gym photos, said all those cases involved alleged voyeurs. This case is different because the motive for sharing the photo appears to be solely mocking the woman. \u201cI am not aware of any case where it was done other than where prosecutors alleged it a prurient interest,\u201d he said. Former prosecutor Dmitry Gorin agreed the circumstances here are unique. \u201cMost have some lascivious intent. In this case, the aspect of the shaming is a very unusual motive that I have not seen prosecuted before,\u201d he said. Lawyers for Mathers could say the alleged victim did not have an expectation of privacy, said Loius Shapiro, a Los Angeles defense attorney. \u201cMathers can argue, though, that a person has no expectation of privacy in the locker room when they are undressed and that the prosecution is simply trying to stick a square peg in a round hole because they don\u2019t have the evidence for the charge they really want to prove\u2026,\u201d he said. Digital technology has made it easier to secretly\u00a0capture\u00a0others\u00a0in their most private moments. Last year, a\u00a0prominent Washington, D.C., rabbi was sentenced to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to secretly recording 52 women as they prepared for a religious bathing ritual. In California, a U.S. Border Patrol supervisor admitted in federal court that he secretly recorded seven female co-workers in the bathroom of the Chula Vista office. Some states have increased the penalties for taking secret images, making it a felony. In New York, offenders can receive up to four years in prison for a first offense. Dr. Robyn Silverman, a body image \u00a0expert, said body-shaming is kind of an act of bullying. \"While the body-shaming aspect of this case is inexcusable, the main issue here is not that Ms. Mathers denigrated another woman online with rude or unflattering remarks,\" she said. \"Rather, Ms. Mathers, with both forethought and intent to humiliate and compare, photographed a naked woman, without her knowledge or consent, and then distributed it online for everyone to see and evaluate.\" \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Hershey filled this student's car with thousands of Kit Kats after his got stolen By Christy Osler 5:15 pm EDT November 4, 2016 130    shares SEND EMAIL National Candy Day may be today , but one student at Kansas State University will be celebrating candy for the next several months. Hunter Jobbins recently found an apology note in his car from someone who stole a Kit Kat bar out of the cupholder of his unlocked car. Jobbins tweeted the note and quickly went viral. And Kit Kat noticed. Left my car for maybe 15 minutes in front of the dorms and I come back to this. College man pic.twitter.com/KlDx5BtXLX \u2014 Hunter Jobbins (@jabbins) October 30, 2016 \u201cKit Kat reached out to me and said they wanted to send me some replacements,\u201d Jobbins told USA TODAY College. \u201cSo I got a box in the mail with a card saying \u2018Saw your Kit Kat got stolen, hopefully this makes up for it.\u2019 It was really nice of them to do that.\u201d Little did he know one box of Kit Kats was just the beginning. On Thursday, Kit Kat filled Jobbins\u2019 car with 6,500 bars, which he handed out around campus. Hunter Jobbins with his Kit Kat motherlode. (The Hershey Company) \u201cIt was crazy. I honestly didn\u2019t think any students would show up. I passed out around 4,000 to 5,000 Kit Kats, probably,\u201d he said. But, he made sure to leave himself enough to get him \u201cthrough the rest of the year.\u201d Related: Student demands lifetime Kit Kat supply following purchase of bar missing wafers Although Jobbins said initially he was angry that someone essentially broke into his car, he quickly realized the humor of the situation. \u201cI thought about it for a little bit, and I thought, \u2018I think a few friends might think this is funny too, so I\u2019m just going to put it on Twitter and see if anybody thinks this is as funny as I do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was just in shock the whole time because I didn\u2019t expect any of that to happen.\u201d One tweet launched him into a crazy, unforgettable experience. The only thing missing? Jobbins said it would be \u201chis next dream come true\u201d to find out who took the Kit Kat from his car. \u201cI would love to know who did this!\u201d he said.

The economy added 161,000 jobs during the month, missing forecasts of 178,000. The unemployment rate fell to 4.9%. Newslook Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016 in New York City.  (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Spencer Platt) The Standard & Poor's\u00a0500 \u00a0index closed lower Friday for a ninth straight day, marking its longest\u00a0losing streak in 36 years, as uncertainty and angst related to Tuesday's tough-to-call presidential election overshadowed a government report showing continued steady job growth. At the close, the\u00a0index was down\u00a03.48 points, or 0.2%, to 2085.18. The\u00a0last time it fell nine straight days was in December 1980, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, when Republican Ronald Reagan was celebrating his presidential election win over Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter.\u00a0The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39\u00a0points, or 0.2%, to 17,888.28. The Nasdaq composite declined 12.04 points, 0.2%, to 5046.37. If stocks fall Monday, it would mark a 10th day of losses for the S&P 500, a streak\u00a0last seen in the summer of 1975, according to Silverblatt. If election angst drags on beyond Election Day the S&P 500 will be\u00a0in danger of eclipsing its longest losing streak of all time: a 12-day swoon back in April 1966 -- or 50 years ago. Stocks have been dragged down\u00a0amid signs the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is narrowing, which is creating major\u00a0uncertainty and making investors jittery. Wall Street had been pricing in a Clinton win, but as polls have narrowed following Clinton's lastest email scandal, investors have opted to\u00a0hedge against the possibility of a Trump surprise win. Still the market's nine-day swoon has only added up to a loss of 3.07%, which is modest, notes Silverblatt, noting that the S&PP 500 has lost more than that amount on a single day 298 times. JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, says the stock market's recent jitters is mostly election-related. \"Volatility has returned to the market,\" Kinahan told USA TODAY. \"People have woken up to the fact that this election can go either way. The market is starting to tell us that the race for the White House\u00a0has tightened.\" 223 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 46 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fm8q2i ",

USA TODAY Sports Fans gather at Grant Park. (Photo: Kiichiro Sato, AP) CHICAGO \u2014 Alfonso Hernandez hasn\u2019t exactly waited a whole 108 years for this. But he says he\u2019s waited 95 of those years \u2014 all his life \u2014 as a tortured Chicago Cubs fan, every birthday getting a Cubs-themed cake or a new piece of memorabilia to keep his faith alive in the once-lovable losers. \u201cThe wait is over,\u201d said the 95-year old from Streamwood, Ill. \u201cAll of my life, I watched them lose. I\u2019m so happy. So happy, happy, happy. God gave us the players to win the World Series. They are \u2026 champions.\u201d The Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in 10 innings\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0in a thrilling Game 7 of the World Series\u00a0to claim their first title since 1908. And the party hasn't stopped.\u00a0The die-hard fans continued to bask in the glory and consumed the streets as early as 4 a.m. local time to celebrate the team\u2019s championship with a Friday parade, which starts outside Wrigley Field before heading to Grant Park. Fly the W: Cubs fans bask in World Series glory at parade Here\u2019s a snapshot of what this means to Cubs fans along the parade route. Florita Killroy, 47, Chicago: \u201cThis parade makes it real. I\u2019ve been a fan all my life. My earliest memories are my Dad taking me to Cubs games. It was always his thing. He passed away four years ago and would have loved this.\u201d Allison Killroy, 7, Chicago: \u201cI was very excited after they won. I stayed up real late and even went to school the next day.\u201d Christopher, 6, and Brian Hopkins, 47, of Aurora, Ill. \u00a0(Photo: Scott Gleeson, USA TODAY Sports) Brian Hopkins, 47, Aurora., Ill.:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just been hope every year. I believed it was gonna happen every single year. Even when there were 5,000 fans in the stands back in the \u201880s. This is validation. My dad passed away at the beginning of the year here. He\u2019d be really, really happy to see this.\u201d Christopher Hopkins, 6, Aurora, Ill.: \u201cI was really, really excited (on Wednesday). My dad was a little (crazier).\u201d Steve Pyke, 53, Chicago: \u201cI always said if they ever won it, it was going to be the biggest party the sports world has ever seen. So here we are. I\u2019ve known for 20 years that I was gonna be here no matter where I was. My grandmother was a die-hard Cubs fans. My dad worked with Ron Santo and my memories were sitting in his seats right next to the Cubs bullpen. I\u2019ve been hooked ever since. Next year is here! Steve Bartman 'overjoyed' by Cubs' World Series win, won't crash victory parade Arianna Cunningham, 15, Park Ridge, Ill.: \u201cI started really liking them after my first game in 2008, but I fell deeply because of Kris Bryant (laughs). I screamed so loud on Wednesday. I knew they were gonna win, I had a hunch. This parade proves it. I was just so worried when they put (Aroldis) Chapman in, but they did it.\u201d Larry English, 34, with his daughter, Queanna English, 9, of Hoffman Estates, Ill. \u00a0(Photo: Scott Gleeson, USA TODAY Sports) Kevin Cunningham, (in his 40s), Park Ridge, Ill.: \u201cI actually felt nauseated (on Wednesday) like, \u2018oh my god I\u2019m sick to my stomach.\u2019 Seeing the parade is all excitement. Of course I took off work for this. I didn't call in sick. I grew up in New Mexico, moved out here in \u201995, and of course, you have to love the Cubs. How can you not,\u00a0right?\u201d Larry English, 34, with his daughter, Queanna English, 9,\u00a0Hoffman Estates, Ill.: \u201cTo me, this means we can fulfill us talking (expletive) because everybody, White Sox and Cardinals fans, always give us crap about how we never won. Now that we officially won, we\u2019ve got the monkey off our back. It\u2019s an uplifting feeling. Game 7, man, and now this parade, what more could you ask for?\u201d Matt Malone, 28, Kempton, Ill.: \"It's something Chicago needed for a long time. The organization set high expectations and provided so now it's come full circle. Growing up a Cubs fan as a kid, it's just a hush or a whisper that they could win the World Series, it was make believe like unicorns or Santa coming down the chimney. My grandfather was 98 and he just recently passed away. His saying was 'Day late and a dollar short.' Now it's perfect.\" Alejanero Guzman, Chicago: \"My father brought me here for the first time when I was 12 years old and I met Ryne Sandberg. And then I brought my son and he met Tom Ricketts and got a ball signed by all the players. I have a lot of memories. Man, all the drama over the years. I was there in '03 with Bartman, seeing that go down. Seven games, bro, but we did that Cinderella story. It was the best thing I've seen in my entire life. This parade is the icing on the cake!\" A day after World Series win, major relief for Cubs, beleaguered fans Hattie Young, 26, Chicago: \"I've Grown up a Cubs fan. I have a memory of being six years old in a costume with pom poms and cheering on the Cubs. This to me is everything. It is for my entire family. I look at pics and videos and start crying. This parade makes my heart burst. We have such loyal fans. I'm shaking. We got an email from work saying we could work from home so this working from home because I live right down the street.\" Michelle Bajaj, 40, Chicago: \"I grew up in the Chicago area and my dad is die hard. So is my grandfather. My husband is from India. We made him a believer! This is extra special because it's my daughter Mira's birthday. She's three today! Best birthday present ever!\" Akin Osinaike, 50, Chicago, from Nigeria: \"This is unbelievable. The players themselves are the believers. Once they were down 3-1 it was hard to believe as a fan. They believed and that's how it transpired. I came to the states when I was 23. Where I'm from it's all soccer. Being on the North Side, you fall in love with baseball, and you really fall in love with the Cubs. This is the craziest I've ever seen the city. It's never been like this. From the kids to senior citizens, it's wild. The goat is dead!\" PHOTOS: Best of the Cubs' World Series parade ",

    "text": "Email LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles prosecutors have charged a Playboy model who took a photo of a naked woman in a gym locker room and posted it to social media with insulting comments about the woman\u2019s body. The city attorney\u2019s office said Friday that Dani Mathers faces a misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy. She is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 28. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if Mathers has an attorney. The 29-year-old faced widespread criticism after she shared the photo on Snapchat in July with the caption: \u201cIf I can\u2019t unsee this then you can\u2019t either.\u201d She later apologized and deleted her social media accounts. The gym reported the posting to police and revoked Mathers\u2019 membership. City News Service says Mathers could face up to six months in jail and a fine. \u201cBody-shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences,\u201d City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. \u201cIt mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of \u2018perfect.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat really matters is our character and humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile body-shaming, in itself, is not a crime, there are circumstances in which invading one\u2019s privacy to accomplish it can be. And we shouldn\u2019t tolerate that.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Chris Christie Convicted in Bridgegate Scandal 0 Shares Email Two former aides to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have been found guilty on all counts in the so-called Bridgegate trial. Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a former official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who was appointed by Christie, were accused of conspiring to close lanes at the George Washington Bridge for political retaliation. The jury in Newark deliberated for 20 hours over the course of five days. Federal prosecutors argued that Kelly and Baroni devised the lane closures, under the guise of a traffic study, to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, who refused to endorse Christie, a Republican, for reelection in 2013. The nine charges against each of the defendants include conspiracy and fraud. Kelly and Baroni could each face a maximum of more than 100 years in prison, though it is unlikely the two would be sentenced to that much time behind bars. The most serious charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. Kelly appeared visibly distraught when leaving the courthouse with her attorney, Michael Critchley. Critchley told reporters they will appeal the guilty ruling and repeatedly said Kelly is a \"scapegoat.\" \"We're going to appeal, absolutely,\" he said, adding that the primary concern was for Kelly's four children. \"This is not over, I assure you.\" Baroni, on the other hand, left the courthouse smiling and appeared upbeat when making his own statement. He and his lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told reporters they also plan to appeal the verdict. \"I am innocent of these charges,\" Baroni said, adding that he is looking forward to his appeal. He also thanked his family, friends and legal team for their support. Kelly and Baroni are due back in court for sentencing on Feb. 21. The judge wields total discretion over whether to sentence them to prison and could even decide to reduce the sentence. Christie has denied any involvement or knowledge of the plot to close the bridge. He issued a statement in the wake of the verdict, vowing to \"set the record straight in the coming days\" regarding his alleged role in the scheme. \u201cOn Jan. 9, 2014, I apologized to the people of New Jersey for the conduct exhibited by some members of my administration who showed a lack of respect for the appropriate role of government and for the people we serve. Those people were terminated by me and today, the jury affirms that decision by also holding them responsible for their own conduct,\" Christie's statement read. \"But let me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them. No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue. As a former federal prosecutor, I have respected these proceedings and refused to comment on the daily testimony from the trial. I will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom.\u201d The New Jersey governor has made only a few public appearances since the trial began six weeks ago. He is expected to campaign for Donald Trump on Saturday. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Homeland Security Officials 'Concerned' About Cyber Attempts to Create Confusion on Election Day By Mike Levine Nov 4, 2016, 6:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Clinton and Trump's Approach to Cybersecurity 0 Shares Email Federal authorities say they are concerned about the potential for cyber attacks that could cause confusion on Election Day . \u201cWe are very concerned about attempts to cause confusion,\" one Department of Homeland Security official said. The official pointed out that it\u2019s important to separate concerns over manipulating the official vote count -- which they see as unlikely if not impossible -- from the threat to cause confusion. Nearly Every State Has Asked for Federal Help to Protect Voting Systems From Hacks \"This kind of ecosystem around the election has made some of these pieces of election infrastructure a target,\" said the official. How does this threat stack up to previous elections? \"The threat level has grown and the technology has not,\" said another official. Officials aren\u2019t worried about the actual outcome of the election being changed because voting machines themselves are disconnected from the Internet. So DHS is focusing on the vulnerability of state websites and other \"internet-facing\" systems. \"What we do have concern is the ability to potentially cause confusion,\" an official reiterated. For example, there could be confusion if people show up to the polls and their name isn\u2019t on the voter rolls. Those voters could potentially cast a provisional ballot, but it could cause confusion and undermine confidence in the system. DHS officials are now working to make sure secretary of state websites are patching vulnerabilities, because that's where a lot of unofficial election night reporting gets publicized (and where unofficial election night reporting could theoretically get altered, sowing more confusion). DHS previously said that 46 states had asked for help , but now says that it is \"in conversations with all 50 states\" as well as many localities. Tools that DHS can office states, include, an automated tool to scan Internet-facing election systems, like websites or voter registration databases, as well ason-the-ground assistance to help state and locals test internal systems, if needed. Officials acknowledged, as ABC first reported, that private election vendors have been targets of cyber intrusions. The officials said that only two states had successfully been breached. Authorities have previously admitted that Illinois and Arizona had their systems compromised. When ABC asked if that assessment of successful intrusions included breaches of voter-related info through private vendors, one official said, \u201cNo\u201d \u2013 essentially acknowledging that private vendors with voter-related info may have been hacked. DHS said they have had conversations with vendors, in coordination with the FBI , to talk to vendors. Many vendors operate systems that states need to conduct their elections. \"The states own the systems, but the vendor is actually providing the security,\" one official said. \"We also wanted to make sure we were connected to vendors, to make sure information is being share with all relevant parties,\" an official said. DHS says information sharing is key. Here\u2019s how it happened with Arizona and Illinois, and how official say it should continue to happen: DHS learns that there is an intrusion, then they get the technical information from the state, then they share it with the Multi-State Information Analysis Sharing Center, which in turn gets the threat information out to all of the states. \"The states then are able to learn from that and are better able to protect their systems,\u201d an official said. DHS is also looking at this issue beyond the Nov. 8 election to ensure that cyber security is built into vendors systems. \"We are thinking about how to make this a long-term program, working with election officials to do that and a part of that is working vendors,\" said one official. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "The Clintons' old attack dogs have a profitable new role, and sometimes it makes the campaign nervous David Brock Danny Johnston / Associated Press David Brock founded Correct the Record, a super PAC that's coordinating directly with Hillary Clinton's campaign. David Brock founded Correct the Record, a super PAC that's coordinating directly with Hillary Clinton's campaign. (Danny Johnston / Associated Press) Evan Halper and Joseph Tanfani Contact Reporters As\u00a0 Hillary Clinton \u2019s presidential campaign was about to launch last year, its architects were desperate to dampen the impact\u00a0of an upcoming book deeply critical of her family\u2019s financial dealings. They turned to David Brock, who crusaded for the Clinton family during the days of impeachment and scandal in the 1990s.\u00a0 Clinton\u2019s new inner circle privately called him a \u201cnut bar\u201d and \u201csoulless narcissist,\u201d a wild-eyed mercenary from the old Clinton wars who could be unpredictable. But Brock\u2019s skills in the political dark arts positioned him to hunt down a copy of the book, \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d before it was on sale. \u201cFeels like what Brock is good at,\u201d John Podesta , now the campaign chairman, emailed \u00a0Robby Mook, who would become the campaign manager. \u201cGreat idea,\u201d Mook replied. Brock\u2019s team delivered. As Clinton aims to move back into the White House, the cottage industry around her political aspirations has sprung up anew and created tensions along the way. Tapping a deep network of donors and their own appetites for bloody political combat, eccentric operatives\u00a0earn\u00a0handsome livings orbiting in Clinton\u2019s universe and even work\u00a0within the shadowy corners of her campaign, according to interviews, tax and campaign filings and\u00a0hacked emails from Podesta\u2019s inbox posted on WikiLeaks. Chris Megerian Chief among these operatives is Brock, the former right-wing antagonist who now commands a network of political groups that will raise about $65\u00a0million to elect Clinton and other Democrats\u00a0this cycle. The groups have paid generous salaries to him and others, including millions of dollars in commissions to a fundraiser who has summered\u00a0with Brock in the Hamptons. Over the months of this long campaign, Brock\u2019s operation became an indispensable part of Clinton\u2019s machinery \u2014 just as in the old days, leading the attacks against her enemies. This time, though, he helped Clinton push the boundaries of finance rules by coordinating their efforts.\u00a0 Soon after Clinton entered the race, Brock announced that Correct the Record, a super PAC he created in 2013, would work directly with her campaign. That wouldn\u2019t break campaign finance rules prohibiting coordination with a candidate,\u00a0group representatives argued, because no money would be spent on ads; Correct the Record would\u00a0instead concentrate on posting material for free. With that, the organization assumed key roles for Clinton, handling opposition research and the \u201crapid response\u201d job of blasting out fiery attacks on her critics. Campaign leaders\u00a0came to rely on Brock, particularly for the dirty work. When Clinton\u2019s aides were upset about a quote in another negative book about her, they\u00a0discussed how to fight back: \u201cI\u2019m sure Brock and team would love to go at him,\u201d wrote Christina Reynolds, then Clinton\u2019s director of rapid response.\u00a0 Brock boasted in an interview about pulling off maneuvers others still considered taboo, such as heeding the campaign\u2019s orders to quickly \u201csaturate the airwaves\u201d last week to spin the revelation that the FBI is looking\u00a0at the emails of a Clinton aide.\u00a0 KYLE KIM AND EDMUND SANDERS \u201cThat is the kind of thing we couldn\u2019t have done before,\u201d Brock said,\u00a0pointing to federal rules that other super PACs still\u00a0interpret to ban such conversations with a presidential campaign. \u201cThis legal interpretation is breaking new ground.\u201d Donors have taken notice. A Brock fundraiser\u00a0 alerted Podesta late last year that billionaire hedge fund manager James Simons was intrigued that Correct the Record was \u201ca coordinated PAC,\u201d as he mulled giving as much as $1 million. Simons did not write the mega-check, but one of his closest associates from his Renaissance Technologies hedge fund, Henry Laufer, gave half a million dollars, the group\u2019s biggest contribution. Campaign finance reformers were appalled. \u201cHugely problematic\u201d and illegal is how Brendan Fischer, associate counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, described\u00a0the arrangement Brock has brokered with Clinton\u2019s campaign. The group has filed a complaint with the Federal Election\u00a0Commission. \u201cA billionaire can\u2019t come in and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to pick up the salary of the campaign manager.\u2019\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIf Clinton had kept her opposition research team in-house, a donor couldn\u2019t have said, \u2018I\u2019m going to pay for all the salaries of the researchers.\u2019\u201d Even Clinton\u2019s allies worried that the unprecedented setup has gone too far, the hacked emails show. \u201cThis does seem shady,\u201d Clinton friend Neera Tanden wrote to Podesta.\u00a0His response was brief: \u201cBrock $ machine!\u201d\u00a0 \"That's fine,\" Tanden wrote back . \"But skirting if not violating law doesn't help her.\u201d David Lauter, Kyle Kim and Armand Emamdjomeh The campaign declined to comment on the emails hacked from Podesta; it has not confirmed their authenticity. Brock, 53,\u00a0with owlish glasses and a shock of white hair, made his name trying to discredit Anita Hill\u2019s\u00a0sexual harassment allegations about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , and publishing Arkansas state troopers\u2019 allegations about Bill Clinton\u2019s womanizing. But as Clinton\u2019s impeachment loomed, Brock refashioned himself as a\u00a0devout defender of the Clintons, providing insider intelligence for their defense.\u00a0He brought his story to the fundraising circuit, impressing many in Clinton\u2019s circle of wealthy donors with his experience in the inner workings of the right. They gave generously. Brock built a network of 10 nonprofits and political groups, all sharing an office in downtown Washington.\u00a0They include Correct the Record, the\u00a0$9.4-million\u00a0super PAC;\u00a0and Media Matters for America, devoted to pushing back against the right-wing media. Brock\u00a0earns\u00a0about $575,000 per year.\u00a0 In the same suite of offices is the small firm belonging to Brock\u2019s friend and fundraiser, Mary Pat Bonner, which collects a 12.5% commission on money brought in. The\u00a0arrangement could\u00a0net Bonner\u2019s company about $4 million this cycle, positioning her for earnings that dwarf those of\u00a0chief fundraisers at much bigger and more sophisticated operations.\u00a0Bonner did not respond to requests for comment and Brock could not say how much she earns. \u201cMary Pat\u2019s take-home pay is her own business, not mine,\u201d Brock said. He praised her ability to find new donors and keep old ones happy and argued that other groups spend even more on fundraising. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have been able to do it any other way,\u201d he said. The Brock operation is also providing for the care and feeding of a select group of longtime Clinton warriors. Sidney Blumenthal, the former journalist and advisor in the Bill Clinton White House, earns $200,000 a year providing \u201cstrategic advice\u201d \u2014 a payment made public only by mistake . Also earning $200,000 for the same type of gig, said Brock, is James Carville , the fervent surrogate who helped run Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign. \u00a0 The financing agreements\u00a0are a source of tension among Democrats.\u00a0Brock and Bonner alleged a conspiracy against them by fellow Democrats when news reports about Bonner\u2019s impressive salary emerged just before Clinton entered the race. It moved Brock to briefly quit the board of Clinton\u2019s biggest super PAC. \u201cWelcome to whacko land,\u201d Podesta\u00a0 wrote in an email about the dust-up to Tina Flournoy, Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. When a panicked Bonner pleaded with Podesta for advice on how to respond to the \u201cpress nightmare\u201d the spat had become, Podesta curtly warned her that obsessing would only garner more media attention. \u201cStop feeding the beast,\u201d he wrote . \u00a0 Bonner regularly pestered Podesta to mollify big donors. When a senior Clinton policy advisor declined to offer a job to the granddaughter of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs, Bonner pushed \u00a0Podesta to intervene. The woman was later hired.\u00a0 It was not the only time Brock created heartburn at Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters, where staffers might be able to turn to Brock for help but had no reins to pull him in. Podesta became enraged during the Democratic primaries when he learned Brock was making an issue out of the health record of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . As Podesta fumed, Tanden hypothesized \u00a0that the idea to demand Sanders\u2019 medical records might have been hatched by\u00a0Bill Clinton, reflecting what she suggested is the former president\u2019s penchant for political skulduggery.\u00a0 Which Republicans are supporting Trump, and who's jumping ship? Open link Podesta and Tanden, who runs the liberal Center for American Progress, pondered whether Brock could be a GOP plant, a real-life \u201cManchurian candidate,\u201d or\u00a0just an \u201cunhinged narcissist.\u201d Tanden, who called \u00a0Brock a \u201cnut bar\u201d and a \u201cmenace\u201d in the emails,\u00a0asserted that the Clintons\u2019 continued confidence in Brock reflected their own taste for conspiracy theories and dirty-tricks politics. Brock laughed\u00a0it off, saying he had\u00a0been called worse in campaigns. He says Podesta has enthusiastically helped\u00a0build and nourish his network since 2003, and a few snarky emails do not reflect their relationship. He interprets Podesta\u2019s \u201cmoney machine\u201d note as a nod to his fundraising prowess, not an insult. As for Tanden, Brock said she sent an apologetic note, explaining that\u00a0she was trying for \u201cdark humor.\u201d \u201cI told her I totally understood and I was sorry her privacy had been violated,\u201d Brock said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re all on the same team.\u201d Brock said angst inside the campaign about the legality of his role dissipated long ago, after Clinton\u2019s own attorneys explained what he calls his \u201cnovel\u201d arrangement that found a way around rules that prohibit\u00a0campaigns from working directly with super PACs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, Brock said, would have severed ties with Correct the Record if it were doing anything risky. \u201cIf they had doubts about the legal nature of our work, they wouldn\u2019t touch us with a 10-foot pole,\u201d he said. Brock doesn\u2019t anticipate the partnership ending on election day, though he has no interest in joining the government payroll as a White House advisor. He says lawyers are looking at how Correct the Record could function as part of a Clinton presidency, battling new investigations already threatened by Republicans. \u201cThere will be plenty of work to do,\u201d Brock predicted.\u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss California\u2019s water conservation is seeing a backslide, The Chicago Cubs win the World Series, The Los Angeles DA is looking into the Seabreeze apartment complex,\u00a0Orange County is on the verge of choosing a Democrat for president for the first time since the Depression, election stress is real, \u00a0 families flee Mosul and the Day of the Dead\u00a0fuses with Halloween in Mexico.

    "text": "By Scott Clement and Emily Guskin November 4 at 6:30 PM Follow @sfcpoll Follow emgusk The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a dead heat nationally. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Hillary Clinton has a narrow four-point edge over Donald Trump heading into the final weekend of a campaign where 3 in 10 likely voters say they\u2019ve already cast their ballots, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. Likely voters currently break 47 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Trump in interviews conducted Monday through Thursday, a lead that is within the range of sampling error and similar to Clinton\u2019s 47-44 margin\u00a0in the previous four-day wave but the largest numerical gap between candidates in the past week of daily tracking. Libertarian Gary Johnson\u2019s support has ticked up from 3 percent to 4\u00a0percent in the latest wave, while Jill Stein stands at 2\u00a0percent, the same throughout the past week. Clinton continues to show weaknesses in the closing days. She trails Trump by five\u00a0points on the question of which candidate is more honest and trustworthy, and she no longer holds a significant lead among those who have already voted nationwide. And among those who have not voted yet, Trump supporters are more likely to say they are following the contest \u201cvery closely,\u201d suggesting they may turn out\u00a0at higher rates. But Clinton\u2019s current 4-point edge is identical both to that found in a mid-October Post-ABC poll and to President Obama\u2019s 4-point winning margin in 2012. Clinton benefits from big advantages with many of the groups that fueled Obama\u2019s two elections.\u00a0African American likely voters support Clinton by 86 to 6\u00a0percent over Trump, shy of Obama\u2019s 93-6 margin\u00a0in the 2012 exit poll. Latinos favor Clinton by 71 to 23 percent, similar to a 67-19 percent margin\u00a0in a Washington Post-Univision News Poll of Latino voters released Thursday and Obama\u2019s 71-27 margin in 2012. While the overall gender gap in Clinton's and Trump\u2019s support is similar to past elections, the divide is particularly stark among younger voters in the latest Post-ABC Tracking Poll. Among likely female voters younger than\u00a040, Clinton leads by 59 to 31 percent over Trump, compared with a 41 to 38 percent split among younger men. This is one area where Clinton may stand on the better end in terms of turnout, as younger women have historically turned out \u00a0at higher rates than their male counterparts. Partisans continue to support their party\u2019s nominees at similar levels, with 88 percent of Democrats supporting Clinton and 85 percent of Republicans supporting Trump. Both of those figures are slightly lower than in previous years, in part because of\u00a0the presence of third-party candidates holding significant support; candidates generally exceed 90 percent support among fellow partisans. Independents favor Trump by 45 to 39 percent; Clinton and Trump both receive support from more than\u00a08 in 10 independents who say they lean toward their one party, while those who lean toward neither party favor Trump by 43 to 34 percent. Early voters Early voting continues to climb at a rapid tick, with 30 percent of likely voters saying they have already voted, higher than the 21 percent who had voted by the end of last weekend. The current share of likely voters who report casting ballots already is higher than at the same point in the Post-ABC Tracking Poll four years ago; five days before the 2012 election, 22 percent said they had voted early. Clinton holds only a narrow edge over Trump in support among early voters, 49 to 44 percent, similar to her edge among likely voters but smaller than the 54-41 advantage in the Post-ABC Tracking Poll early this week. While the attitudes of early voters who have already cast ballots cannot change over time, the rapidly growing size of this group can cause shifts in preferences that polls can estimate only roughly. With turnout of chief importance in the closing days, Clinton supporters who have not yet voted are somewhat less likely to report following the race closely. The poll finds 73 percent of Trump supporters who plan to vote in the coming days say they are following the race \u201cvery closely,\u201d compared with 64 percent of Clinton backers. Voters also say Trump is more honest and trustworthy than Clinton by 44 to 39 percent, narrowing slightly from Trump\u2019s eight-point edge this past weekend. Clinton trails on this question due to weaker faith in her honesty among Democrats than Trump has among Republicans, as well as independents saying by 18 points that Trump is more trustworthy than Clinton. Twenty\u00a0percent of independents and 12 percent of Democrats say \u201cneither\u201d candidate is honest. This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted on cellular and landline phones Oct. 31-Nov. 3, 2016, among a random national sample of 1,419 likely voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

    "text": "Email MOSCOW -- No one in Friday\u2019s Kremlin-sponsored rally celebrating Russian unity can cast a ballot in the U.S. election, but if they could, they\u2019ve picked their candidate: Donald Trump. Russians have been fed the Kremlin line by their mass media: Hillary Clinton is bad, Trump is better, the U.S. election is in a shambles, and American democracy itself is broken. Friday\u2019s Russian unity rally CBS News On state TV\u2019s most watched news program, the anchor called the election America\u2019s biggest scandal and featured Donald Trump and Rudolph Giuliani with tales of vote rigging . \u201cState TV is a direct extension of the Kremlin,\u201d said Mikhail Fishman, editor in chief of the Moscow Times. Mikhail Fishman CBS News He said the Russian government wants to convince its citizens \u201cthere is no real democracy in the world. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d That\u2019s because democracy threatens Vladimir Putin. For example, look to the anti-Putin demonstrations demanding democracy in 2011 after vote-rigging allegations in Russia\u2019s parliamentary elections. When then-Secretary of State Clinton said she had serious concerns, the Kremlin saw it as unforgivable U.S. meddling. It also blamed America for backing democratic uprisings in Russia\u2019s backyard in nearby Ukraine and Georgia. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (R) shakes hands with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin during the arrival ceremony for the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Vladivostok on September 8, 2012. MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/AFP/GettyImages So for Putin, to hear a presidential candidate like Trump imply America\u2019s democracy is a sham is sweet revenge. \u201cWe have been accused of being an authoritarian state but as soon as there is no democracy anywhere, no one is to blame,\u201d Fishman said. The marchers at the Russian unity rally understand the Kremlin\u2019s message perfectly: That opposition and democracy just aren\u2019t worth it so they might as well join the crowd to support President Putin. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Elizabeth Warren questions John Stumpf, then CEO of Wells Fargo, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Sept. 20. Pete Marovic/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Pete Marovic/Bloomberg via Getty Images Sen. Elizabeth Warren questions John Stumpf, then CEO of Wells Fargo, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Sept. 20. Pete Marovic/Bloomberg via Getty Images Elizabeth Warren and two other U.S. senators are demanding answers from Wells Fargo about reports of retribution by bank managers against would-be whistleblowers. This marks the latest development in the ongoing consumer banking scandal engulfing the banking giant. In a letter to Wells Fargo's new CEO, Timothy Sloan , Warren, D-Mass., and Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., say the bank may have \"misled regulators about the scope of the fraud.\" Former Wells Fargo Employees Describe Toxic Sales Culture, Even At HQ The senators extensively cite reporting by NPR about former Wells Fargo workers who were fired or pushed to resign after they called the bank's ethics line. The workers say they were resisting the widespread unethical sales practices that are at the center of the current banking scandal. Wells Fargo opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' consent. In an interview with NPR Friday, Warren said regulators and the general public want to \"protect whistleblowers. When somebody says there's a problem here, their employer doesn't get to attack them.\" But former workers from four states tell NPR that's basically what the bank did to them. Wells Fargo wrote negative comments about the workers on their U5 documents \u2014 a U5 is basically a report card used by the industry. They say this amounted to a scarlet letter that has badly damaged their careers. Article continues after sponsorship Episode 728: The Wells Fargo Hustle \"Wells seems to have taken the attitude that if there's something wrong here it's the whistleblower's problem and that the whistleblower is a troublemaker,\" Warren says. NPR spoke to former Wells Fargo workers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. They all have negative U5 comments written by the bank after they were fired or resigned. They say the comments are inaccurate and hindered their job prospects and caused them financial hardship. They all said they were fired or pushed to resign after resisting the pressure to push products on customers that they didn't want and for reporting unethical practices in their branches to managers or the company's ethics line. And they see these damaging comments on their U5 as retribution by the bank for their refusal to go along with the unethical sales culture. Fired Wells Fargo Employees Allege Attempts To Blow The Whistle The senators say that these reports as well as information from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority \"paint a disturbing picture\" about Wells Fargo's treatment of potential whistleblowers. Fear of retaliatory action from the bank could have prevented potential whistleblowers from coming forward and exposing the fraud. To address this concern, the senators are asking Wells Fargo for extensive information about workers it labeled this way going back more than a decade. Wells Fargo has said it is disturbing to hear claims of retaliation against workers. And the bank says it is investigating these claims. The U5 system was set up decades ago and is operated by FINRA, an industry self-regulatory group. Lawyers and regulators who spoke to NPR said the system has served a good purpose by labeling bad actors in the financial industry. Getting a bad mark on their U5 blocks truly unethical brokers and bankers from hopping from one financial firm to the next and continuing, for example, to defraud customers. Banks and financial firms are required to list a reason on a U5 form after they fire an employee if the employee is authorized to sell investment products to customers. Episode 732: Bad Form, Wells Fargo The system often appears to work well when the individual is the bad actor. But the Wells Fargo case is putting a question in stark relief: If the bank or manager is the bad actor, are there adequate protections for workers who have been unfairly or inaccurately written up on their U5s? For her part, Warren said there is clearly room for reform here: \"The Wells Fargo scandal exposes how vulnerable bank employees are under the current system,\" Warren told NPR. \"The idea of bankwide fraud is something that the FINRA system wasn't designed to catch and in fact may help the banks squelch their whistleblowers and others who would try to correct the problem. I hope that we're going to see some changes come out of this.\" The senators also say their review of the U5 data goes beyond the whistleblower issue alone. Workers Say Wells Fargo Unfairly Scarred Their Careers They say that failing to properly disclose and examine U5 forms may have misled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators by concealing key information on the forms. In their letter, the senators say that \"the bank may have deprived FINRA and other regulators of information that could have allowed them to uncover and stop the illegal activity at Wells Fargo well before the September 2016 CFPB settlement.\" The senators also noted that \"Wells Fargo has a history of compliance problems related to U5 reporting\" and requested information on the bank's U5 filing, review and amendment process. FINRA has launched its own internal U5 review of Wells Fargo but has not disclosed details yet. Meanwhile, investigations into Wells Fargo continue. As Warren said, \"this isn't over yet.\" For its part, Wells Fargo says it has put a team in place to help former workers who qualify to be rehired for open positions at the bank. ",

Timm Fact-checking Trump's voter fraud claims 2:54 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161105013537if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/789715523524\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Donald Trump almost certainly has set records for the number of fact-checks conducted in a presidential campaign. Over the past 56 days, NBC News has exhaustively cataloged him making a long list of baseless claims . Hillary Clinton, for her part, has offered up inaccuracies \u2014 but not to the same extent. Yet, by most measures, America trusts him more than they trust her. Could it be because one candidate is a man, and one is a woman? Trump led Clinton by 4 points on \"being honest and straightforward\" in an October NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, taken just after the second debate when Trump denied tweeting \"check out a sex tape\" about a former Miss Universe when he most certainly did . Trump also led Clinton by 10 points on the same question in a September survey taken the week he finally conceded that President Barack Obama was actually born in the United States. Experts who study the differences between how men and women speak and are perceived say that gender is playing a key role. When both speak authoritatively, the man's credibility is boosted while the woman's is questioned. \"People find it easier to trust men. Particularly\u2026when you have to candidates running for an office that's been the business of men,\" said University of California-Berkeley's Robin Lakoff, a leading expert on the intersection of language and gender. \"Clinton is doing something that isn't normal or natural and is forcing you to change the notion of how you want to look at women. This is scary \u2014 both for men and women. Something that makes you nervous, you don't trust.\" Fact Check 2016: Tall Tales From the Trail To be sure, both Trump and Clinton have complex personalities and long histories in the public eye that contribute to their perceived trustworthiness. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele argues that America holds Trump to a different standard than all politicians, male or female. \"People don't see him as a politician, so they don't hold that standard the way they hold it to Hillary Clinton,\" he said. Steele isn't voting for either Trump or Clinton, and the Trump campaign declined to comment for this story. Trump has spent much of his campaign trying to discredit Clinton's credibility, calling her \"Crooked Hillary,\" and arguing she's a corrupt criminal who has somehow managed to \"rig\" the FBI. Like many of Trump's insulting nicknames against his rivals \u2014 \"Little Marco\" or \"Low Energy Jeb\" \u2014 \"Crooked Hillary\" taps into existing suspicion. Republican strategists often say Clinton's penchant for privacy and secrecy \u2014 including things like her private email server \u2014 is why people don't trust her. But Steele said that there may also be a gendered standard at play. \"People don't see women as secretive, your mom doesn't hold secrets from you, your sister doesn't hold secrets from you, they project,\" he said. A man with a similar taste for privacy would be applauded, he added. Play ",

University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo leaves federal court after closing arguments in her defamation lawsuit against Rolling Stone magazine in Charlottesville, Va., Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016.  Eramo is seeking $7.5 million from the magazine over its portrayal of her in the 2014 story by Sabrina Rubin Erdely.\u00a0 AP Photo/Steve Helber The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice. Jurors also said Rolling Stone and its publisher were responsible for defaming University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo. Eramo was seeking $7.5 million from the magazine over its portrayal of her in the 2014 story by Sabrina Rubin Erdely about the alleged sexual assault of a woman identified only as \u201cJackie.\u201d Eramo claimed she was unfairly portrayed in the article as trying to sweep Jackie\u2019s sexual assault under the rug in order to protect the university. Among the statements in the article that Eramo claimed were defamatory was one in which she is quoted - through Jackie - as saying that the university doesn\u2019t publish all of its statistics about sexual assault because \u201cnobody wants to send their daughter to the rape school.\u201d Eramo says that was fabricated by Jackie. Following the verdict against Rolling Stone, the judge in the case is meeting with lawyers to discuss when they will start the damages phase of the trial. Eramo originally requested $350,00 in punitive damages and $7.5 million in compensatory damages. They dropped the punitive claim during the middle of the trial.\u00a0 Rolling Stone contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely, front, and Rolling Stone magazine Deputy Managing Editor Sean Woods, right, walk with their legal team to federal court in Charlottesville, Va., Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016. University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo is seeking $7.5 million from the magazine over its portrayal of her in a 2014 story written by  Rubin Erdely. Closing arguments in the case are continuing. AP Photo/Steve Helber Eramo had to prove that Rolling Stone statements about her made her appear \u201codious, infamous or ridiculous\u201d and that the magazine acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or should have known it was false. The story about Jackie\u2019s rape set off a firestorm at the University of Virginia and in schools nationwide and prompted police to launch an investigation into the alleged assault. Eramo received hundreds of angry letters and emails and faced protesters outside her office. The story crumbled after other news outlets began asking questions and police found no evidence to back up Jackie\u2019s claims. The article was officially retracted in April 2015. Attorneys for Eramo argued that the author had a preconceived notion \u00a0about the story she wanted to write and ignored any evidence or elements that did not fit the narrative she wanted to tell. Image of the original Rolling Stone article \u201cA Rape on Campus\u201d\u00a0 Attorneys for the magazine argued that everyone who came across Jackie believed her story, and that they had no doubts about the veracity of her account until after the article was already in print. Over the course of the more than two-week trial, the 10 jurors watched 11 hours of video testimony, heard from a dozen live witnesses and examined nearly 300 exhibits.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

News 4:46 p.m. EDT November 4, 2016 x Share A South Carolina woman has been found alive after being held captive inside a metal storage container at a property in Woodruff, South Carolina, local authorities confirmed on Thursday. Time Police search property owned by Todd Kohlhepp after the discovery Nov. 3, 2016, of a 30-year-old woman chained inside a metal container. (Photo: Lauren Petracca, The Greenville (S.C.) News) WOODRUFF, S.C. \u2014 Kala Brown, who was chained inside a metal container for two months,\u00a0said she watched captor Todd Kohlhepp shoot her boyfriend Charles Carver and kill him , according to a testimony Friday during a bond hearing. A body was found in a\u00a0 shallow grave on\u00a0Kohlhepp's property. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that it is the work of a serial killer,\u201d Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deceased person. There could be more.\u201d The body has not been identified. Wright and Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger held the news conference about an hour after Kohlhepp was denied bond in a hearing at the Spartanburg County jail. Solicitor Barry Barnette said Brown told investigators she witnessed Kohlhepp kill Carver.\u00a0Kohlhepp appeared in court on Friday afternoon at the Spartanburg County jail.\u00a0 An initial court appearance for Kohlhepp is scheduled for Jan. 19, 2017. Before daylight broke Friday over the countryside north the\u00a0city of 4,000, dozens of investigators gathered at the scene where the\u00a030-year-old Brown was found\u00a0\u201cchained up like a dog\u201d \u00a0fewer than 24 hours earlier. Brown of Anderson, S.C., had been held captive for two months in this area about 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia. But\u00a0Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright is worried that four bodies could be buried somewhere near the shipping container where she was kept. Brown's boyfriend, Charles Carver, 32, remained missing as the sun rose. And investigators feared Thursday that\u00a0they were dealing with a serial killer as they combed over a fenced property of nearly 100 acres where they were told bear traps may be laid. Deputies arrested Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, 45, of Moore, S.C., on Thursday as they were executing a search warrant as part of a missing persons investigation with Anderson police.\u00a0The real-estate broker owns the property though he lives about nine miles away. Woman \u2014 missing since August \u2014 found alive, chained Kohlhepp has been a private pilot licensed to fly a single-engine plane since March 2006, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. He also owns at least two expensive cars, a BMW X5 and a BMW Z4, and a Suzuki motorcycle, according to the South Carolina Sex Offenders Registry , where he is listed\u00a0in connection with a kidnapping and crimes against children in Arizona.\u200b Registered sex offender Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, 45, of Moore, S.C., was arrested Nov. 3, 2016, after police found a woman chained in a metal container. \u00a0(Photo: Spartanburg County (S.C.) Detention Center) In November 1986 in Tempe, Ariz., he was accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and pointing a gun at her head when he was 15, according to WHNS-TV, Greenville . He served time in prison from 1987 to 2001. He was convicted in adult court Oct. 16, 1987, and is classified as a Tier III offender, the most serious, according to the state sex-offender registry.\u00a0Though his initial crimes were in Arizona, he is not listed in the online registry for that state, likely because of his move to South Carolina. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what goes on inside (closed) doors,\u201d said his next-door neighbor, Maurene Owen. \u201cIt makes life such a scary place when you think of it like that.\u201d Though charges in Brown's case had not been formally filed as of 6 a.m. ET, Kohlhepp is scheduled for an initial hearing at 2 p.m. at Spartanburg County Jail, according to Murray Glenn, 7th Judicial Circuit solicitor\u2019s office spokesman. Brown worked for Kohlhepp, cleaning houses before he offered them for sale or rent, according to her close friend, Leah Miller. Miller said she believes that Brown started working for Kohlhepp just weeks before she disappeared. Follow Michael Burns on Twitter:\u00a0 @MikeAtGvlNwz Posted!

    "text": "WATCH Trump Says Election Day Workers Need to Be 'Very Vigilant' With Voters 0 Shares Email Speaker Paul Ryan said Friday he will seek re-election to the top job in the House if Republicans hold onto their majority, an outcome widely expected in next week's elections. Ryan's comment comes as some House Republicans \u2014 hard-right conservatives and backers of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2014 have discussed trying to oust him from his post. He became speaker only a year ago after conservatives pressured his predecessor, John Boehner , R-Ohio, into abandoning the job and retiring from Congress. Ryan, R-Wis., was asked Friday following a campaign stop with Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson about a report in The Hill newspaper about \"chatter\" that he was no longer interested in being speaker. \"Nope. Not true,\" Ryan said. \"Don't believe everything you read. I am interested in staying on as speaker.\" The 46-year-old Ryan was his party's 2012 vice presidential nominee and is considered a potential future presidential candidate. He has broad support among Republicans, who control 247 House seats. The GOP is expected to lose some seats in Tuesday's elections, with many departed lawmakers likely to be moderates. Since Ryan would need 218 votes \u2014 a House majority \u2014 to be re-elected speaker when the new Congress convenes Jan. 3, that would give more leverage to the small band of dissident lawmakers considering replacing him. No Democrats would be expected to vote for him. Ryan said he wants to keep his job to push the GOP agenda he's been highlighting heading into Tuesday's elections. He also denied there are any divisions among Republicans. Some lawmakers and other strategists have wondered whether Ryan might step aside rather than risk his political career by angering conservative voters. Upcoming budget talks and the need to extend federal borrowing authority next year \u2014 perhaps after negotiating with a President Hillary Clinton \u2014 could well produce results that would upset such voters. Some members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus \u2014 the roughly 40-member group that forced Boehner's departure \u2014 have discussed opposing Ryan. They've expressed worries that he won't hold out for spending curbs in upcoming negotiations with President Barack Obama and Democrats over next year's budget. Others have complained about Ryan's lack of support for Trump. During the campaign, Ryan has criticized Trump's statements about immigrants and others. He said he voted for Trump but has told Republicans he wouldn't actually work to help the GOP nominee win. Ryan dodged a question Friday about whether he thinks Clinton should be impeached if elected because of her use of a private server to handle emails when she was secretary of state. \"I've got a better idea. Let's make sure she's not elected in the first place,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting of Russia's cabinet in the Kremlin in July. (Alexei Nikolsky / Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via Associated Press) Brian Bennett In February 2014, the Obama administration was embarrassed when a secretly recorded phone conversation between the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine and Victoria Nuland, a senior State Department official, was posted on YouTube. The two officials could be heard privately picking who should be in the new government in Kiev, and at one point, Nuland used a four-letter word to dismiss slow-moving diplomats at the European Union. The intercepted call, which U.S. officials traced to Russian intelligence, created friction between U.S. and EU envoys.\u00a0 But its real significance is only now clear \u2014 Russia was publicly willing to use the fruits of espionage to upend U.S. foreign policy. \u201cInstead of using their capability to write secret memos, they decided, \u2018Well, let\u2019s see what happens if we release it,\u2019\u201d said Stewart Baker, former general council to the National Security Agency. Russia\u2019s government, he added, has \u201cdecided that getting fingered isn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d That analysis helps explain Russia\u2019s apparent efforts to influence the U.S. presidential campaign: under Vladimir Putin , a former Soviet-era KGB officer, spying once done in secret is increasingly public. Vladimir Putin on Thursday vehemently rejected claims that Moscow is tampering with the U.S. presidential election, and said it was \u201cutter nonsense\u201d that the Kremlin favors Republican Donald Trump .

(Mansur Mirovalev) U.S. intelligence officials don\u2019t believe Russian hackers can swing Tuesday\u2019s election by covertly changing returns or meddling with the counting. The country\u2019s 9,000 voting districts are highly decentralized and have back-up counting procedures. But they don\u2019t rule out Russian-sponsored service denials or other disruptions that could undermine confidence in the official tallies, especially given Donald Trump \u2019s repeated claims that the election system is rigged. Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere with Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign is not in doubt, according to U.S. officials.\u00a0 It appears to be driven in part by a personal animus against the former secretary of State, officials say, as well as an effort to raise doubts about the validity of U.S. democracy and leadership around the globe. On Oct. 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Intelligence Community said they were confident that Russia\u2019s government was responsible for stealing and leaking tens of thousands of emails from accounts used by Democratic National Committee staff and from the private account of John Podesta , chairman of Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cThese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,\u201d the joint statement declared. It didn\u2019t name Putin, but added, \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\" Election 2016 \u00a0|\u00a0 Live coverage on Trail Guide \u00a0|\u00a0 Sign up for the newsletter \u00a0\u00a0 The stolen emails, which were published by WikiLeaks and other websites, added fodder to allegations that Democratic Party officials worked with Clinton operatives to defeat rival Bernie Sanders during the primaries, and that the Clinton family benefited financially from the Clinton Foundation global charity. Moscow denied any responsibility. Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, called the U.S. claims \u201cnonsense\u201d while Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the \u201cpublic bickering with\u00a0Russia\u201d was a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to divert attention from America\u2019s domestic problems. \"It's flattering, of course, to get this kind of attention \u2014 for a regional power, as President Obama called us some time ago,\" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on CNN. \"We have not seen a single fact, a single proof.\u201d Intelligence agencies regularly try to infiltrate foreign political parties, steal data and influence elections. Analysts scrutinize stolen phone calls and emails from potential leaders and their aides for useful intelligence or potential weaknesses they can exploit. Whether the Russian-backed hackers in this case were careless or defiant is not clear. What\u2019s important, U.S. analysts say, is that Putin\u2019s government got caught \u2014 and didn\u2019t stop. \u201cThere is no cost,\u201d said Michael Allen, former staff director for the House Intelligence Committee and a senior national security aide in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cThey are acting out because their risk tolerance is so high and the consequences are so low,\u201d Allen said. \u201cRight now there is no cyber deterrence\u2026 There is no payback.\u201d (Del Quentin Wilber) Although the White House has asked for retaliation options, U.S. intelligence agencies haven\u2019t been ordered to launch a robust response to the leaks, a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\u00a0 Possible responses include slapping new sanctions on Russia\u2019s government or officials involved in the hacking, targeting a U.S. cyber attack on Russian networks, or expelling Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence operatives from the U.S. Whatever the results on Tuesday, Putin stands to gain from the disorder of this campaign cycle, according to Garry Kasparov, the former Russian chess grand master and Putin opponent who now heads the Human Rights Foundation in New York. If Trump succeeds, the leaks will have helped a candidate who has repeatedly praised Putin and who has publicly dismissed a classified U.S. intelligence judgment about the Russian hacking. In Clinton wins and Trump urges his supporters to challenge the results, Moscow has grist for propaganda that U.S. democracy is adrift and its elected leaders can\u2019t be trusted. \u201cIf Trump wins, it will be the biggest prize they can dream of,\u201d Kasparov said. \u201cIf he loses, [doubt] will drag on for a long time, accusations about the election being rigged.\u201d Putin has made no secret of his dislike of Clinton, according to Dmitry Gorenburg, a Russian expert at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis organization in Arlington, Va. Months of mass street protests broke out in Moscow after Putin\u2019s party, United Russia, won disputed parliamentary elections in 2011. He blamed U.S.-funded pro-democracy organizations for fomenting the unrest. Clinton, who was secretary of State at the time, called for a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into Russia\u2019s election irregularities, saying the U.S. government had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the voting. Putin also saw a U.S. hand when protests broke out in Ukraine in 2014, forcing the Moscow-backed president, Viktor Yanukovich , to flee the country. Putin used the chaos to annex Crimea and has since backed rebels in eastern Ukraine against the U.S.-backed government in Kiev. Relations with Washington have gone downhill ever since \u2014 including in cyberspace. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much they are more willing to take active measures,\u201d Gorenburg said, using a Soviet-era term for using disinformation, forgeries and front groups to influence political events. \u201cThey were always doing active measures [against] their neighbors. Now they are also willing to target the U.S.\u201d To be sure, Russian hacking of U.S. government computers is not new. In 1998, technicians saw unusual activity in restricted computer networks at the Pentagon, NASA and the Department of Energy, as well as at research universities and defense contractors.\u00a0 An FBI investigation, code-named Moonlight Maze, found the cyber attacks had originated in Russia and had lasted almost two years. Hackers had gotten access to thousands of unclassified but sensitive maps of military installations, military hardware designs and troop planning documents. FBI investigators concluded the Russian government was behind the breaches in part because most of the intrusions occurred between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Moscow time and dropped off during Russian holidays.

    "text": "CDC Reports First US Cases of Rare and Deadly Fungal Disease By Gillian Mohney Nov 4, 2016, 12:04 PM ET 0 Shares Star CDC The CDC announced on Nov. 4, 2016 that at least 13 cases of a fungal infection called Candida auris (C.auris) have been reported in the U.S. 0 Shares Email A rare and deadly fungal disease has been reported in the U.S. for the first time, according to a report today from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 13 cases of a fungal infection called Candida auris (C.auris) have now been reported in the country. The first seven of these cases reported were examined in a study published today in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. C. auris is a fungal infection that is dangerous because it is often resistant to multiple anti-fungal drugs and difficult to identify, according to the CDC. The newly-discovered disease was first found in a patient in Japan in 2009. It has since been identified in several countries across the globe including Colombia, India, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said past outbreaks of infection in other countries have concerned U.S. health experts. \"We're very concerned about this one,\" said Schaffner. \"It's resistant to most of the anti-fungal drugs that we use; it does have predilection to seriously infect people with underlying illnesses; it has a high mortality rate, and in other countries, it's spread between hospital [patients] and caused outbreaks in those institutions.\" Fighting Zika With GMO Mosquitoes Could Be the Future of Mosquito Control The CDC issued a report to healthcare professionals urging them to report any cases that appeared to be C. auris. The other six cases identified by the CDC were reported after the time period covered in this study and are still under investigation. The seven reported cases occurred from May 2013 to August 2016 and included patients in four states: Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. All of the cases except one were identified by examining microbiology records retroactively. \u201cWe need to act now to better understand, contain and stop the spread of this drug-resistant fungus,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden in a statement today. \u201cThis is an emerging threat, and we need to protect vulnerable patients and others.\u201d Four of the infected patients died, although all had serious underlying health conditions already. Approximately 71 percent of the C. auris strains in the U.S. appeared to be drug resistant to some degree, according to the CDC report. The strains found in the U.S. patients were linked to South Asia and South America, but none of the patients were linked to the region or had traveled there recently. Schaffner pointed out that various types of Candida fungus can live naturally on the skin or in the intestinal tract of people. He expected that more cases will be identified as doctors continue to look for this condition in sick patients. The authors of the CDC report urged infection control practices in hospitals and other health care settings where C. auris is reported or patients are at increased risk. Dr. JOELLE ROSSER contributed to this article. She is an internal medicine physician at University of Washington and a resident in the ABC News Medical Unit. 0 Shares ",

The suspect had allegedly been harassing and attempting to rob a woman he knew and opened fire on one of the officers at point blank range when they spotted his car, police said. A 911 call at 2:45 p.m. detailed a suspect attempting to forcibly enter an apartment with a gun, said NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill. Emergency dispatchers then received a second call saying the suspect fled the scene in a red Jeep, which he crashed on a nearby street. Minutes later, an officer in a marked NYPD patrol car spotted the Jeep and stopped it. One of the officers was shot point blank with a semi-automatic weapon as he approached the suspect, and a gunfight ensued, police said. O'Neill emphasized that the incident was not a traffic stop. \"The police officers were in pursuit of a vehicle when they knew there was an armed suspect in the car,\" he said. The two officers were rushed to Jacobi Medical Center. The officer who was killed, identified as Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo, was taken to the hospital in critical condition but later died, police said. The other officer, Sgt. Emmanuel Kwo, was shot in the leg, and his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Suffolk County Police Department via AP Photo After breaking into a home of a former girlfriend, in violation of an order of protection, Nov. 4, 2016, police say, Manuel Rosales engaged two New York City Police sergeants in a gun battle in the Bronx Borough of New York. The suspect, 35-year-old Manuel Rosales, was killed in the gun battle and was pronounced dead on the scene, police said. He has 17 prior arrests in Suffolk County on Long Island, New York, and was the estranged husband of the woman who reported the break-in, O'Neill said. Tuozzolo is a 19-year veteran of the police force and is the father to two young children, O'Neill said. 0 Shares ",

Judge Loretta Biggs said the right to vote \"cannot be sacrificed when citizens through no fault of their own have been removed from the voter rolls.\" She ordered the state to reinstate the registrations that were canceled, stop further purges of the registration lists, and make sure that voters denied an absentee ballot are given the option to get one or vote in person. According to data compiled by the state, nearly 6,700 challenged voters were removed from registration lists in eight counties over the past two years. Most were in Cumberland County, which includes Fayetteville. Related: Obama Slams N.C. Republicans for Alleged Voter Suppression A conservative group called the Voter Integrity Project used a variety of data mining techniques, looking for signs that voters had moved and should no longer be on the rolls. They then invoked the state challenge process, and county election officials sent notices to challenged voters, giving them a chance to respond. Those who did not were dropped. Related: Election 2016: Tracking Reports of Voting Problems Across the United States But the judge said Friday that many of the affected voters didn't know about the hearings, because the counties sent notices to the same address as the unreturned mailing that supported the challenges. On Monday the NAACP filed a lawsuit claiming that the practice violated a federal law that allows a registration to be canceled only if a voter either confirms a change of residence in writing or is sent a notice and fails to vote during two federal elections.

    "text": "Nov 4 2016, 12:44 pm ET Why Health Care Eats More Of Your Paycheck Every Year by Associated Press advertisement Millions of Americans are finding out this month that the price of their health insurance is going up next year - as it did this year, last year, and most of the years before that. And it's not just that the price is going up; it's that it goes up faster than wages and inflation, eating away at our ability to pay for other things we want (beer, televisions, vacations) or need (rent, heat, food). Stethoscope Dan Dalton / Getty Images Does it have to be this way? Why does health care grow so much faster than almost any other spending category so consistently? And will it ever stop? \"At some point it's not going to be worth it to have less food, less travel in order to spend money on health care,\" said Louise Sheiner, a health economist at the Brookings Institution. \"That's what really stops it.\" Insurance premiums, which reflect spending on medicines, doctor visits, tests and hospital stays, have climbed 213 percent since 1999 for family coverage purchased through an employer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care. Wages, by comparison, have risen 60 percent, while inflation is up 44 percent. Here's why the price of health care doesn't grow like, say, the price of dishwashers or blue jeans - and why that's unlikely to change anytime soon. IT'S HARD TO SHOP FOR HEALTH CARE Insurers and employers have been trying for years to make patients better health care shoppers and force doctors and hospitals to compete on price. They've raised deductibles or out-of-pocket costs on coverage and given tools to patients so they can compare prices and quality. The idea is that patients become more motivated to price shop when they first have to pay several hundred dollars toward the bill due to a high deductible. Many see this push as a key to curbing health care spending, since insurance tends to hide the full cost of care from the patient. \"It will never be just like buying a lawnmower.\" This can work ... for small stuff, said Renya Spak of the benefits consultant Mercer. Patients will shop if they need an MRI scan on their shoulder. But Spak isn't convinced it will do much for things like surgeries, when the insurer or employer will wind up covering much of the bill anyway and the best deal might involve travel away from family. \"It's not human nature to be rational thinkers about health care cost decisions,\" she added. \"It will never be just like buying a lawnmower.\" Related: Trump's Plan Would Raise Health Costs Consumers also prioritize health care purchases over other buying decisions, especially if they have basics like food and shelter covered. You'll have back surgery to alleviate chronic pain before you take that long-awaited trip to Paris. \"What good is a better house if you are too sick to enjoy it?\" said Charles Roehrig, an economist and vice president of the nonprofit Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending. TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T HELP A carmaker can knock down the cost of making a vehicle by replacing auto workers with robots in parts of the assembly line. Treatment advances in health care are geared more toward making something more effective, not cheaper, noted Paul Fronstin, an economist with the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Related: U.S. Health Costs Are All Over the Map A device maker may come up with a new hip that improves a patient's quality of life, but it's likely more expensive and the surgery might require the same number of doctors and nurses or more. A drugmaker might produce a new treatment that dramatically improves a condition but it may come with a bill of more than $50,000 in the meantime. Device and drugmakers have been producing a steady stream of new products for consumers, and insurers that pay the bills have a limited ability to keep prices for those devices and drugs down. \"Every year, it's kind of like Christmas. They deliver all this new stuff and of course they deliver it at high prices and insurance covers it,\" said Mark Pauly, a health economist with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. HOW IT ADDS UP People with coverage through their employers should expect premium hikes of 5 percent or 6 percent next year, depending on where the employee lives and what adjustments a company makes. That's double the forecast for inflation next year. \"Every year, it's kind of like Christmas. They deliver all this new stuff and of course they deliver it at high prices and insurance covers it.\" And the rising rates may keep them from getting a raise, too. Employers often pay most of the bill for employee coverage, leaving them less money to increase salaries when rates rise.
