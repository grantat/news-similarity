    "text": "Zika Ravages Testes of Mice; Study Raises Concern About Men By malcolm ritter, ap science writer NEW YORK \u0097 Oct 31, 2016, 2:43 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Fighting Zika in the US: The Battle Over GMO Mosquitoes 0 Shares Email Zika virus ravages the testes of male mice, sharply reducing sperm counts and fertility, says a study that raises a new specter about its threat to people. Experiments found testes of infected mice shrank about 90 percent by weight, while their output of useful sperm fell by three-quarters on average, and often more. Now it's time to find out if Zika causes similar damage in men, experts said. \"We just don't know that yet,\" said Michael Diamond of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, a senior author of the study. The virus is known to infect a man's reproductive system and persist in sperm and semen, \"so it's in the right place,\" he said. Diamond said he suspects that in mice, the damage is permanent. But mice are not men, and experts unconnected with the study agreed that it can't be assumed that the mouse results apply to people. Shannan Rossi, who studies Zika in mice at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, noted that the researchers had suppressed the animals' immune system defense against the virus. That's a standard step in such experiments but it adds another level of difference from humans, she said. Zika, which is transmitted by the bite of a tropical mosquito, is such a mild disease in people that most who get it don't even know they are sick. But it can cause serious birth defects if women are infected while pregnant, so health officials have been concerned mostly with helping women who are pregnant or about to become pregnant avoid the disease. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said the study alerts researchers to look for effects in men. \"Don't jump to the conclusion right off that this is definitely what is happening to the human,\" he said. But the mouse finding is a \"red flag you need to pursue.\" The mouse results appear in a paper released Monday by the journal Nature. They show the virus attacks the anatomical structure where sperm are made and reach maturity. Testosterone levels also fell. The infected mice were able to impregnate females at only about one-fourth the normal rate. And in females that got pregnant, the number of fetuses was less than half of normal. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ",

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is reviewing campaign donations made to politicians by people directly or indirectly connected to developer Samuel Leung. An aerial view of the Sea Breeze apartment complex under construction in Harbor Gateway. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is reviewing campaign donations made to politicians by people directly or indirectly connected to developer Samuel Leung. (Travis Geske) David Zahniser and James Queally Contact Reporters The Los Angeles district attorney\u2019s office said Monday that it would review a series of campaign contributions made by donors with ties to a developer who secured approval for a controversial $72-million apartment complex. On Sunday,\u00a0 a Times investigation\u00a0showed that more than 100 donors who were directly or indirectly connected to developer Samuel Leung had made donations totaling more than $600,000 to L.A.-area politicians while his 352-unit Sea Breeze project was being reviewed. Of those who donated, 11 denied making contributions or said they didn\u2019t remember doing so, and one told The Times she had been reimbursed for at least one donation. The responses raise questions about whether someone else was the source of the money\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a practice that is\u00a0not permitted under campaign finance laws. Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey, said prosecutors were \u201caware of the allegations\u201d surrounding the Sea Breeze project, located in L.A.\u2019s Harbor Gateway neighborhood, and would review them. (David Zahniser and Emily Alpert Reyes) A review by the district attorney\u2019s office is the first step in the process of determining whether an investigation is warranted.\u00a0 It remains unclear if the city Ethics Commission plans to launch a separate probe. An official there said his agency is not allowed, under city law, to confirm or deny whether any investigation is taking place. The commission is charged with looking into alleged violations of campaign contribution laws in city campaigns only. A spokesman with the Fair Political Practices Commission, which investigates campaign finance law violations at the state and local levels, would not comment on whether his agency is looking at the donations linked to the Sea Breeze developer. \"All I can say is that we are aware of it,\" said FPPC spokesman Jay Wierenga, referring to The Times\u2019 story on the donations. Several members of the Los Angeles City Council received donations as they were considering the Sea Breeze complex. U.S. Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Los Angeles), who represented Harbor Gateway during her days on the council, received at least $203,500 in contributions and wrote a letter favorable to the project. Campaign finance experts said the statements to The Times from donors, some of them low-income workers with ties to Leung\u2019s business interests,\u00a0suggest donations may have been made by someone else in an effort to bypass campaign contribution limits. Leung said he did not reimburse any donor and has declined repeated requests for further comment from The Times.\u00a0Emails and phone calls made to a representative for Leung on Monday were not returned. Sea Breeze was initially opposed by staffers in the Department of City Planning and rejected by the Planning Commission. But both Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council reversed the commission\u2019s decision. In 2013, a campaign committee that supported Garcetti's mayoral bid, but was not controlled by him, received $60,000 from companies and individuals with direct or indirect ties to Leung. (Steve Lopez) Politicians and neighborhood activists have called for a wide range of investigations since The Times\u2019 story was published. Councilman Joe Buscaino , a backer of Sea Breeze who received $94,700 in contributions from donors connected to Leung, said the city\u2019s Ethics Commission should check to see if any donors were reimbursed. Buscaino has also promised to return any campaign funds found to be improper by investigators. Councilman Gil Cedillo , who accepted at least $9,000 from donors tied to Leung, also voiced support for an outside review. He serves on the council committee that vetted the Sea Breeze project \u2014\u00a0and overturned the Planning Commission\u2019s decision. \u201cI am just as concerned as my colleagues and welcome an Ethics Commission investigation,\u201d\u00a0he said in a statement. \"If after an investigation the funds are in fact found to be questionable, I will return all donations immediately.\u201d Former Manhattan Beach Mayor Steve Napolitano, who is running against Hahn in the Nov. 8 election for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, has also called for local and federal prosecutors to investigate the donations. On Monday, Napolitano also asked for the county to form its own ethics commission to review similar situations. Bob Stern, the former president of the California Center for Governmental Studies and a coauthor of the state\u00a0Political Reform Act, said any criminal investigation would likely focus on anyone suspected of reimbursing donors, rather than the politicians who received contributions.\u00a0 If the donations were found to have come from someone other than the listed donors, prosecutors could bring charges of campaign money laundering as well as violations of campaign contribution limits. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the politicians will be charged unless they were involved in the actual scheme, but they probably will have to turn over the money to the city or the state\u00a0if it was found that the money was illegally received,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the time the politicians don\u2019t know where the money is coming from, unless they are told.\u201d The pattern of donations struck Stern as odd. \u201cMany of these people don\u2019t sound like they could afford to make these contributions,\u201d he said.

    "text": "WATCH Ex-Wife Describes Moment She Found Out Son Died in Hot Car 0 Shares Email Justin Ross Harris ' ex-wife, Leanna Taylor, grew emotional on the stand at her ex-husband's murder trial this morning as she looked at one of the last photos taken of her son, Cooper. Harris is accused of murdering his and Taylor's 22-month-old son, Cooper, who died June 18, 2014, after spending about seven hours in a car seat in Harris' hot SUV in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. That day, temperatures in Atlanta were in the low 90s. Authorities say Cooper was in the car when Harris drove to work at a Home Depot corporate office that morning. When Harris went inside, Cooper was left in the vehicle. Harris returned to his car during lunch to put something away, then went back to work. Testifying in defense of her ex-husband at his trial in Brunswick, Georgia, today, Leanna Taylor recounted how on that summer day she learned from her son's daycare teachers that her husband had not brought the child in for the day. WSB Leanna Harris, the wife of Justin Ross Harris, who is accused of intentionally leaving his 22-month-old son to die in a hot car, in court in Brunswick, Georgia, Oct. 31, 2016. \"We were trying to figure out when Ross left work,\" she said. \"One of the daycare teachers called me and said 'Leanna, I think it's time to call the police.'\" \"I was in complete denial about the situation,\" Taylor said. \"My phone rang and it was a detective ... I said, 'Will you please just tell me what's wrong? I know something's wrong.' They said, 'No, we're gonna talk about it when we get there.' I said, 'It's bad, isn't it?' And he said, 'Yeah, it's bad.'\" When detectives arrived, Taylor said she felt the situation wasn't real. \"They told me that my son was deceased,\" Taylor said. \"I didn't know what had happened. I didn't know if Ross was OK, I didn't know anything.\" WSB-TV Cooper Harris is seen in this undated handout photo. \"I needed more information,\" she said. \"It just wasn't real. It was like I wasn't even there. I couldn't understand.\" \"Sometimes it still doesn't feel real,\" she said, crying. Taylor said that when Harris was questioned by police, he was \"broken and just beside himself,\" she said. John Bazemore/AP Photo Justin Ross Harris, who is accused of intentionally killing his son in June 2014 by leaving him in a hot car listens as his ex-wife Leanna Taylor testifies during his murder trial, Oct. 31, 2016, in Brunswick, Georgia. Taylor described Harris as an involved father who enjoyed time with his son. \"Based on everything that I knew that day, Ross must have left him in the car. That was the only thing that made sense. The only thing that clicked in my mind as even a remote possibility,\" she said. \"He must have forgot.\" ",

    "text": "The manhunt for an Oklahoma suspect wanted in a deadly crime spree came to a dramatic end Sunday night. Michael Vance Jr. was killed in a shootou... Roach provided Vance with bandages, an assault rifle and ammunition, said Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel. Vance, 38, was suspected of shooting a woman and stealing her vehicle at a mobile home park near Wellston, then driving about eight miles to his relatives\u2019 mobile home in Luther and killing them. Ronald Everett Wilkson, 55, had been shot and had stab wounds to his neck \u201cconsistent with an attempt to sever his head,\u201d an arrest affidavit said. Valerie Kay Wilkson, 54, had similar neck wounds along with defensive wounds on her arms, the affidavit stated. Whetsel said the couple were Vance\u2019s aunt and uncle. Authorities also believe Vance\u00a0 filmed two Facebook Live videos \u00a0documenting his run from police before going to the Wilksons\u2019 mobile home. Whetsel has described the deaths of the Wilksons as a \u201crage killing\u201d and said Vance had likely developed a list of potential targets connected to a pending sexual assault case filed against him. Vance had been scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 7 to face felony child sex abuse charges after a 15-year-old girl accused him of sexual assault. Police say Danny Roach came into contact with Vance Oct. 23 at Roach\u2019s home in Oklahoma City immediately after the murders of his relatives in Luther. Roach allegedly admitted that Vance came to his home, and told him to look at his Facebook page to find out what had happened. According to an affidavit, Roach said he knew that Vance had just killed two people and had been involved in a shootout with law enforcement. Roach said Vance described \u201ccutting the wrong side\u201d of one of the victims\u2019 necks and said he then cut the other side as well. Roach said Vance admitted to killing the female victim after she lied to him, the affidavit says. The affidavit alleges Roach gave Vance bandages for the wounds Vance sustained. It also says Roach admitted to giving Vance two 30-round magazines which Roach taped together for Vance and a different assault rifle \u201cthat would give Vance a better tactical advantage due to its shorter length.\u201d Roach took the weapon Vance allegedly used to kill the two murder victims in exchange, according to the affidavit. Police say in the affidavit the gun Roach gave to Vance belonged to 33-year-old Reginald Moore, and that a woman Roach lives with, April Harden, who also goes as April Roach, called Moore to ask his permission to give the gun to Vance. The affidavit says Moore had been storing the AK-47 with Harden, 36, and Roach. Authorities allege Harden also gave bandages to Vance. Police allege Moore agreed to the exchange of the rifles, purchased a pair of needle nose pliers and used the tool in an attempt to remove a bullet that may have still been lodge inside Vance. Roach allegedly told investigators he acted as a \u201clookout\u201d for Vance when a police car drove by his home, telling him when it was clear to leave. Whetsel wouldn\u2019t detail the connection between Roach and Vance or say why Roach allegedly helped Vance. After a tip from a farmer led authorities on Sunday to a camp site near Hammon in far western Oklahoma, the manhunt intensified for Vance. Several troopers were chasing Vance, who was driving a stolen flatbed pickup truck, when the vehicle went off the road near Leedey, 130 miles northwest of Oklahoma City and 45 miles north of where he was last seen a week earlier. Reginald Moore Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office \u201cHe exited the vehicle and engaged our troopers in a pretty fierce gun battle,\u201d said Oklahoma Highway Patrol Capt. Paul Timmons.\u201dIt\u2019s probably safe to say he (Vance) was hit more than once.\u201d Vance was pronounced dead at the scene, and authorities plan to release dashboard-camera video of the shooting during a press conference on Tuesday, Timmons said. Earlier Sunday, Vance shot and wounded Dewey County Sheriff Clay Sander after Sander stopped a pickup truck to warn the driver about a chain dragging behind it. After Sander managed to broadcast a description of the pickup truck, Oklahoma Highway Patrol air units in the area were able to spot the vehicle, and a chase ensued, Timmons said. Vance said the gun used in the sheriff\u2019s shooting and another shooting in Sayre was believed to be the one given to him by Roach, a convicted felon who was arrested Oct. 29 by U.S. Marshals. When authorities located Roach they found him in possession of several guns including two rifles and two handguns, reports CBS affiliate KOTV. \u00a0 Sander underwent surgery Monday morning and is recovering from his injuries, which are not life-threatening, said Dewey County office deputy Judy Junkins. Timmons said the authorities were tipped off to Vance\u2019s whereabouts by a farmer who spotted a vehicle in his field that matched the description of the car the fugitive was thought to be driving. \u201cThe vehicle was covered with brush and tumbleweeds,\u201d Timmons said. \u201cIt appears that he had been camped out there for some time. \u201cApparently by the time law enforcement made it to the scene, he had already fled the area ... so we started gearing up for a full-scale manhunt.\u201d Roach was charged Monday with two counts of accessory to felony murder after the fact, two counts of possession of a firearm after a felony conviction.

Got it The Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky explains why FBI Director James B. Comey has found himself at the center of the presidential campaign in recent days. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Sari Horwitz , Tom Hamburger and Ellen Nakashima October 31 at 7:51 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @thamburger Follow @nakashimae The Justice Department moved Monday to quell the outrage and frenetic speculation surrounding FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s disclosure last week that the bureau has resumed its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server after discovering a new trove of emails. The department signaled that it now wants the politically charged investigation to follow standard procedures, including a strict limit on official comments about the probe and the provision of updates to Congress through routine channels. But after Comey\u2019s highly unusual disclosure last week rocked the final days of the presidential campaign, it may prove impossible for Justice to lower the temperature and regain control over how the investigation is conducted and depicted to the public. On Monday, criticism of Comey continued to mount, notably from prominent former law enforcement officials. Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill amplified their demands that Comey and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch provide a more detailed account of the investigation into the emails, which were found on a computer belonging to former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) earlier this fall. Justice is a staid and secretive department, and on Monday officials tried to restore that traditional bearing, trying to tamp down the highly public disclosures about a confidential investigation. The Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky breaks down the unknowns following the FBI\u2019s announcement on Oct. 28 that it will renew its Hillary Clinton email probe. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Justice officials said there will be no further statements or news conferences about the Clinton investigation until it is completed. The FBI has software capable of sifting through thousands of emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer, identifying ones that investigators have already reviewed as well as searching for key words that might indicate that the emails may have contained classified information. The department also sent a three-paragraph letter to six lawmakers saying it would move quickly in pursuing the renewed investigation into emails potentially tied to Clinton\u2019s server. The letter was sent by the department\u2019s head of legislative affairs \u2014 not Comey or Lynch \u2014 in a return to standard practice. \u201cThe Department of Justice appreciates the concerns raised in your letter,\u201d wrote Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter J. Kadzik, addressing lawmakers who had asked Comey and Lynch for more details. In particular, the lawmakers had pressed for details about the investigative steps being taken by the FBI, the number of emails involved and the steps being taken to determine how many of the emails duplicate those already reviewed by the FBI. [ Read the letter the Justice Department sent to lawmakers ] \u201cWe assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Kadzik wrote, adding no new details about the investigation. \u201cWe hope this information is helpful.\u201d It was not, according to several lawmakers and their staffs. \u201cWe are not satisfied with the FBI response,\u201d said a staffer for Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who was one of the congressmen who received the letter, along with Democratic Sens. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.). 1 of 15 Who is FBI Director James B. Comey? View Photos Scenes from the career of the bureau\u2019s head. Caption Scenes from the career of the bureau\u2019s head. June 7, 2016\u00a0 FBI Director James B. Comey speaks during a news conference in Minneapolis. Jeff Wheeler/Star Tribune via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Comey Monday saying that the disclosure provided to Congress last week \u201cdid not go far enough\u201d and was unfair to Congress, the American people and Clinton. \u201cIn the absence of additional, authoritative information from the FBI in the wake of your vague disclosure, Congress and the American people are left to sift through anonymous leaks from Justice Department officials to the press of varying levels of detail, reliability, and consistency,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cThe American people deserve better than that.\u201d The senator asked Comey to answer by Nov. 4 a series of questions about the discovery of the emails and what the FBI has learned about their contents. Grassley\u2019s request adds to the increasing pressure on Comey to release more details and clarify his letter to Congress. A bipartisan group of about 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Justice Department officials have also called on Comey to release more information. \u201cWe do not question Director Comey\u2019s motives,\u201d wrote the group, which included President Obama\u2019s former attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., and former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson, who served under President George W. Bush. \u201cHowever, the fact remains that the Director\u2019s disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cFor this reason, we believe the American people deserve all the facts, and fairness dictates releasing information that provides a full and complete picture regarding the material at issue.\u201d Comey set off a firestorm Friday by telling the chairmen of eight congressional committees that the FBI would take \u201cappropriate investigative steps\u201d to determine whether newly discovered emails found in an unrelated investigation contain classified information and to assess whether they are relevant to the investigation involving Clinton\u2019s private email server. The unrelated case was an investigation of Weiner, who is accused of having explicit exchanges with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. [ Abedin says she doesn\u2019t know how her emails wound up on her husband\u2019s computer ] Justice officials have said that before Comey notified Congress, they warned him that doing so would go against long-standing practices of the department not to comment on ongoing investigations and not to take steps that could be viewed as influencing an election. However, officials familiar with Comey\u2019s decision said that he felt a sense of obligation to lawmakers to \u201csupplement\u201d his testimony under oath in July that the Clinton investigation was complete and there would be no charges. Comey was also concerned that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup, the officials said. Comey\u2019s disclosure about the Clinton probe is particularly striking, some U.S. officials said, because he had advised against the administration publicly accusing Russia of trying to meddle in the 2016 election because it would seem too political too close to Election Day. Comey eventually supported the administration\u2019s Oct. 7 denunciation, which alluded to hacks of Democratic Party organizations, as long as it did not have the FBI\u2019s name on it, officials said. His desire to keep the FBI out of the announcement stemmed from several concerns, including a wish not to appear biased as the bureau conducted a probe into Russian hacking, they said. Comey\u2019s position was first reported by CNBC. White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised Comey on Monday as \u201ca man of principle . . . integrity and talent\u201d and said that Obama, who nominated Comey three years ago to serve a 10-year term, does not believe that he is trying to influence the presidential election. Earnest said that the president believes it is important for the \u201cnorms, traditions and guidelines\u201d surrounding FBI investigations to be followed. But Earnest said repeatedly that he would \u201cneither defend nor criticize\u201d Comey\u2019s decision, saying he lacked the independent knowledge to weigh in. [ The Clinton email probe: Questions and answers ] One official said the total number of emails recovered in the investigation into Weiner is close to 650,000, although that reflects many emails that are not related to the Clinton investigation. But officials familiar with the case said that the messages include a significant amount of correspondence associated with Clinton and Abedin. It should not take long for the FBI to determine if there are emails that are duplicates of ones already collected in the probe, bureau experts said. But if the bureau finds emails that contain potentially classified information, getting those analyzed could take weeks because the agencies whose information was being discussed would need to review them, officials said.

In a separate letter to Comey on Monday, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, asked for details about the FBI probe including the number and nature of emails related to Clinton's use of a private server. Multiple federal officials have told NBC News that the emails were uncovered as part of a separate investigation of disgraced former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, whose wife, Huma Abedin, is a top aide to Clinton. The FBI is investigating allegations that Weiner engaged in illicit communications with an underage girl. Play ",

Emrah Gurel/AP hide caption toggle caption Emrah Gurel/AP A man holds up the latest copy of Turkey's opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper outside its headquarters after Turkish police reportedly detained the chief editor and at least eight of its senior staff on Monday. Emrah Gurel/AP Turkey has arrested senior staff members from the country's foremost opposition newspaper. It's the latest move in a sweeping government crackdown that began following a failed coup attempt in July. The top prosecutor in Istanbul issued arrest warrants for 13 journalists and executives from the opposition daily Cumhuriyet, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency . Police have reportedly arrested 11 of the staffers, including the editor-in-chief, writers, a cartoonist and a book editor. Turkish Government Extends State Of Emergency After Failed Coup \"This is a comical situation,\" cartoonist Musa Kart told journalists before his arrest, according to Reuters. \"I would like to say that you won't be able to frighten anyone with pressure. It is not possible for people with a conscience to accept this. You can't explain this to the world. I am being detained solely for drawing caricatures.\" An unnamed judicial official tells Anadolu that the staffers are charged with \"being members of the Fetullah Terrorist Organization and the PKK [the Kurdistan Worker's Party], and for committing crimes on behalf of those organizations.\" FETO is a reference to Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric that Turkey's government blames for attempting to launch the coup. Gulen has denied any involvement in the events. Since then, the government has carried out a broad purge, and approximately \"100,000 people in Turkey have been suspended, arrested or fired,\" as NPR's Peter Kenyon reported earlier this month . That number has now grown: From Istanbul, Dominique Bonessi reports for NPR that \"over the weekend, 10,000 civil servants were also dismissed.\" She adds that \"Cumhuriyet's former editor-in-chief, Can Dundar, is also being charged, but he fled Turkey in August after being sentenced to five years in prison for revealing state secrets about Turkey's operations in Syria.\" Article continues after sponsorship Victims Of Turkey's Post-Coup Purge Invited To Prove Their Innocence In mid-October, the government extended its emergency powers for three more months, drawing criticism that it is trying to stamp out all opposition. As the BBC reports , Cumhuriyet's front page Monday morning carried the headline, \"Coup against opposition.\" The piece was about \"the suspension of thousands of civil servants and other laws introduced under emergency decrees.\" The arrest warrants were issued within hours, and supporters of the paper rallied outside its office in Istanbul, holding up copies of Monday's edition. The government also closed 15 news outlets over the weekend, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement . This effectively \"eviscerated what remained of the country's Kurdish media,\" the press freedom advocacy group said in a news release. The group cited news reports that said police have \"raided and sealed\" their offices, and \"their assets will be transferred to the state treasury.\" Enlarge this image Readers shout slogans as they hold the latest copy of Cumhuriyet in Istanbul.

In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cAt This Hour,\u201d Gonzales argued that Comey \u201cbreached\u201d that protocol when he announced in July his recommendation to the Justice Department not to pursue charges against Clinton. \u201cI really worry that the FBI director has made an error in judgment in terms of releasing a letter that really says nothing,\u201d said Gonzales, who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush. He was referring to the letter Comey sent to GOP committee chairmen on Capitol Hill last Friday, notifying them that the FBI had found new emails that were potentially related to its investigation of Clinton\u2019s email servers. In a separate investigation into sexually explicit emails Anthony Weiner allegedly exchanged with a 15-year-old girl, the new emails were found on a laptop used by Weiner, and investigators obtained a warrant to search them on Sunday.\u00a0 Gonzales, who served as Bush\u2019s attorney general from 2005 to 2007, argued that the Justice Department operates under a policy whereby it doesn\u2019t comment on investigations or file cases within 60 days of an election because he explained indictments often cannot be resolved in that time frame. \u201cIn my judgment, it\u2019s a very wise policy because at the end of the day, if you delay the announcement, hopefully it\u2019s not going to jeopardize an investigation\u201d or the pursuit of justice, Gonzales said. \u201cIt appears that this was an error\u2026,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was a mistake. As a general matter, you would not comment on an investigation.\u201d Gonzales pointed out that Comey previously served as his deputy. \u201cHe is a man of integrity,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cWe all make mistakes.\u201d He added that Comey might further \u201cjeopardize\u201d the investigation by releasing more information on the matter, which Clinton\u2019s campaign is demanding happen before the election next Tuesday. Asked if the situation can be cleared up by Election Day, Gonzales said, \u201cIt could be, but of course, the damage may have already been done.\u201d ",

By David Weigel October 31 at 6:31 PM Follow daveweigel DETROIT \u2014 Kevin Stanton, a 55-year-old volunteer for Hillary Clinton, was having a good day. As he walked door-to-door off Livernois Avenue, plenty of his fellow black Detroiters told him they\u2019d already turned in their ballots. One elderly woman danced in her wheelchair as she said she\u2019d absentee-voted for Clinton \u2014 her three grandchildren would do the same \u201cif they want to live in my house.\u201d Several voters said the FBI\u2019s announcement of yet another email probe had made them even more motivated. But at one home, a voter in his 20s opened the door and couldn\u2019t wait to close it. \u201cNot voting,\u201d he said. \u201cNot voting this year.\u201d Stanton had seen that before. \u201cThem old people fought for the right to vote, and they believe in it,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cIt was the young guy who said he didn\u2019t want to vote. But that guy voted for Barack, and it may be the only time he ever votes.\u201d Following the latest FBI inquiry, which has dominated news coverage for days and has been described as a potential lifeline for Republican nominee Donald Trump, Clinton\u2019s campaign is counting on its organization more than ever to revive the coalition that twice elected Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton meets Ohio voters, accompanied by Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), at Angie's Soul Cafe in Cleveland on Oct. 31. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) [ Justice Dept. says it is moving quickly in renewed Clinton email inquiry ] In places such as Michigan, that means turning out minorities in big numbers to overcome Trump\u2019s advantage among white voters. The trend in early-voting returns has been both encouraging and worrying for the Clinton campaign: Enthusiasm among Latinos appears to be up, in some cases considerably, but African Americans are turning out in smaller numbers than they did with Obama on the ticket. That\u2019s the picture in Florida. Early returns show a boost in turnout in heavily Latino counties and a decline in largely African American ones. In a state such as Nevada, where Democrats are relying heavily on Latinos, early returns show they are voting in similar numbers as in 2012, boosting Democratic chances. But in battleground states such as Ohio where Democrats are counting on African Americans to put them over the top, they could be in trouble if blacks stay home. Polling shows a similar story. Clinton maintains a large lead among nonwhite voters in the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll, but by a smaller margin than Obama did. In polling since Oct. 20, Clinton has led Trump by more than 3 to 1 among all nonwhites (69\u00a0percent to 19\u00a0percent), compared with President Obama\u2019s margin of 80\u00a0percent to 19\u00a0percent in 2012. Moreover, nonwhite voters are more united by their strong dislike of Trump than positive views of Clinton \u2014 only 39\u00a0percent have a strongly favorable view of Clinton, while 68\u00a0percent have strongly unfavorable views toward Trump. [For young black activists, an urgent task: Persuading peers to vote] On Monday, in campaign trips that were scheduled before news of the FBI inquiry broke last week, Trump was attempting to vault the Democratic \u201cblue wall\u201d with stops in Michigan. No poll has suggested that Clinton could lose the state. It would take a collapse of suburban support or a cratering black vote to make that happen. Clinton\u2019s campaign is counting on the coalition tha twice elected Barack Obama. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Exit polls from the past few elections show how Democrats could lose their advantage in such states. In 2004, the last time a white candidate led the Democratic ticket, then-Sen. John F. Kerry won Michigan by 3.4 points. According to the exit poll, he lost Michigan\u2019s white voters by 10 points but carried a supermajority of nonwhites. Black voters, who made up just 13\u00a0percent of the electorate, went for Kerry by a 79-point margin. Eight years later, Obama won Michigan by 9.5 points \u2014 but did just as poorly as Kerry with white voters. Much of his margin came from black voters, who rose to 16\u00a0percent of the electorate and went for him by 90 points. In closer states, Trump\u2019s campaign is working to soften enthusiasm for Clinton among young black voters. One TV ad plays a clip of Clinton, then supportive of a new crime bill, referring to a group of young black offenders as \u201csuper-predators.\u201d That two-decade-old quote \u2014 even after an apology \u2014 has dogged Clinton with some Black Lives Matters activists. Trump has also sought to dampen enthusiasm by casting life in black communities as something akin to apocalyptic. [In the final sprint, Trump targets Democratic-leaning states] Democrats counter that Trump is ill-equipped to talk black voters into staying home. Rumors of Trump supporters challenging voters have spread quickly and have been included in Democrats\u2019 doorstep pitch on why to vote early. One elected Democrat here speculated that militia groups might dispatch their members to join the \u201cpoll watching\u201d programs suggested by groups such as Oath Keepers and by Trump supporter Roger Stone. On Monday, Democrats filed lawsuits in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania alleging that Trump, the Republican state parties and Stone\u2019s group Stop the Steal are conspiring to intimidate and block minorities from voting. Trump is violating federal civil rights \u201cby using the loudest microphone in the nation to implore his supporters to engage in unlawful intimidation\u201d at polling places, the lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania alleges. Stone\u2019s response: \u201cI assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.\u201d In North Carolina, where Democrats and civil rights groups won a high-profile lawsuit against Republican-backed voting restrictions, the early look is mixed. Total black turnout has fallen 17\u00a0percent from its 2012 level, but Democrats point to a shrunken number of early-voting locations to claim that they are on track. At the polls, the voters who are showing up said they feel an obligation, if not passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not like four years ago when we knew we were going for Barack Obama, no ifs, ands and buts,\u201d Sunia Wilson, 38, said after casting a ballot at the Chavis Community Center in Raleigh. \u201cThis year it\u2019s like, \u2018Hmmm. I don\u2019t know.\u2019 But I\u2019ve got to vote.\u201d [Once the hope candidate, Obama in his final days faces a hopeless electorate] In Florida, where Latino voting patterns look stronger for Democrats, the relationship between shaky enthusiasm and fear of voter suppression is even more complicated. Reports of problems at the polls have spiked, with the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials reporting 31,000 phone calls to its help line since its September launch. Meanwhile, voters such as Robert Ortiz, 20, were not sure whether they would bother. As he walked out of a Duvall Homes thrift store in Deltona, Fla., Ortiz said he could not figure out which candidate to trust or what to believe. Friday\u2019s revelation about the FBI looking into more emails that could be relevant to the Clinton email server investigation only added to the noise. \u201cYou try, but you still don\u2019t really know how they truly feel about life,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cOne is too eager to be president. And one does not know anything about struggling people. No, no, both of them are like that.\u201d In Michigan, with higher stakes and a bigger built-in advantage for Democrats, the pitch to black voters comes with plenty of caveats. One of the fliers given out on every canvass shows Obama talking to Clinton in the Oval Office, a black-and-white photo with \u201cProtect His Legacy\u201d written across it. In a state where felons are allowed to win back their voting rights, canvassers emphasize that Clinton has endorsed a criminal-justice reform agenda. On Sunday morning, Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), whose district covers much of Detroit, stopped by the Life Line church to tell voters that Trump favored a national stop-and-frisk approach, contending that he supports mass incarceration. \u201cNobody\u2019s asking you to marry Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us here is planning on having them over for dinner tomorrow. But when you tell me, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sick of this,\u2019 and, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not going to vote\u2019 \u2014 the audacity of anyone to say that, when there\u2019s blood still on the ground from people who fought for that right!\u201d On Sunday, as Stanton knocked on doors, the FBI inquiry came up multiple times \u2014 never in a way that reflected poorly on Clinton. One voter, pulling into his driveway, said the new story had persuaded him to vote early. Fred Franklin, 56, was so irate about the email inquiry that he stopped another canvasser to vent. \u201cComey got involved in politics, and if you ask me, he should be fired,\u201d Franklin said. Michigan\u2019s Republican voters, who have lived through 24 years of presidential droughts, are not getting cocky. Trump\u2019s Monday schedule took him to Grand Rapids, where Democrats say he has underperformed with social conservatives, and to Warren, a Detroit suburb where he stumped during the primary campaign. The Warren crowd did not quite pack an events center, and the voters trickling in \u2014 more than one dressed as Clinton in a prison jumpsuit \u2014 said that they fully expected Democrats to come out. \u201cI live in Flint, and it feels like every year,\u201d said Brenda Battle Jordan, 59. \u201cThey work the polls and they pull out their vote. They\u2019re everywhere. Doesn\u2019t matter who they run.\u201d Ed O\u2019Keefe in Washington, Robert Samuels in Florida and Vanessa Williams in North Carolina contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

In the chilling audio, which a judge ordered the city of Orlando to release Monday, the operator asks what his name is. \"My name is \u2014 I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State.\" The phone call was one of several that Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber ordered the city to release after news organizations requested more than 600, according to the Associated Press. Two-thirds of the calls have already been released, the AP reported, but city attorneys have fought to withhold more than 200, citing the extreme suffering depicted in them. For Demetrice Naulings, who survived the massacre but lost her close friend Eddie Justice, hearing the audio released Monday was difficult enough. \"It's like I'm swallowing a brick,\" she told NBC News, adding that she regretted having Mateen's voice in her head. Finally listening to it didn't appear to help her resolve the questions that have been haunting her since June 12. \"Why now? Why that night? Why that place?\" she said. \"Those are the questions that I'm always going to ask.\" Play ",

News 7:45 p.m. EDT October 31, 2016 x Share Orlando police have released recordings of multiple 911 calls between police and the Pulse nightclub shooter, Omar Mateen. USA TODAY NETWORK Omar Mateen of Fort Pierce, Fla., is accused of killing dozens of people June 12, 2016, inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. (Photo: AP) In chilling audio recordings between the shooter at an Orlando gay nightclub and a police negotiator on the night of the Pulse nightclub massacre, Omar Mateen's demeanor fluctuated from emotionless to frenzied and indignant. In nearly 30 minutes of audio released Monday because of a court order from\u00a0Judge Margaret Schreiber of Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit, Mateen embarks on a profanity-laced rant about U.S. airstrikes in the Middle East, evading police efforts to pry information from him about the unfolding attack. \u201cThey\u2019re killing a lot of innocent people, so what am I to do here when my people are getting killed over there? You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Mateen says about the airstrikes, sounding almost robotic. Transcripts of the conversations Mateen had with dispatchers and negotiators have been available for more than a month, but not the actual recordings. On June 12, Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Fla., embarked on a shooting spree at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, that left 49 dead and dozens injured. Mateen was killed after a standoff with law-enforcement officials. At times, Mateen sounded antsy and condescending, at one point calling the negotiator \u201chomeboy.\u201d He repeatedly hung up and ignored questions about how the situation could be resolved peacefully. \u201cYou\u2019re annoying me with a lot of these phone calls,\u201d an impatient Mateen said during one of the calls. Asked by the negotiator whether Mateen had done anything about the crisis in the Middle East, Mateen sneered, \u201cYou already know what I did.\u201d Mateen insisted he be called \u201cSoldier of God,\u201d demanded the negotiator \u201cdo your (expletive) homework\u201d on U.S. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq\u00a0while repeatedly demanding the strikes stop. He told negotiators he was wearing a vest\u00a0but refused to elaborate further. Members vow to rebuild fire-damaged mosque where Pulse shooter worshiped At one point, a frenzied Mateen threatened that a car outside the club was rigged with explosives to take out nearly a city block. \u201cYour people are gonna get it, and I\u2019m going to ignite it if they do anything stupid.\u201d Mateen said, taunting. Schreiber ordered the release of the audio recordings following dozens of media requests, said lawyer Rachel Fugate\u00a0of Thomas & LoCicero law firm. The judge decided to evaluate further\u00a0more than 200 other recordings of calls made to and from people in the nightclub, Fugate\u00a0said after the Monday hearing. The Ninth Judicial Circuit is Orange and Osceola counties, and Orlando is in Orange County. Gannett, the publisher of\u00a0USA TODAY, was one of more than 25 news organizations and news advocacy groups, including CNN and\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0who sued Orlando in Orange County Circuit Court to compel release of the tapes. 911 calls paint picture of horror in Orlando nightclub attack \u201cThe legal battle has been proceeding for some time and there was a lot of back and forth, but we\u2019re now down to the last remaining issues with respect to whether these calls will be released,\u201d Fugate said. The City of Orlando asserted the calls couldn\u2019t be released because of an active criminal investigation and also because they could depict the killing of a person,\u00a0Fugate said. \u201cAny recording that depicts the killing of a person is exempt, but it does provide a mechanism to show good cause to get those recordings,\u201d the lawyer said. The cause would be to evaluate the police response to the emergency. If a call doesn\u2019t fall within the exemption, it will be released, Fugate said. But if it does, the judge will \u201cmake a determination whether there\u2019s good cause for access in some form to the call.\u201d No time frame was given during the hearing on when that could occur, she said. Two Orlando hospitals won't bill Pulse shooting victims \u201cI think this is going to give better insight into the timeline of events, what was happening within that nightclub, what were emergency responders communicating with the victims and the hostages in there and did they act swiftly enough in rescuing them,\u201d Fugate said. Early in September, the City of Orlando stated that the Department of Justice and the FBI \u201cadvised the city of the FBI\u2019s determination that the 911 calls no longer need to be protected as part of the active criminal investigation into the Pulse nightclub massacre.\u201d Follow\u00a0Will Greenlee \u00a0and Nicole Rodriguez on Twitter:\u00a0 @OffTheBeatTweet \u00a0and\u00a0 @NicRodriguez 3313 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eNTdIX ",

Got it At a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., Oct. 31, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump thanked Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner while talking about the FBI investigation in Clinton's private email server. (The Washington Post) By John Wagner , Jenna Johnson and Anne Gearan October 31 at 4:32 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @wpjenna Follow @agearan KENT, Ohio \u2014 Hillary Clinton sought Monday to redirect the focus of the presidential race to national security and Donald Trump\u2019s fitness for office after days of damaging uncertainty over a renewed investigation into her email use when she was secretary of state. The Democratic nominee addressed the email issue at the start of a speech at Kent State University. It marked a departure from her standard stump speech, as Democrats are reeling from news that FBI Director James B. Comey is revisiting his probe into the potential mishandling of classified material. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about, and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing,\u201d less than two weeks before Election Day, Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d \u201cI understand. And as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not making any excuses\u201d for setting up her private email system as she did, Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019ve said it was a mistake, and I regret it.\u201d On Monday afternoon, the Justice Department responded to growing calls from a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress for additional information about the renewed inquiry. In a letter to lawmakers, the Justice Department said it was moving \u201cas expeditiously as possible\u201d to investigate the new emails, but it did not provide any additional information. 1 of 51 Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail View Photos The Democratic presidential nominee hits the road as Election Day nears. Caption The Democratic presidential nominee hits the road as Election Day nears. \u00a0 Hillary Clinton speaks to and meets Ohio voters during a rally in Cleveland. Melina Mara/The Washington Post [ Trump says Comey has restored reputation by revisiting probe; Clinton debuts new \u2018Daisy\u2019 ad ] At her rally in Ohio, Clinton predicted that the new inquiry will reach the same conclusion as Comey did at the end of the FBI investigation in July, when he announced that despite what he called sloppiness, there was no evidence of criminal conduct. \u201cThere is no case,\u201d Clinton said, adding that she thinks most Americans have long since decided how they feel about the email issue. \u201cNow, what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander in chief of the United States of America.\u201d Campaigning earlier Monday in Grand Rapids, Mich., Trump said Comey \u201cbrought back his reputation\u201d with his notice to Congress on Friday that he would look at new information in the case. \u201cIt took a lot of guts\u201d for Comey to change course three months after ending the probe into whether classified information was compromised, the Republican nominee said. \u201cI really disagreed with him\u201d over that earlier decision, Trump said. \u201cI was not his fan. But what he did brought back his reputation.\u201d During her lengthy speech at Kent State University, Clinton returned to an argument that has been among her most potent: that Trump\u2019s \u201cvery thin skin\u201d and brash, ill-informed commentary on world affairs disqualifies him as commander in chief. [ Is America addicted to this election? ] \u201cI\u2019m running against a man who says he doesn\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t use nuclear weapons. He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons.\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re telling yourself he\u2019s going to surround himself with smart people to stop these crazy ideas, remember this: He was asked who he consults on foreign policy. Donald Trump said he doesn\u2019t need to consult because, and I quote, \u2018I have a very good brain.\u2019\u201d Turning to Trump\u2019s relationship with Vladi\u00admir Putin, Clinton said the Russian president is playing Trump for a patsy. \u201cHe knows he can use flattery to get into Donald\u2019s head, to make Donald the Kremlin\u2019s puppet, and it seems to be working. Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants,\u201d she said. Clinton also addressed the hacked emails of Democratic organizations and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, which intelligence officials have blamed on the Russians. She also ran through a series of Trump remarks about the NATO alliance, U.S. nuclear umbrella in Asia and other topics that she said show him to be ignorant or reckless. \u201cThis is one of those make-or-break moments for our nation,\u201d she said. Clinton was introduced at Kent State by Bruce Blair, a former U.S. Air Force Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile control officer. \u201cI keenly appreciate the importance of electing a commander in chief who can be trusted with the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal,\u201d Blair told the crowd, adding that Trump is \u201cutterly lacking\u201d in that regard. [ Clinton loses popularity edge in tight race with Trump, new Post-ABC Tracking Poll finds ] Aside from changing the subject from the emails, Clinton\u2019s efforts in Ohio are part of a strategy to create several paths to an electoral college victory \u2014 the simplest of which would be to win Florida. Clinton spent the weekend campaigning in the Sunshine State , where some polls show Trump leading. But the campaign has encountered significant obstacles over the weekend after Comey reignited a political firestorm when he said FBI officials had detected a batch of emails pertinent to the earlier case during an \u201cunrelated\u201d investigation. People close to the situation have told The Washington Post that the emails were found on a computer belonging to disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner is the estranged husband of Clinton campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin. Abedin, who is very often the aide closest to Clinton\u2019s side on trips, has been absent from the campaign plane since Friday, the day the Comey news broke. Clinton\u2019s campaign pushed back hard all weekend against Comey\u2019s decision. Democrats demanded swift answers about what Comey is looking for and why he chose to renew the inquiry less than two weeks before Election Day. Democratic senators asked for answers by the end of the day Monday. [ Donald Trump is refusing to pay his campaign pollster three-quarters of a million dollars ] Claiming momentum from the FBI news, Trump said Clinton has only herself to blame. \u201cHillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied on so many different occasions to the FBI.\u201d Clinton denies that her email put the country at risk, and her campaign says she testified truthfully. As Trump\u2019s audience laughed, he crowed, \u201cThank you, Huma,\u201d mispronouncing the name as \u201cOO-ma. \u201cThank you, Huma! And thank you, Anthony Weiner.\u201d When Trump first brought up Clinton\u2019s emails, the crowd began to loudly chant: \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d In the audience was a woman dressed up in an orange prison jumpsuit labeled \u201cClinton.\u201d Later in the afternoon, Trump is expected to hold a rally in Warren, a suburb of Detroit and then return to New York that evening. He plans to travel to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin on Tuesday and to North Carolina on Thursday. Trump\u2019s staff has yet to publicly confirm the rest of his schedule for the week. Clinton opened the last full week of campaigning Monday with a television advertisement revisiting the famous 1964 \u201cDaisy\u201d ad about nuclear weapons. The new ad features the same woman who, as a small girl, plucked petals from a flower in the original ad for President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s campaign, which was aimed at Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. The new one returns to a frequent Clinton theme this year \u2014 the claim that Trump is reckless and unfit to be commander in chief. The national security comparison has been one of Clinton\u2019s strongest advantages over the Republican businessman in an election she remains favored to win. Clinton\u2019s goal at rallies Monday near Cleveland and in Cincinnati is to keep up enthusiasm among Democrats and encourage more early voting this week. Former president Bill Clinton campaigned for his wife in Cleveland over the weekend, and President Obama is due in Columbus on Tuesday. Trump leads Clinton in Ohio by 1.3 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls. That is within the margin of error, meaning the race is effectively tied. On Sunday night, the FBI obtained a warrant to review the emails , which one official said include a significant number of messages associated with Clinton and Abedin. In his letter to Congress, Comey said that whether the emails provide any new information to the Clinton investigation had yet to be determined, but Democrats worry that the news could sway the election. Johnson reported from Grand Rapids, Mich. Gearan reported from Washington. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print May 25, 2010: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton answers a question at a news conference after the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing. \u00a0(REUTERS/Jason Lee) An unnamed \u201csenior aide\u201d to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton left classified information unsecured and unattended in a hotel room during a 2010 trip to China, one of several overseas lapses by Clinton\u2019s inner circle, Fox News has learned. Confirmation of the alarming violation comes as Clinton herself is under a renewed FBI probe for mishandling sensitive information on a private server and her longtime senior aide, Huma Abedin, also faces scrutiny as part of the investigation. It was not known which of Clinton\u2019s aides left the information exposed. \u201cIn May 2010, Secretary Clinton was on official travel in Beijing, China, accompanied by senior staff. Upon Secretary Clinton\u2019s departure, a routine security sweep by Diplomatic Security agents identified classified documents in a staff member\u2019s suite,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby told Fox News in a statement, issued several weeks after a Freedom of Information Act request was filed with the agency. Diplomatic Security, which protects the Secretary of State in the U.S. and abroad, as well as high-ranking foreign dignitaries and officials visiting the United States, wrote up the incident on a Form 117, while the Marine Security Guards filed a separate formal report, the source said. The information came to light when the FBI was investigating whether Clinton or her staff violated the US Espionage Act by mishandling classified and top secret information. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., citing a whistleblower who separately came to him with an allegation it was Clinton who left the material out, wrote to the FBI director on Monday asking for more information. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 \u201cI \u2026understand that former Secretary Clinton left classified documents in her hotel room in China and that U.S. Marine Corps security officials filed a report related to the possible compromise of the documents,\u201d Nunes wrote to FBI director James Comey. Additionally, Nunes said an email released in response to a FOIA request described Abedin asking another staffer to remove \u201cburnstuff\u201d Abedin had left in a car during a trip to India. Kirby told Fox News that incident may not have involved classified material. \u201cThis email exchange does not show that classified information was left in a motorcade car,\u201d Kirby said of that incident. \u201cSensitive But Unclassified material is routinely disposed of in burn bags. As the regulations state, Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) and Personally identifiable information (PII) documents are often burned. So it\u2019s not accurate that any reference to a document going to a burn bag is a document that includes classified material.\u201d\u00a0 As for the China incident, Kirby insisted that Clinton had nothing to do with the matter.\u00a0 \u201cTo be clear \u2013 this was not Secretary Clinton\u2019s hotel room and no citation whatsoever was given to Secretary Clinton, nor were any reports written about Secretary Clinton\u2019s conduct,\u201d Kirby said in the statement. At the time of the security sweep, the suite was still inside of a Diplomatic Security-controlled area, Kirby said, and under the direct control of a Diplomatic Security agent posted outside the room. \u201cUltimately, Diplomatic Security concluded that classified information had been improperly secured, but that the evidence did not support assigning culpability to any individual. Furthermore, the Diplomatic Security investigation concluded that due to the fact that the documents were found within a Diplomatic Security controlled area, the likelihood that the information was compromised was remote.\u201d Leaving out classified or top secret information is a serious offense, a former state department staffer told FoxNews.com. \u201cDiplomatic Security and the Marine Security Guard takes exposure of classified information very seriously,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy research at the Center for Immigration Studies.\u00a0\u201cYou can lose your security clearance if you\u2019re caught more than once, and that means you might lose your job. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d As FoxNews.com\u00a0reported Sept. 30, a top aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found herself in hot water in 2013 with the agency\u2019s security and law enforcement arm when she lost classified information while accompanying her boss on a diplomatic trip to Moscow, an incident that the FBI also revisited earlier this year when it probed Clinton\u2019s own problems handling sensitive data. Monica Hanley, Clinton\u2019s \u201c confidential assistant \u201d at the state department, was reprimanded and given \u201cverbal counseling\u201d by Diplomatic Security after she left classified material behind in the Moscow hotel, FBI documents show. The FBI spoke to Hanley, 35, in January as a part of its investigation into Clinton\u2019s handling of top-secret and classified information when she was Secretary of State. During her trip with Clinton to Russia, Hanley was given a \u201cdiplomatic pouch\u201d that held Clinton\u2019s briefing book and schedule for her Russian trip. Hanley brought the pouch and its contents into the Russian hotel suite, which she shared with Clinton, but she left behind some of those classified documents, the FBI report revealed. Diplomatic Security found the classified document in that suite during a routine sweep after Clinton and Hanley left the hotel. Agents subsequently informed Hanley \u201cthe briefing book and document should never have been in the suite.\u201d Adam Housley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based senior correspondent.

    "text": "By Emily Schultheis CBS News October 31, 2016, 3:33 PM DNC interim chairwoman passed debate questions along to Clinton campaign Email Interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile is coming under fire Monday after a newly released WikiLeaks email indicated she gave Hillary Clinton\u2019s team an explicit heads-up about debate questions last spring. In one exchange , released in Monday\u2019s batch of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s account, Brazile apparently wrote to Podesta ahead of the March 6 Democratic debate in Flint, Mich. \u201cOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,\u201d the subject line of the email read. It continued: \u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl [sic] of Flint.\u201d Russian hackers are blamed for breaking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's computers. But Kremli... And in a March 12 email to Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri, Brazile wrote: \u201cFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.\u201d The email included the text of what looked like a question about the death penalty, presumably for a CNN town hall Clinton was doing the following day. \u201cI\u2019ll send a few more,\u201d Brazile said. In a statement, CNN denied providing Brazile with any advance debate questions or preparation material and noted that she had officially resigned as a CNN contributor as of Oct. 14. \u201cWe are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,\u201d CNN\u2019s statement read. Brazile responded to the news Monday with a tweet directing reporters to her statement from earlier in October, in which she said she supported \u201call of our candidates for president\u201d and denounced Russia for its alleged role in hacking and releasing these emails in the first place. \u201cAs a longtime political activist with deep ties to our party, I supported all of our candidates for president,\u201d she said. \u201cI often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue. As it pertains to the CNN Debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.\u201d Brazile stepped in as the interim head of the DNC this summer, after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from the position because of a scandal surrounding hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Those leaked emails fed the perception that the DNC had been biased against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary. One Sanders\u2019 staff defended Brazile in the wake of the email\u2019s release, separating her from the DNC officials implicated in this summer\u2019s hack. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what she did or didn\u2019t send to Clinton people. All I can speak to is the relationship our camp had with her,\u201d Symone Sanders, a former Sanders campaign press secretary, wrote to Politico Monday. \u201cDuring the primary, Donna regular reached out for messaging guidance from us and was very helpful. She was even handed and we all had a great working relationship with her.\u201d Meanwhile, the White House is defending Brazile and her performance as DNC chairwoman.\u00a0 \u201cThe president believes that she\u2019s done a fine job stepping in in a very difficult situation to lead the Democratic Party,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. \u201cThose of us who\u2019ve known Donna a long time, know that she is a person of integrity and a person of high character.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Sedgwick County Sheriff\u2019s Office Email WICHITA, Kan. - A man accused of plotting to bomb a western Kansas apartment complex where 120 Somali immigrants live told The Associated Press on Monday that federal prosecutors waited until 10 minutes before his detention hearing to share their evidence with his defense attorney. Patrick Stein called the AP from jail in response to a letter seeking comment. Stein declined to talk about the charges against him until he talked with his attorney, but he derided the Oct. 21 proceeding as \u201ca half trial/detention hearing,\u201d laughing about it and calling it \u201cridiculous.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi presented during that hearing a thick packet of text messages, photographs and other material, reading some of the text exchanges in the courtroom. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any of that information that he laid out until 10 minutes before we went before the judge,\u201d Stein told the AP. \u201cThat is how they are playing the game.\u201d Jim Cross, spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, said in an email that prosecutors \u201cworked to compile information as quickly as possible. It was provided to the defendants\u2019 attorneys as soon as it was available.\u201d Prosecutors allege that Stein, 47, Gavin Wright, 51, and Curtis Allen, 49, planned to attack the apartment complex, which contained a mosque in one of the units, the day after the November election. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Stein said that while he would like to give his side of the story he needs to discuss with his attorney whether doing so would hinder his defense. \u201cI can\u2019t afford that - not when my life is on the line,\u201d he said. Stein was the only one of the three defendants who tried to get released pending trial, but U.S. Magistrate Judge Gwynne Birzer denied his request following a detention hearing in which she told him that he posed a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to the community.

KLAS Email LAS VEGAS -- Police say they\u2019ve arrested a 15-year-old student accused of plotting a shooting at his Las Vegas high school. Clark County School District Police captain Ken Young said Thursday the student at Desert Oasis High School was taken into custody Thursday after police uncovered an alleged plot for a mass shooting in the near future or \u201csomething more catastrophic\u201d at the school of about 2,350. Several students who heard about the alleged plot came forward, along with a parent in Arizona who listened in to a Skype conversation their child was having that mentioned the high school, Young said.\u00a0 Police interviewed the student suspect and went to his home, where they recovered evidence that\u2019s currently being analyzed. Sources told CBS affiliate KLAS that investigators discovered a \u201cmanifesto.\u201d Young wouldn\u2019t detail what items were found. Young thanked the students and the parents who called police.

    "text": "Hillary Clinton is slamming FBI director James Comey's decision to release a letter about the probe into the Democratic nominee's emails. Ed O'Ke... Investigators have already seen the subject, date, and time of the emails, but the software will isolate messages that may be relevant to the Clinton server investigation. Agents will cast out emails they\u2019ve already seen and search for those that came from Clinton or that may contain classified information. Then agents will manually go through those emails. \u201cI think this will be an extended process, given the sheer volume of emails ... and then any follow-up investigation, additional warrants, interviews, re-interviews,\u201d said Janice Fedarcyk, a former assistant director of the FBI. FBI agents in New York discovered the new emails earlier in October while investigating Weiner for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to a minor .\u00a0 Still unanswered is why FBI Director James Comey was not informed about the new emails until late last week. Also unclear is how Huma Abedin\u2019s emails ended up on her husband\u2019s laptop, and whether they will change the outcome of the investigation, in which Comey recommended that Clinton not be prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Sources said that Comey felt bound to inform Congress of the new development, but the timing of the revelation put him at odds with the attorney general. \u201cI do not honestly think that they will rush an investigation of this, this nature and this sensitivity,\u201d said Fedarcyk.\u00a0 Part of the delay was in securing a warrant to look at the emails.\u00a0 CBS News learned Monday that there was friction between Comey and the DOJ.\u00a0 Attorney General Loretta Lynch felt that getting a search warrant in this case -- so close to an election -- violated department policy. Comey got one anyway. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Ashlee Rezin, AP) CHICAGO \u2014 At least 17 people were killed and more than 40 others\u00a0were injured in shootings since Friday in the nation\u2019s third-largest city, marking the deadliest weekend in what has been the city\u2019s most violent year in more than a decade. There\u2019s already been more than 600 homicides in Chicago this year. The city is tallying murders at a rate not seen since the late 1990s in the midst of violence fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic. Police and Mayor Rahm Emanuel have blamed the current spike in street violence on increased gang activity and gun laws that they say aren\u2019t strong enough to deter convicted felons from carrying and using weapons. The violence has disproportionately impacted predominantly African-American neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides. \u201cThese violent gun offenders are clearly giving us the message that they just don\u2019t care about the rest of the city of Chicago,\" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Monday. \u201cTo be quite frank, I\u2019m sick of it, and I know the people in the communities are tired of it. That\u2019s why we have to do a better job of holding those individuals accountable.\u201d Among the victims of the\u00a0weekend violence were 17-year-old twins Edward and Edwin Bryant who were killed early Sunday in an apparent drive-by shooting in the city\u2019s Old Town neighborhood. Johnson said the shooting was possibly gang-related. The brothers were not documented gang members\u00a0but were with others who\u00a0did have gang affiliations. No one was in custody for the double homicide, but police have video\u00a0footage of the incident that they hope will lead detectives to assailants. In a separate drive-by shooting Saturday,\u00a014-year-old Demarco Webster Jr. was shot in the torso as he was standing on the street on the city\u2019s West Side. Police said witnesses saw someone in a dark-colored sedan shoot at Webster before fleeing the scene. Demarco was transported to a nearby suburban hospital but later succumbed to his injuries. Violence-plagued Chicago plans to hire nearly 1,000 more cops Two people were fatally shot late Friday evening as they sat in a car parked at\u00a0a gas station on the city\u2019s South Side\u00a0when a man approached them and fired multiple shots before fleeing the scene. Brian Fields, 30, suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and Chiquita Ford, 30, suffered fatal wound on the right side of her body. Fields had been injured in a shooting in early March. In that incident, Fields was\u00a0live-streaming himself on Facebook Live when a gunman opened fire on him. More than 60 shot in Chicago over July 4th weekend The violent\u00a0stretch marks the deadliest weekend\u00a0Chicago has seen the 2014 Independence Day weekend, when 16 were killed and 66 were wounded. The city also saw 13 killed in shootings over Father's Day weekend and Labor Day weekend this year. Chicago has recorded at least 2,800 shooting incidents through Oct. 16, according to police department data.\u00a0 The number of murders has climbed by about 44% compared with\u00a0last year\u00a0and has also seen significant increases in sexual assaults (16%), robbery (25%) and theft (19%) compared with\u00a0the same time last year.

USA TODAY Sports Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott (21) walks to the huddle in the fourth quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles at AT&T; Stadium. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) The lead attorney who evaluated allegations against Dallas Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliott says he believes there were a series of violent interactions between Elliott and the woman who accused him of abusing her five times in July. But Robert S. Tobias, principal assistant city attorney in Columbus (Ohio) and director of its prosecution resources unit, says he couldn\u2019t conclude exactly what happened between Elliott and the woman. The city attorney\u2019s office announced last month it was not pursuing criminal charges against Elliott, citing conflicting and inconsistent information across all incidents. USA TODAY Sports reported last week that Elliott has met with NFL investigators as part of an ongoing probe by the league, which faces a much lower burden of proof than prosecutors \u2013 and has the authority to place Elliott on paid leave pending a decision on potential discipline if Commissioner Roger Goodell believes Elliott may have violated the personal conduct policy. Trading Jamie Collins seems crazy, but it's just the 'Patriot Way' In response to questions last week from USA TODAY Sports about the case and comparisons to the NFL\u2019s investigation, Tobias wrote in an email: \u201cOver the course of a calendar year, there are thousands of complaints filed through our office where I truly believe the person filing the complaint is a victim of crime. But, for a significant number of them, the reality is that there is insufficient corroborating evidence to approve a criminal charge.\u00a0And for those complaints that do get charges approved, many face evidentiary hurdles at trial where, as you properly noted, the burden is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cFor the Ezekiel Elliott matter, I personally believe that there were a series of interactions between Mr. Elliott and (his accuser) where violence occurred.\u00a0However, given the totality of the circumstances, I could not firmly conclude exactly what happened.\u00a0Saying something happened versus having sufficient evidence to criminally charge someone are two completely different things.\u00a0Charging decisions are taken very seriously and we use best efforts to conduct thorough and detailed investigations.\u201d Asked if he believes Elliott committed some of the violence in those interactions, Tobias declined to expand, deferring to previous emails in which he pointed out the \u201csole focus\u201d of the investigation by the city attorney\u2019s office was to determine if there was sufficient corroborating evidence to support the woman\u2019s allegations. USA TODAY does not identify alleged victims of domestic violence. Giants GM Jerry Reese refuses to answer Josh Brown questions Tobias said he\u2019d had minimal contact via email with the NFL\u2019s director of investigations, Kia Roberts, who \u201cjust wanted to make sure she had all the information available,\u201d but the two had not spoken. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league has had multiple points of contact with Columbus authorities and its investigation remains ongoing, declining to provide details. Elliott\u2019s accuser said in an interview with police that Elliott choked her, attempted to hit her in the face, threw her against doors and onto a bed and refused to let her leave his apartment on multiple occasions over five days of abuse in July, when Elliott was back near campus at Ohio State prior to Cowboys training camp. But documents released by the Columbus City Attorney\u2019s Office reveal numerous issues with the case. Witnesses contradicted various portions of the accuser\u2019s accounts. A statement from one key witness \u2013 Ayrin Mason, who refers to Elliott as her ex-boyfriend and the accuser as a friend \u2013 said the accuser told Mason to lie to police about Elliott pulling the accuser from a car and assaulting her, though the accuser never raised that specific allegation to police. Elliott denied he dated the accuser or lived with her, as she claimed, though he acknowledged the two had a sexual relationship and he helped her with rent and co-signed a car lease with her. Elliott told police the accuser\u2019s injuries were from a fight with another woman \u2013 an altercation witnesses and a bar bouncer confirmed, matching the description of a fight observed by police \u2013 but Mason told police the accuser had bruises prior to that and had confided earlier that day abuse at the hands of Elliott. Mason said she didn\u2019t want to testify in court. Under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy, a player can be placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list (paid leave) if formally charged with a crime of violence, but also \u201cif an investigation leads the Commissioner to believe that you may have violated this Policy by committing any of the conduct identified above, he may act where the circumstances and evidence warrant doing so. This decision will not reflect a finding of guilt or innocence and will not be guided by the same legal standards and considerations that would apply in a criminal trial.\u201d NFL Week 8 overreactions: Does Cam Newton have a case against refs? A player may be disciplined even if not charged or convicted \u201cif the credible evidence establishes that you engaged in conduct prohibited by this personal conduct policy.\u201d Prohibited conduct includes \u201cactual or threatened physical violence against another person.\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told USA TODAY Sports on Sunday he hasn\u2019t discussed the issue with Elliott in recent months. Asked if he was satisfied there was nothing more to the allegations, Jones told USA TODAY Sports: \u201cTotally, with everything that was laid out. And all the people that looked at it in detail. I\u2019m well aware of what the officials have up there.\u201d Elliott's attorney, Frank Salzano, released a statement Monday night stressing his client wasn't charged, criticizing the media for focusing on the NFL's investigation and implying the league's probe only remains open because of recent controversy surrounding its handling of the Josh Brown case. \"We firmly believe that the NFL should promptly close its investigation which is only open because of their apprehensiveness stemming from the recent scrutiny it has come under for its handling of other domestic violence matters,\" Salzano's statement said. \"Notwithstanding the forgoing, we remain firm that the NFL will clear Mr. Elliott of any wrongdoing and this matter can be finally put to rest.\" The NFL has faced renewed scrutiny over its handling of domestic violence in light of recent revelations about former New York Giants kicker Josh Brown. Like Elliott, Brown was not criminally charged. The NFL still suspended Brown one game in August for a previously unreported arrest, then placed Brown on the exempt list and reopened its investigation this month after authorities in Washington released documents that included new allegations and admissions of abuse by Brown in emails and journals provided by his ex-wife. Strengthened after the Ray Rice fiasco and other incidents in 2014, the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy recommends a six-game suspension for a first offense involving a violent crime, though that\u2019s flexible based on aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The No. 4 overall pick in April\u2019s draft, Elliott leads the NFL with 799 rushing yards for the Cowboys, who beat the Philadelphia Eagles 29-23 in overtime Sunday night to improve to 6-1.

Two Chicago newspapers that analyzed police data from Friday afternoon to early Monday called it 2016's deadliest weekend. Chicago police couldn't immediately confirm that, though a spokesman said their weekend homicide count from Friday midnight through Sunday was 18. Either way, the toll surpassed the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times' analysis of holiday weekends when violence typically spikes. The Tribune reports six people were fatally shot over Memorial Day weekend, five over Fourth of July, and 13 over Labor Day . The October weekend deaths included seven people under 20 years old. Seventeen-year-old twin brothers were killed in a Sunday drive-by. There's been a spike in street violence this year with over 600 homicides already. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CNN accepts Donna Brazile's resignation after interactions with Clinton campaign prior to debate Donna Brazile Donna Brazile appears on the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Donna Brazile appears on the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (AP) Stephen Battaglio CNN distanced itself from interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile after supposedly hacked emails said she gave Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign advance word about a question for a March 6 primary debate with Bernie Sanders . Brazile was a commentator for CNN and a vice chair at the DNC at the time of the debate. She was suspended in July when she took over the DNC chair duties. CNN disclosed for the first time on Monday that it had accepted Brazile\u2019s resignation from the network on Oct. 14. \u201cCNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cWe are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.\u201d The statement came after the latest WikiLeaks drop of what it says are hacked emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta . The batch included a message purportedly from Brazile that contained a question used in the CNN Democratic primary debate staged in Flint, Mich., that dealt with the city\u2019s water crisis. \u201cOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,\u201d Brazile purportedly wrote in a March 5 email. \u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\u201d The question was presented to Clinton and Sanders during the CNN event. On Monday Brazile acknowledged the end of her relationship with CNN in a message on her Twitter account that said, \u201cThank you CNN . Honored to be a Democratic Strategist and commentator on the network. Godspeed to all my former colleagues.\u201d Brazile\u2019s official resignation apparently occurred three days after an earlier supposedly hacked email disseminated by WikiLeaks. In that March 12 message, regarding an upcoming town hall that aired on CNN and cable channel TV One, Brazile purportedly told Clinton\u2019s\u00a0communications director Jennifer Palmieri that \"From time to time, I get the questions in advance.\" According to another email on WikiLeaks, Brazile purportedly tipped off Palmieri that Clinton would get a query regarding her position on the death penalty. The question was posed to the candidate on the March 13 program. The Clinton campaign is refusing to confirm the authenticity of anything WikiLeaks has posted. Brazile is a veteran strategist who has worked on a number of national campaigns. She was the campaign manager for Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000.\u00a0 See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour \u00bb Caption Suzanne Lacey and Andrea Bowers in debut show for Beta Main A series of \"beta\" events will be staged in completed storefront areas of The Main Museum in downtown L.A.

    "text": "ESPN's Jon Gruden talks Jay Cutler, future of Bears QB position Halas Hall Pass: Jay Cutler set to return against Vikings Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs preview Jay Cutler's return in the Bears' Week 8 game against the Vikings. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs preview Jay Cutler's return in the Bears' Week 8 game against the Vikings. Rich Campbell Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune ESPN analyst Jon Gruden was at Chicago Bears headquarters Saturday afternoon ahead of Monday night\u2019s game against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field. He watched practice, and attended production meetings with Bears players and coaches. Then he hosted a \u201cChalk Talk\u201d session with members of the Thornridge High School and Waukegan High School football programs as part of his work with the Monday Night Football Sports Matter initiative. At Halas Hall, Gruden chatted with the Tribune about Bears quarterback Jay Cutler , the team\u2019s future at the quarterback position and his efforts with the initiative. Here's the full Q&A. What do you expect to see Monday night with Jay Cutler back for the Bears? The offense when he\u2019s in the game is going to be different than when Hoyer is in the game. I think the big thing he brings is athleticism. You look at third down. Last year, they were sixth converting third downs. A lot of it might have been Matt Forte \u2014 a third-down back coming out of there. They had Martellus Bennett in there. They had a guy, Marc Mariani , he was making first downs for them. They don\u2019t really have a pure slot receiver now (with Eddie Royal out). But anyway, Cutler\u2019s mobility to create some plays, scramble for a first down, scramble over here and then throw it \u2014 so it\u2019s no so scripted. I just think he brings the ad-lib plays. He brings the gun-slinging, throw-it-up-to-Alshon. We need an explosive play, a pass interference. Cutler ran over a safety last year, I think the Vikings\u2019 Harrison Smith , to put the Bears ahead late in the fourth quarter. It was a gritty, gutty play the guy made. Back to the future: Jay Cutler 's return to the huddle this week brought a fresh set of questions about his iffy future in Chicago. All signs right now are pointing to a winter separation from the Bears , a reality Cutler certainly understands even if he's programming himself to ignore... 4 storylines Back to the future: Jay Cutler 's return to the huddle this week brought a fresh set of questions about his iffy future in Chicago.

(Rich Campbell, Dan Wiederer and Brad Biggs) Bears ' rebuilding plan did not include anything about being 1-6 near the halfway point of Year 2.

But that reality once again has the organization absorbing indignities that come with being stuck at the bottom of the NFL . The latest blow hit Sunday morning when\u00a0 NFL Media reported the team has... (Rich Campbell) Cutler is interesting. Every time I come up here he\u2019s polarizing. Some love him. Some just don\u2019t like him. I feel bad for the guy because when we showed up to start the season (in Week 2) the offensive line, I mean, Cody Whitehair had never played center. Josh Sitton had just learned the snap count. And the right guard, Kyle Long , played right tackle (last year) and had (an injury-limited) training camp. And then Cutler was playing at Houston against J.J. Watt (in Week 1). Now he comes back and Sitton and Long don\u2019t look like they\u2019re playing. And they\u2019ve got to play the Vikings. So, you know, who\u2019s the running back? Who\u2019s the go-to receiver? Where are we going? I just think there are some issues. It\u2019s not just him. He\u2019s always going to take the bullets. And some the quarterback needs to take. But the Bears are rebuilding this team. You hate to say it, but they needed to be put back together. They got all old. So here we are with Cutler. You understand what young, highly-touted quarterback prospects mean to organizations that are bad enough to be in position to draft them. Knowing what the Bears are, what could one of those top quarterback prospects do for the Bears\u2019 big picture when they decide to finally go that direction? You\u2019ve got to get the right guy. I don\u2019t care who it is. Just because you draft a guy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got the right guy. I remember when Andy Reid took over the Kansas City Chiefs , they were 2-14. Andy is a good friend of mine. And they had the No. 1 pick in the draft (in 2013). There was no quarterback in the draft, so they took a tackle out of Central Michigan named Eric Fisher . Andrew Luck wasn\u2019t in that draft. Sorry, but Andrew\u2019s not in there this year. So every year you\u2019ve got to take the pool of players. Is there a free agent? Is there a guy we can trade for? He got Alex Smith . So, is there a guy that, when we build a great defense, can we do a better job on offense until we get that right quarterback? You just don\u2019t have them fall out of the sky. Right now, Houston got a guy ( Brock Osweiler ), $70 million, they\u2019re not sure they\u2019ve got the right guy. No one\u2019s sure they got the right guy. Maybe they think they did, but to a lot of us they\u2019ve got to prove that. When you watched the Buccaneers play against the Panthers earlier this year, did you have a sense of what Jameis Winston was doing for that organization? I love Jameis. Look, he threw for 4,000 yards last year. He stands in the fire, man. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s really good. NFL regular season, and fantasy owners are sizing up their division standings. Can they make one final push to make the postseason? Are there any players out there capable of helping? Here's the good news: For owners in need of a free agent that might assist their... We are at the halfway point of the NFL regular season, and fantasy owners are sizing up their division standings. Can they make one final push to make the postseason? Are there any players out there capable of helping? Here's the good news: For owners in need of a free agent that might assist their... (John Romero) We saw him last December. In fact, the Bears went down there and won. The Bears are going to win some games, now. This defense you got here, with Vic Fangio and John Fox in there, those guys are really good. They had Green Bay down, 10-6. I went to bed the other night. I couldn\u2019t take it. I hated the uniforms. The Bears were only down, 13-10, and I didn\u2019t know who was playing. I don\u2019t know who DeVante Bausby is, and who some of these guys are, and I don\u2019t think they care. They\u2019re really good coaches. They\u2019ve just got to get some guys healthy. Look at the 2015 draft. Where\u2019s Kevin White? Where\u2019s Eddie Goldman? Where\u2019s Hroniss Grasu? These guys aren\u2019t even making contributions because they\u2019re hurt. They\u2019re supposed to be the guys they\u2019re building the team around. Same with (Jeremy) Langford. You\u2019ve got to ask yourself what\u2019s with all the injuries? Going back to that Jameis Winston situation, as we prepare in Chicago for the Bears to go down a similar road, what can a prospect do like that for the energy and confidence of an organization? You just go to practice and watch. The defense steps it up a notch. \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a quarterback.\u2019 There\u2019s just a certain vibe. There\u2019s a certain intangible those guys bring to a team. And the playmaking and the production. They\u2019ve still got to get some things in order in Tampa, but when you have a quarterback, you have a chance. What\u2019s behind your work with the Sports Matter initiative? When I got fired from coaching. I started coaching high school because my son played. I realized real quick that high school football is in trouble. There\u2019s no budget. A lot of kids have got to pay to play, and every year coaches are getting out of the profession. Kids aren\u2019t playing like they used to. It bothers me. I want to create an awareness out there. And I met these people at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods that have done a lot of research that youth sports \u2014 boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 sports \u2014 are diminishing across the country. It really ticks me off. I got a lot of the greatest values in life from playing sports, from playing football \u2014 teamwork, sportsmanship, my work ethic, resiliency, dedication \u2014 I got it all by being on a team. There are a lot of geniuses out there that think we don\u2019t need sports anymore. That we can get these qualities by getting an app on your phone and looking at your phone. There are a lot of geniuses that think we should get rid of sports, get rid of recess. The first thing we did is created an awareness and partnered with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. They have become in the engine. The NFL and ESPN have gotten involved. We\u2019re getting NFL players. We\u2019re getting people involved to support their local youth sports programs. Every city we go to, we get three local high school teams and donate money to their programs. We give them equipment. We give them a message. And we give them some exposure. And we get a couple of NFL guys to give us a little bit of a jolt as we leave. Hopefully people wise up out there and understand that football is a great game. If it wasn\u2019t for football, a lot of the best times of my life, my brother\u2019s life, my dad\u2019s life, wouldn\u2019t exist. ",

Thousands of South Koreans took to the streets of the capital on Saturday calling for increasingly unpopular President Park Geun-hye to step down over allegations that she let an old friend, the daughter of a religious cult leader, interfere in important state affairs. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) 0 Shares Email South Korean police detained a man who rammed a large excavator into a gate Tuesday near the office where prosecutors questioned a woman at the center of a scandal that threatens the country's president. The woman had earlier said she \"deserves death\" and the detained man said he \"came here to help her die.\" The attack with heavy construction equipment on a government building is part of a frenzy of emotion in South Korea over the woman, Choi Soon-sil, whom prosecutors have detained as they examine whether she used her close ties to President Park Geun-hye to pull government strings from the shadows and amass an illicit fortune. Prosecutors are expected to quickly seek an arrest warrant for Choi, who was swarmed Monday by hundreds of journalists and protesters as she tried to enter the prosecution office. Choi, a cult leader's daughter with a decades-long connection to Park, was nearly knocked off her feet several times as the crowd closed in on her. Protesters screamed for her arrest and Park's resignation; one angry person reportedly tried to enter the building with a bucket full of animal feces; and Choi, 60, lost her Prada shoe in the scrum. Social media is now awash with images of the discarded black footwear and the word, \"Soonderella,\" a combination of parts of Choi's name and the girl from the fairy tale who leaves behind a glass slipper at a ball. \"Please, forgive me,\" Choi said Monday through tears inside the Seoul prosecutor's building. Using a common expression of deep repentance, she added, \"I committed a sin that deserves death.\" The man accused of running his big yellow excavator into the prosecution office near where Choi had been investigated later told officials that \"since Choi Soon-sil said she committed a sin that deserves death, I came here to help her die,\" according to police officer Han Jeung-sub. The man detained was identified as a 45-year-old surnamed Jeong. It wasn't known if Choi was at the Seoul office at the time of the ramming, which injured a security guard and damaged the gate and other facilities. Last week, amid intense speculation, Park acknowledged Choi had edited some of her speeches and provided public relations help. Widespread reports have said Choi had a larger role in government affairs despite having no official ties to the administration. Prosecutors are trying to determine the scope of access Choi had and whether she was given sensitive presidential documents. Choi has previously said she helped Park but didn't know if she was seeing confidential information. Other reports have contained allegations she misused money from nonprofit organizations after pressuring businesses to donate to them. Park has fired some of her closest aides to try to contain the fallout. Some lawmakers and the public have called for Park's resignation or impeachment, and thousands of people have protested in the streets. Choi has been close to Park since Choi's father, the leader of a religious cult, gained Park's trust by reportedly convincing her that he could communicate with her assassinated mother. Choi's father denied this in a 1990 media interview. The scandal has resonated with South Koreans in a way that past corruption allegations have not. Some of this has to do with Park Geun-hye, who has long been criticized for an aloof manner and for relying on only a few longtime confidantes. That she may have been outsourcing sensitive decisions to someone outside of government, and someone connected with a murky, lurid backstory, has incensed many. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "8 Children Hospitalized for Possible Rare Nervous System Disorder By Gillian Mohney Oct 31, 2016, 2:50 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH 8 Children Hospitalized for Possible Rare Nervous System Disorder 0 Shares Email Federal and state health officials are investigating a possible cluster of a rare nervous system disorder after multiple children reported symptoms, including weakness or loss of movement in one or more limbs. Eight children in the Washington state were hospitalized recently for symptoms that matched a rare condition called acute flaccid myleititis (AFM). It is condition that affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can occur due to various causes, including the polio virus. Experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Washington State Health Department are still evaluating if these children's symptoms point to AFM as an \"exact cause\" and other conditions are being investigated as well, according to the Washington State Health Department. \"None of them have been confirmed or ruled out,\" department spokeswoman Julie Graham told ABC News. \"At this point there isn\u2019t evidence that would point to a single source of illness among these cases,\" Dr. Scott Lindquist, state infectious disease epidemiologist at the Department of Health, said in the statement on Friday. Fighting Zika With GMO Mosquitoes Could Be the Future of Mosquito Control All of the children, between the ages of 3 to 14, reported a loss of strength or movement in one or more limbs. Three of the children remain hospitalized and five have been released, according to the state health department. Since AFM can be caused by a viral infection, officials at Seattle Children's Hospital have taken steps to minimize the risk of infection among patients. \"At Seattle Children\u2019s, patient safety is our top priority and parents should rest assured that it is safe to bring their children to the hospital,\" Dr. Mark Del Beccaro, chief medical officer at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, said in a statement. \"We are following our standard infection control protocols, including putting patients with symptoms of active respiratory infections in isolation so they do not have contact with any other patients.\" The CDC was already investigating an increase of AFM cases in the U.S., with at least 50 cases reported by last August compared to 21 cases in all of 2015. In 2014, 120 cases of AFM were reported throughout the U.S. just between August and December. At the time, the CDC and other health agencies were investigating if a virus called enterovirus D68 was linked to the increase in cases. Enterovirus D68 spread rapidly in 2014 and infected many children. Some of the children developed AFM, but the CDC has not \"consistently detected a pathogen\" in the spinal fluid of infected patients, making the cause impossible to pinpoint. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "New discovery could solve mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart By Kirrily Schwarz Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Amelia Earhart (Library of Congress) Legendary aviator Amelia Earhart was attempting to become the first female pilot to fly around the world when her plane disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1937. Last month, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) proposed the theory that she landed her plane safely on a remote island and\u00a0 died as a castaway . Now, scientists say a new discovery shows a striking similarity between the pilot and the partial skeleton of a castaway found on an island in the country of Kiribati in 1940. A historical photo provided the vital clue. The legendary pilot In May 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, taking off in Canada and landing in Ireland. Three years later, she flew solo from Hawaii to California, winning a $10,000 prize. She was America\u2019s darling, famous for being a daring, but modest, pilot. SCIENTISTS TO STUDY STRANGE STAR FOR SIGNS OF LIFE\u00a0 Together with co-pilot Frederick J. Noonan, she was attempting to circumnavigate the globe when the plane disappeared somewhere near Howland Island, in the middle of the Pacific. In August, TIGHAR\u2019s Ric Gillespie said Earhart made\u00a0 more than 100 radio transmissions \u00a0calling for help between July 2 and July 6 of 1937, ruling out the possibility of a crash landing. Her calls were picked up as far away as Texas, Florida, and even Melbourne. \u201cShe\u2019s out there calling for help,\u201d Mr Gillespie said, adding that she must have landed safely, because the radio wouldn\u2019t have worked without the engine running. A strange detail\u00a0 The bones were uncovered on the island of Nikumaroro, also known as Gardner Island, which is about 400 miles south of Howland Island. They were analysed in 1940, but a doctor said they were male, ruling out the possibility they belonged to Earhart. However, when TIGHAR discovered the files in 1998, scientists said modern techniques proved the bones were \u201cconsistent with a female of Earhart\u2019s height and ethnic origin\u201d. INCREDIBLE IMAGES OFFER FIRST GLIMPSE OF SUNKEN WWII-ERA AIRCRAFT CARRIER\u00a0 More recently, anthropologist Richard Jantz was preparing an updated evaluation when he noticed\u00a0 a strange detail:\u00a0 the skeleton\u2019s forearms were considerably larger than average. However, without knowing the dimensions of Earhart\u2019s body, Dr Jantz had no way of comparing if her forearms were similarly longer than normal. The fascinating science\u00a0 TIGHAR turned to forensic imaging specialist Jeff Glickman for help. Using a historical photo where both of Earhart\u2019s bare arms were visible, he calculated the ratio between the bones in her lower and upper arm. \u201cBecause there is tissue over the skeleton in living people ... the location of each bone end must be estimated,\u201d he wrote in\u00a0 a report published last week . Her clothing also added a layer of difficulty, however, he used the point of her shoulder, the crease of her elbow, and the indent of her wrist as landmarks. SUNKEN AMERICAN WWII TORPEDO BOMBER DISCOVERED IN PACIFIC\u00a0 \u201cGiven the evidence and my experience in the field of photogrammetry and photo interpretation, I estimate that the radius-to-humerus ratio of Amelia Earhart is 0.76,\u201d he wrote. In other words, the difference between her lower and upper arm was virtually identical to the partial skeleton, unearthed in the South Pacific. The discovery doesn\u2019t conclusively prove the castaway was Amelia Earhart, but it\u2019s certainly another step in that direction. ",

Medina and Emmanuelle Saliba Dakota Access Pipeline protesters square off against police near the Standing Rock Reservation and the pipeline route outside Saint Anthony, North Dakota, on Oct. 5, 2016. Reuters Share advertisement There's a mysterious plane and helicopter circling over the camp at Standing Rock in North Dakota, where police and activists have been locked in a showdown over the Dakota Access oil pipeline for months. It's unclear who sent the plane or its purpose \u2014 but those on the ground believe it may be flying overhead to interfere with connectivity. Dakota Access Pipeline protesters square off against police near the Standing Rock Reservation and the pipeline route outside Saint Anthony, North Dakota, on Oct. 5, 2016. Reuters \"We don't know what it does. Some posts have been blocked from being posted on Facebook. Some live feeds have been disrupted. I know one woman's phone completely crashed while she was at the front line and it doesn't work anymore. She had valuable videos on her phone,\" Marilyn Fox, 18, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe told NBC News. Related: Fight for Standing Rock: Native Americans Defend Water, Land Questions of surveillance have circulated at the camp. Protesters call themselves water protectors, because the pipeline would be built beneath the primary water supply of several tribal communities and cities downstream. These water protectors say they've had trouble getting connectivity and are also aware of allegations police may be targeting protesters who are checked in via Facebook. Nathan Wessler, an ACLU staff attorney who specializes in technology and privacy, said he \"doesn't know for sure whether law enforcement or the landowner is using technology that could surveil or interfere with phone networks, but we have heard from some activists on the ground who have said their phones are behaving strangely.\" NBC News producer Chiara Sottile, who is at Standing Rock, reported interference in microphones she was using for an interview as the plane circled above on Sunday. Such interference could have been caused by other factors as well. Wessler said there are a few different technologies that law enforcement could use to scramble phone networks, including technology such as cell site simulators and phone jammers. However, he also said the reports in North Dakota could also be caused by over saturated cell network. The ACLU has outstanding requests with local law enforcement and government agencies for public records concerning North Dakota and the use of this technology, he said. Chances are, you've seen at least a few of your Facebook friends checked in at Standing Rock today, but they're likely not in North Dakota. The viral movement came amid reports law enforcement was using Facebook to surveil activists checked in at Standing Rock. \"It's almost as if they've figured out that's how we're getting the word out about what's going \u2014 about what's truly going on here,\" Fox said. \"So they're doing their best to prevent that from happening, because they know the truth isn't being spoken about on local media.\" In a statement, Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier called the reports \"absolutely false.\" \"The Morton County Sheriff's Department is not and does not follow Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location,\" said Kirchmeier. Post by NBC News . For Dallas Goldtooth, whose Facebook Live videos have routinely garnered hundreds of thousands of views throughout the standoff, the reports that the Morton County Sheriff's office was possibly monitoring his or others' Facebook activity was \"completely unsurprising.\" \"Every one of us who's utilized social media to broadcast online has been targeted,\" Goldtooth, an activist with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told NBC News. Goldtooth said the Facebook \"check-in\" campaign was \"an innovative way to keep folks engaged in our struggle\" but, he countered, \"we understand it's not a game changer, though.\" Chiara Sottile ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A Democratic operative who bragged about getting orders from Hillary Clinton to execute a bizarre stunt aimed at Donald Trump and was linked to a covert operation to incite the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s supporters was \u201cclose\u201d to Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, according to an email released Sunday by WikiLeaks \u2013 despite the campaign\u2019s denial of any \u201crelationship\u201d with the consultant. \u00a0\u00a0 Democracy Partners co-founder Mike Lux made the eyebrow-raising assertion in a Dec. 17, 2015 email to Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden. The message , found in a trove hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account and posted by WikiLeaks, refers to an alleged connection between Democracy Partners head Robert Creamer and Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook. \u201cJust wanted to pass along this note I sent to Bob Creamer, who as you may know is consulting for the DNC and is close to Robby Mook,\u201d Lux wrote in a note about outreach to grassroots progressives. DEM OPERATIVES LOSE JOBS AFTER UNDERCOVER VIDEO COMMENTS Mook previously denied any ties between the Clinton campaign and Creamer after undercover video surfaced appearing to tie Creamer to schemes to incite brawls at Trump rallies and illegally bus voters to polling stations. \u201cThese individuals no longer have any relationship with the DNC. They\u2019ve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign,\u201d Mook said on CNN on Oct. 23. \u201cAnd my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened in February of last year, they did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again, a video that was leaked out for the purpose of damaging the campaign.\u201d Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 But Lux\u2019s email would appear to call most of that statement into question. Mook stated Democracy Partners didn\u2019t \u201chave a contract with the DNC until June [2016],\u201d though Lux clearly asserts Creamer is \u201cconsulting for the DNC\u201d as of December 2015. Lux\u2019s characterization of Mook and Creamer as \u201cclose,\u201d and Creamer\u2019s own boast in one video of getting a directive from Clinton, also raise questions about Mook\u2019s response. Asked about any relationship between Creamer and Mook, Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin told FoxNews.com in an email that the Clinton camp was not authenticating individual emails from the Podesta hack. Instead, Caplin blasted Trump for not standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose government many intelligence analysts blame for the email theft. Creamer earlier this month said he was \u201cstepping back\u201d from efforts to elect Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee following the release of the undercover, edited Project Veritas video in which a Democracy Partners subcontractor appeared to describe a push to incite Trump supporters to violence. Another video emerged last week that showed Creamer twice bragging that Clinton personally approved plans to place Donald Duck-suited activists at Trump rallies. Amid separate reports finding Creamer made hundreds of White House visits, the email released Sunday provided yet another link between the highest levels of the Democratic Party and the operative. The GOP quickly posted to its website the text of the email alongside Mook\u2019s recent denial. Trump has referenced the Project Veritas videos on the campaign trail and during the third presidential debate. \u201cI was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence,\u201d Trump said during the Oct. 19 debate. \u201c[Clinton\u2019s] the one, and [President] Obama, that caused the violence. They hired people, they paid them $1,500, and they\u2019re on tape saying, be violent, cause fights, do bad things.\u201d The DNC and Clinton campaign have steadfastly disavowed the actions discussed in the videos, produced by controversial conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe. \u201cWhile Project Veritas has been known to offer misleading video out of context, some of the language and tactics referenced in the video are troubling even as a theory or proposal never executed,\u201d Clinton campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said earlier this month.

(John Locher/AP) Donald Trump's\u00a0 hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from\u00a01996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaign's latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio's firm says it is still owed for polling. Trump campaign officials declined to provide details about the reason the campaign\u00a0has declined to pay the sum to\u00a0Fabrizio Lee, the pollster's Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based firm.\u00a0\u201cThis is an administrative issue that we're resolving internally,\u201d said senior communications adviser Jason Miller. Fabrizio did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fabrizio was an ally of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who persuaded a skeptical Trump in the spring that he needed a professional pollster. The abrupt departure of Manafort in August and Trump's hiring of pollster Kellyanne Conway to be his campaign manager raised questions about whether Fabrizio would stay on. There have also been multiple reports that Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner have rejected Fabrizio's advice. Even though he was hired in May, the campaign did not make any payments to Fabrizio until September, when his firm received nearly $624,000, federal filings show. Trump's finance reports show that the campaign owes the firm an additional $55,300 on top of the $766,756.67 in debt that it is contesting. Fabrizio\u2019s polling firm has also been paid by\u00a0the Committee on Arrangements for the 2016 Republican National Convention, which gave it\u00a0$273,378 in July, federal filings show. Despite his issues with Fabrizio, Trump appears to have warmed up to pollsters in general. Since late August, the GOP nominee has tapped four other polling firms to conduct voter surveys, including Conway's, which had been paid $673,000 through Oct. 19, filings show. Anu Narayanswamy contributed to this report. Read more:\u00a0 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took time off the campaign trail to cut the ribbon at his new D.C. hotel Oct. 26.

Martijn Beekman /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption The leader of the far-right Freedom Party, Geert Wilders, poses at The Hague in December. Martijn Beekman /AFP/Getty Images The hate-speech trial of far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders opened Monday, with Wilders notably absent from the proceedings. The Freedom Party leader known for his remarks against Islam said he's boycotting the trial for alleged racial discrimination and inciting hatred \u2014 accusations tied to comments he made about Moroccans at a 2014 rally. \"Prosecutors argued that Geert Wilders crossed a line when he asked supporters if they wanted 'fewer or more Moroccans' in the Netherlands,\" the BBC reports . \"After supporters chanted back 'fewer,' he replied: 'We'll organise that.\" Wilders maintains he has done nothing wrong and that the trial is political. He announced that he would not be attending the proceedings in a video statement Thursday , saying he would be represented by his lawyer. \"I refuse to cooperate. Political statements should be discussed in Parliament, not in court,\" Wilders said, referring to himself as a \"politician who says what the politically correct elite does not want to hear.\" He repeated his earlier inflammatory remarks: \"It's a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans. It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country \u2014 because the Netherlands have a huge problem with Moroccans.\" Article continues after sponsorship In response, a spokesman for the public prosecutor, Frans Zonneveld, said, \"The fact that the politician has to appear before a court doesn't make it a political trial.\" He told The New York Times that \"the whole of Dutch society and the people who have made complaints on this issue, as well as Mr. Wilders, have a right to have a court verdict on this matter.\" As NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson tells our Newscast unit, \"some 6,500 complaints were filed in connection with his remarks and several dozen were read aloud in the Dutch courtroom today.\" Soraya explains that Wilders could face up to two years in prison if he's found guilty \u2014 but \"Dutch prosecutors say most people convicted of such crimes are fined or ordered to do community service.\" She adds that Wilders was \"acquitted at a similar trial in the Netherlands five years ago.\" However, legal experts say this trial differs from the previous one in a significant way. In the last trial, he was accused of \"discriminating against, and inciting hatred towards, Muslims in interviews in which he denounced Islam as a 'fascist' religion,\" The Guardian reports . This time, he's accused of comments inciting hatred against Moroccans, rather than Islam. Henny Sackers, a professor of criminal law at Radoud University, tells the newspaper that this means the prosecutor might have a stronger case: \"The European court says you can criticise religion in public even if it shocks, hurts or disturbs. ... In the case of discrimination on grounds of nationality, you can be guilty of an offence in Dutch law if you provoke social unrest. So I see the chances of a conviction for Wilders as being considerably higher than three years ago.\" Some 400,000 Moroccans live in the Netherlands, where they \"make up 2 percent of the population,\" according to The Associated Press.

USA TODAY, Collin Brennan Kati Averitt, with her son Jack Averitt, 1, is facing highter health care premiums after the insurer she and her family found through the ACA marketplace, has announced it's leaving her area, Zionsville, Indiana, Monday, Oct. 31, 2016. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) As open enrollment starts Tuesday on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, consumers in some parts of the country are bracing for huge rate hikes, while many others are preparing to change insurers and likely doctors. The crazy quilt of 2017 changes is creating angst among both supporters of the law and consumers under 65 who don't get their insurance through work.\u00a0And it comes as enrollment needs a\u00a0big boost, especially of younger, healthier people to help offset insurers' costs of covering the sicker people who have signed up so far. \"The way people are experiencing Obamacare varies tremendously across the country,\" says Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u00a0\"In some states, the market is stable and in other places, it\u2019s a bit of a mess.\" For example, the second lowest cost silver plan \u2014\u00a0which federal subsidies are based upon \u2014\u00a0was up 116% in Arizona and down 3% in Indiana. In Indiana, four insurers left the exchange and four remain, while consumers in all but one Arizona county only have one insurer to buy from. Much of Southwest Florida, a region with uninsured rates above the national average, will have a single insurer from which they can select plans: Florida Blue. Nearly 93,000 residents of the Gulf Coast counties enrolled in exchange plans during the last enrollment period, according to government figures. About 80,000 of them live in counties with a single provider this time around. Obamacare: There's at least some agreement on what's best, worst \"This year, the vast majority of consumers will qualify for tax credits that help keep coverage affordable, and it\u2019s easier than ever to shop around and compare options,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said\u00a0in a statement. A key point of pride among Obamacare supporters is that about 20 million more people were insured early this year than in 2010 before the law took effect. Federal data out Monday also show, however, that there was no statistically significant difference between the number insured in the first six months of this year\u00a0compared to the same period last year. Decisions by insurers including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield to leave many states prompted insurance regulators to allow insurers to refile their rate requests, often more than once. That led eight states to approve\u00a0rates that were often far higher than those originally proposed by insurers. It's critical to attract more people into the exchanges to make them \"attractive for more insurers,\" says\u00a0Ashish Jha, a physician who is a professor of both health policy and medicine at Harvard. \"We have to fix it one way or another,\" says Jha. Ashish Jha is a practicing general internist who is also a professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a member of the Institute of Medicine. \u00a0(Photo: Harvard Office of External Relations) Jha favors more generous subsidies to help people afford insurance instead of increasing the tax penalties for not buying it. \"Prices go up and young healthy people opt out,\" Jha says, which causes rates to rise, creating a \"vicious cycle.\" A \"virtuous cycle\" is possible too, he says, when prices go down, more people buy health insurance and more insurers come in. Andy Nebel, who has a Chicago-area video production company, was used to the downsides of health insurance as someone with several preexisting health conditions before the ACA. One plan he bought had a $7,500 deductible per claim. But now he's worried insurance companies are taking advantage of people like him with individual insurance. He's shopping for a new plan because his Aetna plan was eliminated. However, the closest hospital for his only\u00a0Blue Cross Blue Shield option is nearly two hours away. \"I understand that poor people who get some federal relief will be able to get affordable health insurance, but middle class individuals who want to buy health insurance are being shut out,\" says Nebel, who is 53.\u00a0\"What kind of a country is it where\u00a0I can\u2019t leave and start my own company and and get good health insurance?\" The law shouldn't allow health plans to \"dump sick people on other health plans,\" says economist John Goodman, a critic of Obamacare who helped draft an alternative pending in the SenateBut that's what the narrow networks of hospitals and doctors allow\u00a0by making their plans \"unattractive to people who would have very high health care costs.\" Young healthy people shouldn't have to bear the burden either, says Goodman. \u00a0The ACA also decreased the number of levels of underwriting it allows, which forces young people to pay more than many believe they should. \"The federal government created this problem.,\" says Goodman, who was the longtime head of the free market National Center for Policy Analysis. \"Taxpayers should generally be called upon to solve it, not just a small number of young people in the individual market. \" How 2017 is different: \u2022 Shopping around more important than ever. \u00a0The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will match\u00a0people whose insurers are leaving the exchanges\u00a0to another plan, but consumers will only be officially enrolled if and when they pay their first month's premium. \u00a0For those whose insurer is still on the exchange, most who\u00a0don\u2019t return to Healthcare.gov\u00a0by December 15 \u2014 the deadline for coverage that takes effect on January 1 \u2014 will be re-enrolled in their current plan. But shopping around saves money. CMS says if every returning consumer picked the cheapest plan in the same metal level as last year, their average premiums would drop by\u00a020% a month over 2016. \u2022 Rates are often way up. The tax credits more than 80% of people get\u00a0to pay their premiums will generally keep up with the rate increases, shielding people below 400% of the federal poverty limit \u2014 about $97,000 a year for a family of four \u2014\u00a0from most of the pain. But the\u00a0people who aren't eligible for tax credits will be especially hard hit. \u2022 Tax penalties will be at their maximum. \u00a0Those who weren't insured in 2016 will have the highest penalties at tax time in April: $695 per adult or a maximum of $2,085 per\u00a0family or 2.5% of adjusted gross income, whatever's higher.\u00a0Some experts recommend that the penalty for remaining uninsured should be higher as it is often cheaper to remain uninsured than to pay the penalty. Hitting home In Indiana, more than 68,000 people find themselves starting anew on the marketplace after the departure of their insurers for this year. Four plans, including United Healthcare and IU Health, opted not to offer plans for 2017, leaving only four insurers on the exchange. Kati Averitt and her family are among those bracing for what the market may bring. Until last year, Averitt, a teacher, and her husband, who works for a small business, had insurance through her employer. Then their infant son arrived and Averitt decided to quit her job and stay at home. Through an insurance agent, the Zionsville, Ind., family found a plan they liked for a monthly premium of just under $900. Kati Averitt, with her son Jack Averitt, 1, is facing highter health care premiums after the insurer she and her family found through the ACA marketplace, has announced it's leaving her area, Zionsville, Indiana, Monday, Oct. 31, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Then came the letter from United Healthcare. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of back to the drawing board for us because we don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d Averitt said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m worried about how much it will be.\u201d Across the board, Indiana marketplace consumers can expert premiums to increase between 15 to 30%,\u00a0said Matt Kleymeyer, Indiana market leader for Bernard Health. \u00a0He cautions his clients not to choose plans based on price alone, if at all possible. Many of the cheaper plans available offer fewer choices when it comes to providers. Whatever happens with the ACA, Jha says he hopes it doesn't lead to an abandonment of the Obama administration's commitment to those who couldn't afford insurance before the law. \"We're too wealthy of a country to not cover the poor,\" he says.

Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images White House spokesman Josh Earnest at the White House briefing Tuesday, where he said he would \"neither defend nor criticize what Director [James] Comey has decided to communicate to the public\" regarding the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 8:30 p.m. ET In a letter to several Democratic senators Monday, the Justice Department said it \"will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible\" regarding the review of thousands of newly discovered emails that may be relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server. Did FBI Director James Comey's Email Announcement Break The Law? The letter, signed by Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, came in response to four Senate Democrats who sent the Justice Department a strongly worded letter of their own, pressing for more details about precisely why FBI Director James Comey revived the inquiry into Clinton's emails. That letter was signed by Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee; Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee; Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee; and Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. The letter did not discuss whether the department officials were on board with Comey's decision to disclose the revived investigation last Friday. Leahy, Feinstein, Carper and Cardin called Comey's disclosure to Congress about the renewed probe \"vaguely worded\" and left \"so many questions unanswered.\" In particular, they wrote, \"it is not clear whether the emails identified by the FBI are even in the custody of the FBI, whether any of the emails have already been reviewed, whether Secretary Clinton sent or received them, or whether they even have any significance to the FBI's previous investigation.\" Article continues after sponsorship The senators had set a deadline of Monday for answers. The DOJ letter did not include any more information about the investigation. Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a fierce Clinton critic, sent a letter to Comey Monday, castigating him for not providing \"additional context\" to his disclosure. \"Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton,\" Grassley wrote. Grassley acknowledged DOJ faced a difficult decision about whether to disclose the new development, but said he was disappointed in Comey's cryptic approach. \"While I disagree with those who suggest you should have kept the FBI's discovery secret until after the election, I agree that your disclosure did not go far enough,\" Grassley wrote. \"Unfortunately, your letter failed to give Congress and the American people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development.\" Grassley then laid out 10 questions for the FBI to answer, including whether the FBI had read the new emails, whether any of the emails are duplicates of those the bureau already investigated and exactly how the FBI learned of the existence of the new emails. Grassley demanded answers to his questions by Nov. 4. Also on Monday, the White House carefully tried to steer clear of the political fight over Comey's controversial decision to publicize a new round of scrutiny related to Clinton's private email server. \"I'll neither defend nor criticize what Director Comey has decided to communicate to the public about this investigation,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. Comey has become a lightning rod since he notified Congress last Friday that agents had discovered additional emails that could be relevant to the server probe. Although Comey said he couldn't be sure of the emails' significance, the announcement \u2014 just a week and a half before the presidential election \u2014 sent shock waves through the political world. Republicans, including Donald Trump, cheered the renewed scrutiny, while Democrats cried foul. The partisan sniping was the opposite of what it had been in July, when Comey concluded a lengthy investigation of Clinton's private server with a finding that no reasonable prosecutor would bring criminal charges. The new emails were discovered during an unrelated investigation of former Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and others have criticized Comey for publicizing the renewed scrutiny at such a preliminary stage, before agents are even aware whether the emails contain additional information. In an op-ed for the Washington Post , Holder pointed to long-standing Justice Department policies against taking actions near an election that could influence the outcome. Earnest said he doesn't think that was Comey's intent. \"The president doesn't believe that Director Comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election,\" Earnest said. \"The president believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity. He's a man of principle. And he's a man of good character.\" Obama appointed Comey to lead the FBI. He earlier held high-ranking positions in the George W. Bush administration. Earnest added that even if there were not an election just over a week away, Justice Department guidelines typically limit what officials are allowed to say about investigations. He suggested that's an important safeguard to protect innocent targets of a probe, given the government's broad powers to gather information. Officials at the Department of Justice urged Comey not to deliver his notice to Congress but did not order the FBI director to hold off. Doing so might have looked like the department was running interference on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidate. The White House has also been careful about that, going to what Earnest called \"great lengths\" to insulate the FBI's probe \"from even the appearance of political interference.\" As NPR's Carrie Johnson reports, the FBI is currently sifting through the newly discovered emails to figure out whether they are duplicates of what agents already read during the investigation of Clinton that ended in no criminal charges in July. Longtime friends tell Carrie that Comey felt boxed in by the situation \u2014 he had testified twice that the server investigation was over. But then he was faced with the new email findings, which he worried could leak. Clinton has urged the FBI to put out more information, saying over the weekend that \"it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.\" ",

    "text": "How Enthusiasm, Early Voting Can Affect Turnout in Presidential Election James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York and the author of \"Polarized: Making Sense of a Divided America,\" believes the investigation into the new trove of emails \"will definitely help Republicans from the top to the bottom of the ticket.\" \"Just as [Comey's] earlier announcement ... helped Clinton in July, this hurts her candidacy by raising the matter again,\" he explained. The down-ballot implications will likely be seen in the form of depressed turnout rather than people switching their votes from Democratic to Republican, Campbell said. He noted that in recent races, 8 to 9 out of 10 presidential voters cast straight ticket ballots. According to John Hudak, a political scientist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the email investigation could do more harm to down-ballot candidates than to Clinton. \"It's probably not going to risk Clinton's loss, but it could jeopardize some of her coattail effect,\" he said. He continued, \"I don't think there are many voters who are out there saying, 'I was willing to support Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, but now that this email thing broke, I'm going to go vote for Donald Trump [and the Republicans].'\" Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan look on during a campaign rally at Saint Anselm College, Oct. 24, 2016, in Manchester, New Hampshire. Clinton has been including local Democratic Senate and House candidates like Hassan at her campaign stops, regularly making pitches for herself as well as for her party's down-ballot contenders. Hudak said her team was likely thinking that \"if Clinton runs up the score in a lot of these states she's going to win, it might help carry a couple of Democratic senators on her back,\" but that may no longer be true. \"That was something the campaign was thinking seriously about, but if this situation cuts a couple of points into her margins in some of these states, it might be a little more difficult for her Senate or House races,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

An-Li Herring/NPR At the Supreme Court on Monday, the justices heard arguments in the case of a girl with disabilities, her service dog and the school that barred the dog from the premises. Ehlena Fry was born with cerebral palsy, which significantly limits her mobility but not her cognitive skills. So when she was about to enter kindergarten in Napoleon, Mich., her parents got a trained service dog \u2014 a white furry goldendoodle, named Wonder. Dog and kid traveled to Ohio and trained together for two weeks so that Ehlena could use Wonder to help her, for example, open and close doors, transfer from a chair to a walker, or from a walker to a toilet seat. But the school district would not allow the dog. It said it was already paying for an aide to help the child, and the dog was unnecessary. Ehlena's parents maintained the dog was necessary to make her more independent, just as a Seeing Eye dog would be for a blind student. They subsequently moved to another, more welcoming school district, where Wonder helped Ehlena until she graduated to middle school. Article continues after sponsorship Ehlena and her family were on the steps of the Supreme Court Monday, surrounded by dogs, parents, and kids with similar problems. Wonder, who is now pretty much retired as a service dog, was there too, dutifully at Ehlena's side. Enlarge this image Ehlena Fry and her service dog, Wonder, visit the Supreme Court on Monday. An-Li Herring/NPR hide caption toggle caption Ehlena Fry and her service dog, Wonder, visit the Supreme Court on Monday. An-Li Herring/NPR \"He was a great helper to me and my family,\" Ehlena said, \"and he made me independent.\" The legal issue before the Supreme Court tests whether children denied the help of a service dog may sue for damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA, without first going through a time consuming and sometimes costly administrative appeal under another law, the Individuals with Disability Education Act, or IDEA. Representing Ehlena, lawyer Sam Bagenstos seemed to face considerable skepticism at first from both conservative and liberal justices. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that if parents want additional leverage in designing the free and appropriate public education plans to which their children are entitled under the IDEA, they can gain additional leverage by suing for damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act. And that, chimed in Justice Stephen Breyer, \"would seem to gut the carefully written procedural system that the IDEA sets up.\" Lawyer Bagenstos replied that Ehlena's family is suing for emotional distress damages \u2014 something not available under the IDEA, so there is no point in going through an administrative appeal under that law. What emotional damages? In addition to the school's general hostility to the dog, Bagenstos cited the humiliation Ehlena suffered when forced to demonstrate, in front of four adults at the school, just how she used the dog to get on and off the toilet. Representing the school district, lawyer Neal Katyal told the justices that timing is central to the case \u2014 that parents cannot file a suit for damages under the ADA before completing administrative appeals under the IDEA. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg opined that just because the IDEA exists doesn't mean individuals are barred from suing under other laws that protect the disabled. \"Think of it this way,\" Justice Elena Kagan interjected. \"Suppose this girl wanted to go to a public library a couple of times a week and the library said, 'You can't take your dog here; we're going to just provide you with a librarian who will help you.' \" If the girl sues, claiming \"she was deprived of access to a public facility in a way that caused her distress and emotional harm, isn't that exactly the suit\" this girl brought here, \"except that instead of a library, it's a school?\" Lawyer Katyal suggested that allowing these suits would create a two-track system that would constitute an \"end run\" around the \"cooperative process\" in which parents and school officials are supposed to design an individualized education plan for a disabled child under the IDEA. In this case, though, Chief Justice Roberts said, the cooperative process is a \"charade\" because the parents weren't asking for the school district to allow the dog as part of an education plan but to allow the dog under the ADA, which guarantees access for the disabled. Lawyer Katyal replied, \"You can't just say, 'Oh I met with some administrators, and they didn't like the dog.' You've got to go through the complicated process that IDEA\" requires. After all, he added, \"It's only 105 days, start to finish.\" Chief Justice Roberts, father of two high school students, raised his brows at that, observing \"105 days is a big part of the school year.\" But when the dust settled, it was unclear in which direction the court was heading.

In each lawsuit, the state's Democratic Party is seeking court action to preemptively block potential voter harassment or intimidation from Republican poll watchers or other observers. The lawsuits were filed beginning Sunday in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona against Trump's campaign, each state's Republican Party and GOP operative Roger Stone, who runs the group Stop the Steal. Trump has called on his supporters to act as election observers in certain areas of the country to help prevent fraud. That has stirred fears of voter intimidation and confrontations at the polls. In a federal lawsuit filed in Cleveland, the Ohio Democratic Party accused Trump and Republicans of conspiring to threaten, intimidate and prevent minority voters from casting ballots in the perennial battleground state. The complaint cited comments Trump has made at rallies in Ohio and elsewhere. \"In the months leading up to the 2016 election, Trump has made an escalating series of statements, often racially tinged, suggesting that his supporters should go to particular precincts on Election Day and intimidate voters,\" the Ohio lawsuit alleged. The state party said that, absent court intervention, voters would be subjected to \"intimidation, threats and perhaps even force at the hands of vigilante 'poll watchers' and 'ballot integrity' volunteers on Election Day.\" Ohio Republican Party spokeswoman Brittany Warner called the lawsuit \"a publicity stunt\" and said the party is not involved in such voter intimidation. Pennsylvania Republicans called the lawsuit \"a desperate effort by the Democrats in the face of eroding support for Hillary Clinton .\" Messages left Monday with Trump's national and Ohio campaigns were not immediately returned. In an emailed response, Stone said the lawsuit is without merit. He said his organization is not coordinating with the Trump campaign or any official GOP organizations. Instead, it is partnering with another group called Vote Protectors to conduct exit polls and plans to compare those responses with the voting machine results in 7,000 precincts nationwide. \"We seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that is not the case,\" Stone said. In Arizona, Democrats are seeking a court order to block volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The lawsuit there said the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump's campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing \"citizen journalists\" and \"poll watchers\" to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8. But Arizona GOP spokesman Tim Sifert said the party is doing no such thing. Arizona Democratic Party Chairwoman Alexis Tameron said the party is worried that \"rogue actors\" will scare off voters. In Nevada, the lawsuit claimed that Trump supporters have yelled at voters outside Las Vegas-area polling places when they said they were not voting for the Republican nominee. Among other requests, Democrats asked the court to declare that aggressive questioning of voters waiting to cast their ballot or threats of legal or criminal action are illegal. Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald said his party has zero tolerance for voter intimidation. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Bob Christie in Phoenix, Michelle Rindels in Las Vegas and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

The emails, uncovered during the FBI's separate investigation into Weiner's alleged illicit communications with an underage girl, are connected to Weiner's estranged wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and ended up on the same laptop. Related: FBI Obtains Warrant for Newly Discovered Emails in Clinton Probe \u2014 as Reid Accuses Comey of Hatch Act Violation The cache of emails goes back several years, the official told NBC News. Abedin has said she says she didn't know these emails were on the household computer. Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner attend the 12th annual CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards at Spring Studios on Nov. 2, 2015 in New York. Dennis Van Tine / Geisler-Fotopres via AP Officials have been combing through the emails since Sunday night \u2014 using a program designed to find only the emails to and from Abedin within the time when Clinton was secretary of state. Agents will compare the latest batch of messages with those that have already been investigated to determine whether any classified information was sent from Clinton's server.

Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP On Friday, FBI Director James Comey revealed the existence of the emails \u2014 information which sent shockwaves through political circles as it came with less than two weeks before the general election. While Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his supporters applauded the move, Clinton said Comey's actions were an \"unprecedented\" departure from FBI policy. On Monday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest stressed that President Obama does not believe that Comey's decision was politically motivated. The president, Earnest told reporters, feels Comey is \"a man of principle and a man of good character.\" Play ",

By Paul Farhi October 31 at 2:51 PM Follow @farhip CNN has cut ties with commentator and interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile after WikiLeaks revealed that Brazile provided more primary debate questions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. The network said it accepted Brazile\u2019s resignation as a contributor Monday after the hacked emails showed that she had tipped off Clinton\u2019s campaign to likely questions during the primaries. In a statement, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said, \u201cWe are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.\u201d WikiLeaks had previously revealed that Brazile had emailed John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, in March about her access to questions that would be asked at CNN-sponsored primary debates. \u201cFrom time to time I get the questions in advance ,\u201d she told Podesta on March 12. She added, \u201cI\u2019ll send a few more.\u201d CNN acted Monday after more WikiLeaks emails showed that Brazile had, in fact, tipped Podesta to other debate questions. In an email sent to Podesta in early March , she wrote that a question would come from a Flint, Mich., woman who is dealing with that city\u2019s water crisis. \u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,\u201d Brazile wrote. At a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of getting debate questions ahead of time from then-CNN contributor and DNC official Donna Brazile and demanded to know why Clinton didn't report it. (The Washington Post) Pratapas disclaimed any involvement by CNN itself, saying the network \u201cnever gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate.\u201d Brazile, in an interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly last week , denied that she had received a debate question about the death penalty in advance. She said she would not be \u201cpersecuted\u201d by Kelly. Brazile is also a contributor to ABC News, which has not commented on her status at the network. In a tweet Monday, Brazile said: \u201cThank you @CNN. Honored to be a Democratic Strategist and commentator on the network. Godspeed to all my former colleagues.\u201d CNN and ABC temporarily suspended their contracts with Brazile in July after she became interim DNC chair after the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.). Wasserman Schultz resigned after other hacked emails indicated that DNC officials had favored Clinton\u2019s campaign at the expense of her challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The networks had said they expected to resume their relationship with Brazile after the election. lifestyle ",

ALEX WELLER Oct 31, 2016, 5:24 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Candidates' Solutions Differ on America's Opioid Epidemic 0 Shares Email As the opioid epidemic has continued to expand across the U.S., multitudes of children have been hospitalized for opioid-related poisonings, according to a new study published in JAMA Pediatrics. Hospitalizations for prescription opioid-related poisonings increased a dramatic 165 percent, for children between the ages of 1 to 19, between 1997 and 2012, the researchers found. The \"opioid crisis is effecting us all,\" Julie Gaither, lead study author and Postdoctoral Fellow in Biostatistics at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Yale University School of Medicine, told ABC News. The largest percentage increase in prescription opioid poisonings was among the youngest age group \u2013 1- to 4-year-olds -- at 205 percent. The vast majority of these poisonings are unsupervised ingestions, where children get into a drug supply that belongs to a family member. Prescription opioid poisoning among adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 increased 176 percent, according to the study. Gaither said that she was \"surprised to see the greatest increase was in young children.\" Unlike many young children who take the drugs accidentally, in adolescents over the age of 10 the prescription poisonings were mainly attributed to a suicide attempt or self-inflicted injury. In teens, between the ages of 15 to 19, there was a 140 percent increase in suicidal or self-inflicted ingestion of prescription opioids . \"We need to pay more attention,\" she said, including locking up medications and putting pressure on drug companies to make more child-resistant packaging. The study shows yet another toll the opioid epidemic has taken on Americans, according to Dr. Nora Volkow, the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health . She told ABC News that having opioids in the house is just like having a weapon present; they both have to be kept locked away from children and adolescents. \"Abuse and [the] associated heroin epidemic has touched every single segment of our society, even children 1 to 4,\" Volkow said. In the study, researchers looked at 13,052 records for patients between the ages of 1 to 19, who were hospitalized for prescription opioid poisoning and in the 15- 19 age bracket, heroin and methadone poisonings over this time period. The records were from hospitals across the nation, using the Kids\u2019 Inpatient Database, which tracks a sample of pediatric hospital admissions and discharges every three years. Multiple research institutions, including the Yale University School of Medicine, reviewed this data. Fighting Zika With GMO Mosquitoes Could Be the Future of Mosquito Control In addition to higher rates of poisonings, researchers found that children are ingesting a diverse array of available opioids, including prescription medications and illicit drugs. As prescription opioids, including oxycodone , have become more restricted, more people have been abusing heroin. Rates of heroin-related poisonings increased 161 percent for adolescents between the ages of 15 to 19. Poisoning also skyrocketed, in 15- to 19-year-olds, specifically from methadone -- a prescription drug available for patients both with severe pain and to help with withdrawal and abstinence from other opioids like heroin -- with a 950 percent increase. The increase in heroin abuse is particularly troubling because it can be contaminated with unknown substances or mixed with synthetic opioids that can be hundreds of times more potent then prescription medications, according to Dr. Bill Banner, President of the Board of the American Association of Poison Control Centers and a pediatric intensive care doctor at INTEGRIS Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City. In Ohio and Massachusetts, carfentanil, an opioid created to sedate elephants, has been found mixed into heroin. Illegal opioids are certainly not contained in child-resistant packaging. Authorities will not be able to force \"drug dealers to use child resistant packaging,\" Banner said. Dr. Weller is a senior resident physician in internal medicine at Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey. He is a resident in the ABC News Medical Unit. 0 Shares ",

Maher/AP This 1933 photo made available by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the ruins of St. Anthony's Church in Long Beach, Calif., after an earthquake struck on March 10, 1933. T.J. Maher/AP A new study suggests some Los Angeles-area earthquakes in the 1920s and 1930s could have been caused by the oil boom at the time. The paper, scheduled to be published online Tuesday in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, presents evidence that drilling around Los Angeles between 1915 and 1932 could have been associated with damaging earthquakes in the area, including the magnitude 6.4 Long Beach quake in 1933 that killed 120 people. Although the modern practice of hydraulic fracturing has been tied to small man-made earthquakes , right off the bat, the study authors \u2014 Susan E. Hough and Morgan Page of the U.S. Geological Survey \u2014 make clear this is not a study to draw lessons from today. The authors write in the opening paragraph: \"Our results suggest that significant earthquakes in Southern California during the early twentieth century might have been associated with industry practices that are no longer employed (i.e., production without water reinjection), and do not necessarily imply a high likelihood of induced earthquakes at the present time.\" As the Los Angeles Times points out , \"Nowadays, water is carefully used to replace the pumped-out oil, which prevents land from sinking and also helps extract more oil,\" something that was not being done in the '20s and '30s in the oil fields of the Los Angeles basin. Article continues after sponsorship How Fracking Wastewater Is Tied To Quakes Rather than a model for the present, the new paper is a lens through which to view the seismic past of Southern California, using scientific history. The authors note that earthquake-sensing technology was neither as sensitive nor as widespread in the early 20th century as it is today. Most earthquakes in the Los Angeles basin in the first third of the century \"caused light shaking reported by at most a few witnesses,\" they write. A few witnesses are not the most reliable source of data, so Hough and Page limited themselves only to the 22 biggest, most widely felt earthquakes of the period, and compared those quakes to oil industry records from the time. Of those earthquakes, they found 13 possibly or likely were associated with \"oil production activities,\" including the drilling of deeper and deeper oil wells near hidden faults that are known to cause earthquakes . The authors based their findings on the best information available about when and where the earthquakes and drilling occurred and the kind of drilling being conducted. Last year, Hough and Page published evidence that midcentury earthquakes in Oklahoma were triggered by the injection of wastewater during oil production in that part of the country. That historical finding was more relevant to today's oil production activities than the California data. The USGS announced earlier this year that pumping wastewater underground during oil production has caused parts of Oklahoma to be as seismically active as parts of California. U.S. Geology Maps Reveal Areas Vulnerable To Man-Made Quakes Hough and Page used a similar historical record analysis for the Oklahoma and California papers, but Thomas Heaton, director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, told NPR he thought the Oklahoma research was more convincing than the new California findings. \"There is a long history of earthquakes being triggered by increased fluid pressure,\" he wrote in an email after reviewing the new paper. \"Although we don't understand [the association] very well, it's as close as our community gets to consensus that fluid induction triggers earthquakes.\" \"The tricky part of the equation in California is that earthquakes occur regularly without fluid injection,\" he wrote. He did not go so far as to call into question the associations suggested by the paper \u2014 he thought it's certainly possible that oil drilling played a part in some or all of the earthquakes Hough and Page identified. But it's hard to be sure about the reason for any one quake. \"It would be no surprise to discover that some of our California earthquakes were triggered by oil production,\" Heaton wrote. \"What would be surprising would be to discover that a team of scientists was able to present a compelling case that it had occurred in any particular example (e.g. 1933 Long Beach).\" Oil Production Fuels Earthquake Surge In Oklahoma Oil Production Fuels Earthquake Surge In Oklahoma ",

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, regularly receives sensitive briefings. Schiff said he could not discuss Reid's assertions, but he said, \"Americans have every right to be concerned about what they see in terms of Trump advisors and their closeness with the Kremlin, Trump's policies vis-a-vis Russia, Trump's potential financial interest, all of those things ought to be of deep concern to voters.\" He added, \"Whether an investigation is appropriate depends on whether there's evidence of criminal connections. Of course the intelligence community wants to know what foreign influence Russia may be looking to exert in the United States.\" Manafort was paid millions of dollars \u2014 $12.7 million in cash, according to The New York Times\u2014representing a pro-Russian politician in the Ukraine. Manafort's name in an alleged payment ledger. The Times Trump has taken a series of pro-Russian positions that experts from both parties say are far outside the mainstream, and inexplicable from a political viewpoint. He continues to cast doubt on Russian involvement in election hacking, for example, despite the intelligence community's public assessment. \"The relationships that Trump's advisors have had with pro-Russian forces are deeply disturbing,\" David Kramer, a former senior State Department official in the George W. Bush administration and a former adviser to Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, told NBC News in August. \"Trump's attitude on Russia is not in line with most Republican foreign-policy thinking. Trump has staked out views that are really on the fringe.\" An FBI inquiry is a preliminary examination that falls short of a criminal investigation. But in this highly charged atmosphere, it has some arguing that Comey is applying a double standard. \"Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly,\" Schiff said. \"But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn't discuss other potential investigations.\" Ken Dilanian ",

Soldiers from the California Army National Guard have been ordered to return enlistment bonuses they received a decade ago when the Pentagon needed troops for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (California Army National Guard) David S. Cloud The California National Guard can\u2019t locate more than 4,000 of the 9,700 soldiers caught up in the military enlistment bonus scandal that has rocked one of the nation\u2019s largest Guard organizations, according to its commander. In an internal memo obtained by The Times, Maj. Gen. David Baldwin said the California Guard needed help finding thousands of soldiers who received improper enlistment bonuses or other incentives at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars a decade ago. Baldwin also wrote that the vast majority of the 9,700 current and former California Guard soldiers who received improper payments did so \u201cunknowingly\u201d and enlisted \u201cin good faith at a time of war.\u201d His Oct. 27 memo is one of the first unequivocal statements by a senior military official since the bonus scandal surfaced that most California Guard soldiers did not know they were getting money improperly. It suggests most may be eligible to have some or all of their debts forgiven under a Pentagon review. But the new Pentagon inquiry already appears mired in confusion. Despite Baldwin\u2019s assertions, the Treasury Department tracked down some of the 4,000 soldiers long ago through tax returns and forced them to repay their bonuses, raising questions about whether the Pentagon will now return the money. Brett Sholtis, who left the California Guard in 2007 and now lives in York, Pa., received a letter from the Treasury Department in 2015 ordering him to repay $2,500.79 that he was given after he first enlisted in 2001. (David S. Cloud) When he refused to pay, the Treasury Department garnished his wages and claimed his 2015 federal tax refund until the debt was paid last spring, he said. \u201cI was one of those soldiers who couldn\u2019t be located,\u201d Sholtis said Monday. \u201cThey made a weak effort and then immediately proceeded to step two \u2014 turning it over to Treasury.\u201d A Los Angeles Times report\u00a0this month about the enlistment bonus repayment demands to California Guard soldiers and veterans, including some who were wounded in battle, sparked a public furor about what many viewed as an injustice. Four days later, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter suspended the debt recovery program and ordered faster appeals for soldiers and veterans seeking relief from the debts. He set a July 1 deadline next year to complete the process. The Pentagon\u2019s efforts to recover the money have brought hardship to many soldiers and veterans, Baldwin said, \u201cwho signed up for incentives based on misinformation about their eligibility.\u201d The supposedly missing soldiers in Baldwin\u2019s memo are likely to have retired, changed addresses, moved to Guard units in other states or transferred to the active-duty Army, officials said. The affected soldiers did not respond to letters sent by the California Guard to addresses on file for them, the officials said. Baldwin asked current and former California Guard members for help locating the soldiers. He directed them to the Soldier Incentives and Assistance Center, an office set up in Sacramento to help soldiers appeal to the Pentagon for waivers of some or all of the debts. With the center\u2019s help, \u201chundreds of soldiers \u2026 have had their debts forgiven or have corrected their records,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, more than 4,000 Soldiers with errors in their incentive packets have not had the same opportunity.\u201d In 2010, after the Sacramento Bee first reported corruption in the California Guard enlistment payments, an FBI investigation found that officials had given millions of dollars in bonuses and student loan payments to soldiers who did not qualify for them, or who were approved despite paperwork errors. Ashton Carter on Wednesday ordered the Pentagon to suspend efforts to claw back enlistment bonuses improperly given to thousands of California National Guard members during the height of the Iraq war. Aides made clear they didn\u2019t intend... Moving to quell widespread criticism, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter on Wednesday ordered the Pentagon to suspend efforts to claw back enlistment bonuses improperly given to thousands of California National Guard members during the height of the Iraq war. Aides made clear they didn\u2019t intend... (David S. Cloud) A California Guard audit of the enlistment contracts, completed in September, concluded that 9,700 soldiers had received improper bonuses and other payments. Army Master Sgt.\u00a0Toni Jaffe, the California Guard\u2019s incentive manager, pleaded guilty in 2011 to filing false claims of $15.2 million and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. Three officers also pleaded guilty to fraud and were put on probation after paying restitution. Nearly 100 California Guard members have been disciplined for knowingly paying or accepting improper bonuses. A senior California Guard official, Col. Darrin Bender, blamed the improper payments on the pressure\u00a0recruiters faced to fill Army ranks starting in about 2005, when the Pentagon was engaged in bitter fighting in both Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cTo increase soldier retention, the Army funded a number of very generous bonus programs,\u201d Bender, the California Guard\u2019s director of government relation, wrote in an email last week to members of the California Legislature. \u201cThese programs were implemented far too quickly, without the appropriate institutional checks and balances,\u201d and recruiters were under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d to meet \u201chigh enlistment and reenlistment quotas,\u201d he wrote. Though a small number of soldiers knew they were committing fraud, the \u201cvast majority acted on good faith resulting from bad information from recruiters and others in positions of authority,\u201d he added. Sholtis, the former California Guard member who moved to Pennsylvania, is skeptical about the government\u2019s efforts to help veterans like him. The California Guard\u2019s attempt to find him consisted of a registered letter sent to his old California address informing him of a problem with his 2001 enlistment bonus, he said.\u00a0 It told him to get in touch with the soldiers\u2019 assistance center in Sacramento that was handling the repayments.

(John Myers) When he did not reply, California Guard officials forwarded his name to the Defense Finance Accounting Service, the Pentagon agency that handles recovery of the bonuses.\u00a0 They found no record that he was still in the military and sent his name to the Treasury Department, which used tax records to locate him. Sholtis, who is now a reporter, refused to repay the debt, which included an automatic $500 penalty. He contacted the California Guard to find out why he owed the money. It turned out the paperwork for his $2,000 enlistment bonus was missing. The Treasury Department garnished his paycheck, taking $320 every month and his entire tax refund for 2015. He recently was denied pre-approval for a Veterans\u2019 Affairs home loan, partly because the former bonus debt is on his credit report. \u201cIt\u2019s profound incompetence,\u201d Sholtis said, \u201cmixed with indifference.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the FBI would have to find to press charges against Hillary Clinton , Frank Gehry\u2019s controversial development is approved , two Des Moines officers were shot to death , and the Cubs push a game 7 of the World Series .

    "text": "Service Dog Case Comes Before Supreme Court By GENEVA SANDS Oct 31, 2016, 8:07 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH The History of Dogs as Pets 0 Shares Ehlena Fry, a 12-year-old Michigan girl with cerebral palsy , has been at odds for years with her former school over the use of her service dog Wonder. Today her case made its way to the Supreme Court . In 2009, when Fry was just 5 years old, Wonder entered her life. The Goldendoodle was prescribed by her doctor and trained to help Fry with daily activities, including opening doors, turning on and off lights and taking her coat off. President Obama Not Throwing In Towel for Merrick Garland's Supreme Court Nomination The school denied her family and pediatrician\u2019s request to allow Wonder to assist Fry in the classroom. Her parents sued in federal court, but the case was dismissed. At issue before the Court is the technical matter of whether the suit can be brought in federal court or should the matter should be resolved in state administrative proceedings. In 2009, the Napoleon Community Schools and the Jackson County Intermediate School District said that it already had an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that included a human aide to support Fry during the school day, so she did not need Wonder, according to analysis of the case. The school allowed a brief trial period after mediation, but at the end of the school year declined to change their minds. Fry attended the 2009-10 school year without the service dog. After the school's decision, the girl's family pulled her from the school and home-schooled her for two years. In 2010, the family filed a complaint with the Department of Education alleging that the district had violated the \"Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The government investigated the complaint and sided with her parents. In response to the decision, the school allowed Fry to bring the dog into the school and she re-enrolled in 2012, but she left for a neighboring district after her parents felt the school administration would \"resent\" their daughter. That same year, the family sued the school in federal court, seeking monetary damages for the refusal to allow Wonder in the classroom. However, a district court dismissed the suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. An appeals court agreed with that decision and attorneys for the Frys appealed to the Supreme Court. \"If you're choosing to bring one of those lawsuits, you got to first exhaust the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act] IDEA procedures if the relief available is one that you could get from the IDEA,\" said Neal Katyal, the attorney for the school distinct, arguing in Court today. He declined to discuss the arguments today, citing policy not to comment on-going litigation. \"The legal issues in this case are pretty technical, involving the interaction of a number of federal statutes and the kinds of remedies available under those statutes,\" said ABC's Supreme Court Contributor Kate Shaw. \"The humiliation and discrimination that Ehlena faced when she was in kindergarten won't have to happen to anybody else. This case is about tearing down barriers to access to school for kids. It's not only illegal--it's cruel--to make kids choose between an education and access to an independent life,\" said American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) Michigan Legal Director Michael Steinberg in a statement. The ACLU has advocated on Fry's behalf since April 2010. While Wonder did not attend the proceeding, he did join Fry in front of the Court steps this morning. 0 Shares ",

Smoke rises from burning oil fields in Qayyarah, about 40 miles south of Mosul, Iraq. (Felipe Dana / Associated Press) Laura King Contact Reporter The fight against Islamic State is finally coming to Mosul, Iraq. With Iraq\u2019s prime minister vowing to cut off \u201cthe head of the snake,\u201d elite government forces were said to\u00a0have begun their assault on\u00a0the city proper.\u00a0 Iraqi special forces reported fierce clashes east of Mosul as they approached the outskirts of the city Tuesday. Lt. Col. Ali Hussein Fadil who leads the Najaf battalion of Iraqi special forces, part of the Golden Division, said they were battling Islamic State along the eastern Mosul highway in the village of Gogjali, about four miles outside the city. He said Iraqi troops were fighting amid an area of factories, trying to secure the road forward. \u201cLast night, we made an advance,\u201d he said, killing eight Islamic State fighters and exploding four of their vehicles. The fight to retake Mosul from the Sunni Muslim extremists could involve weeks or months of brutal urban warfare. This apparent new phase of the battle comes two weeks after the start of a long-awaited offensive by tens of thousands of American-backed Iraqi and Kurdish troops, tribal fighters and militias.\u00a0 The coalition has been working to drive Islamic State out of towns and villages surrounding the northern city, its fighters dealing as they go with jihadist suicide bombers, oil-filled trenches and booby-trapped structures and bridges. \u00a0 Omar Turki defied Islamic State and fled the city of Mosul on foot last month with his family of five, the youngest just 6 months old. Eager to escape the coming battle to free the city from the militant group\u2019s violent grip, the family had to cross a trench \u2014 apparently designed to be filled with...

Eager to escape the coming battle to free the city from the militant group\u2019s violent grip, the family had to cross a trench \u2014 apparently designed to be filled with... (Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Nabih Bulos) It\u2019s the biggest military operation in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq 13 years ago. The leading edge of Iraqi forces, elite counter-terrorism troops reached Mosul's eastern Karama district after penetrating the outlying industrial zone of Gogjali, Reuters quoted Lt. Gen Abdul Ghani Assadi as telling state television. State TV also reported that residents were rising up against the militants \u2014 something the coalition has long urged them to do despite the dangers. A resident of Mosul\u2019s eastern edge named Abu Mohammed told Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper by phone that Islamic State fighters had been putting up \u201cintense resistance\u201d in the face of the Iraqi troop advance on Karama.\u00a0The reports could not immediately be independently verified. Islamic State overran the city, Iraq\u2019s second largest, in 2014, representing a major expansion of its self-declared caliphate extending across parts of Syria and Iraq. Retaking the city has already been costly for civilians trapped between battle lines and commandeered as human shields by the extremists.

    "text": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder is blasting his former colleague FBI Director James Comey for violating long-standing Justice Department policies by writing a letter to Congress last week about finding potentially new emails related to the Hillary Clinton email server investigation . In an editorial published late Sunday in The Washington Post, Holder said he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with Comey\u2019s decision. \u201cThat decision was incorrect. It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition. And it ran counter to guidance that I put in place four years ago laying out the proper way to conduct investigations during an election season,\u201d Holder wrote. Holder, who served as President Obama\u2019s attorney general from 2009 until April 2015, explained that the policy has remained in effect and applies to the entire Justice Department including the FBI. The department also has a practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, he wrote, as well as \u201cnot taking unnecessary action close in time to Election Day that might influence an election\u2019s outcome.\u201d \u201cDirector Comey broke with these fundamental principles. I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI,\u201d Holder wrote, adding that it has allowed for \u201cmisinformation to be spread by partisans.\u201d Holder also criticized Comey for publicly announcing in July his recommendation to the Justice Department that it not bring charges against Clinton for her use of email servers as secretary of state. Comey has led the FBI since 2013. \u201cThat was a stunning breach of protocol. It may set a dangerous precedent for future investigations. It was wrong,\u201d Holder wrote. Holder was among dozens of former federal prosecutors who signed a letter over the weekend critical of Comey\u2019s decision , according to the Associated Press. No one knows yet, including Comey, what the emails contain, if they were directly related to Clinton or if there was any wrongdoing involved. Investigators obtained a search warrant Sunday to look through thousands of emails on a laptop used by Anthony Weiner, which also contained emails from his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a top aide to Clinton. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Chen somehow got into the enclosure of Meiling, a 265-pound male panda during the tour, reports Reuters.\u00a0 In the video, Chen can be seen sneaking up on a sleeping Meiling and touching the sleeping bear on the head. The bear wakes up and then lunges at Chen\u2019s leg, eventually wrestling the man to the ground. The two tangled for about five minutes before Meiling rolled over on his back and Chen fled the enclosure. The People\u2019s Daily reports neither man nor bear were injured in the encounter. Chen reportedly said afterwards he was trying to impress the girls he was accompanying on the tour by \u201cteasing\u201d the giant panda. ",

Myspace/Handout via REUTERS ORLANDO -- The Orlando Police Department on Monday released audio from the 911 calls made by Omar Mateen the night he went on a rampage at Pulse nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring more than 50 others .\u00a0 Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber on Monday ordered that calls made by Mateen, who died during the massacre, be made public immediately. The city previously released a transcript of the calls. Chilling, calm and deliberate is how the FBI described Omar Mateen when he called 911 during the Pulse nightclub rampage.

Wait, what? That is where American politics now finds itself, debating Justice Department policies and civic protocols in the campaign's final stretch. It's all related to FBI Director Jamey Comey's surprise Friday announcement, which has drawn criticism for its potential impact on Hillary Clinton's election prospects. Here are the answers to some of the key questions surrounding the matter. Who does James Comey work for? In short, the president. Comey was appointed by President Obama \u2014 and approved by the Senate \u2014 three years ago. His term is limited to 10 years, but he can be fired at any point by Obama, or whoever succeeds him. His direct boss is Attorney General Loretta Lynch. But the FBI director traditionally enjoys a measure of independence that forms a bedrock of American criminal justice: that investigative decisions are not influenced by politics.

Comey has differed with Obama in the past. Last year, Comey said he saw a link between public unrest aimed at law enforcement and a jump in violence in some cities \u2014 the so-called \"Ferguson effect\" \u2014 a notion that Obama has downplayed. He also said he was concerned about \"certain gaps\" in the screening process for Syrian refugees at a time when Obama was insisting that the vetting was comprehensive. Comey has also had differences with previous bosses, the most noteworthy example coming in 2004, when, as a deputy attorney general, he blocked aides to President George W. Bush from persuading Attorney General John Ashcroft to extend a warrantless eavesdropping program. What is the Hatch Act? The main criticism leveled against Comey is that he violated the Hatch Act, a rule designed to keep government officials from using their authority to influence elections. Elected officials, including the president and vice-president and members of Congress, can campaign for candidates. But they are not allowed to pressure government employees \u2014 including FBI agents \u2014 from trying to shape an election's outcome. Government employees, in turn, are restricted in their involvement in politics. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (R) talks to her staff as aide Huma Abedin listens on board their campaign plane at the Westchester County Airport in White Plains, New York, before leaving for campaign rallies on October 28, 2016. JEWEL SAMAD / AFP - Getty Images There is also a standing policy that the FBI refrain from discussing pending investigations with the public or Congress \u2014 particularly when it could impact a coming election. Comey acknowledged that policy in an email to FBI employees. But he said he felt an obligation to send the letter \"given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.\" If he hadn't done it, it would have been \"misleading to the American people,\" he added. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accused Comey of violating the Hatch Act. So did Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under Bush \u2014 and a Republican who supports Clinton. He filed a complaint against Comey with the Office of Special Counsel and called Comey's Friday announcement an \"abuse of power.\" Play ",

    "text": "Email Does social media make us happier or more depressed ? More connected or just more addicted ? The impact on our relationships and overall well-being has been debated for years. Now, a new study of 12 million Facebook users finds a major upside: being active on the social networking site is associated with living longer. This association was seen when the site served to maintain and enhance real-world friendships. The authors note that the research was observational and does not prove that Facebook use actually leads to a\u00a0 longer life . However, they say the study shows that the health benefits of strong social connectedness extend to those on the internet. \u201cInteracting online seems to be healthy when the online activity is moderate and complements interactions offline,\u201d first author William Hobbs, who worked on the study as a UC San Diego doctoral student in political science and is now a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University, said in a statement. \u201cIt is only on the extreme end, spending a lot of time online with little evidence of being connected to people otherwise, that we see a negative association.\u201d For the study, the researchers matched a group of 12 million California Facebook users with vital records from the California Department of Public Health. They analyzed online activity over a six-month period and compared that of those who were still living to those who had died. All those who were studied \u2013 whose privacy was maintained \u2013 were born between 1945 and 1989. All the comparisons were made between people of similar age and gender. The results showed that in a given year, the average Facebook user is about 12 percent less likely to die than someone who does not use the social networking site. But how a person uses the platform matters, the researchers found. For example, people with the highest levels of offline social activity \u2013 measured by the number of photos posted, suggesting face-to-face interactions \u2013 had the greatest longevity. In contrast, online-only interactions, such as writing wall posts or messages, showed no such relationship. Facebook users with large social networks \u2013 in the top 50 to 30 percent \u2013 lived longer than those with fewer friends \u2013 those in the lowest 10 percent. This finding is consistent with previous studies of real-world relationships, which have found that people who are lonely and socially isolated don\u2019t live as long as those who maintain connections to family and friends. However, one finding surprised the researchers. The results showed that Facebook users who accepted the most friend requests lived the longest, while there was no observable relationship for those who initiated the most friendships. \u201cUnfortunately, what this suggests is that it\u2019s possible that the causal arrow is reversed. That it\u2019s not that friends make us healthier, it\u2019s that healthier people attract more friends or that popular people tend to be healthier,\u201d senior author James Fowler, professor of political science in the UC San Diego Division of Social Sciences and of global public health in the UC San Diego School of Medicine, told CBS News. The authors emphasize that since the study is observational, it does not prove that using Facebook will help you live longer. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a prescription for how much to use Facebook ,\u201d Fowler joked. \u201cBut I think the number one takeaway is that on average Facebook usage is not bad for you. We can\u2019t say that it\u2019s good for you and that there\u2019s a causal relationship, but certainly the data contradicts the claim that social media usage is bad for you.\u201d The researchers also note that many other factors could be at play. They controlled for things like age, gender, and socioeconomic status, though they acknowledge the latter is difficult to account for due to the lack of information about the individual users studied. Dr. Murali Doraiswamy, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke Health, said the study is timely, given that research shows that teens are spending about nine hours a day using various media and 35 percent of U.S. seniors are on social networks. Doraiswamy was not involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s important to quantify the benefits \u2013 and risks \u2013 of online social networks on our health,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cThis study suggests that online friendships do matter if they act to supplement offline face-to-face activities. Online networks can be an effective \u2018booster dose\u2019 to keep the real-world friendships alive.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Trump, who counts among his fans people notorious for harassing perceived enemies on social media, urged the crowd to \"check out\" one accuser's Facebook page. While Trump spoke, a burly man in a \"Make America Great Again\" cap put a protester in a headlock before security removed the activist, then walked around collecting high fives from rally-goers. As security came to remove him as well, the crowd began cheering, \"Let him stay!\" Law and Order While past presidential nominees have taken care to distance themselves from unruly or threatening supporters, Trump has hinted, implied or outright stated that extremism in defense of Trump is no vice. That message peaked during the primaries, when Trump, running on a platform of \"law and order,\" routinely defended supporters who physically attacked protesters. On the day of the Iowa caucuses in February, Trump told supporters he would pay for a lawyer if they \"knock the crap out of\" protesters he claimed were planning to throw tomatoes. Later that same month, as a protester was escorted out, Trump said he'd \"like to punch him in the face, I tell ya.\" A member of the audience throws a punch at a protester as Trump speaks during a campaign event in Tucson, Arizona, on March 19. SAM MIRCOVICH / Reuters In March, Trump said he would consider paying legal bills for a supporter who had sucker punched a protester on camera. He didn't \"condone\" the behavior, but the protesters, he said, were \"very taunting.\" These face-offs were a familiar ritual at Trump rallies until the candidate toned things down somewhat after protesters and supporters clashed at a March event in Chicago. His rallies now include a recorded request that audience members let security handle any disturbances. The largest subsequent outbreak of violence came from anti-Trump protesters , who threw eggs and attacked Trump supporters at an event in San Jose. But Trump also warned Republicans of \"riots\" if delegates denied him the nomination at the GOP convention. \"We see a lot of violence around Trump appearances where supporters think: 'Well, gee he's authorized me to do it,' even without a direct order,\" said Kim Lane Scheppele, a Princeton professor and expert on authoritarian regimes. \"It creates a kind of culture of permission,\" Scheppele said. Trump supporters watch him speak on the eve of the state's primary in North Charleston on Feb. 19. Spencer Platt / Getty Images Twice Trump has made jokes that seem to float the notion of Clinton being assassinated. In August he suggested \"Second Amendment people\" could prevent her from filling a Supreme Court seat. It was widely perceived as a reference to violence, although the campaign denied that was his intent. In September, he said Clinton's bodyguards should disarm and then \"see what happens to her.\" Trump has also shown unprecedented tolerance for supporters who engage in more overt threats. He enthusiastically defended the character of an adviser, Al Baldasaro, after he repeatedly said Clinton \"should be shot by a firing squad,\" even after his campaign distanced itself from the remarks. Carl Paladino, the current chair of Trump's New York campaign, sent an email to a female anti-Trump Utah GOP delegate saying she should be \"hung for treason\" and promised to \"be in your face\" at the convention. Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, has regularly called for executing political opponents. Rising Tension In the final weeks of the campaign, the candidate has cast himself as the victim of an unsubstantiated global conspiracy to rob him of the presidency \u2014 blaming almost everyone, including media outlets, election officials, banks, pollsters, Democrats, Republicans and his many female accusers. Taking a cue from the nominee, one Trump voter told the Boston Globe that he plans to make minority voters \"a little bit nervous\" at election sites in response to the candidate's regular calls to watch for fraud at polling places. Others have raised the possibility of post-election unrest. The Trump campaign responded to the Globe article by saying they \"reject violence in any form and will not allow it to be a part of our campaign.\" Play ",

Ng Han Guan/AP hide caption toggle caption Ng Han Guan/AP A child walks past a dessert stand on a hazy day in Beijing earlier this month. Ng Han Guan/AP Some 300 million children around the world are breathing highly toxic air, according to a new report from UNICEF . The report, which uses satellite imagery to determine the impacted areas, says these children live in places \"where outdoor air pollution exceeds international guidelines by at least six times.\" Altogether, it states, some 2 billion children are breathing air that has been deemed a \"long term hazard,\" exceeding minimum standards set by the World Health Organization. \"Air pollution is a major contributing factor in the deaths of around 600,000 children under five every year \u2014 and it threatens the lives and futures of millions more every day,\" UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in a statement . \"Pollutants don't only harm children's developing lungs \u2014 they can actually cross the blood-brain barrier and permanently damage their developing brains \u2014 and, thus, their futures. No society can afford to ignore air pollution.\" PHOTOS: After Diwali Fireworks, Toxic Smog Shrouds New Delhi The report says poor air quality can have an outsize impact on children: Their lungs are still developing; their respiratory airways are more prone to blockages; they \"breathe twice as fast, taking in more air per unit of body weight, compared to adults.\" The impact of living in a place with poor air quality extends far beyond childhood. As the report states, \"studies have shown that the lung capacity of children living in polluted environments can be reduced by 20 per cent \u2014 similar to the effect of growing up in a home with secondhand cigarette smoke.\" Here's more from the report on the impact: \"The combination of respiratory, cardiovascular, cognitive, morbidity and reproductive health effects of air pollution have biological as well as social and economic effects that last a lifetime. These include health conditions, school attendance, school performance, health costs and productivity, which affect income, poverty and inequalities. Air pollution, through its massive and cumulative impact on the overall health and well-being of children and parents, can perpetuate intergenerational cycles of inequality.\" Article continues after sponsorship Both outdoor air pollution (such as pollution from a factory) and indoor air pollution (such as smoke from solid fuels used in cooking) are causing damage to children's health, the report finds. Outdoor air pollution is worse in \"lower-income, urban communities,\" while indoor air pollution is more prolific in \"lower-income, rural areas.\" At the same time, the report states that it can be difficult to tease out the impact of each, because individuals are constantly moving between the two environments. The problem is getting worse because of industrialization, based on current projections. \"Unless action is taken to control outdoor air pollution, studies show that outdoor air pollution will become the leading cause of environment-related child death by 2050,\" the report states. \"South Asia has the largest number of children living in these areas, at 620 million, with Africa following at 520 million children,\" according to UNICEF. \"The East Asia and Pacific region has 450 million children living in areas that exceed guideline limits.\" ",

    "text": "CBS/AP October 31, 2016, 5:05 PM Gas line explosion rocks Helena, Alabama An apparent gas line explosion in Helena, Alabama, on Monday, Oct. 31, 2016.\u00a0 CBS affiliate WIAT Email Last Updated Nov 1, 2016 12:48 AM EDT HELENA, Ala. \u2014 One person was killed and several workers injured Monday when an explosion occurred along the Colonial Pipeline in rural Alabama, not far where it burst last month, authorities said. Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline \u00a0said in a statement Monday night that one person died at the scene and five others were transported to Birmingham-area hospitals. The company said it shut down its two mainlines, which traverse Shelby County, after the blast and the lines were still shut Monday night. The explosion sent flames soaring over the forest about a mile west of where the pipeline burst in September, Gov. Robert Bentley said in a statement. That rupture led to gasoline shortages across the South. People within 3 miles of the blast site were being evacuated, the governor said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just hope and pray for the best,\u201d the governor added. Video from area media shows a huge plume of flame and smoke rising in a wooded area in Shelby County southwest of Birmingham.\u00a0 Earlier, Helena police confirmed on Twitter that there was an explosion, and said no residents are in danger. There has been an explosion in Shelby County Jurisdiction. No Helena residents are in any danger. Will report more as available. The explosion took place near 334 Highway 13,\u00a0 CBS affiliate WIAT reported. Bentley had said earlier that seven workers were injured. \u201cIt appears to have been an accident, and they\u2019re allowing fuel to burn,\u201d Bentley told WBRC-TV in a live interview Monday evening. . \u201cIt\u2019s about one mile west of where the repair took place on the Colonial Pipeline just recently.\u201d\u00a0 In September, the pipeline leaked 252,000 to 336,000 gallons of gasoline and led to dry fuel pumps and price spikes in several Southern states -- for days, in some cases. There was no immediate indication Thursday whether or not Monday\u2019s explosion near Helena southwest of Birmingham would lead to similar shortages. Plagued by a severe drought after weeks without rain, the section of the state where the explosion happened has been scarred by multiple wildfires in recent weeks, and crews worked to keep the blaze from spreading across the landscape. Coleen Vansant, a spokeswoman with the Alabama Forestry Commission, said crews built a 75-foot-long earthen dam to contain burning fuel, which will be allowed to burn itself out. The Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement Monday night that the blaze had been contained but it was unclear how long the fire may take to burn out.\u00a0 Colonial Pipeline said in a brief statement Monday evening that it has shut down its main pipeline. \u201cColonial\u2019s top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public,\u201d the company said. The company\u2019s statement did not address how Monday\u2019s explosion might affect the availability of gasoline, and said more information would be released as it becomes available. Several fire departments were sending crews to assist. Helena police say they\u2019re assisting Shelby County authorities with the blaze. The explosion happened in a remote area outside the town of Helena, away from residential areas, Helena Mayor Mark told WBRC-TV.\u00a0 Colonial Pipeline, based in Alpharetta, Georgia, transports more than 100 million gallons of products daily to markets between Houston and New York City, serving more than 50 million people, it says on its website. They include petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. Authorities have not said which type of fuel was involved in the explosion Monday.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Schrimpf\u00a0told the Cleveland Plain Dealer\u00a0that\u00a0Kasich voted straight-ticket Republican on\u00a0his ballot and was\u00a0comfortable tapping the Arizona senator\u00a0for his vote. Kasich ended his own campaign for the GOP nomination in May in an emotional speech in Columbus, Ohio. Kasich said voters had \"changed me with the stories of their lives,\" and he highlighted some of the most moving\u00a0moments of his campaign. The Ohio governor had been intent\u00a0on staying in the race as\u00a0the lone\u00a0alternative to Trump's candidacy. But he\u00a0won only his home state and trailed Trump by nearly 900 delegates when he bowed out. On the eve\u00a0of his exit, the campaign\u00a0tweeted out a\u00a0homage to\u00a0Star Wars,\u00a0suggesting Kasich\u00a0was the only hope to defeat Trump and prevent a Hillary Clinton presidency. Kasich slams Trump for 'rigged' election talk As the summer wore on, the Trump and Kasich teams became embroiled in a feud over whether Trump ever seriously wanted Kasich to join the ticket as his vice president amid a swirl of speculation.\u00a0Kasich did not attend the GOP convention, even though he was the governor of the host state. After the convention, the ill will continued as\u00a0Trump said\u00a0he would \"probably\" create a political action committee to fund opponents of some of his rivals, such as Kasich. Three weeks ago,\u00a0Trump's lewd comments about women on a 2005 tape\u00a0apparently sealed the deal for Kasich. He issued a statement saying he would not vote for the GOP nominee. Trump \u201cis a man I cannot and should not support,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe actions of the last day are disgusting, but that\u2019s not why I reached this decision. ...I will not vote for a nominee who has behaved in a manner that reflects so poorly on our country. Our country deserves better.\u201d Kasich's McCain vote won't count, however. Ohio law requires write-in candidates to file with the secretary of state more than two months before Election Day. In McCain, Kasich is voting for one of the earliest targets of Trump's insults. Trump said last summer that McCain, a former prisoner of war and a U.S. senator from Arizona, is\u00a0 \"not a war hero\" because he was captured . Kasich also fashioned his primary campaign in New Hampshire after McCain's town-hall based efforts in 2000 and 2008. Kasich has continued to travel the country since abandoning his presidential bid, keeping his name in front of\u00a0voters and campaigning for Republicans in tight congressional races. No Republican has won the presidency without carrying\u00a0Ohio since\u00a0Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Oct. 31) AP WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama cracked some dad jokes and danced to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" at his last Halloween celebration at the White House Monday. \"You guys all look scary, or cool, or whatever you're trying to be,\" Obama told the assembled trick-or-treaters. \"We hope, parents, that on this day at least, you don't have to pay attention to Michelle and healthy eating.\" \"Candy for everybody,\" the first lady agreed. \"And in fact, the more candy, the later you eat the candy, the better,\" said the president. \"Because I think that you being up all night with a sugar rush is exactly what your parents are looking for.\" The Obamas decorated the South Lawn of the White House and welcomed more than 4,000 people for trick-or-treating, mostly from 15 Washington-area elementary schools and military families.\u00a0Treats came in the form of\u00a0Hershey Kisses,\u00a0Halloween cookies,\u00a0M&Ms,\u00a0Fruit Bars,\u00a0Kettle Corn,\u00a0Bo and Sunny baseball cards and other\u00a0assorted candies. Tricks were forbidden by the Secret Service. Obama dressed up as the president of the United States.

Halas Hall Pass: Jay Cutler set to return against Vikings Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs preview Jay Cutler's return in the Bears' Week 8 game against the Vikings. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs preview Jay Cutler's return in the Bears' Week 8 game against the Vikings. Rich Campbell , Dan Wiederer and Brad Biggs Contact Reporters 4 storylines Back to the future: Jay Cutler 's return to the huddle this week brought a fresh set of questions about his iffy future in Chicago. All signs right now are pointing to a winter separation from the Bears , a reality Cutler certainly understands even if he's programming himself to ignore that part of things. \"I think those are conversations for the end of the year,\" he said. In the meantime, Cutler has the keys to the offense again and the task of reviving a unit that has scored only 10 touchdowns on 74 possessions all season. Degree of difficulty: Cutler's first game since Sept. 19 will come against a Vikings defense that has 19 sacks and 15 takeaways. The Vikings have difference makers on all three levels of their defense and have allowed only 14 points per game, best in the NFL . \"I could have picked a different game to come back, huh?\" Cutler cracked early in the week. Somehow, with a depleted offensive line and a short-handed receiving corps, the Bears will need to shore up their protection and create quick passing opportunities to keep their quarterback safe and their offense moving. The next step: There were very few positives to draw from the Bears' 26-10 loss to the Packers in Week 7. But the production and energy from outside linebacker Leonard Floyd was certainly notable. Floyd had two sacks, including a strip sack for a touchdown at Lambeau Field and left Green Bay with something to build on. Said coach John Fox : \"Obviously when good things happen, your confidence gets a little higher. So with a guy like Leonard, who's as young as he is and has been in and out as much as he has, that was a huge boost.\" Play it again, Sam: The Vikings have withstood injuries on offense to their starting quarterback ( Teddy Bridgewater ), starting running back (Adrian Peterson) and both starting offensive tackles ( Matt Kalil and Andre Smith ). Yet, for the most part, the offense has played well enough to aid the team's 5-1 start. Sam Bradford , acquired in a trade on Sept. 3 has completed 67.5 percent of his passes and has been sharp with his decision making. In the Vikings' lone loss last week, however, the Eagles came after Bradford and sparked a 21-10 upset with six sacks and 13 quarterback hits. Bradford threw one interception and fumbled four times. Matchups Photos of all the touchdowns the Bears have scored this season. In the air NFL rank: Bears offense 11th, Vikings defense 4th Jay Cutler (sprained right thumb) returns after a five-game absence. Cutler is known for being more of a risk taker than backup Brian Hoyer . Cutler trusts Alshon Jeffery (no touchdowns this season) to make contested catches. \"We'll be on the same page most of the time,\" Jeffery said. \"I just tell him, 'Throw it up and give me a chance.'\" The Vikings bring pressure from all directions and try to cause confusion by aligning two linebackers over the center. Ends Everson Griffen , Danielle Hunter and Brian Robison each have four sacks. On the ground NFL rank: Bears offense 25th, Vikings defense 3rd The Vikings are loaded with top talent on defense, and it shows in their approach to the run game. \"They hunt in packs\" Bears left tackle Charles Leno said. Linebackers Anthony Barr and Chad Greenway are fast and physical. Safety Harrison Smith is constantly around the ball. The Bears expect to have Jeremy Langford (right ankle) back from a four-game absence. The fastest of their three backs likely will be on a play count. He said the ankle injury made changing speeds problematic. Bears T-16th in total offense, 32nd in points scored Vikings 1st in total defense, T-1st in points allowed Bears on defense Sam Bradford Chris Szagola / AP Vikings quarterback Sam Bradford reacts from under center during a game against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016, in Philadelphia. Vikings quarterback Sam Bradford reacts from under center during a game against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016, in Philadelphia. (Chris Szagola / AP) NFL rank: Vikings offense 26th, Bears defense 16th Quarterback Sam Bradford has completed 68 percent of his throws for a 100.3 passer rating. But he has been sacked 14 times in five games, including six sacks last Sunday against the Eagles. With both starting tackles lost to injury, Bradford said he's focusing this week on pocket awareness, his movement in the pocket and knowing his outlets when pressured. Receiver Stefon Diggs is a threat after the catch. Bears linebacker Pernell McPhee (left knee) did not register in the box score despite playing 19 snaps against the Packers. On the ground NFL rank: Vikings offense 31st, Bears defense 17th Adrian Peterson\u2019s absence (knee) has left Matt Asiata in a familiar fill-in role. Asiata is a bulky back, a good pass blocker and receiver. He'll have to carry a bigger load because leading rusher Jerick McKinnon (ankle) was ruled out. Ronnie Hillman, with whom John Fox is familiar from Denver, is expected to rotate in. The Vikings\u2019 struggle to run the ball is a consequence of poor offensive line play.

Panthers' Fozzy Whittaker runs as Vikings' Linval Joseph defends in the second half in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2016. (Bob Leverone / AP) Measurables: 6-foot-4, 329 pounds. Assigned: Bears C Cody Whitehair (No. 65) and Gs Eric Kush (No. 64) and Ted Larsen (No. 62). Notable numbers: After finishing 17th against the run last season (109.3 ypg), the Vikings have jumped to third this year (81.7 ypg). ... Joseph has 38 tackles, three sacks and 15 quarterback hurries. ... The Bears rank 25th in rushing offense (87.9 ypg). Scouting report: The Vikings might have the most aggressive and well-rounded defense in the league. And it's Joseph's strength and consistency up the middle that sets the tone. As much credit as the Vikings deserve for their 19 sacks and 15 takeaways, it all starts with their ability to stop the run. And Joseph welcomes his responsibility toward that effort. \"He could be a really good pass rusher,\" Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. \"But his mentality is, 'Look, the running game is mine.'\" Whitehair won't be solely responsible for controlling Joseph, needing help from Kush and Larsen. But if the Bears can't chew up yardage on first and second down, they'll be in for a long night. Word from within: \"He's a big, strong guy. He's tough to move. He's good at countering, feeling your pressure and using your own force against you by clubbing you or by chucking you. It makes it difficult because you want to come off the ball and hit him and try to get some movement on him, but you know he's good at using your own pressure against you.\" \u2014 Kush Scouting report Xavier Rhodes, Dorial Green-Beckham Chris Szagola / AP Vikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes defends Eagles wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham during a game Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016, in Philadelphia. Vikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes defends Eagles wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham during a game Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016, in Philadelphia. (Chris Szagola / AP) Information for this report was obtained from NFL scouts. Xavier Rhodes is in his fourth season and third as a full-time starter as the team's No. 1 cornerback. A 6-foot-1, 218-pound first-round pick from Florida State in 2013, Rhodes really has developed under coach Mike Zimmer into one of the better young cover men in the league. The knock on Daniels has been his hands as he has only four career interceptions, but he has made two this season, including a terrific diving pick last week at Philadelphia when he undercut Nelson Agholor's deep-in route to snare Carson Wentz's throw. \"He was brought into the league in Leslie Frazier 's system to play Cover-2 and be that physical guy at the line of scrimmage who could jam, re-route, sink underneath and play some Cover-3 and tackle,\" the scout said. \"He's really a complete player at the position because of that. What he has transitioned into is more of a cornerback who can play off man and backpedal, keep his shoulders square, drive on the football. But he still has that physicality with him, so he will jam and compete. The great tape to watch is him against Odell Beckham Jr. He didn't back down at all. \"Because of the Vikings system and because they create so much confusion and panic at the line of scrimmage under Zimmer, he can challenge more routes because the ball has to come out. The quarterback is tired of getting hit. They roll coverage very well. They will roll to two man from a Cover-1 alignment. They will drop Harrison Smith down as a blitzer and Rhodes will roll over the top and play trap coverage over the top of the wide receiver. So they doing a lot of complex things and in the complete setting, it really caters to his skill set because he has really developed. \"The thing I am most impressed with is his footwork because he is long. A lot of tall guys lack natural bend and they struggle playing off man because they don't have that sudden burst of a 5-10 guy. But he has shown that. It's his technique. His skill set has really expanded since coming into the league and that's a testament to him and the coaching.\" Predictions Brad Biggs (4-3) The return of Jay Cutler ought to make Alshon Jeffery happy and open up the downfield passing game. But Cutler catches a tough matchup in his return and it coincides with injuries once again compromising the offensive line. The Vikings have got O-line issues of their own having lost both starting tackles for the season. But coach Mike Zimmer has been fuming all week after what he termed an \"embarrassing\" performance last week in Philadelphia. That ought to be motivation enough for his players as Minnesota bounces back in a place where they have struggled of late. Vikings 28, Bears 20 ",

    "text": "Jill Stein Life of a Ballot Millions of voters will head to the polls on Election Day to choose the next president. But once a voter casts a ballot, what happens next and how does the counting process work? By David Taintor, Sam Petulla & Ian Rose Oct 31, 2016 What happens next \uf447 Welcome to Hamilton County, Ohio To answer that question, we took a look at Hamilton County, a large county in the crucial swing state of Ohio . The Buckeye State plays an important role in presidential politics: It has been won by the eventual victor in each of the last 13 elections. At the Polls On Election Day, voters enter private booths to fill out their ballots. Some voting locations have switched to touch screens, but Hamilton County relies on paper ballots, according to Sherry Poland, the director of the county\u2019s board of elections. After the Vote Is Cast After voting and leaving the booth, the ballot is scanned electronically and then placed into a secure box . The ballots stay at the polling place until everyone has voted, Poland said. Campaign-Free Zone Campaigning, of course, continues through Election Day across the country. But in Hamilton County, American flags outline a 100-foot buffer zone around a polling place, where campaigning is prohibited. In Ohio the parties may, however, appoint precinct observers, who can inspect the proceedings of the election. Each state differs in how observers and watchers are chosen, according to the National Association of Secretaries of State. Transporting the Ballots Because there are so many votes cast in Hamilton County, bipartisan teams of poll workers take boxes of ballots and drop them off for collection at various satellite locations, such as community centers. These teams are with the ballots the whole way. Some of the workers will eventually collect the boxes and bring them to the county\u2019s board of elections. Counting the Ballots The board of elections uses memory cards with information from the scanned ballots cast at polling places across the county to count the votes. This tabulation system is secure and not connected to the internet , according to Poland. Off to the Secretary of State\u2019s Office As the votes are tallied by the county, they are sent to the Ohio secretary of state\u2019s office , which eventually posts results on its website. How the Data Comes In The largest counties must send vote data every 15 minutes , according to Matt McClellan, communications director for the Ohio secretary of state. The next largest counties send data every 30 minutes , and the smallest counties in the state send every hour. Other ballots that were sent by mail or cast in-person at the board of elections are included in the total count. Collecting Ballots in Really Big Counties This method of aggregating ballots from the precinct all the way up to the state level is typical nationwide. How the ballots are transported, though, varies. Los Angeles County, for example, as large and spread out as it is, relies on helicopters to transport bags of its ballots for counting. The Official Canvas Following Election Day, Ohio\u2019s counties must complete what\u2019s called an official canvas , which is the final vote count. This must be completed 21 days after the election, McClellan said. Electoral College Meets Finally, the Ohio Electoral College meets to cast its votes for the winning candidate . Typically, they meet at the statehouse. The electoral college sends its results to the U.S. Congress, which counts the votes, marking the end of the election process. And that\u2019s democracy in action.

    "text": "NFC North So much for all that rust on Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. So much for the idea that a ferocious Vikings defense would terrorize a short-handed Bears offensive line. So much for the forecasts that the Bears would stagger into their open date at 1-7. Turning in a complete performance Monday night at Soldier Field, the Bears upset the NFC North-leading Vikings 20-10. Cutler\u2019s 11-yard touchdown toss to Alshon Jeffery in the third quarter provided a 20-3 lead, the Bears\u2019 biggest lead of the entire season. And against a shaky Vikings\u2019 offense, that advantage provided a sense of comfort and confidence that had yet to be felt this season. The Bears jumped all over the Vikings in the first half, building a 13-0 lead midway through the second quarter. Jordan Howard scored the game\u2019s first touchdown on a 2-yard run, continuing an impressive first half. Howard compiled 145 total yards before halftime, including a 69-yard run to spark the Bears\u2019 first scoring drive. The defense also stood strong, forcing the Vikings into four consecutive three-and-outs at one point of the first half. The Bears also held the Vikings to a field goal after facing a first-and-goal situation from the 3-yard line. First-half sacks from Cornelius Washington, Leonard Floyd and Akiem Hicks set a tone as the Bears defense held the Vikings to 98 total yards in the first half, an average of 3.0 per play and 16.3 per possession. -- Dan Wiederer ",

    "text": "What's Next for the FBI's Renewed Investigation Into Clinton's Email Server By Pierre Thomas Oct 31, 2016, 6:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Hillary Clinton's Email Saga Explained 0 Shares Email The FBI says it's moving ahead with urgency as it begins the examination of newly discovered emails that prompted a review of the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server. Investigators have taken the hard drive out of former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner \u2019s laptop and made a mirror image of it to immediately begin pulling data. Weiner\u2019s laptop contained hundreds of thousands of emails, but the FBI team is only focusing on the thousands that appear to be associated with Huma Abedin , Weiner's now-estranged wife and Clinton insider, said sources familiar with the investigation. Obama Doesn't Believe FBI Director Trying to Influence Election With Clinton Email Investigation Investigators are targeting work-related emails and any emails that may have gone to the private Clinton server. The FBI will use computers to eliminate any emails that they\u2019ve already seen. Agents will also look at the time frame when Clinton was in office, but may include some of the time after she left office, according to sources. The investigators working on the latest cache of emails is the same FBI team that conducted the Clinton private email server probe. It\u2019s a collection of cyber and forensic experts, and counterintelligence agents, which number in the dozens. The goal was to have people most familiar with this case step back into it, said sources familiar with the investigation. The FBI hasn't yet determined if the newly discovered emails are truly \"new\" or whether any of the emails contained any type of sensitive information. The emails were found as part of a separate criminal investigation as FBI agents in New York were analyzing a laptop used by Weiner, who had been accused of sending sexually explicit messages to an underage girl. Since the Clinton-related emails were found while investigating another case, the FBI needed a separate warrant to examine the news emails. Federal agents discovered the emails weeks ago, but presented the findings to FBI Director James Comey last Thursday. On Friday, Comey sent a letter to key members of Congress informing them of the update. That sparked a frenzy within the Clinton campaign and immediate backlash against Comey, as lawmakers and former officials on both sides of the aisle demanded for a more complete understanding of the new information. It is also long-standing DOJ tradition to steer clear of potentially influential investigative actions so close to an election. On Sunday, the FBI obtained the appropriate warrant and began reviewing thousands of emails. Comey is receiving regular updates on the investigation and if something definitive is developed quickly, he might consider whether to release additional information. On Monday, the Department of Justice said it was moving as \"expeditiously as possible\" in response to Democrats and Republicans in Congress who had asked for additional information related to the FBI's investigation. \"We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible, wrote Assistant Attorney General Peter Kazik in the letter. Officials in the Justice Department weren't trying to block the FBI from trying to review these emails, according to sources familiar with the discussions. However, there was tension over whether the FBI should notify Congress about it with the knowledge that it would be immediately leaked\u2014and potentially affect an election that is effectively already underway, said those sources.

    "text": "Trump warns Clinton election would trigger \u2018crisis\u2019 amid email probe, as polls tighten Published               October 31, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump amplified warnings Monday that Hillary Clinton is \u201cunfit\u201d for office -- and claimed her election would mire the country in a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d -- as he fought to gain an advantage after the discovery of new emails kick-started the FBI\u2019s dormant Clinton server investigation. While the impact of the FBI\u2019s announcement isn\u2019t yet apparent in the polls, the Republican presidential nominee has climbed back into contention in Florida and other battleground states. Two separate polls released Sunday shows Trump in a tight race in Florida, after having chased Clinton\u2019s lead there for essentially the entire election cycle. The polls, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey and a New York Times/Upshot survey, showed Trump trailing by 1 percentage point and ahead by 4 points, respectively. However, neither was conducted before the FBI on Friday announced a review of new-found emails possibly connected to Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state. The FBI had investigated the server issue for a year to learn whether Clinton had mishandled classified material. FBI Director James Comey effectively ended the case this summer when he said Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with regard to classified information but they didn\u2019t have enough evidence to recommend criminal charges. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump, who has run a rollercoaster-but-resilient campaign, has taken full advantage of the new email revelations, related to a laptop the FBI has taken in connection with ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner allegedly sexting an underage female. Weiner is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. \u201cThank you, Huma. Thank you, Anthony,\u201d Trump said at rally Monday in Michigan, while warning that the emails could lead to a criminal trial for a sitting president, if Clinton is elected. He warned this could throw the country into a crisis. \u201cHow can Hillary manage his country if she cannot even manage her emails?\u201d he said. Still, as Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway vowed Sunday, Trump has since Friday stayed on message -- weaving his Clinton attacks into his now-familiar campaign speech that promises to create better jobs, to repeal and replace ObamaCare and to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d that is Washington, D.C. Clinton immediately dived into the new email issue at a rally Monday in battleground Ohio, where Trump has regained a narrow lead since mid-October, when a 2005 audiotape emerged of him boasting about making unwanted advances on women. \u201cWhy in the world would the FBI jump into an election with just eight days to go? There is no case here,\u201d Clinton said at a campaign rally, after apologizing for using the private server and before warning about the dangers of Trump and his \u201chair trigger\u201d temperament controlling the U.S. nuclear arsenal.\u00a0 Aside from the recent polling in Florida, Trump trails the front-running Clinton by just 1 percent point, 46-to-45 percent, in a national ABC/ Washington Post tracking poll. \u201cWe\u2019re doing great in every poll,\u201d Trump also said in Michigan. \u201cWe\u2019re winning all over the place.\u201d The map still favors Clinton, as the candidates battle for the ultimate prize of 270 Electoral College votes on Nov. 8. But Trump\u2019s uptick in the polls follows his campaign increasing its TV spending. Trump, in mid-October, for the first time outspent Clinton in TV advertising -- $14.4 million\u00a0to $13.9 million during the week beginning Oct. 18. That week, Trump spent $72,134, compared with $65,205 for Clinton. And in Florida, he spent roughly $128,000, compared with $138,000 for Clinton. Those week-long expenditures compare to Trump previously spending about $3 million a week and Clinton spending about $9.1 million a week since the last primary election, on June 14, according to an analysis published last week by Bloomberg Politics.\u00a0 Democratic strategist Ben Tulchin said Monday that Trump\u2019s increased advertising spending is having only a marginal impact -- considering his ability to control the news cycles with raucous rallies, myriad tweets and call-in interviews. \u201cIt\u2019s helped on the margins, to reinforce his messages,\u201d said Tulchin, president of San Francisco-based Tulchin Research. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a modest impact because he just dominates the news media. \u2026 He\u2019s blunted the impact of paid media.\u201d Tulchin instead thinks Trump recent, incremental climb is the polls is part of larger patterns occurring throughout the cycle -- Trump making a controversial remark that drops him to about 37 percent in polls, then going back to about 43 when his base returns. \u201cThey so despise Hillary, it makes them run back to Trump,\u201d he said. The White House will again be decided by a handful of battleground states, remaining extremely close with just eight days left before Election Day. In other battleground races, Clinton leads by nearly 6 percentage points in Pennsylvania and 3 points in North Carolina, while Trump is ahead by 1.4 percentage points in Iowa, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average.

USA TODAY Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is apologizing for joking about gun owners putting a\u00a0\"bull\u2019s-eye\ufffd? on Hillary Clinton. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is facing Democrat Deborah Ross in November. \u00a0(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) \u201cNothing made me feel any better\u00a0then \u2014 I walked into a gun shop ... there was a copy of Rifleman on the counter, it's got a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it,\ufffd? Burr said, referring to American Rifleman, the official publication of The NRA. \"I was a little bit shocked at that it didn't have a bull\u2019s-eye on it.\" Burr continued: \"But on the bottom right, it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there\u2019s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.\ufffd? Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman,\u00a0was speaking to GOP volunteers in Moorseville, N.C., on Saturday when he made the comment. \"The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,\" Burr\u00a0said in a Monday statement to CNN, which first reported the story. Burr is in a tight race for his seat against former Democratic state senator\u00a0Deborah Ross in North Carolina. Donald Trump drew criticism in August for suggesting that \"Second\u00a0Amendment people\" could stop Clinton \u00a0from appointing anti-gun judges. Trump,\u00a0speaking at a rally in Wilmington, N.C.,\u00a0warned that Clinton opposes the Second Amendment and would appoint Supreme Court justices who would block gun rights. \"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,\ufffd? Trump said before adding: \"Though the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\ufffd? Minutes later, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying that Trump meant people who support the Second Amendment are unified and will vote together. Meanwhile,\u00a0Democrats \u2014 including Clinton \u2014 quickly accused Trump of suggesting violence against the Democratic nominee. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f6ES8S Most Popular ",

Phil Rosenthal Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Cubs have never played in a televised World Series , but they're getting the hang of it with Cleveland. They kept their championship hopes alive with a 3-2 Game 5 victory Sunday at Wrigley Field , and trounced the NFL 's \"Sunday Night Football\" in doing so. Over their first five games nationally, the Cubs and Indians are averaging an 11.0 rating and 19.3 million viewers tuning in. That's makes this the most-watched World Series since 2004, when the Red Sox ended their championship drought of 86 years in a four-game sweep of the Cardinals , a Series that averaged 25.4 million viewers. Photos from Game 5 of the World Series at Wrigley Field on Oct. 30, 2016. Mark Gonzales Dexter Fowler looked across the Cubs clubhouse Sunday night in the direction of closer Aroldis Chapman after the flame-throwing left-hander saved the Cubs season with 2 2/3 scoreless innings. \"I don't think there is a reset button,\" Fowler said before the Cubs left Monday night for Cleveland. \"We're... Dexter Fowler looked across the Cubs clubhouse Sunday night in the direction of closer Aroldis Chapman after the flame-throwing left-hander saved the Cubs season with 2 2/3 scoreless innings. \"I don't think there is a reset button,\" Fowler said before the Cubs left Monday night for Cleveland. \"We're... (Mark Gonzales) The throwback matchup of long-frustrated franchises is reviving recollections of the days when the Fall Classic was a media juggernaut. That these two teams have gone a combined 176 years without a champions may account for some of the appeal. But the Cubs also have cultivated a national fan base and there's the novelty of seeing them play in the World Series, something they haven't done since 1945, two years before the Series was televised for the first time. Game 5's 15.3 preliminary overnight rating on Fox across the nation's top markets eclipsed the 11.6 for the Dallas Cowboys ' overtime victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on NBC. Those early numbers will be adjusted later but not enough to upend baseball. In one sense Cowboys-Eagles should have been a solid draw for the NFL, two popular division rivals in a close game. But it was also an extra-long NFL Sunday that began around breakfast-time with a Washington-Cincinnati game from London that ended in a tie -- and there may be a saturation point. Plus, NFL ratings overall have slipped some this season. The Cubs and Indians' ratings average over five games is a 26 percent improvement on last year's Mets- Royals World Series, which Kansas City won in five games. It is a 53 percent improvement on the first five games of 2014 Giants and Royals showdown, which San Francisco wound up needing seven games to win. Here in Chicago, with their season on the line, the Cubs' game Sunday scored a 42.8 household rating and was seen in 60.4 percent of all homes watching television. That translates to roughly 1.48 million Chicago-area homes. ",

USA Today Network Ilana Keller, Asbury Park (N.J.) Press 9:21 p.m. EDT October 31, 2016 Halloween candy. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Death By Chocolate is a delicious dessert, but according to the\u00a0American Chemical Society, sweets\u00a0can be toxic . With Halloween treat eating under way (and leftovers piling up on office counter-tops), the Washington-based nonprofit scientific society tackled the bittersweet question of just how much candy is too much. And it's not all Almond Joy. ACS researchers\u00a0have found that the LD50 of sugar \u2013 that's the lethal dose of a sugar\u00a0that would kill half the population of a test group \u2013 is 13.5 grams per pound of body weight, consumed all at once. Here's the most popular Halloween treat by state This is in rats, of course, because testing on humans is, well, illegal. Still, the research\u00a0implies you would have a 50/50 chance of\u00a0seriously overdoing it at that amount. The\u00a0average person in the U.S.\u00a0weighs about 180 pounds. \u00a0That means the LD50\u00a0of sugar for humans\u00a0amounts to eating about 5.4 pounds of sugar in one sitting \u2014 more than an average bag on a grocery-store shelf. In terms of deadly candy, that means you'd have to consume\u00a0262 fun-sized bars\u00a0\u2013 or a whopping\u00a01,627 pieces of\u00a0candy corn. Sweet Jesus. Such a binge would pitch your body, especially the liver,\u00a0into sugar shock from an inability to break down all that glucose, researchers noted in a video from ACS. The toxic response as experienced by\u00a0rats in the test included depressed activity, gastrointestinal disturbances and, if diabetic, damage to the eyes, heart, nerves and kidneys. ACS was chartered by the U.S. Congress, and has\u00a0nearly 157,000 members, according to a news release, making it the \"world's largest scientific society and a global leader in providing access to chemistry-related research through its multiple databases, peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.\" For more information, visit\u00a0 ACS.org .

Only a skeleton of the historic Basilica of St. Benedict--which had stood in the center of Norcia, Italy, since the 14th century--was left standing following Sunday's tremor. The spiritually significant site for the Catholic Church was built atop what is believed to be the historic birthplace of Saint Benedict, the Patron Saint of Europe. Earthquake in Italy Causes Cathedral to Collapse Aerial footage from a drone reveals that the front facade of the church remains erect, but little else of the historic building remains. Sunday's quake is believed to be the strongest to hit the country since a tremor that killed some 3,000 people in 1980. A 6.1-magnitude tremor also devastated the area on Aug. 24 of this year, killing nearly 300 people.

The monks, an International Benedictine community, stated in a series of tweets that the basilica had been destroyed in the earthquake and that they were praying for those affected by the quake, as well as searching for those who may need their last rites. The monks started an online fund to raise money for rebuilding the cathedral. ABC News' David Caplan contributed to this report 0 Shares ",

Look at them,' Clinton says of the new emails Chrissie Thompson and Jeremy Fugleberg, The Cincinnati Enquirer 9:57 p.m. EDT October 31, 2016 x Share Hillary Clinton is challenging the FBI's new email inquiry, saying 'There is no case here.' Clinton is also warning anew about Donald Trump having control of nuclear weapons  (Oct. 31) AP Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton arrives Oct. 31, 2016, for a campaign stop in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) CINCINNATI\u00a0\u2014 With eight days remaining until Election Day,\u00a0Hillary Clinton told a crowd of supporters here Monday that the FBI should hurry up and check out the additional emails that agents said they found while investigating the estranged husband of one of her aides. \"Go ahead. Look at them,\" the Democratic nominee said\u00a0about the emails that may have been originally housed on a private server she used as secretary of state\u00a0\u2014 a revelation that has thrown the presidential election into turmoil. \"I made a mistake. I'm not making any excuses,\" Clinton said about not using an official State Department email address. After an investigation that concluded during the summer, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton's treatment of classified material \"extremely careless\" but did not recommend prosecution. With Clinton email case, FBI director on 'fraught, perilous' path Now that the bureau is reviewing emails from staffer Huma Abedin's\u00a0laptop, \"I know they\u2019ll reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year,\" Clinton said Monday. \"It wasn\u2019t even a close call. And I think most people have moved on.\" In Ohio, a swing state, Clinton is locked in a tight battle with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, according to a rolling average of state polls. No Republican has reached the White House without winning Ohio, and no Democrat has done so since 1960. \u201cIt was politically timed.\u201d Rabbi Tom Friedmann, Montgomery, Ohio, on the FBI's Friday letter. Clinton, who has trailed Trump by a few points in Ohio in the past few months, has led nationally\u00a0but is seeking to fire up and reassure supporters after the FBI's announcement Friday. Supporters in Cincinnati indicated Clinton's defense was working. \u201cIt was politically timed,\" Rabbi Tom Friedmann, 65, of Montgomery, Ohio, said of the FBI's letter to several members of Congress. \"If anything, it\u2019s strengthened my support of Hillary. There is no other choice.\u201d Clinton\u2019s sustained lead nationally and the lack of excitement she engenders among Democrats present a challenge for her campaign as it seeks to turn people out to vote \u2014 especially early voters. Democrats in 2012 used early voting to build an insurmountable lead before Election Day. \u201c(Hillary) is the face of the future,\" said Isaias Gamboa, 53, of Cincinnati. On the email controversy: \"It\u2019s like a gnat. Just shoo it away.\u201d Clinton: Private server 'a mistake,' but a vote for Trump risks nuclear war Many of the people\u00a0The Enquirer\u00a0interviewed at Clinton\u2019s rally, where\u00a0an estimated 2,800 gathered in Smale Riverfront Park in the heart of downtown Cincinnati,\u00a0indicated they\u00a0already\u00a0had\u00a0voted. Clinton is seeking to refocus the race after Comey's announcement. The bureau is reviewing emails that could be related to its former investigation of Clinton's private email server, he said without elaborating. The John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge that spans the Ohio River from Cincinnati to Covington, Ky., is visible behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as she arrives Oct. 31, 2016, at a rally at Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati. \u00a0(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) The political world erupted with Democrats insisting he had overstepped his bounds and Republicans \u2014 including Trump \u2014 warning that Clinton once again could face indictment. The FBI appears to be focused on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and the estranged husband of Abedin. It's unclear whether the material on the device is from Clinton. It's also not known if the emails in question are new or duplicates of the thousands the former secretary of state and her aides already\u00a0have turned over. So after addressing the emails, Clinton joined other speakers in casting the election in almost apocalyptic terms. She asked supporters to imagine if they don\u2019t vote\u00a0and Trump is elected: \u201cThe American dream itself is at stake,\u201d she said. Then Clinton focused on gun control. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, joined Clinton at the rally. \u201cThink about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and a president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America,\u201d Clinton said. In 2011, a gun-wielding assailant nearly assassinated Giffords, and the former congresswoman, who may never fully regain her ability to speak and walk, is\u00a0an outspoken advocate for stronger gun control policies \u2014 policies that Clinton champions.

    "text": "David Lauter, Kyle Kim and Armand Emamdjomeh Other developments Monday, though, rekindled unanswered questions about Trump. His former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort , is the subject of a preliminary FBI inquiry into any connections to Russia,\u00a0NBC reported, citing unnamed law enforcement and intelligence officials. Manafort, who reportedly had\u00a0financial ties to a pro-Russia party in Ukraine, where he once worked as a political operative,\u00a0denied the report to the network. Trump\u2019s campaign said that he had no knowledge of Manafort\u2019s \u201cpast or present activities.\u201d Trump has repeatedly expressed his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose strongman tactics the U.S. has disavowed. The White House accused Russia this month of leaking Democratic emails, which Putin has denied. Though the void of information about the new email review may hurt\u00a0Clinton, Trump\u2019s reaction carried the\u00a0risk of overplaying the controversy, especially with uncommitted voters who may not loathe Clinton as passionately as Trump\u2019s core supporters do. But even those who do not harbor Trump\u2019s view may nonetheless be reminded of Clinton\u2019s\u00a0and her husband\u2019s protracted battles with Republicans in the 1990s and the unending investigations that ensued. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI\u00a0would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go,\u201d she said in Kent,\u00a0Ohio. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d Which Republicans are supporting Trump, and who's jumping ship?

And they said it wasn\u2019t even a close call, and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.\u201d Comey initially decided against recommending prosecution of Clinton, which drew heavy criticism from Trump and his allies and praise from Democrats. Now the\u00a0tables are turned. \"It took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made,\" Trump said in Michigan. \"I really disagreed with him. I was not his fan. But I tell you what \u2014 what he did, he brought back his reputation,\" Trump said, as the crowd applauded in agreement. \"He's got to hang tough.... A\u00a0lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. What he did was the right thing.\"\u00a0 Times staff writers Melanie Mason in Grand Rapids, Mich.,\u00a0Michael A.

They are more likely than whites to be raising grandchildren or supporting needy relatives. In tough times, they have less to fall back on. All of this is playing out here in East Mount Airy, once a heavily white and Jewish neighborhood in northwestern Philadelphia, just across the border from suburban Montgomery County. Sandwiched between Chestnut Hill, with its upscale boutiques, and less affluent Germantown, where Ms. Solomon lives, it has long stood for upward black mobility. \u201cI often say this was the place where working-class black folks would come when they wanted some R and R,\u201d Cherelle Parker , a member of the Philadelphia City Council and former state legislator, said. \u201cBut R and R has translated from rest and relaxation to reverse mortgages and retirement insecurity.\u201d Marlene Trice, who founded the Kitchen of Love, bears witness to these changes. Video Running the Kitchen of Love Marlene Trice, the founder of the Kitchen of Love, and Natalie Solomon, a volunteer, prepare to give out food at the pantry, which serves 500 to 700 people a week.

A no-nonsense woman with a booming voice and a penchant for T-shirts with sayings like \u201cKeep Calm and Love Jesus,\u201d Mrs. Trice, 69, and her husband, Clarence, 73, bought their home in East Mount Airy in 1969. He details cars; she worked at the prepared food counter at Pathmark \u2014 \u201cI fried the chicken, made the hoagies, did the party trays\u201d \u2014 until its parent company filed for bankruptcy last year. \u201cI thought I would work until I was 75,\u201d she said. In 1996, Mrs. Trice opened the food pantry in North Philadelphia, the poor neighborhood where she grew up. In 2010, a new recreation center was built in East Mount Airy. Ms. Parker suggested that Mrs. Trice move the pantry to the old center, in a boxy cinder-block building next to a playground and school. \u201cI said, \u2018No, the people are not going to come out like they do in North Philly,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Trice recalled. \u201cBut now, let me tell you something: They made a liar out of me.\u201d Continue reading the main story Video \u201cIt Helps\u201d Hundreds of people, many retired and all trying to make ends meet, come each week to the Kitchen of Love in Mount Airy, a tidy middle-class neighborhood in Philadelphia.

Helping, and Receiving Help Ms. Solomon turned up at the Kitchen of Love four years ago, frightened and sick. \u201cI was hoping it would help me to eat better,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A daughter of a factory worker and a Philadelphia police officer, Ms. Solomon is a private woman, and not as financially secure as some of the people she now serves. She inherited her house from her mother, raised five children and lost two sons to violence. She was engaged once, but never married; in a quiet moment, she wondered if \u201cmaybe I should have, because I would have a husband to help me out.\u201d Still, during her 27 years at the Ford factory, later spun off as a subsidiary called Visteon, she \u201cconsidered myself middle class.\u201d Active in her union, she took trips to cities like Cincinnati, where she shook hands with Mr. Obama at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in 2008. She thought he might save the plant, but it closed in 2010 . She does not blame him. \u201cI blame Ford,\u201d she said.

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times She was too young for early retirement, and the Affordable Care Act had not yet become law. She declined coverage under the Cobra program; she needed the money, she said, to buy heating oil for her house. When her unemployment compensation ran out, she dipped into her pension, agreeing to benefits at a vastly reduced rate: roughly $5,000 a year. The local community college offers a human services program \u2014 \u201cto prepare graduates for careers as professionals in mental health agencies and social services,\u201d according to its website \u2014 and Ms. Solomon enrolled. She has no computer and was often on campus until 10 p.m. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really eating,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe twice a week I would go to the cafeteria and eat half a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes on, but most of the time I drank Mountain Dew and Pepsis and coffee and cakes to keep myself alert, for the sugar. I would wake up at 3 in the morning, trying to do homework.\u201d EAST MOUNT AIRY, Pa. Sources: U.S. Census Data; Ira Goldstein, Policy Map by Reinvestment Fund Then the fainting spells started. She spent five days in the hospital getting blood transfusions. Mrs. Trice later helped her find a doctor. Today, Ms. Solomon has health coverage through Medicaid , expanded in Pennsylvania under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cShe came to me asking for help,\u201d Mrs. Trice recalled. \u201cAnd after maybe six months, she asked me, \u2018Could I volunteer?\u2019\u201d Uncertain Times Parked outside Mrs. Trice\u2019s home is a rusty white pickup truck, with 172,000 miles on it and a creaky driver\u2019s-side door that needs to be slammed several times before it will shut. Stepping off the bus, Ms. Solomon pulled the key out of her purse: Her volunteer duties include driving to local grocery stores to pick up their castoffs.

Gospel music played on an old boom box. A truck from Philabundance , the regional hunger relief organization, was on the way. As much as food, the Kitchen of Love offers comfort in an uncertain world. It is a place to debate whether the new Powerball lottery is a good value or a scam; to get tips on which programs help with home heating costs; to watch the schoolchildren, in uniforms of khaki and blue, scamper around the playground \u2014 and maybe get a kiss from a grandchild passing by. It is also, lately, a place to vent about a presidential race that feels too horrible to watch, yet too compelling to avoid.

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times In Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, people here concede, there is a tiny kernel of truth. Yes, there is violence in their community; Ms. Solomon, in her quiet grief, knows this. Yes, many people here lost their jobs, even under an African-American president, but some of Ms. Solomon\u2019s friends from the factory are now employed. When people here watch Trump rallies, some see imagery that reminds them of their childhoods in the Deep South; some go so far as to wonder if Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have been planted by the Ku Klux Klan. Their feelings about Mrs. Clinton are mixed, but those who are voting for president will vote for her. They hold Republicans in disdain. But their reaction to Mr. Trump is especially deep and visceral. \u201cBack to slavery days,\u201d Ms. Solomon said gravely. \u201cDo as master say.\u201d But if Mr. Trump has brought racial animus to the fore, some see that as a blessing. \u201cIt kind of pulled a blindfold off of America,\u201d Inez Muhammad, 54, a disabled federal worker, said. Like many here and across the nation, Ms. Solomon is looking past Election Day: She fears that Washington \u201cwill be a mess,\u201d with Mr. Trump kicking up a fuss if he loses. She has been working on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and intends to re-enroll in college, to prove to her grandchildren that \u201cif Nana can get a degree, you can too.\u201d In the meantime, she has volunteered to help Democrats register voters and pushing everyone she knows to go to the polls, especially her grandson, who is 18. \u201cI told him, that\u2019s not a given right for black people,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many people died for you to give up that right.\u201d Correction: November 2, 2016 Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Monday with an article about the concerns of voters in Philadelphia misstated the given name of a woman who volunteered at the Kitchen of Love food pantry in the Mount Airy neighborhood. She is Natalie Solomon, not Deborah. And also because of editing errors, a second picture caption misstated the surname of a founder of the food pantry and a third caption referred incorrectly to Raymond and Eric Melton, who were shown playing ball in the neighborhood. The founder of the pantry is Marlene Trice, not Price. And while the brothers live near the Kitchen of Love, they are not fed by the pantry. Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter @SherylNYT .
