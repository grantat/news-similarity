    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies on illegal immigration, particularly on the border wall and cracking down on sanctuary cities, were at the center of his election campaign. Now, advocates of immigration restriction are hoping for reform to H-1B visas that they say are hurting American workers. The H-1B is a temporary, non-immigrant visa, currently capped at 85,000 visas a year, that allows employers to hire skilled, specialty workers on a temporary basis -- particularly scientists, engineers, or computer programmers. However, critics say that the system is rife with abuse, and is no longer a limited short-term program to help employers with unexpected labor shortages in niche areas, and has instead become a way to push out American workers in favor of cheap foreign labor. \u201cBecause of lobbying by the Chamber of Commerce and big tech companies, they\u2019ve succeeded in loosening standards and we\u2019ve seen the increasingly common scenario where American workers are fired, and have to train their replacements,\u201d \u00a0Dan Stein, President of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told FoxNews.com. Trump has shifted stances somewhat on the visas. After initially taking a hard stance against them, in contrast to some of his Republican opponents, at a primary debate in March he appeared to change his stance and said: \u201cI\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll get them in.\u201d Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 He later released a statement saying the H-1B program \u201cis neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.\u201d \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions,\u201d he said. Advocates of immigration restriction have been made hopeful that a Trump administration will clamp down on the visa. In particular they have been buoyed by Trump\u2019s decision to pick Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as his attorney general \u2013 known for his hardline stances on both illegal and legal immigration. In 2015, Sessions sent round an \u201cimmigration handbook\u201d to Republican members of Congress that calls immigration reform \u201ca legislative honorific almost exclusively reserved for proposals which benefit everyone but actual American citizens.\u201d In that handbook and since, Sessions has railed against what he sees as the abuse of the program. In his handbook he cites statistics suggesting that guest workers make up two-thirds of all new IT hires, while half of Americans with STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic] degrees can\u2019t find work. He says that while the cap is 85,000, the real number is much higher. \u201cBut, due to overlapping admissions and other factors, the total number of H-1B workers physically present in the U.S. is actually much higher\u2014it has been estimated to fall somewhere in the range of 650,000 to 750,000,\u201d he wrote. While Sessions\u2019 appointment may put those companies who use the system on edge, analysts say there is still a long way to go in appointments. \u201cI think companies are in wait-and see mode, By the time of inauguration there\u2019ll be a clearer sense of who will be head of Council of Economic Advisors and the Department of Labor. There\u2019ll be a better sense of the team and that will tell the tech companies something,\u201d Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), told FoxNews.com. The plight of American workers being replaced was highlighted earlier this year when laid-off Disney IT workers sued the company, claiming that despite high performance ratings, they were made to train their foreign replacements. In February, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from some of those laid off. Presiding over the hearing was Sen. Jeff Sessions. However, supporters of the program warned that while surgically reforming the program could work, cutting it too deeply could have the opposite of the intended effect, and actually hurt American workers if companies can\u2019t get the help. They warn that some companies may actually ship more jobs overseas if the visa is limited. \u201cCompanies doing tech work\u2026\u2026they would be thinking about expanding work in places other than United States. They might put it in Canada, in a place like Vancouver, where Microsoft employs a lot of \u00a0people because they can find it hard to get the skills to come to the U.S.,\u201d Atkinson said.. \u201cThe whole view that there\u2019s not a shortage [in STEM workers], I think that\u2019s wrong, and the idea that H-1B workers are substitutes is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey normally complement one another, allowing companies to gain global market shares and expand even more.\u201d Adams Nager, economic policy analyst at ITIF, found that unemployment in STEM fields is very low, and concludes that, despite occasional stories of lay-offs, \u201cAmerica faces a shortage of high-skilled STEM talent, especially in IT industries.\u201d Those opposed to the current state of the program say there are a number of things a Trump administration could do without needing whole-scale reform from Congress. \u201cOne of those is to collect the data and make it available to the public. That would strike horror into the industry,\u201d John Miano, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, told FoxNews.com \u201cThis has been kept secret or not collected. We don\u2019t know who are getting the visas, we don\u2019t know where the people are, what occupations they\u2019re in or what the salary is.\u201d Other possible reforms include a clarification on the definition of \u201cspecialized knowledge,\u201d which could help cut down on abuse, and a limit on such visas for two years. Proponents on both side of the issue agree that, despite the pick of Sessions as AG, it is not yet clear which way the administration will fall on the issue. Trump\u2019s official website makes no mention of H-1Bs on the immigration policy page. But those who want significant reform are hopeful in the wake of the Sessions pick. \u201cH-1B spans the Department of Justice, Labor Department and USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]. There\u2019s hope you\u2019d have people at all three levels enforcing the law, and Sessions gives us hope they\u2019ll start doing that,\u201d Miano said.

    "text": "Jill Stein files for recount in Wisconsin Patrick Marley and Bill Glauber, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 7:16 p.m. EST November 25, 2016 x Share Former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has raised funds to launch a recount in the second of three battleground states won by Donald Trump where she intends to challenge the results. Video provided by AFP Newslook Dr. Jill Stein, Green Party presidential nominee, arrives at a rally July 27, 2016, in Philadelphia. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) MADISON, Wis.\u00a0\u2014 Elections officials in three states will have to move quickly if the Green Party's presidential nominee, Jill Stein, is able to force a recount to be conducted by hand. Stein and\u00a0Reform Party candidate\u00a0Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente separately\u00a0filed recount requests late Friday in Wisconsin \u2014 the state's first ever for a presidential race \u2014 on the final day they were able to do so. As liberals raised fears about hacked voting machines, Stein has raised more than $5\u00a0million \u00a0to pay for recounts here and in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where recount deadlines are next week. That's more than the $3.5 million she raised as a candidate. Hitting a Dec. 13 federal deadline to certify electoral votes \u2014 10 in Wisconsin, 16 in Michigan\u00a0and 20 in Pennsylvania \u2014\u00a0could be particularly tricky in a by-hand recount, Wisconsin's top election official said. County boards of canvassers, which likely will have to work nights and weekends, will do the recounts. Jill Stein nears $4.5M goal to fund key-state recounts \"You may potentially have the state electoral votes at stake if it doesn't get done by then,\" \u00a0said Michael Haas, the administrator of the Wisconsin Election Commission.\u00a0A lawyer with Stein's campaign has said she wants the recount done by hand, something that Haas said would require a judge's order in Wisconsin and take longer in general. Stein received just 1% of the vote in each of the three states. De La Fuente\u00a0had about 1,500 votes in Wisconsin, a fraction of a percent of those cast here, and he was not on the ballot in the other two states. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is standing up for an election system that we can trust. We deserve to have votes that we can believe in.\u201d Jill Stein, Green Party \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is standing up for an election system that we can trust. We deserve to have votes that we can believe in,\u201d Stein said in a video on\u00a0 her Facebook page . \u201cThis is a commitment that Greens have expressed \u2014\u00a0that we stand for election integrity, that we support voting systems that respect our vote.\u00a0 We demand voting systems that are accurate, that are publicly controlled, that are not privatized.\u201d Unofficial vote tallies in the three states show GOP nominee Donald Trump won Michigan by fewer than 12,000 votes, Wisconsin by fewer than 30,000 votes and Pennsylvania by fewer than 70,000 votes. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would have to win recounts in all three states to receive enough electoral votes to win the presidency, a remote possibility. A federal \"safe harbor\" law requires presidential recounts to be completed within 35 days of the election. This year\u00a0that's Dec. 13, two weeks and a day from this coming Monday. Wisconsin law allows any candidate to seek a recount. The candidate has to pay if he or she lost by more than 0.25%, hence Stein's fundraising.\u00a0She estimates a Wisconsin recount would cost $1.1 million. Michigan's price tag could be about\u00a0$787,500, based on a 2014 law that put the bill at $125 per precinct when the margin of a race is more than half a percentage point. Michigan has 6,300 precincts. Green Party pushes for recount in key states The approximate costs of a recount in Pennsylvania weren't immediately available, but the vote-rich state is being targeted even with its wider Trump victory margin because two-thirds of the state's counties, including its most populous, use electronic voting machines that don't leave a paper trail, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Experts have demonstrated that such machines can be hacked even without being hooked up to the Internet. Similar machines are scattered in some of the smaller counties in Wisconsin. About 1 in 10 votes in the state's April presidential primary came from such machines. All of Michigan's voting machines have paper ballots that can be recounted, election officials there said. An article this week in\u00a0 New York\u00a0magazine \u00a0contended that Clinton received 7% fewer votes in counties with electronic voting compared to those with paper ballots. \u201cOur plans are being drafted\u201d for a recount, said Chris Thomas, director of elections at the Michigan Secretary of State's office. \u201cWe\u2019re on top of it. We\u2019ve got some blueprints on how it will be done.\u201d Clinton's popular vote lead surpasses 2 million It's been nearly five decades since Michigan has had a statewide recount, most recently when the state's voters rejected daylight saving\u00a0time in 1968 by 490 votes. This time, nearly 4.8 million presidential-race votes would have to be counted by hand at the county level under state supervision. \u201cWe\u2019re fast,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe do all of our state recounts by hand.\u201d Wisconsin's most recent statewide recount was in 2011 for a state Supreme Court seat, and the outcome did not change. The recount showed Justice David Prosser defeated challenger JoAnne Klopenburg by 7,004 votes\u00a0\u2014 a slightly tighter margin than the 7,316-vote victory he had in initial returns. In recounts, typically both candidates gain votes, in part because absentee ballots that weren't counted initially get tallied, said\u00a0political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Some absentee ballots don't get counted at first because they were damaged or had extra marks on them. The judicial\u00a0recount took more than a month. This time Wisconsin election officials will have nearly double the number of votes, 3 million, to go through, Burden said. Mich. vote tally may change, but outcome will remain the same Pennsylvania has almost 6 million presidential votes to retally in a potential recount. More important than the Dec. 13 federal deadline is Dec. 19 \u2014 three weeks from Monday \u2014 when electors across the USA must meet to cast their Electoral College votes, said Edward\u00a0Foley, an expert in election law at Ohio State University. \"That is a hard deadline, and if a state were to miss that deadline, it would be technically in jeopardy of not having its electoral votes counted,\" he said. If any recount isn't complete by then, electors from the states could meet anyway and have their results sent to Congress by the time it counts electoral votes Jan. 6, Foley said. Congress has wide latitude to decide how to count the states' electoral votes. The push for recounts came as some questioned Trump\u2019s wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But election experts noted that voting patterns in those states were similar to ones in other Midwestern states such as Iowa and Ohio. Trump slammed for refusing to say if he'd accept election results The Clinton and Trump campaigns have not commented on the recount effort. \"Jill Stein's decision to pursue a recount is absurd and nothing more than an expensive political stunt that undermines Wisconsin's election process,\" Mark Morgan, executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said in a statement. George Martin, who sits on the Green Party's coordinating committee, said Stein is seeking the recount because of concerns about differences between the votes and exit polls, as well as worries of tampering with voting machines. The party is \"prepared to delivered certified checks\" to meet the estimated costs for the recount as tabulated by the Wisconsin Election Commission. \"We're not saying this is the smoking gun, but there is enough evidence to take a look at our voting system,\" he said.

Williamson/The Washington Post) \u201cThey all want to buy the place,\u201d says Matthews, a retired federal worker. \u201cAnd the reason is, they know this whole area\u2019s getting ready to pick up big-time.\u201d His property, just above the District\u2019s eastern tip, is on Douglas Street NE, a tumbledown block these days, but once a tidy enclave of middle-class African Americans. Here, for almost 100\u00a0years, three generations of the Matthews clan, including Frank, witnessed the sweep of D.C. history from the same wood-frame, farmhouse-style abode. In the new Washington that emerged from 1990s fiscal chaos, an influx of affluent professionals, mainly white, has altered the character of neighborhoods close to downtown. Now, as the tide of gentrification rolls toward outlying sections of the city, Matthews sees it lapping at his doorstep in the long-forsaken Kenilworth-Parkside area. What\u2019s occurring on Douglas Street, among the prosperous and the poor, is the story of gentrification in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 a saga of huge change writ small along a third of a mile of cracked and patched pavement. As in many parts of the District that are undergoing transformation, anxiety and tension are rife. And it\u2019s a tale of one man\u2019s perseverance, his hope for renewal. Frank Matthews has lived in his home on Douglas Street since he was born. The house was bought by his grandfather in 1919. Matthews says that he has no intention of selling his home to developers or speculators. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) \u201cOh, they\u2019ll do a cash deal,\u201d says Matthews, 66, who scoffs at the notion of selling his boyhood home. He waves a hand dismissively. \u201cSame thing every time. \u2026 \u2018Oh, I can give you $250,000 for it. \u2026 I don\u2019t even have to look inside.\u2019\u201d If all goes as planned, the city next year will begin razing the blighted Kenilworth Courts public housing complex, across the road from Matthews, and replacing it with a larger, upscale project of stylish design, including not only public housing but nicer apartments for middle-class renters and townhomes for sale at market prices. Gone will be 26 low-slung blockhouses separated by shadowy labyrinths of courtyards and alleys. Although the city has vowed that the impoverished tenants will be allowed back in when the work is done, many of them are skeptical. And even if the promise holds true, the residents, who depend on one another daily for help, dread the loss of their mini-communities, their vital support networks within the buildings. \u201cA lot of times, I can\u2019t get up to go to the store,\u201d says Delories Williams, 61, who is slowed by chronic back pain. \u201cI\u2019ll give the money to Miss Kim,\u201d meaning a longtime friend in an adjacent apartment. \u201cMiss Kim will go get the things we need.\u201d Meanwhile, the first gentrifiers have arrived, a German-born white woman and her husband, a native New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent. Kyra Szanto and Eduardo Laguerre, both college educated and profitably employed, bought a remodeled century-old house directly opposite Matthews and next to Kenilworth Courts. The couple, who have befriended Williams and other nearby tenants, are burdened by angst. On Douglas Street, living at the intersection of the city\u2019s future and past, they worry that their neighbors quietly resent them for the looming disruption. \u201cWe are the poster children of gentrification,\u201d Szanto, 42, says uneasily. As for Matthews, he is cheered by the thought of a neighborhood resurrection, and he passes his days untroubled, alone in the house where he was raised, where his father grew up and where his paternal granddaddy rooted the family ages back. \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since things were looking up around here,\u201d he says. This photo is from the Official Personnel File of Frank Matthews, Department of the Interior. He started work for the Interior Department as a laborer in 1909 and remained a federal employee into the Depression years. (The National Archives/St. Louis) Humble beginnings Before he died in 1947 at age 75, Granddaddy Frank Matthews could gaze out at Douglas Street from that narrow porch and ponder the measure of dignity he had achieved despite the bedrock racism of his times. Born a decade after Emancipation, he was sworn in as a civil servant, an Interior Department laborer, in 1909. His pay, $480 a year, was paltry even then. By 1920, he was an elevator conductor in the grand Old Post Office building, four blocks from the White House, and his wages, still meager, had nearly doubled. On May 14, 1919, with a $1,900 loan, he and his wife, Sadie, bought their piece of the dream: a little house on a quarter-acre in a countrified corner of the capital. Today\u2019s Kenilworth-Parkside area, two miles long and a half-mile across at its widest, includes five neighborhoods between Benning Road NE and the Maryland border, flanked by the Anacostia River and the Anacostia Freeway. When the first community was built there, a tiny suburb-within-the-city dubbed Kenilworth, blacks could buy property on one block in an otherwise whites-only subdivision. Although the road was labeled \u201cDouglass Avenue,\u201d as in Frederick Douglass, on a 1903 planning map, it was Douglas Street when Matthews moved in, and he could ride a trolley six miles to downtown, where he stayed on the federal payroll into the Depression years. His son, Thomas, joined Interior as a laborer in 1934. After military service in World War II, he returned to the workforce as a lithographer in the Navy\u2019s map-making Hydrographic Office with a salary that afforded his growing family a middle-class lifestyle. He and his wife took over the Douglas Street house, and the youngest of their three kids, born in 1951, was named Frank after his late granddaddy. Note: Frank Matthews\u2019s father Thomas and mother Beatrice out for a walk in the 1950s. Matthews\u2019s family has owned the Douglas Street home in Northeast D.C. for nearly a century. Matthews got a bike for Christmas, circa 1956. (Family photo) Frank Matthews recalls an idyllic \u201950s boyhood on a tranquil block, the homes a mix of farmhouse styles and stout brick Colonials. There were African American businessmen and civil servants; there was a dean of the D.C. Teachers College; there was a dapper nightclub owner whom Frank addressed as \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d always with a Cadillac and a roll of cash, who\u2019d peel off a five and tip a kid for wiping his windshield. But a great social upheaval, vaguely noticed by young Frank, had already begun. Nationwide in the 1950s, postwar-era government housing programs and the lure of open space spurred white flight to suburbia. Racist real estate practices prevented most African Americans from joining the exodus. Black families, many of them middle class, gradually filled up formerly all-white D.C. neighborhoods, including Kenilworth. By decade\u2019s end, the city\u2019s African American population, 35\u00a0percent in 1950, had climbed to 54\u00a0percent. Whites in Kenilworth were especially apprehensive about the growth of a community just to their south: Eastland Gardens, developed by and for blacks in the late 1930s, was the second of the five neighborhoods built in Kenilworth-Parkside. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed segregation in public schools, causing more white families to flee urban America. As for Douglas Street, its middle-class African American character endured \u2014 until the late \u201950s, when Frank, standing on the porch one day, saw earth-moving machines clearing the woods across from his home. That tree-filled acreage had been his playground. But Frank overheard some unhappy grown-ups saying that the city needed the land. \u201cPublic housing,\u201d they grumbled. The Kenilworth Courts housing project will eventually be torn down and redeveloped. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) The rise of public housing Kenilworth Courts, opened in 1959, was a larger complex then. Today, it is 290 apartments in 26 squat brick buildings spread across 14\u00a0acres on the north side of Douglas Street, right outside Frank\u2019s front door. Conceived in the New Deal era, public housing was meant to create construction jobs and provide decent living quarters for people who were bruised by the Depression yet still able to pay modest rents. The District erected its first complex in 1938 and built about 50 more in the next quarter-century. There were plenty of working-class white tenants in the early years. But after Congress lowered the income ceiling in the late 1940s, America\u2019s public housing population turned steadily poorer and overwhelmingly black. Along Douglas Street, the moneyless newcomers came face-to-face with a long-settled community of working- and middle-class African Americans. Although Frank found playmates in the complex, he also encountered class resentment. More than once, he says, he was waylaid by \u201cproject kids\u201d he barely knew.

Clad in a suit and fedora, Thomas Matthews, a hard-nosed man who wouldn\u2019t tolerate laziness, marched to the complex and canvassed the courtyards. \u201cThey thought he was a cop,\u201d Frank recalls. \u201cHe\u2019d ask them who was doing what. Asked guys what their names were. Because if there was any problem, he wanted to know who the problem people were.\u201d In the 1960s, urban riots across America fueled more white flight. Violent unrest after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 left vast swaths of the District in ruins. While his father stood guard over his property, Frank, then 17, watched from the porch as looters streamed out of Kenilworth Courts, bound for a nearby Safeway, and hurried back with all the groceries they could steal in overflowing carts. \u201cIt was like a parade of people,\u201d he remembers. \u201cSome people didn\u2019t have carts. Some just had stuff all up to their armpits, carrying them and running.\u201d The Kenilworth Courts populace, once just mostly black, was virtually all African American by then, and desperately impoverished. Thomas Matthews, on the other hand, was making the equivalent of $68,000 a year in today\u2019s money before he retired in 1966 from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office. If he hadn\u2019t been busy protecting his home during the rioting, his son says, he almost certainly would have been off playing golf. As they sat together out front, taking in the mayhem that April night in 1968, Frank recalls, his father turned to him, quietly seething: \u201cYou don\u2019t ever get caught up in nonsense like this, you understand? It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d A year later, Frank would finish high school, join the Marines and go off to war. For the time being, though, in a city in flames, he could only pace and idle at home. For three days, his father wouldn\u2019t allow him beyond the porch. Frank Matthews has lived in his home on Douglas Street since he was born. The house was purchased by his grandfather in 1919. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) \u2018Hell on Earth\u2019 The view across Douglas Street got uglier while Frank was overseas. When he came home in 1973, he was 22 and restless, freighted by the memories of what he had seen in the jungles of Vietnam. After moving to Maryland, to a place of his own, he joined the federal workforce as a mail clerk with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. He dropped in regularly to check on his parents. And from their porch, looking at Kenilworth Courts, he saw a perilous wasteland, a crimescape of guns and heroin with few ways out: by handcuffs, by gurney. In 1971, the city\u2019s chief of housing programs had publicly declared the complex \u201chell on Earth.\u201d \u201cThe guys I used to know over there,\u201d Frank says, \u201cthey just got older and crazier.\u201d In the 1970s, black Washingtonians, then numbering 7 in 10 residents, enjoyed a new sense of self-determination. Empowered by Congress, which granted the city partial home rule, voters elected an African American mayor and a predominantly black city council. But a fault line ran beneath the buoyant mood. Fair housing laws and liberalizing racial attitudes had opened suburbia to middle-class blacks, who followed whites in abandoning cities. From 1978 to 1998, the District\u2019s population would fall by 100,000, to fewer than 600,000 people, a dire percentage of them poor. The eroding tax base, combined with official mismanagement and a staggering demand for costly social services, would eventually cripple the D.C. government. During his visits, Frank noticed Douglas Street sliding downhill. One by one, the old families left, and several of the houses, sold cheap, fell into disrepair. Some were razed, and the lots turned to grassy fields. Alone after his wife, Beatrice, died in 1975, Thomas Matthews refused to quit the neighborhood, his son says. \u201cThis was his house, period.\u201d Thomas was 72 when he died of a heart attack in 1984, and he wasn\u2019t long buried before Frank moved back in. He has lived there by himself ever since. The corner of the District he returned to was a hardscrabble patch of an ailing city tumbling toward the brink of bankruptcy. The lucrative crack trade and the feverish homicide rates it spawned, starting in the mid-1980s, stamped Washington as \u201cAmerica\u2019s murder capital.\u201d In the neighborhoods of Kenilworth-Parkside, gunshots and sirens pierced the nights. On Douglas Street, Kenilworth Courts was a hive of violent dopers. To the south, below the aging enclave of Eastland Gardens, police made thousands of drug arrests in the side-by-side neighborhoods of Mayfair and Paradise, comprised entirely of sprawling, privately owned apartment complexes for low-income tenants. And south of there, in the Parkside neighborhood, a small public housing building stood in a treacherous no man\u2019s land, surrounded by weed-choked empty lots and desolate streets swirling with litter. As his father had done, Frank kept a vigilant eye on his property, through the 1980s and into the \u201990s, confronting any crack slinger or pipehead who encroached. \u201cI remember the police used to come around, putting all these guys down on the ground,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019d be standing on the porch, and the cops would look at me, they\u2019d be like: \u2018How can you live here, man? Why do you stay?\u2019\u00ad \u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019d be like: \u2018Why would I leave? It\u2019s my home.\u2019\u00ad \u201d \u2018The people were nice\u2019 Delories Williams was 10\u00a0miles from Douglas Street in 1997, sharing a $475-a-month apartment with her boyfriend, Bobby Riles. They worked as janitors, and three of Williams\u2019s grandchildren, the oldest in middle school, lived with them. Then one night their roof collapsed. After years on the public-housing waiting list, Williams was bumped to the top, and she and Riles got a place: four bedrooms in Kenilworth Courts for the standard public-housing rent, roughly 30\u00a0percent of their incomes. Williams, who grew up poor, had a daughter in prison then. \u201cIt was a whole lot of things got her into drugs,\u201d is pretty much all she\u2019ll say about it. \u201cI took the kids.\u201d And so there she was at age 42, a low-wage worker with three young mouths to feed. Their names were Adrian, Tyree and Marquell. Compared with the \u201cslum\u201d they had been living in, she recalls, the Kenilworth apartment felt deluxe. And \u201cby me being a friendly person, you know, the people were nice.\u201d Meanwhile, the D.C government had bottomed out. With the city facing bankruptcy, unable to pay its bills, Congress in 1995 created a financial control board to manage the municipal purse strings, empowered to veto decisions by the mayor and city council. Six years later, the board chairman, economist Alice Rivlin, declared that the city was back from the dead, its revenue adequate, its budget balanced. As D.C. officials reassumed the reins of government, she wrote in 2001, they should focus on growing the tax base by attracting 100,000 additional residents. The more money they had, the better. For this reason, and many others, gentrification took hold in the nation\u2019s capital. Delories Williams lived with her grandson Tyree Williams, age 26. She holds a sign that was tacked onto her unit advertising a zoning meeting regarding the fate of Kenilworth Courts. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Following a strategy laid out by Rivlin to entice new city dwellers, the District adopted policies favoring entertainment, restaurant and high-rise apartment and condo development in the downtown area. At the same time, it helped immensely that the local job market stayed relatively strong through the post-2007 recession. The results were remarkable. In the 2000s, for the first time since World War II, the District\u2019s population grew, topping 600,000, an increase of 30,000 people. It has since gone up again, by 70,000, amid a forest of construction cranes near the city\u2019s core. About 40\u00a0percent of newcomers in the late 2000s settled in the Shaw, Dupont Circle, Penn Quarter and Chinatown areas, according to a study in the Journal of Urban Affairs. As a consequence, though, many longtime residents of modest means are anxious about rising rents and escalating property values that lead to heftier tax bills. There is cultural disruption, too, as newcomers of all races, but largely affluent whites, settle in communities where deeply rooted neighbors have lived in rhythm for years, relying on one another when times are hard. After 60 years in the majority, blacks now account for 49 percent of the D.C. population. Among those who tipped the balance were Kyra Szanto and her husband. Szanto was studying at Hotelschool The Hague in 2000 when she traveled to Washington as a Ritz-Carlton intern. She chose to stay, working as a purchasing director at the Mandarin Oriental, where she met Eddie Laguerre, an IT specialist. \u201cI have never lived outside the city, never once,\u201d says Szanto, who moved several times in her early years in the District. It was a point of pride for her to alight in decidedly unhot neighborhoods before other young professionals discovered them. Kyra Szanto attends a planning meeting regarding the fate of the Kenilworth Courts housing project. The project sits directly behind her home. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) She and Laguerre, now parents of a 4-year-old girl, were renters until 2012, when Szanto was pregnant and the two started shopping for a house. \u201cOh, my God, she makes a spreadsheet for everything,\u201d her husband says. \u201cLiterally, it had crime statistics, neighborhoods, prices, schools in the area, park space \u2014 I mean, there were flow charts, PowerPoint presentations.\u201d One place stood out: a small three-bedroom with a big back yard, built in 1915 and handed down through generations of the original owner\u2019s family, then fully remodeled in 2011 after a speculator bought it. The couple would pay $230,000 to live in the shadow of public housing, but so what? Szanto never shied from an authentic urban experience. \u201cWe are the reason gentrification happens,\u201d she says with mixed emotions. \u201cWe are the poster children of gentrification.\u201d Newly ensconced on Douglas Street, they met Delories Williams (Miss D, as she\u2019s known), whose Kenilworth Courts apartment is steps from their front door. Chatting over the black iron fence at the border of their separate worlds, Szanto and Williams, the neighborhood\u2019s future and its past, got to be friends. \u201cWe bonded,\u201d says Williams. \u201cYou can feel the love coming from her.\u201d Delories was a widow by then, having married Bobby Riles in 2009, two months before he died of stomach cancer. Of the grandkids she had parented, only Tyree Williams still lived with her as an adult, because he had little choice. On an autumn night in 2003, when Tyree was 13, he was riding in a car in a neighborhood that he had been warned to stay out of. When gunfire went off, a bullet caught him in the spine, paralyzing him below the waist. And his grandmother became his nurse. Delories Williams with her grandson Tyree Williams, 26. Tyree was badly injured in a shooting when he was 13. Delories lives in a multi-room apartment at Kenilworth Courts and fears that she will have to relocate when the area's redevelopment begins. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) Through the generations In 2016, the view of Douglas Street from Frank Matthews\u2019s front porch isn\u2019t much different than it was 20\u00a0years ago \u2014 not yet. But lately, when he looks out a rear window, south toward Kenilworth Avenue, he takes in a landscape undergoing rebirth. Where once there were loiterers and felons, he sees moms pushing strollers; he sees joggers and bicyclists; he sees millennials in officewear hurrying to the Deanwood Metro. He knows change is headed his way, again, spreading outward along H Street and Benning Road from downtown, gentrification\u2019s ground zero. At the bottom of Kenilworth-Parkside, the once-forlorn Parkside neighborhood is a model of mixed-income redevelopment, filled with moderate-rent apartments and market-priced townhomes. In Mayfair and Paradise, the subsidized housing complexes have been overhauled and rebranded. And in Eastland Gardens, Siraaj Hasan, 38, typifies a new generation of homeowners in his neighborhood. He\u2019s a cybersecurity consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton, married to the D.C. government\u2019s acting director of health-care reform. \u201cThe older people are passing on and their houses are being sold or their children or grandchildren are moving in,\u201d Hasan says. \u201cMy best friend around the corner is chief of staff for one of the council members. There\u2019s an IT professional across the street. There\u2019s an Asian couple. There are several white families.\u201d Adrianne Todman, director of the D.C. Housing Authority, says she knows what\u2019s happening in Kenilworth-Parkside. That\u2019s why the authority and two developers intend to demolish the 290 apartments of Kenilworth Courts and build a 530-unit mixed-income complex. In her office downtown, with a map spread before her, Todman, who is African American, circles the five neighborhoods with a finger. \u201cThis entire footprint is going to be different in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cYears from now, the affordable housing we build today might be the only affordable housing that\u2019s there.\u201d As for the market-priced townhomes included in the redevelopment, the revenue from those, and from the moderate-rent apartments, will help pay for the upkeep of the 290 replacement public-housing units, Todman says. So late next year, as when Matthews was a boy, earth-movers will roll into Kenilworth. Kyra Szanto runs her own business now, decluttering and organizing her clients\u2019 homes and offices, and Laguerre works for a defense contractor. The two were already settled on Douglas Street when they heard about the plan for Kenilworth Courts. By then, they had hosted barbecues for the neighbors, befriending Williams and others (Miss Kim, Miss Mildred) from the blockhouse abutting their property. \u201cThere\u2019s a happy dance involved from an equity standpoint,\u201d Szanto says of the project. \u201cAnd that was followed by: What about Miss D? What about Miss Mildred?\u201d These days, when the gentrifiers and the tenants chat over the fence, no one mentions the future. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched the subject,\u201d says Szanto, frowning. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t even know how to touch it. Because . . . how?\u201d Williams, who hurt her back in a car crash and survives on disability payments, says she harbors no resentment toward the couple next door. Yet she\u2019s distraught over the looming break up of her community. \u201cWith Miss Mildred, I rely on her clothesline, because my dryer\u2019s broke,\u201d she says. \u201cMe being a missionary at my church, I get a whole lot of food, and I\u2019ll put it out around the neighborhood. . . . Or Miss Kim, she has that car, she\u2019ll take me to the doctor\u2019s.\u201d One morning last month, Williams woke up depressed, so Kim Wallace suggested that they go for a drive, to take her mind off things. Hours later, when Williams returned to her apartment, she found Tyree, 26, slumped in his wheelchair, dead from what a police detective told her was an apparent drug overdose. Sweeping out her grandson\u2019s bedroom the next day, she says in a tired voice: \u201cThese are the things that happen. He\u2019s a product of Kenilworth, you know.\u201d And Frank Matthews: There\u2019s a lilt in his voice as he strolls the length of Douglas Street, pointing to this lot and that lot, sharing tales of neighbors long gone. By the time he retired last year from the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 a third-generation career civil servant \u2014 he was a budget analyst with a bachelor\u2019s degree and a salary in the low six figures. Now he speaks of better days for his block. Back home, upbeat, he climbs the steps to the porch. In granddaddy\u2019s house, settled on its century-old cinder-block foundation, dust from ancient coal still lines the basement bins. But solar panels cover the roof now, the vinyl siding is pale green, and there\u2019s a 20-foot motorboat in the side yard. He checks his mail and heads inside. Letters from speculators \u201cgo in the trash,\u201d he says. And those phone calls and visits: \u201cThey\u2019ll all be like, \u2018Oh, Mr. Matthews, we\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with you!\u2019 And this and that.\u201d He smiles. \u201cNo, sir. Not now, not ever. The place ain\u2019t for sale.\u201d Frank Matthews has lived in his home on Douglas Street since he was born. The house was bought by his grandfather in 1919. (Michael S.

Early morning commuters at the Irvine Transportation Center walk down the stairway from an elevated pedestrian bridge, bundled with jackets and shielded from the rain, on Nov. 21, 2016. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Adam Elmahrek A cold pressure system is expected to bring some rain and possible thunderstorms throughout Southern California beginning Saturday afternoon and continuing into Sunday, forecasters said. Showers are expected over much of the Los Angeles region, with some areas getting up to an inch over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service . Temperatures are also expected to dip into the low to mid-60s along the coast and possibly into the 50s in the valleys, said Bonnie Bartling, a weather specialist with the NWS in Oxnard. Snow levels could to drop to about 4,500 feet in mountain areas. No significant flooding is anticipated, but the weather will be severe enough to cause hazardous driving conditions, particularly along the 5 Freeway near the Kern County line, Bartling said. Gusty winds, rain and snow could make for a dangerous drive home at the end of the Thanksgiving Day weekend, she said. The storm system is expected to continue moving inland on Sunday, Bartling said. Rain in the Los Angeles area is expected to clear up by Sunday night.

Investigators have questioned the shooter but have not arrested him, Reno police Lt. Sean Garlock said. Officers were looking at road rage as a potential cause of the confrontation that happened about 6 p.m. Thursday in the parking lot near a freeway exit, he said. Police believe the 33-year-old man killed at the scene may have been armed with a stick or a bat and hit the shooter's car before the weapon was fired, Garlock said. The shooting did not appear to be related to shopping, authorities said, and the store was open Friday. Officers were investigating whether the argument started in the parking lot or ended there after being sparked somewhere else. The vehicles and gun have been recovered. Nevada law does not require a concealed-weapons permit for guns kept inside a vehicle, Garlock said. The names of the man who died and the shooter were not immediately released. 0 Shares ",

Shasta County Sheriff's Office Sherri Papini, a mother of two, was reported\u00a0missing from Northern California in early November. Sherri Papini, a mother of two, was reported\u00a0missing from Northern California in early November. (Shasta County Sheriff's Office) Esmeralda Bermudez Contact Reporter Sherri Papini, the Northern California mother missing for three weeks, was \u201cvery emotional\u201d after being released by her captors on Thanksgiving morning, said Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko. Papini, 34, was found bound by restraints along Interstate 5 in Yolo County. Officials were called about 4:30 a.m.\u00a0after Papini was able to flag\u00a0down a motorist. The mother of two was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and reunited with her husband, Keith. Speaking on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d\u00a0Bosenko said detectives are hoping to get more information from her soon as part of the effort to find her kidnappers. \"Obviously she was emotional and quite upset, but elated to be freed, and so we were able to get some information from her,\" he added. \"Then in the days following this, we will be following up with her.\" Officials said they\u00a0were searching for two women in connection with the abduction. They were last seen driving a dark SUV and were\u00a0believed to be armed with a handgun. \u201cThis investigation is far from over,\u201d Bosenko said. Officials said they were\u00a0not aware of a motive for the kidnapping\u00a0and did not provide details on Papini\u2019s injuries or whereabouts. Bosenko also said it was not clear if Papini knew her abductors. The Redding resident disappeared\u00a0Nov. 2 while out for a jog in the small town of Mountain Gate in Shasta County. Her husband\u00a0reported her missing after he came home from work and found that she hadn't picked up their children from daycare. Her cellphone and headphones were found near where she had last been seen, about a mile from her home, investigators said. Her disappearance made national news, and the community launched an aggressive manhunt to find her. They shared her story on social media and launched volunteer searches. A private group working with Papini's family released a video Wednesday offering $100,000 to anyone with information leading to her safe return, according to NBC affiliate KNVN. Bosenko said police had received more than 400 tips in the case, but Papini\u2019s release was not a result of the reward money. \u201cIt shows what a community can do when it works together to get the word out,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

At a Kremlin ceremony where Seagal signed his new passport in front of Putin, the Russian leader said: \"I want to congratulate you and express the hope that this is another, albeit small, gesture and it might be a sign of the gradual normalization of relations between our countries.\" Russia's President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with actor Steven Seagal during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on Nov. 25, 2016. SPUTNIK / Reuters When Putin then asked how he was doing, the actor replied that \"everything is good. We will talk later. For now just honored to be here.\" Putin, a fan of the kind of martial arts that Seagal often practices in his Hollywood action movies, signed an order at the start of this month to grant Russian citizenship to Seagal. At the time, a Kremlin spokesman cited Seagal's \"warm feelings towards Russia\" and his celebrity as the reasons for granting the gesture. For more than a decade Seagal, who according to his own website is 64, has been a regular visitor to Russia. His movies, including such titles as \"Under Siege\" and \"Sniper: Special Ops,\" are popular with Russian audiences. Related: Trump Victory: Russians Relieved About Republican Win Over Clinton Seagal is the latest Western celebrity to have been given a Russian passport in the past few years. In 2013, Gerard Depardieu , a French actor, was given citizenship by Putin. In the past two years, relations between Russia and Washington have deteriorated to their worst level since the Cold War as a result of the armed conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, where Moscow and Washington backed opposing sides. Putin has expressed hope that, with the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president, relations will improve. Putin has praised Trump's personal qualities, and the U.S. president-elect has said he wants friendly ties. Reuters ",

Chuck Burton/AP hide caption toggle caption Chuck Burton/AP Homeland Security officers walk outside the federal courthouse in Charleston, S.C. Jury selection in the case will resume Monday. Chuck Burton/AP Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old white man charged with murdering nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church last year, is competent to stand trial on federal hate crime charges, a judge ruled Friday. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel announced his ruling after a two-day competency hearing that was closed to the public . In the court order, Gergel wrote: \"A criminal defendant is not competent to stand trial only if the Court finds 'that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect' that renders him 'unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.' The test for competency is whether the defendant 'has a sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding' and 'has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.' \" He wrote that a defendant must also understand the proceedings and have the capacity to consult with his lawyers. Gergel then concluded that Roof was competent to stand trial. Article continues after sponsorship Roof faces the death penalty . He is pleading not guilty . Roof is also facing separate murder charges brought by the state of South Carolina. South Carolina Public Radio's Alexandra Olgin reports that the competency hearing \"included testimony from the court-appointed examiner, four other witnesses and additional affidavits,\" but that the details of the hearing are not being released in order to protect Roof's right to an impartial jury and fair trial. Multiple media organizations including NPR objected to the ruling keeping the hearing closed. Gergel ordered the competency hearing earlier this month after Roof's attorneys \"brought up the issue of whether he is mentally able to help his lawyers,\" The Associated Press reported . \"It was the first time Roof's competency has been brought into question. The reason that his lawyers are worried about his mental state has been kept under seal.\" Jury selection for the trial is scheduled to continue Monday. ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Florence Henderson will be remembered as America's TV mom but she was full of surprises, too. Here are a few lesser-known items from her r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u200b. 1. She starred in a Weird Al Yankovic video In 1996, she sent up Michelle Pfeiffer's inner-school\u00a0teacher from the film\u00a0Dangerous Minds in Amish Paradise, which saw her staring down Weird Al as he promised, \"If I finish all of my chores and you finish thine, then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699.\" 2. She was a certified hypnotherapist Henderson conquered her fear of flying thanks to sessions at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute, where she met Dr. John Kappas, the man who would become her second husband and inspire her to spend two years training as a hypnotherapist in her own right, using the skill to help the families of the terminally ill. Celebs react to 'Brady Bunch' star Florence Henderson's death 3. She counseled Peter Brady According to Henderson, Christopher Knight (who played Peter Brady) asked her to provide on-air counseling for his VH1 reality show My Fair Brady, which charted the course of his whirlwind romance with\u00a0America's Next Top Model winner Adrianne Curry, whom he met in 2005 while filming VH1's celebrity roommate reality series\u00a0The Surreal Life. Henderson tried unsuccessfully to convince the couple to slow down. \"They didn't take my advice at all,\" Henderson said when asked about their meeting while promoting another project at the\u00a0 Television Critics Association 2008 summer press tour . \"And as you may have seen, they did get engaged and they did get married.\" They divorced in 2013. 4. She freaked Ozzy Osbourne out in a Super Bowl commercial We're not sure if he was more confused by waking up next to Henderson or finding the Osmonds in his kitchen during this 2003 spot for the short-lived Pepsi Twist. 5. She did two stints on NBC's 'Today,' four decades apart During her pre-Brady years in New York, Henderson appeared as the Today Girl\u00a0from 1959 to 1960, contributing fashion and lifestyle pieces.\u00a0In 1999, she returned for Later Today, a forerunner of the 9 and 10 a.m. hours, minus the wine. It didn't last a year. (Maybe she and co-hosts Jodi Applegate and Asha Blake\u00a0should have given day drinking a try.) Whatever happened to Jodi Applegate (left), anyway? \u00a0(Photo: NBC) Posted!

    "text": "Green Party's Stein files for Wisconsin recount Published               November 25, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein officially filed a request to election officials Friday to conduct a recount in the battleground state of Wisconsin. State Elections Commission Administrator Mike Haas said Stein filed the request around mid-afternoon Friday, about an hour and a half ahead of a 5 p.m. CST deadline. \u201cThe Commission is preparing to move forward with a statewide recount of votes for President of the United States,\u201d Haas said in a press release. \u201cWe have assembled an internal team to direct the recount, we have been in close consultation with our county clerk partners, and have arranged for legal representation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\u201d Stein, who earned little more than 1 percent of the national vote, formally requested a Wisconsin recount Friday afternoon, vowing to do the same in the coming days in Michigan and Pennsylvania. There is no evidence of election tampering in the states where Trump scored razor-thin victories, but Green Party spokesman George Martin insisted \"the American public needs to have it investigated to make sure our votes count.\" Wisconsin GOP Executive Director Mark Morgan issued a statement calling the recount request \"absurd and nothing more than an expensive political stunt that undermines Wisconsin's election process.\" Republican Sen. Devin LeMahieu, who chairs the Senate elections committee, said he would re-examine state law next year to ensure \"a candidate who received 1 percent of the vote cannot hold the results of an election hostage.\" Martin said Republicans' response was expected and stressed that the recount was about determining whether the system was secure, not who won or lost the fight for Wisconsin's 10 electoral college votes. During a news conference in Milwaukee, Martin said Stein's campaign would also ask for a \"reconciliation\" of voting records that would go beyond an audit, but he didn't provide details. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Stein's campaign has been raising money online to cover the costs of recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. She says she wants to make sure hackers didn't skew the results in those swing states. The campaign had raised about $5.2 million as of Friday afternoon. Late Tuesday, Stein issued a press release calling on supporters to raise $2.5 million to fund a recount effort in three states that Donald Trump won - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Wisconsin law calls for the state to perform a recount at a candidate's request as long as he or she can pay for it. The state has never performed a presidential recount. Election officials estimate the effort will cost up to $1 million. The state is working under a federal deadline of December 13 to complete the recount.

Hays, The Indianapolis Star 4:35 p.m. EST November 25, 2016 Indiana State Promo (Photo: Shane Music) INDIANAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Police are investigating after a mother told them she injected fecal matter into her teenage son's IV tube while he was receiving cancer treatment at a hospital. The mother was arrested and charged with six counts of aggravated battery and one count of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury, according to court documents. Indianapolis police were contacted by\u00a0staff at Riley Hospital for Children after a 15-year-old being treated for leukemia\u00a0developed several infections that were \"unexplained in origin,\" according to the documents. The teen received his first round of chemotherapy and went home, but was re-admitted\u00a0in early September with a fever, vomiting and diarrhea and continued to have those symptoms. He also continued to have near-daily positive blood cultures for organisms normally found in stool, but doctors could find \"no medical reason\" to explain the blood infections, according to the court documents. Mom convicted of killing son by poisoning him with salt On Nov. 17, a nurse observing video surveillance in the teen's room noticed his mother inject an unknown substance into his IV bag. She returned and again injected a substance into the bag about an hour and a half later. When interviewed by officers, the mother admitted to collecting her son's fecal matter and injecting it into his IV tube several times, beginning Nov. 13. She said she did it to get him moved from the intensive care unit to a different floor at the hospital, where the treatment would be better. Investigators later found a gift bag containing a substance consistent with fecal matter on the bathroom sink in the woman's son's room. Since his mother's removal from his bedside on Nov. 17, the teen has had no further fever. He had been in intensive care for 18 days and, due to the infections, doctors had to put his chemotherapy on hold for approximately 55 days, placing him at high risk of relapse in his leukemia, according to court documents. All seven counts faced by the mother are felonies. She is scheduled to appear for a pretrial conference on Jan. 17, according to online court records.

    "text": "A Palm Beach County Sheriff security tower watches over local traffic at Mar-a-Lago resort, where President-elect Donald Trump stayed for Thanksgiving. Security is tight in the area. (Gerardo Mora/Getty Images) By Lori Rozsa November 25 at 6:21 PM PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 On a postcard-perfect day here, tourist Kinsey Hoffman saw many things she\u2019d never seen before: mansions with 12-foot-high gold-painted eagle statues decorating the driveway; million-dollar mega-yachts lined up 10 abreast bobbing in the Intracoastal Waterway; chic boutiques on Worth Avenue, where a dog collar costs $475. But as impressive as all that was, Hoffman was really dazzled by what she saw crossing the bridge to get to the island. \u201cSeeing boats with Secret Service people and machine guns, that\u2019s kind of not what you expect when you\u2019re going to the beach. That\u2019s really something,\u201d said Hoffman, 22, who is from Louisville. \u201cWe don\u2019t see things like that back home.\u201d Hoffman was vacationing with her family in Palm Beach for the Thanksgiving weekend, the same weekend President-elect Donald Trump came to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, for the holiday. The difference between a visit by candidate Trump and President-elect Trump was evident from a mile away. Trump supporters wave to his passing motorcade on Tuesday. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) When he was just a candidate, the police presence around the estate was minimal. A local police officer was stationed at the huge front Moorish-style gate, and another one at the back entrance. This weekend, the security was far more intense. Secret Service agents on two small boats patrolled the Intracoastal behind Mar-a-Lago. They also set up a small temporary communications tower, about the size of a lifeguard station, on a dirt lot to the east of the estate. A half dozen police cars were spaced along Ocean Boulevard, the narrow two-lane road that winds past the front entrance and follows the property as it curves around the southern tip of Palm Beach. Officers flagged down any trucks that approached, sending them in a different direction away from the compound. Trump\u2019s first visit to his lavish Mar-a-Lago estate since winning the presidential election signaled a change in the way life in Palm Beach will be when the sprawling compound becomes the winter White House in two months. The biggest change appears to be traffic. \u201cTraffic was a lot worse. It took us longer to get to the beach,\u201d said 21-year-old Cooper Podosnik, a nurse who lives in West Palm Beach. He was lying in the sun on Midtown Beach, about a mile away from Mar-a-Lago. \u201cSo I don\u2019t like that part of it. But it\u2019s still kind of cool to think that the next president of the United States is right down the road from us now.\u201d Like a lot of other aspects of Trump\u2019s relationship to this wealthy town, traffic woes will have to be handled the same way Palm Beachers have handled Trump in the past: They\u2019ll just have to deal with it. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll all adapt,\u201d resident and business owner Catherine Louis said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much else we can do at this point. But this time it feels a little different. When George W. Bush was elected, people in town were celebrating. When President Obama was first elected, a gloomy pall settled over Palm Beach. This time, nobody wants to outright celebrate, but I\u2019m sure half the island is thrilled.\u201d Louis and her husband own Bibi\u2019s Boutique, a shop for pet accessories on Worth Avenue. She still carries two popular stuffed toys left over from the campaign \u2014 one a figure of Trump, the other of Hillary Clinton. A motorcade carrying the president-elect and his family makes its way toward Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \u201cPeople would come in and buy one of each,\u201d Louis said. \u201cI always wondered if one was meant to be a keepsake and the other one a chew toy.\u201d Old-money Palm Beach may have never truly embraced Trump, but he never let their disapproval slow him down. Trump has expected the town to deal with him, on his terms, since he first bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985. Trump\u2019s brash style, coupled with his ostentatious taste, rubbed the old-money social set in Palm Beach the wrong way from the start. His flurry of lawsuits, on issues from the local airport to the size of his flagpole, have alienated even those who gave the billionaire developer the benefit of the doubt at first. Trump succeeded in turning the aging 1927 compound, built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, into a private club and resort, overcoming town ordinances and social pressure. He spruced up the property inside and out, transforming Mar-a-Lago from a hulking historic artifact into a fashionable resort that caters to the ultra-wealthy (memberships at Mar-a-Lago cost $100,000, plus fees of $13,000 a year). After much resistance, the town of Palm Beach has learned to love Mar-a-Lago, if not necessarily the man who owns it. The resort is the go-to spot for a slate of prestigious charity balls every year, rivaling the old-guard Breakers Resort and Flagler Museum as a high-end hot spot to hold a ball. Celebrities including Elton John, James Taylor and Tony Bennett have appeared there. Rock star Rod Stewart, Trump\u2019s Palm Beach neighbor, has also been a guest. Trump brought glitz and glam to the staid island that had been more accustomed to a low-key patrician kind of wealth. President John F. Kennedy and his extended family wintered at the Kennedy estate on the northern end of the island. The Kennedys attended services at St. Edward\u2019s Catholic Church when they\u2019re in town, and frequently ate lunch across the street at Green\u2019s Pharmacy. Trump is not seen much around the island outside of Mar-a-Lago, residents say. \u201cHe has everything he needs right there at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d one Palm Beach resident said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to come into town.\u201d Robin Bernstein, a founding member of Mar-a-Lago and now a Trump elector for Florida, said members see him all the time and they\u2019re happy he came back for Thanksgiving. \u201cIf there is a love-hate relationship with Donald Trump, I\u2019m in the love category,\u201d Bernstein said. Bernstein, who worked in the Commerce Department under President Jimmy Carter, has known Trump for nearly 30 years. She credits him with allowing a diverse membership to Mar-a-Lago without putting up some of the subtle racial and religious barriers other clubs on the island were accused of doing. Trump may not make it out into public when he\u2019s in Palm Beach, but he is a frequent presence at his club. \u201cHe was always here, talking with us, eating dinner here, he lives here,\u201d said Bernstein, who saw Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad they came down for Thanksgiving. He was happy, relaxed, taking pictures with people. We missed him during the 18 months of the campaign. We\u2019re glad to have our Donald back on Palm Beach.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

This is good news for the likes of Amazon.com, although traditional store chains such as Target and Walmart are fighting back with their own web offerings. Walmart, for instance, has unveiled a new mobile app and tripled the number of goods available from its e-commerce site. 137 million people expected to shop Thanksgiving weekend E-commerce was off to a strong start, with Thanksgiving Day online shopping at $1.93 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insight, up 11.5 percent from last year. Mobile purchases, using phones and tablets, accounted for 57 percent of the online total.\u00a0 For the entire November-December holiday season, Forrester Research forecasts that online sales will exceed the $100 billion mark, surging 17 percent to $112 billion.\u00a0 On Friday, Macy\u2019s website was so jammed that shoppers reportedly had to wait as long as several minutes to connect -- an eternity in Internet time for some consumers. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that \u201chigh volume\u201d on Macys.com \u201chas slowed traffic\u201d and \u201cwe are working quickly to alleviate the delay issue.\u201d Macy\u2019s Black Friday deals will remain available online through midnight on Saturday, the spokesperson said. For more tips on budgeting and spending for the festive season, see our annual\u00a0 Holiday Financial Guide How the holiday sales, whether in physical or digital outlets, translates to retailers\u2019 bottom lines remains to be seen. Rampant discounting is more intense this year. A research note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch pointed out that \u201cthe consumer remains price-conscious.\u201d\u00a0 As shoppers go mobile for Black Friday weekend, experts warn of cybertheft Even Apple is rampantly discounting, with shoppers getting a $50 gift card to buy an iPhone and $25 for an Apple Watch. That said, people still clogged physical stores. Kohl\u2019s department stores reported record Thanksgiving sales, a bright spot for the department store chain, which like others has seen a dip in same-store sales, as online retail has claimed more of the consumer\u2019s dollar. Brian Motzko is making his usual trip to the Mall of America in Minnesota early Friday while visiting relatives for Thanksgiving. The Cedar Falls, Iowa resident says he\u2019s doing all his Christmas shopping on Black Friday, buying gifts for himself, his wife and family \u201cuntil my card blows up.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019ve got two teenage girls. It\u2019s whatever.\u201d Motzko says he scored 70 percent off cookware at Williams-Sonoma and was on the hunt for a Bluetooth speaker. He said the nation\u2019s largest shopping center seemed less packed than in years past. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under the control of the new administration, the office could slow President Obama\u2019s latest regulatory initiatives by repeatedly sending them back for additional work. \u201cIt has been a brake on agency regulation throughout its lifetime,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert on environmental regulation. \u201cSome presidents have used it as more of a brake than others.\u201d More Reporting on Climate Change Much remains to be learned about the president-elect\u2019s environmental policy goals, and some of his views appear to have shifted. Mr. Trump, who has claimed that global warming is a hoax, said this week in an interview with The New York Times that he now saw \u201csome connectivity\u201d between humans and climate change, and that he would \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d about whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as he threatened to do during the campaign. Yet at the same time, some key positions on his transition team are occupied by people with a long history of rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. Other than climate change, there are numerous environmental issues that he has never talked about and that he might be content to leave untouched. And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or by his advisers. Two people considered to be in the running to head the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an energy lobbyist, and Robert E. Grady, a venture capitalist \u2014 also have experience in the complex machinations of the federal government. \u201cEvery new administration comes in with an overestimation of what it can accomplish and how quickly it can accomplish it,\u201d said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, a Washington law firm. If Mr. Trump does decide to withdraw from the Paris agreement, he will find it difficult: The accord went into force this month. He would also encounter tremendous obstacles were he to try to dismantle the E.P.A., another campaign threat.

The United States has only informally committed to participate in the program, and the new administration could refuse to make that commitment legally binding.

Henderson, who went from Broadway star to television icon when she became Carol Brady on \"The Brady Bunch,\" has died at age 82. Florence Henderson arrives at a gala in Los Angeles on Oct. 29, 2014. Henderson, who went from Broadway star to television icon when she became Carol Brady on \"The Brady Bunch,\" has died at age 82. (Jordan Strauss / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Florence Henderson, who went from Broadway star to become one of America's most beloved television moms in \"The Brady Bunch,\" has died, her manager and her publicist said. She was 82. Henderson died Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, after being hospitalized the day before, said her publicist, David Brokaw. Henderson had suffered heart failure, her manager Kayla Pressman said in a statement. Family and friends had surrounded Henderson's hospital bedside, Pressman said. On the surface, \"The Brady Bunch\" with Henderson as its ever-cheerful matriarch Carol Brady, resembled just another TV sitcom about a family living in suburban America and getting into a different wacky situation each week. But well after it ended its initial run, in 1974, the show resonated with audiences, and it returned to television in various forms again and again, including \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" in 1977, \"The Brady Brides\" in 1981 and \"The Bradys\" in 1990. It was also seen endlessly in reruns. \"It represents what people always wanted: a loving family. It's such a gentle, innocent, sweet show, and I guess it proved there's always an audience for that,\" Henderson said in 1999. Indianapolis 500 next weekend. Henderson is best known for her role on \"The Brady Bunch.\" She's also a native of the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. As race grand marshal she will greet drivers and dignitaries... Actress Florence Henderson will be the grand marshal for the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 next weekend. Henderson is best known for her role on \"The Brady Bunch.\" She's also a native of the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. As race grand marshal she will greet drivers and dignitaries... (Tribune news services) Premiering in 1969, it also was among the first shows to introduce to television the blended family. As its theme song reminded viewers each week, Henderson's Carol was a single mother raising three daughters when she met her TV husband, Robert Reed 's Mike Brady, a single father who was raising three boys. The eight of them became \"The Brady Bunch,\" with a quirky housekeeper, played by Ann B. Davis, thrown into the mix. Mourners flooded social media with memories of Henderson. Both her Brady co-star Maureen McCormick and \"Dancing With the Stars\" host Tom Bergeron posted their thoughts on Twitter, according to City News Service. Her last public appearance was at the Monday, Nov. 21 \"Dancing With The Stars\" taping where she was in the audience to support McCormick, who competed this season. The blonde, ever-smiling Henderson was already a Broadway star when the show began, having originated the title role in the musical \"Fanny.\" But after \"The Brady Bunch,\" she would always be known to fans as Carol Brady. \"We had to have security guards with us. Fans were hanging on our doors. We couldn't go out by ourselves. We were like the Beatles!\" she said of the attention the show brought the cast. Like the Beatles, there was even a Saturday morning cartoon version called \"Brady Kids,\" although Henderson was not in that show. She and Reed did return, however, for \"The Brady Bunch Hour, \"The Brady Brides\" and \"The Bradys.\" So did most of the original cast. Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2016. She was also back again in 1995 when a new cast was assembled for \"The Brady Bunch Movie,\" a playful spoof of the original show. This time she was Grandma Brady opposite Shelly Long's Carol. Numerous memoirs also kept interest in the show alive, as cast members revealed they were more than just siblings off camera. Barry Williams , who played eldest son Greg Brady, would confess to having a crush on his TV stepmom. Henderson, in her own book, denied having any relationship with Williams, but did acknowledge a fling with former New York City mayor John Lindsay. Henderson was a 19-year-old drama student in New York when she landed a one-line role in the play \"Wish You Were Here.\" Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were so impressed they made her the female lead in a 1952 road tour of \"Oklahoma!\" When the show returned to Broadway for a revival in 1954, she continued in the role and won rave reviews. \"She is the real thing,\" wrote Walter Kerr of the New York Herald Tribune. To broaden her career, Henderson took acting, dancing, singing and guitar lessons, even studying French and Italian. She went on to play Maria in a road production of \"The Sound of Music,\" was Nellie Forbush in a revival of \"South Pacific\" and was back on Broadway with Jose Ferrer in \"The Girl Who Came to Supper\" in 1963. She made her movie debut in 1970 in \"Song of Norway,\" based on the 1944 operetta with music by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Her career nearly came to an end in 1965 when she suddenly lost her hearing while appearing in \"The King and I\" in Los Angeles, and was diagnosed with a condition linked to heredity. \"Corrective surgery in both ears restored my hearing,\" she said in 2007. As her TV career blossomed with \"The Brady Bunch,\" Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host \"The Tonight Show\" for the vacationing Johnny Carson. For eight years she also commuted to Nashville to conduct a cooking and talk series, \"Country Kitchen,\" on The Nashville Network. The show resulted in a book, \"Florence Henderson's Short Cut Cooking.\" After \"The Brady Bunch\" ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including \"Hart to Hart,\" ''Fantasy Island\" and \"The Love Boat.\" In later years she also made guest appearances on such shows as \"Roseanne, \"Ally McBeal\" and \"The King of Queens.\" The Los Angeles Times reports that she also became a commercial spokeswoman and co-produced \"Country Kitchen,\" a Nashville Network series. Florence Agnes Henderson was born Feb. 14, 1934, in the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. She was the 10th child of a tobacco sharecropper of Irish descent. In grade school, she joined the choir at a Catholic church in Rockport, Ind. After high school she moved to New York, where she enrolled in a two-year program at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, her studies financed by a theatrical couple who had been impressed by her singing when they saw her perform in high school. She dropped out of the program after one year, however, to take the role in \"Wish You Were There.\" Henderson married theater executive Ira Bernstein and the couple had four children before the union ended in divorce after 29 years. Her second husband, John Kappas, died in 2002. Pressman said she is survived by her children; Barbara, Joseph, Robert and Lizzie, their respective spouses, and five grandchildren. Associated Press ",

(Photo: Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports) 5432 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE AUSTIN, Texas - \u00a0Charlie Strong went to the corner of the stadium to sing The Eyes of Texas\u00a0with his team for what was most likely the final time. Texas running back D\u2019Onta Foreman knelt in the end zone, tears streaming down his face. His brother, Armanti, sprinted off the field rather than rather than get caught in a public show of emotion. All of it signaled the likely end of Strong\u2019s coaching tenure at Texas, a three-year rut of losing capped by a dismal 31-9 loss to TCU on Friday night. The Longhorns took the field amid swirling reports Strong would be fired at the end of the week. Strong and school administrators had said he\u2019d been promised an evaluation after the final game, but a 16-21 overall record for the only Texas coach in program history with three consecutive losings seasons may be all anyone needs to know. Texas will miss a bowl game for the second straight season. Strong said he\u2019ll likely meet with Texas President Greg Fenves and athletic director Mike Perrin on Saturday and he\u2019ll plead his case for more time. He has two years left on a guaranteed contract that pays him more than $5 million per year. \u201cI said the third year we\u2019ll make progress, the fourth year will be our year,\u201d Strong said. \u201cI was told when I came in three years ago to build a program. The wins and losses don\u2019t add up, but it\u2019s more than that \u2026 (It\u2019s) taking the program in the right direction.\u201d Fenves\u2019 office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday night. Texas\u2019 somber finish was a long fall from the season-opening win over Notre Dame when Strong\u2019s players tossed him in the air in celebration. \u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed to have him,\u201d freshman quarterback Shane Buechele said. \u201cNo one wants him to leave. Everybody wants him to stay.\u201d But Strong\u2019s program has moved backward in the Big 12, and Friday\u2019s loss was the third in a row to TCU. Horned Frogs quarterback Kenny Hill did the damage this time, running for two touchdowns before TCU put the game away with two fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hill scored with a 4-yard run that capped the Horned Frogs\u2019 first drive. He scored again in the third quarter on a 41-yard scamper that saw him break away from a pass rush and dart along the right sideline to the end zone for a 17-9 lead. Even after Hill left the game with an injury, TCU (6-5, 4-4 Big 12) blew it open in the fourth quarter when Trevorris Johnson capped a 97-yard touchdown drive with a 5-yard TD and Darius Anderson ran 70-yards for a score. TCU coach Gary Patterson said he ignored the emotions that were bubbling on the Texas sideline. \u201cI didn\u2019t worry about Texas. I had enough problems \u2026 We\u2019re just glad to win,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWe got bowl eligible and not anything really good has happened for these guys this year.\u201d D\u2019Onta Foreman rushed for 165 yards for Texas (5-7, 3-6) and passed 2,000 yards on the season. \u201cI cried because it\u2019s emotional to put everything on the line. I gave my all every game, every practice. To come up short in a game like this is very emotional,\u201d Foreman said. THE TAKEAWAY TCU: The Horned Frogs became bowl eligible behind a defensive effort that gave up big yards to Foreman but didn\u2019t break when it mattered. By keeping him out of the end zone and forcing early field goals, TCU never let the Longhorns grab a lead. TCU also dialed up steady pressure on Texas freshman quarterback Shane Buechele with four sacks. Texas:\u00a0Longhorns players had rallied behind their coach this week , with several giving tearful pleas for him to return next season. And the defense played arguably its best game of the year. Strong had hoped a win and a bowl trip would earn him another year, then had to watch as the game turned into a blowout. \u201cEvery year, it turned into being all about me. It never should have been all about me. The players should have been given a chance to enjoy it,\u201d Strong said. D\u2019ONTA\u2019S RUN Foreman is a junior and said he has to decide if he will turn pro after this season. His 2,028 yards this season rank second only to Ricky Williams\u2019 2,124 at Texas in 1998, the year Williams won the Heisman Trophy. Foreman also has a school record 13 consecutive 100-yard games dating to last season. UP NEXT TCU: The Horned Frogs host Kansas State to end the regular season Texas: The Longhorns season is over.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Don McGahn, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for White House counsel is a rock star\u00a0\u2014 and not just in the field of campaign finance law. OK, star might be overstating a tad, but the man picked to be the administration's legal eagle also moonlights as the lead guitarist for Scott's New Band, covering rock hits primarily from the 1980's and 90s. As White House counsel, one of McGahn top tasks will be sorting out any possible conflicts of interest between Trump the president and Trump the businessman \u2014 no easy feat, but McGahn does know a thing or two about finding harmony and striking the right chord. The owner of more than 30 guitars, McGahn has played for more than 20 years and studied at the Berkeley\u00a0College of Music in Boston, according to his\u00a0bio on the band's website , which describes him as \"one of the premier guitarists of the Mid-Atlantic region.\" \"Over 20 years of strumming, and a true appreciation of his craft, have honed Don\u2019s skills as sharp as a samurai\u2019s sword,\" the site says, adding that he has also written original music. Here's a clip of Scott's New Band performing Nena's indispensable 1980s classic, 99 Red Balloons (McGahn can be seen on stage right in a t-shirt and cap): There will be no conflict of interest for McGahn between his responsibilities as White Houe counsel and lead-guitarist for Scott's New Band. The group announced in August that it would be making its last performance on Dec. 10, 2016. \"We\u2019ve been at this for quite a long time. SNB has been around 10 years and is hardly\u00a0'New' anymore; it\u2019s probably closer to 'gently used,'\" lead vocalist Scotty Pip wrote in a\u00a0statement. \"So we figured it was time to call it a day, and get on with something else. That plan may look different for each of us, and each plan may cause us all to cross paths musically again at some point, but for now, it\u2019s time to wander a bit, rest a lot, and be glad it happened.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g0JVd0 Most Popular ",

On Friday, President-elect Trump announced McGahn would be his White House counsel. Drew Angerer/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Donald McGahn, a longtime Washington lawyer who once led the Federal Election Commission, to be his White House counsel, his transition team announced Friday. \"Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law,\" Trump said in a statement, referring to the lawyer who served as both his campaign and transition attorney. \"He will play a critical role in our administration, and I am grateful that he is willing to serve our country at such a high-level capacity.\" A Washington Transition For Trump, And For The Rest Of Us McGahn said he was \"honored to continue advising President-elect Trump in the Trump-Pence Administration. President-elect Trump is a bold leader committed to draining the swamp in Washington and restoring economic prosperity and security. I look forward to serving the American public in this role.\" McGahn is a partner at the Jones Day law firm in Washington, where he has long represented candidates and elected officials. Unlike many people in Trump's inner circle, McGahn has deep roots in the nation's capital. He served as the top lawyer for the National Republican Congressional Committee and led the FEC, where he helped usher in looser regulations for campaign spending. McGahn's law firm biography reports he focused on building \"due process\" into elections enforcement over five years at the FEC. But his critics argue that mostly made it harder to bring enforcement actions against candidates or political action committees that failed to follow the rules. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Chooses Betsy DeVos For Education Secretary Like his most famous client, the president-elect, McGahn embraces the role of disrupter, telling the Center for Public Integrity that he served on the FEC \"to change how the place thinks.\" The Wall Street Journal concluded that McGahn \"marches to his own tune,\" highlighting his off-hours work as lead guitarist for a band that plays Guns N' Roses cover songs and other music. Trump has long been familiar with the McGahn family. McGahn's uncle, Patrick, another lawyer, helped the Trump family navigate real estate and political challenges for Trump's properties in Atlantic City, N.J. McGahn's wife is a staffer on the House Financial Services Committee and a onetime spokeswoman for former Rep. Tom Delay, R-Texas. McGahn advised DeLay on a number of ethics controversies. ",

Five men arrested this week in two French cities were planning a terror attack in France as early as next week and were receiving their orders from an Islamic State group member based in Iraq or Syria, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) 0 Shares Email Four long-time friends in their 30s, living in the same French city and communicating through a closed phone line, were planning a terror attack in France as early as next week on orders from an Islamic State group member in Iraq or Syria , Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday. The \"commando\" of four arrested on Sunday in the eastern city of Strasbourg plotted to carry out an attack on Dec. 1, but investigators have not yet determined \"the specific chosen target among all those considered by the group,\" Molins said. A fifth suspect was arrested in the southern city of Marseille at the same time as the Strasbourg suspects. Molins told reporters that suspect was not in direct touch with the other four, but was \"given guidance remotely\" from the same IS member. The prosecutor didn't name any targets, but security was tightened this week at the Paris headquarters of France's criminal investigations police, reportedly among the locations studied. French President Francois Hollande said a \"large-scale attack\" was thwarted. The night they were arrested, two of the Strasbourg group had just downloaded the Periscope application, which allows people to stream live on Internet with a cell phone. The app activity suggests they were preparing an \"imminent\" attack, Molins said. The four Strasbourg suspects also were in possession of guns and ammunition, he said. Among the weapons seized during home searches were two handguns, two automatic rifles, several cartridge clips and dozens of cartridges of different calibers. Investigators also found instructions for a money transfer, GPS coordinates and detailed explanations for obtaining more weapons on one suspect's USB stick. All five men had a \"clear will to find and to identify targets to commit an act in the very short term,\" Molins said. In addition, the five \"had common instructions to obtain weapons, instructions given by a person from the Iraqi-Syrian zone through encrypted applications popular among terrorists,\" he said. Investigators recovered a notebook that contained 12 pages of writing that referred to an armed jihad, death in martyrdom and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the Islamic State group leader, the prosecutor said. After being held in custody since Sunday, the five were moved Friday to the Paris courthouse where they were to appear before counter-terrorism investigating judges. The Paris prosecutor asked magistrates to hand the five preliminary charges of taking part in a \"terrorist criminal association\" and to jail them. Molins was speaking the day after anti-terrorism authorities took the unusual step of holding the men in custody without charge beyond the normal maximum period, relying on a recent anti-terrorism measure. The five were later placed under investigation on preliminary charges of criminal terrorist association with a view of preparing attacks, a judicial official said. Three of the Strasbourg group were also charged with acquiring, possessing and transporting arms in relation with a terrorist enterprise. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the case and asked not to be named. The four arrested in Strasbourg were two French citizens, both age 37; a 36-year-old Franco-Tunisian; and a 35-year-old Franco-Moroccan. Two of them had several criminal convictions in France, Molins said. The man arrested in Marseille was a 26-year-old Moroccan. Two of the Strasbourg suspects traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border via Cyprus in March 2015, then prosecutor said. The Marseille suspect left Morocco in 2013 and made multiple trips across Europe with fake ID documents. In 2015, the Turkish authorities prevented him from entering Turkey, he said. France remains under a state of emergency imposed after Islamic State attacks in Paris in November 2015 that killed 130 people. 0 Shares ",

The president-elect tapped Kathleen Troia \"K.T.\" McFarland, a former government official and one-time Fox News analyst, as a deputy national security adviser, a transition official told NBC News. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed Friday that McFarland's contract has been terminated on the heels of Trump offering her the position, a necessary step in order for her to serve in his administration. Trump also has asked attorney Donald McGahn to serve as his White House counsel, a top transition source confirmed. The news was first reported by Reuters. McGahn, a partner at Jones Day , is Trump's campaign lawyer and is currently advising the transition effort. Kathleen Troia 'KT' McFarland poses at her home in New York, on Mar 6, 2006. JASON DECROW / ASSOCIATED PRESS Politico has reported that McGahn, who has longstanding familial ties to the Trump organization and an \"inside the Beltway\" background as a former chairman of the FEC, may be tasked with putting distance between the president-elect and his myriad of business interests, which critics have argued could present unprecedented number of conflicts of interest and potential Constitutional crisis for the incoming administration. \"Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law,\" said President-elect Trump in a statement on Friday. \"He will play a critical role in our administration, and I am grateful that he is willing to serve our country at such a high-level capacity.\" Meanwhile, following Trump's selections of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as U.N. ambassador and billionaire businesswoman Betsy DeVos for education secretary this week, McFarland marks just the third female appointment to his administration \u2014 featuring a Cabinet that has been criticized in some circles for being disproportionately white and male. Don McGahn, general counsel for the Trump transition team, gets into an elevator in the lobby at Trump Tower in New York, on Nov.15, 2016. Drew Angerer / Getty Images The Oxford-educated McFarland, with her experience working in the Ford and Reagan administrations in national security and defense positions, also represents a break from some of the more inexperienced names which Trump has floated for some of his administration's top jobs. Ironically, McFarland was once seeking to run against the candidate who Trump just narrowly defeated in the presidential election \u2014 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In New York's U.S. Senate race in 2006, McFarland sought the GOP nomination that year to challenge Clinton's run for re-election, but fell short in the primary. Clinton would be re-elected that year in a landslide. Her selection will likely be far less controversial than Trump's choice for national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been condemned for his extreme anti-Muslim rhetoric in the past, accused of conflicts of interest because of his lobbying relationships with foreign governments and described as having an unstable temperament by some of his former colleagues.

Archaeologists in Trondheim, Norway have unearthed the church where Viking King Olaf Haraldsson was first enshrined as a saint. Experts working for the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) uncovered the stone foundations of a wooden stave church where Haraldsson was likely enshrined after he was declared a saint in the 11th century. Olaf Haraldsson, or Olaf II of Norway, is the country\u2019s patron saint. \u201cThis is a unique site in Norwegian history in terms of religion, culture and politics,\u201d said excavation director Anna Peters\u00e9n, in a press release. \u201cMuch of the Norwegian national identity has been established on the cult of sainthood surrounding St. Olaf, and it was here it all began!\u201d TINY VIKING CRUCIFIX COULD REWRITE HISTORY Haraldsson died fighting rival nobles in the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 and his body was buried in Trondheim, or Nidaros as it was then known. Local people soon reported tales of miracles attributed to the dead king, according to NIKU, and in 1031 his coffin was dug up and opened in in the presence of a bishop, revealing his well-preserved body. Related Image Expand / Contract The excavation site in Trondheim, Norway (NIKU). The dead king was declared a saint and his remains were enshrined above the high altar of St. Clement\u2019s Church, which became his first mausoleum. Olaf\u2019s coffin rested in the church for a number of years before it was moved to a larger church. The remains were eventually enshrined in Trondheim\u2019s Nidaros Cathedral. St. Clement\u2019s Church was eventually destroyed and its location remained a mystery until NIKU archaeologists unearthed the site in Trondheim, which was dated to the time of Olaf\u2019s rule. \u201cDuring its excavation, the archaeologists uncovered a small rectangular stone-built platform at the building\u2019s east end,\u201d said NIKU, in a press release. \u201cThis is probably the foundation for an altar \u2013 probably the very same altar on which St. Olaf\u2019s coffin was placed in 1031!\u201d THE REAL REASON FOR VIKING RAIDS: SHORTAGE OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN? A small well was also discovered at the site, which may have been a \u201choly well\u201d associated with the saint\u2019s remains. Other stunning Viking era discoveries have been made in Scandinavia this year. In March, for example, a 10th century Viking crucifix was unearthed in Denmark, prompting experts to reconsider the dates when Christianity arrived in the country. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "(Frank Shyong) Some also skirt ethical and legal lines, vilifying women and resorting to subterfuge as sneaky as the people they hunt. \u201cThey create chaos,\u201d said Liu Weimin, president of the Guangdong Marriage and Family Counselors Assn. With marriages, \u201cwe have to deal with the internal problem in order to solve the external one.\u201d Though most mistress hunting companies sprout up in wealthy metropolises on the coast, such as Shanghai or Shenzhen, Zhu\u2019s enterprise sits in the nondescript, third-tier southern city of Changzhou. His 12th-floor office, located in a building littered with cigarette butts, is stuffed with cubicles. Counseling accreditation plaques hang near the entrance. Zhu\u2019s staff of 23 includes psychologists, lawyers, counselors and beauticians \u2014 who make the customer more alluring. Men occasionally request his services, but the majority of clients are women who want their marriages rescued. For that, he charges $15,000 to $150,000. Zhu tailors plans for his high-roller customers and recently partnered with a law firm next door so the company can better investigate mistresses. Zhu said he succeeded in 73% of his 362 cases last year. Customers call in a panic, and conversations \u201calways end with: \u2018Money is not a problem.\u2019\u201d China\u2019s divorce rate reached 2.8 per 1,000 people last year, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than triple the rate in 2002. The shift occurred as the country\u2019s economy grew and better-educated women no longer needed to rely on a husband\u2019s finances. America\u2019s divorce rate is still more than doubles China\u2019s.\u00a0 Companies such as Zhu\u2019s cater to an affluent clientele that has much to lose financially in a divorce and little faith in lengthy court procedures. Sometimes one of Zhu\u2019s psychologists and a jilted wife directly confront the mistress. More often they resort to a \u201cpublic relations consultant\u201d \u2014\u00a0a.k.a. fake suitor \u2014 to split up the lovers. The company trains these employees on luxury brands, wine and Western food, delights they believe will entice a mistress away from a straying husband. Cases play out like a mystery novel. In one last year, Zhu and his team got a call. They researched the mistress\u2019 habits and then set up an employee with the fake identity of an affluent auctioneer. The man rented an apartment in Hong Kong, down the hall from the mistress. Zhu\u2019s stylists, in the meantime, gave the wife a new look. Behavioral specialists coached her to sound more appealing. We are fighting for justice. \u2014 Zhu Lifei He hired fake loan sharks to show up at the mistress\u2019 apartment and demand money.\u00a0The \u201cauctioneer\u201d appeared afterward with wine to ease her stress. He sent presents the cheating husband would find, so as to arouse suspicion and foment distrust between the couple. In several months, the affair was over. \u201cWe are fighting for justice,\u201d said Zhu, who has a master\u2019s in business administration and a marriage counseling certificate. In most interventions, which tend to last one to six months, Zhu\u2019s employee withdraws afterward with an excuse such as\u00a0family disapproval. In the rare instance of male clients, Zhu provides a female affairs doctor. \u201cIt feels like we have achieved something, helping to repair marriages,\u201d said the fake auctioneer, who would not provide his name out of safety concerns. Dalliances in China underwent a resurgence as the country opened up. The keeping of mistresses began to confer status on businessmen and government officials.\u00a0At least 95% of the officials detained for corruption in 2012 had mistresses, according to a study by People\u2019s University in Beijing. Some wronged spouses deliver their own form of justice. A gang of angry wives beat an accused mistress last year in the middle of a crowded street, one of several incidents that went viral on the Internet. This \u201cindicates that Chinese women are much more assertive and vocal than in the past, and that extramarital affairs are more common,\u201d said Sandy To, who studies Chinese relationships and lectures in the University of Hong Kong\u2019s sociology department. \u201cMarriage itself is becoming more fickle, with individuals more interested in pursuing their own gratification.\u201d On a balmy day this month, Zhu and his team pondered how to salvage the marriage of the Hangzhou wife whose husband barely noticed her \u201ccar accident.\u201d Psychological consultant Meng Hao suggested threatening to expose the affair to local media. (The mistress later became more aggressive, at one point slapping the wife in an encounter. So they turned to a splitting specialist whose presence demonstrated to the husband how little his lover valued him and how much she enjoyed his money. It took 13 days.) But such an approach almost always ends up punishing the mistress and not the deviant spouse. Critics point to this dynamic and accuse companies of lacking either moral principles or legal grounds.\u00a0 \u201cIt all depends how they hunt the mistresses and how they persuade them to leave,\u201d said Hailey Han, a civil attorney based in Shanghai. Companies enter illegal territory when uncovering information through apartment break-ins or other nonpublic means, she said.\u00a0 Zhu says the company does not violate anyone\u2019s privacy and employs the law firm to stay within legal bounds. He sees himself as the man who mends marriages, creating unorthodox solutions in a society that eschews public discussion of private matters. \u201cWhen I get phone calls, someone is cheating, someone is splitting,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart is tired.\u201d The phones rang beside him as he spoke, playing the same few lines of a Chinese love song.

(Alyssa Pointer & Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Christy Gutowski and Juan Perez Jr. Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Protesters attempted to stop holiday shopping along parts of Chicago's Magnificent Mile for the second consecutive year, urging a Black Friday boycott to demand civilian oversight of city law enforcement amid high-profile police shootings and continuing neighborhood gun violence. After organizing early Friday near the old Water Tower monument, as many as 200 demonstrators peacefully marched on sidewalks under a heavy police presence during an effort to block several Michigan Avenue storefronts on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Activists focused their attention along a five-block stretch just north of the Chicago River while chanting, \"No justice. No peace,\" and \"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Rahm Emanuel has got to go.\" Video: Protester, shopper face off on Michigan Avenue A protester and a passerby face off during a rally along Chicago's Magnificent Mile urging a Black Friday boycott to raise awareness of police misconduct toward minorities and other inequalities in the city's poorest neighborhoods.

See more videos The demonstration failed to gain the momentum of last year's Black Friday march, when a massive crowd of approximately 1,000 people shut down some retailers and halted traffic in the heart of the city's famed shopping district. The earlier protest came just days after the city released police dashcam video capturing the fatal October 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a white Chicago police officer. The 17-year-old was shot 16 times as he appeared \u2014 with knife in hand \u2014 to be walking away from police. Friday's protest followed three fatal Chicago police shootings in the past week, including that of 19-year-old Kajuan Raye. Police fatally shot Raye in West Englewood late Wednesday. Many demonstrators also spoke about the fatal police shooting of Joshua Beal earlier this month in the Mt. Greenwood neighborhood. Beal's mother, Tiffaney Boxley, thanked participants for their activism.

See more videos \"We have a long fight ahead of us,\" she said. This year's rally was planned by a network of groups that includes the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. Organizers said they wanted to draw attention to a range of issues, including police treatment of minorities and economic inequalities in West and South Side neighborhoods plagued by gun violence, struggling schools and poverty. But their main target was Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his new police oversight agency, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which protesters argue falls short of their call for a civilian-led council to investigate cases of alleged police misconduct. Activists carried signs that promoted their proposal for an elected police watchdog group, the Civilian Police Accountability Council, or CPAC.

(Lauren Zumbach, Samantha Bomkamp and Lisa Schencker) Demonstrators, gathering weeks after the divisive U.S. presidential election, also voiced their opposition to President-elect Donald Trump. They locked arm-in-arm, formed a human chain and tried to keep shoppers from entering the Nike, Apple and Victoria's Secret stores, while police officers formed their own competing wall of bodies to usher people through. Some minor scuffles broke out when shoppers tried to enter stores by pushing through lines of demonstrators, but the four-hour event was largely peaceful. Some onlookers even snapped pictures and carried on undeterred with their shopping.

See more videos Police reported no significant problems, and said three arrests were made for charges including trespassing and resisting arrest. There also were a few lighter moments, including one outside Saks Fifth Avenue when demonstrator Calvin Jackson chanted, \"Go home. Go eat turkey!\" at would-be shoppers. Officers could occasionally be seen laughing with demonstrators and some passersby made a point of delivering high-fives or handshakes to police at the scene. \"For some, it's about the police; some it's about immigration. It's just all the people who are not (Trump supporters), and they're afraid,\" said protester Barbara Lyons, 79, of Jewish Voice for Peace. \"It just upsets me what kind of world my grandchildren will grow up in,\" she said. Los Angeles resident Kirby Shaw, who was in town to visit his sister, decided to join the demonstration while taking in the sights along Michigan Avenue. Shaw, 23, said he understands some will not be happy with the message to boycott Black Friday, but \"for one day of the year you can not buy things and support your local retailers and help make a difference.\" Chicago Tribune's Ally Marotti contributed. cmgutowski@chicagotribune.com ",

IPhone 6S, 6 and SE buyers will get $50 gift cards, and those purchasing an iPad Pro, Air 2 or Mini 4 tablet\u00a0will receive\u00a0$100 gift cards. There are no discounts on pricing and no deals for the company's latest products, the Apple Watch Series 2 and iPhone 7. Apple is similarly not incentivizing purchases of its latest MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, instead only offering $150 gift cards for the older MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. Three gifts to avoid buying this holiday The Apple Store is, however, embracing some other Black Friday offers, matching other retailers in offering the Sonos Play 1 speaker for $149.95, a $50 savings. It is also throwing in three months of Apple Music (a $30 value) with the purchase of a Sonos Play 1 or Play 5 system. Apple's deals are available in-store and online. Target, Best Buy have Apple deals For those looking for the latest in Apple gear, your best bet is to look elsewhere. Target has the iPad Air 2 32GB for as low as $274.99, $125 cheaper than Apple's price. Target also is offering the Apple Watch Series 1 for as low as $198 for the 38mm version, $80 cheaper than at Apple. The deals are even better if you have a Target card, which will save you an additional 5 percent. Skip the lines\u2014these are the BEST online Black Friday deals For the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, a variety of carriers and retailers are offering promotions if you're willing to buy a monthly payment plan. Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are all throwing in\u00a0$250 gift cards when purchased at their stores, while many carriers have deals in place to get an iPhone 7 for free.

    "text": "Otto Enters Pacific After Devastation, 9 Dead in Costa Rica By javier cordoba, associated press SAN JOSE, Costa Rica \u0097 Nov 25, 2016, 5:45 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Workers cut a tree that fell and killed a boy outside a school in Panama City, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. Civil defense officials in Panama say the country has already seen three deaths blamed on late-season Tropical Storm Otto. (AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco) 0 Shares Email Tropical Storm Otto killed at least nine people in Costa Rica and then headed into the Pacific Ocean Friday after making landfall as the southernmost hurricane on record to hit Central America. Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis announced that nine people had been killed in the area of Bagaces and Upala, a town south of the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border. Earlier, he said at least six people were missing in the nearby town of Bijagua. Solis said as much water fell on the area in a few hours as normally falls in a month, and said some people had been trapped by rising waters. The United States sent airplanes and neighboring Panama sent planes and helicopters to aid in the search and rescue efforts in the area, where rain-swollen rivers overflowed their banks. Otto made landfall on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast on Thursday as a dangerous Category 2 storm but it faded to tropical storm force before emerging over the eastern Pacific early Friday. Authorities in Nicaragua said the hurricane had damaged houses, but so far there were no reports of casualties. Earlier, heavy rains from the storm were blamed for three deaths in Panama. Otto battered Nicaragua's Corn Islands with 3.5-meter (10-foot) waves and damaged houses, but residents were all safe in refuges, said the archipelago's mayor, Cleveland Rolando Webster. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that by Friday morning, the storm was centered about 245 miles (395 kilometers) south-southeast of El Salvador's capital, San Salvador, and had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). It was moving toward the west at 16 mph (26 kph). It was projected to keep moving westward away from Central America, further into Pacific. The Nicaraguan government earlier declared a state of emergency, but later reported there were no deaths directly related to the hurricane. About 400 homes in Nicaragua were damaged or destroyed. Solis said Otto could damage the country's important coffee and agriculture sectors. Nicaragua also feared damage to coffee crops that are almost ready for harvest. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "<p>Authorities are looking for two inmates who escaped from a California prison on Thanksgiving Eve.</p> Close CBS SF Bay Area SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Authorities asked for the public\u2019s help in tracking down a\u00a0 pair of potentially dangerous California prisoners who cut through the bars of a jail window on Thanksgiving Eve, rappelled to the ground on a bedsheet rope and escaped. Santa Clara County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Rich Glennon said four inmates got out through a second-floor window of the county\u2019s main jail late Wednesday. Two men were quickly back in cuffs -- but the other two men are on the lam.\u00a0 Glennon identified the men as Rogelio Chavez and Laron Campbell, who are facing possible life sentences if convicted of burglary, extortion, false imprisonment and other charges they were being held on.\u00a0 Authorities didn\u2019t know if they\u2019re armed, but said they should be considered dangerous.\u00a0 \u201cBased on just some of their crimes and some of their history -- yeah, I mean, they are dangerous,\u201d Det. Elbert Rivera of the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office told CBS SF Bay Area . Authorities released photos of the severed bars and the bedsheet tied to one of them, but said they didn\u2019t know what tools the inmates used or how they had gotten them. \u201cNo cutting instruments were located inside the cell or in the surrounding area,\u201d Glennon said, according to the Associated Press. Glennon said the way the bars were cut indicated the escape was planned.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact that these bars were cut the way that they were -- it wasn\u2019t something that they just thought of in a minute,\u201d he told CBS SF Bay Area. \u201cIt\u2019s something that probably took some previous planning.\u201d Authorities asked for the public\u2019s help in finding them and warned that anyone who sees them should call 911 rather than try to apprehend them. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want the community to approach these individuals, but be aware of anything suspicious,\u201d Glennon said.\u00a0 The escape was discovered by a deputy patrolling the jail\u2019s perimeter.\u00a0 \u201cHe kind of thought he saw some movement in the shadows, looked up and saw some bedding in the window,\u201d Glennon said.\u00a0 Chavez, 33, and Campbell, 26, were believed to be wearing jail clothing, consisting of an orange top over gray bottoms, when they escaped.\u00a0 Chavez has a distinctive face tattoo resembling an inky gash going through his left eye. He was booked into the Northern California jail in August.\u00a0 Campbell, who stands 6-feet-4, had been jailed there since February 2015. Glennon said deputies were being assisted by other local and federal law enforcement agencies. A\u00a0 similar escape was made from a Southern California jail in January by three men authorities later determined had planned it for weeks. They cut through the main Orange County jail\u2019s fifth-floor bars with tools smuggled in by an outsider, rappelled to the ground and escaped in a get-away car.\u00a0 They later abducted a cab driver and forced him to drive them to Northern California. The escape began to unravel when one of the men , fearful the others would kill the driver, fled to Southern California with him and surrendered. The others were captured soon after in San Francisco. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "Green party candidate Jill Stein has raised millions of dollars for a vote audit in Pennsylvania, Wisonsin and Michigan. CBS News correspondent A... That\u2019s enough, the party says, to fund audits in three states critical to Donald Trump\u2019s victory: Pennsylvania, where the president-elect won by about 68,000 votes; Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump edged out Hillary Clinton by just over 27,000 votes; and Michigan, where Mr. Trump has a slight lead but where the votes are still too close to call.\u00a0 How much of those millions will be used to fund the recount efforts?\u00a0 Filing recount petitions in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan will run up a hefty tab, the Green Party says. In Wisconsin, where the deadline to file is Friday at 5 p.m., the price tag is estimated to be $1.1 million; in Pennsylvania, the cost to recount ballots is approximately $600,000; and in Michigan, the bill will be about $500,000.\u00a0 Jill Stein recount efforts in Wisconsin: What you need to know Additional funds, she and the party say, will be used to fund legal challenges. George Martin, a member of the Wisconsin Green Party\u2019s coordinating council, said Friday Stein will submit appropriate paperwork for a recount in Wisconsin by the deadline.\u00a0 If there is extra money in the donation fund -- or if Stein\u2019s petition fails to pass muster with the election commissions in any of the states -- Martin promised that the money will be used to fund the Green party\u2019s local \u201ccampaign schools,\u201d meant to groom local candidates for public service.\u00a0 \u201cAs a national party, our commitment is to build at the local level,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat\u2019s where these dollars and excess dollars will go.\u201d On her website, however, Stein\u2019s donation page says that any extra dollars not devoted to the recount will \u201cgo toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform.\u201d As for the recounts, Martin said at a press conference that they are the first step to finding out \u201cwhether our electoral system is working,\u201d emphasizing that it\u2019s \u201cnot about the outcome -- it\u2019s about the process.\u201d\u00a0 Martin, who said there is \u201cno smoking gun\u201d about voter fraud, nevertheless pointed to forensic and computer expert testimony to say there is \u201cenough peripheral evidence to warrant that our system should be investigated.\u201d Earlier this week, a group of election lawyers and researchers also urged Clinton to ask for a recount in the three states Stein\u2019s campaign is currently looking at. The Green Party official also pointed to the discrepancy in votes for Mr. Trump, according to Wisconsin exit polls (where he received 44.3 percent of the vote share) versus the official vote count (where he earned 47.9 percent). The Wisconsin Republican party is panning the effort as \u201cabsurd and nothing more than an expensive political stunt that undermines Wisconsin\u2019s election process.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Millions in the U.S. May Be Misdiagnosed by Lauren Dunn and Linda Carroll Share Study: Your Allergy to Penicillin May Be Non-Existent 1:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161126004657if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/817768003694\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> When Maria Duggan developed a breast infection she faced a choice no new mother would want to make: take an antibiotic that she'd been told could cause a severe allergic reaction, or one that would pass through her breast milk to her baby. Like millions of Americans, Duggan, 32, had been diagnosed with a penicillin allergy as a child, but doctors believed she might have outgrown it. Still, the prospect of taking a drug that might send her into anaphylactic shock was scary. \"I knew there was going to be a risk in the decision and that risk was going to have to fall to me,\" Duggan said. After being prepared for the worst, Duggan had no reaction to the penicillin. As it turns out, she is one of many Americans who've been told they have a penicillin allergy, but may been initially misdiagnosed or have grown out of it. Most doctors aren't even aware that some 90 percent of those diagnosed with a penicillin allergy can actually tolerate the drug, according to a study presented recently at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Maria Duggan was diagnosed with a penicillin allergy as a child. When she developed an infection she faced the dilemma of taking a medication that might cause an allergic reaction, or one that might pass through her breast milk to her baby. Courtesy of Maria Duggan \"The typical situation is at a young age a child will get an infection and will get a course of penicillin and then will get a rash, or some other side effect, and get labeled as penicillin allergic,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Phillips, a professor of medicine and pharmacology and director of personalized immunology, Oates Institute of Experimental Therapeutics at Vanderbilt University. An estimated 25 to 50 million people in the U.S. who believe they are allergic may not truly be, said Phillips. A simple skin test Penicillin-related drugs are antibiotics with a long track record of safety. When people who've been labeled as allergic to penicillin need antibiotics for serious infections, \"they may get a second antibiotic that has more side effects or is less effective for the condition they need treated,\" Phillips said. Related: Drug-resistant Superbugs are a 'Fundamental Threat' The solution for many is a simple, two-step test, followed, as needed, by a low-dose oral penicillin, taken under a doctor's observation. \"The whole process takes about three hours and then we can say they're free to take penicillin in the future,\" said Phillips Hollis Heavenrich-Jones tested her son, Spencer's reaction to penicillin before he needed it. Spencer Heavenrich-Jones was diagnosed with a penicillin allergy as a baby. A later skin test show no allergic reaction. Courtesy of Hollis Heavenrich-Jones The child was diagnosed with a penicillin allergy when he was a baby, but Heavenrich-Jones wanted to be sure. \"He had his one and only ear infection and they gave him penicillin and he broke out in a sort of head-to-toe rash,\" Heavenrich-Jones said. \"It went into his chart and it's been there ever since.\" Spencer was tested and had a reaction \u2014 but it was to a control substance in the injection, not the penicillin. A second skin test and oral dose revealed no allergy, a \"huge relief\" to his mother. Lauren Dunn ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times All the same, the Mexico-closing-its-border story proved so popular after it appeared on his site that he hunted around on the web for other articles on the same theme. He found a tall tale about Mexico planning to call back its citizens from the United States if Mr. Trump won. This, too, generated huge traffic, though not quite as much as the first one, which Mr. Latsabidze described as \u201ca really great story.\u201d He insisted he has nothing against Mexicans or Muslims, whose exclusion from the United States is requested by an online petition that often appears on his websites and who are invariably presented in a negative light in the stories he posts. \u201cI am not against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw that there was interest. They are in the news.\u201d Nor, he added, is he particularly against Mrs. Clinton, though he personally prefers Mr. Trump. Photo This online petition often appears on Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites. If his pro-Clinton site had taken off, he said, he would have pressed on with that, but \u201cpeople did not engage,\u201d so he focused on serving pro-Trump supporters instead. They, he quickly realized, were a far more receptive audience \u201cbecause they are angry\u201d and eager to read outrageous tales. \u201cFor me, this is all about income, nothing more,\u201d he added. The income comes mostly from Google, which pays a few cents each time a reader sees or clicks on advertisements embedded in one of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites. His best month, which coincided with the hit bogus story about Mexico closing the border, brought in around $6,000, though monthly revenue is usually much lower. Mr. Obama, speaking in Berlin last week, assailed the spread of phony news on Facebook and other platforms, warning that \u201cif we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not\u201d and \u201cif we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.\u201d While Facebook does not directly provide Mr. Latsabidze any revenue, it plays a central role in driving traffic to his websites. He initially established several fake Facebook pages intended to steer traffic to his websites, including one supposedly set up by a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka. This woman, he acknowledged, does not really exist. \u201cShe is me,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He discovered, however, that such pages were ineffective compared with legitimate Facebook pages from real people, particularly Trump supporters, because they have so much energy and love promoting stories they like. Departed.co \u2014 named after Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s favorite movie, \u201cThe Departed,\u201d and recently redirected to usatodaycom.com \u2014 published dozens of stories daily, many of them similar to one posted on Nov. 17 with the headline, \u201cThis Is Huuge! International Arrest Warrant Issued By Putin For George Soros!\u201d The story was not true and had already been published on scores of other fake news sites around the web. Then there are the stories that have a grain of truth, along with big dollops of exaggeration and extrapolation, like \u201c Dying Hillary Says She Just Wants To Curl Up And Never Leave Her House Again After Defeat .\u201d Mrs. Clinton did say the day after her election defeat that she just wanted to curl up with a book. But she was not, as far as anyone knows, dying. Kremlin Suspicions In the prelude to the election, bogus reports about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health and highly favorable ones about Mr. Trump were promoted with gusto by Russian state-controlled news media outlets and legions of pro-Russian internet agitators. This has stirred suspicions that the Kremlin has had a hand in the fake news industry, prompting American researchers to assert in recent studies that the online blurring of the boundary between truth and falsehood is in part the result of Russian manipulation. But Mr. Latsabidze and others here say they serve only their bank balances, not Russia or anything else. He insisted that his team operated entirely on its own and that it did not want or need outside help. He said that it took him just two hours to set up a basic website and that anyone with a modicum of computer savvy could quickly start hawking news \u2014 real or fake \u2014 online. \u201cI did not invent anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has all been done before.\u201d Mr. Latsabidze, who apparently has broken no laws, said that any crackdown on fake news might work in the short term but that \u201csomething else will come along to replace it.\u201d \u201cIf they want to, they can control everything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this will stop freedom of speech.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story For now, the postelection period has been bad for business, with a sharp fall in the appetite for incendiary political news favoring Mr. Trump. Traffic to departed.co and affiliated websites has plunged in recent weeks by at least 50 percent, Mr. Latsabidze said. \u201cIf Hillary had won, it would be better for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI could write about the bad things she was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not write to make Trump win.

But he seemed reluctant to quit altogether. \u201cAre there any elections coming up in the U.K.?\u201d Mr. Latsabidze asked. He was disappointed to hear that none were scheduled soon. But, advised that France will hold a hotly contested presidential election next April featuring a Trump-like candidate in the form of Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist, he perked up. \u201cMaybe I should learn some French,\u201d he said.

The bow area of the Black Duck is seen in 350 feet of water off Oswego, N.Y. (Roger Pawlowski via AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The 144-year-old\u00a0shipwreck\u00a0of a rare sailing vessel that typically wasn't used for long voyages on the Great Lakes has been found in deep water off Lake Ontario's New York shore, according to two underwater explorers. Western New York-based explorers Jim Kennard and Roger Pawlowski announced Friday that they identified the wreck as the Black Duck in September, three years after initially coming across it while using side-scan sonar in 350 feet of water off Oswego, New York. The 51-foot-long, single-mast ship known as a scow-sloop sank during a gale while hauling goods along the lake's eastern end in August 1872. The ship's captain, his wife and a crewmember, the only people on board, all survived by getting into a small boat and reaching shore eight hours later. Only a few scow-sloops sailed the Great Lakes, Kennard told The Associated Press. A search of nautical records turned up only about a dozen references to scow-sloops being built in the region, he said. ",

Mike Windle/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mike Windle/Getty Images Actress Florence Henderson, pictured in June, has died at 82. She was best known as the mother of the blended family on TV's Brady Bunch. Mike Windle/Getty Images Florence Henderson, who went from Broadway star to become one of America's most beloved television moms in The Brady Bunch, has died, her manager and her publicist said. She was 82. Henderson died Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, after being hospitalized the day before, said her publicist, David Brokaw. Henderson had suffered heart failure, her manager Kayla Pressman said in a statement. Family and friends had surrounded Henderson's hospital bedside, Pressman said. On the surface, The Brady Bunch with Henderson as its ever-cheerful matriarch Carol Brady, resembled just another TV sitcom about a family living in suburban America and getting into a different wacky situation each week. But well after it ended its initial run, in 1974, the show resonated with audiences, and it returned to television in various forms again and again, including The Brady Bunch Hour in 1977, The Brady Brides in 1981 and The Bradys in 1990. It was also seen endlessly in reruns. \"It represents what people always wanted: a loving family. It's such a gentle, innocent, sweet show, and I guess it proved there's always an audience for that,\" Henderson said in 1999. You are in my heart forever Florence\uf495 pic.twitter.com/PABCuPubA2 \u2014 Maureen McCormick (@MoMcCormick7) November 25, 2016 Premiering in 1969, it also was among the first shows to introduce to television the blended family. As its theme song reminded viewers each week, Henderson's Carol was a single mother raising three daughters when she met her TV husband, Robert Reed's Mike Brady, a single father who was raising three boys. Article continues after sponsorship The eight of them became The Brady Bunch, with a quirky housekeeper, played by Ann B. Davis, thrown into the mix. The blonde, ever-smiling Henderson was already a Broadway star when the show began, having originated the title role in the musical Fanny. But after The Brady Bunch, she would always be known to fans as Carol Brady. \"We had to have security guards with us. Fans were hanging on our doors. We couldn't go out by ourselves. We were like the Beatles!\" she said of the attention the show brought the cast. Like the Beatles, there was even a Saturday morning cartoon version called Brady Kids, although Henderson was not in that show. She and Reed did return, however, for The Brady Bunch Hour, The Brady Brides and The Bradys. So did most of the original cast. She was also back again in 1995 when a new cast was assembled for The Brady Bunch Movie, a playful spoof of the original show. This time she was Grandma Brady opposite Shelly Long's Carol. Numerous memoirs also kept interest in the show alive, as cast members revealed they were more than just siblings off camera. Barry Williams, who played eldest son Greg Brady, would confess to having a crush on his TV stepmom. Henderson, in her own book, denied having any relationship with Williams, but did acknowledge a fling with former New York City mayor John Lindsay. Henderson was a 19-year-old drama student in New York when she landed a one-line role in the play Wish You Were Here. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were so impressed they made her the female lead in a 1952 road tour of Oklahoma! When the show returned to Broadway for a revival in 1954, she continued in the role and won rave reviews. \"She is the real thing, right of of a butter churn somewhere,\" wrote Walter Kerr of the New York Herald Tribune. To broaden her career, Henderson took acting, dancing, singing and guitar lessons, even studying French and Italian. She went on to play Maria in a road production of The Sound of Music, was Nellie Forbush in a revival of South Pacific and was back on Broadway with Jose Ferrer in The Girl Who Came to Supper in 1963. She made her movie debut in 1970 in Song of Norway, based on the 1944 operetta with music by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Her career nearly came to an end in 1965 when she suddenly lost her hearing while appearing in The King and I in Los Angeles. She was diagnosed with a hereditary condition called osteosclerosis. \"Corrective surgery in both ears restored my hearing,\" she said in 2007. As her TV career blossomed with The Brady Bunch, Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host The Tonight Show for the vacationing Johnny Carson. For eight years she also commuted to Nashville to conduct a cooking and talk series, Country Kitchen, on The Nashville Network. The show resulted in a book, Florence Henderson's Short Cut Cooking. After The Brady Bunch ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including Hart to Hart, Fantasy Island and The Love Boat. In later years she also made guest appearances on such shows as Roseanne, Ally McBeal and The King of Queens. Florence Agnes Henderson was born Feb. 14, 1934, in the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. She was the 10th child of a tobacco sharecropper of Irish descent. In grade school, she joined the choir at a Catholic church in Rockport, Ind. After high school she moved to New York, where she enrolled in a two-year program at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, her studies financed by a theatrical couple who had been impressed by her singing when they saw her perform in high school. She dropped out of the program after one year, however, to take the role in Wish You Were There. Henderson married theater executive Ira Bernstein and the couple had four children before the union ended in divorce after 29 years. Her second husband, John Kappas, died in 2002. Pressman said she is survived by her children; Barbara, Joseph, Robert and Lizzie, their respective spouses, and five grandchildren. ",

    "text": "Email SAN FRANCISCO -- \u00a0A Northern California sheriff says a woman missing for three weeks was \u201cvery emotional\u201d after a passing driver found her bound on the side of a rural road. In an interview Friday on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said authorities are looking for two women armed with a handgun they believe kidnapped 34-year-old Sherri Papini on Nov. 2 after she left for a jog. Sherri Papini disappeared on Nov. 2, 2016, and has been reunited with her husband, Shasta County sheriff\u2019s officials said on Nov. 24, 2016. Bosenko said the suspect descriptions were based off of \u201climited information\u201d given to them so far by Papini. Investigators were expected to interview her to elicit more information in coming days. Bosenko said Papini was released Thanksgiving morning about 150 miles south of where she disappeared near Redding. Bosenko said Papini was found bound by restraints near Interstate 5 but was able to flag down a driver after her captors dropped her off, driving a dark SUV. \u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks since her disappearance and then to find her, and released by her captors I think is very rare,\u201d Bosenko said. Bosenko said the woman was able to speak with her husband via cellphone before he drove down to meet her. The mother of two was treated for unspecified non-life-threatening injuries and released from a hospital. \u201cShe was very emotional to be released and to her hear husband\u2019s voice, and then a few hours later to be re-united with him,\u201d Bosenko said. Sherri Papini\u2019s husband Keith had previously been cleared as a suspect after he took a lie detector test, officials have said. He reported his wife missing after she didn\u2019t show up to pick their two children up from day care. Her cellphone and headphones were found near where she was last seen. Family had feared an abduction and described Papini as a \u201csuper mom\u201d who would never abandon her children. Before she was found, Keith Papini said he was \u201cgetting very angry and frustrated\u201d and \u201cscared for my wife.\u201d He made several emotional pleas in the media for her safe return. Bosenko said the man was \u201coverjoyed\u201d she is now safe. Police had received more than 400 tips in the case, but Papini\u2019s release was not the result of a $100,000 reward that was offered, Bosenko said. Investigators have said they don\u2019t know a possible motive or whether the abduction was targeted or random. It\u2019s also not clear where Papini may have been held captive or how she was restrained. Bosenko said at a news conference Thursday investigators \u201chad not given up hope.\u201d Bosenko said Papini was \u201cquite upset but elated to be free.\u201d Phone numbers for Papini and some of her family rang through Friday. Shasta County sheriff\u2019s official\u2019s didn\u2019t respond to phone calls and emails from CBS News\u2019 Crimesider. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

With the economy in crisis, prices have soared and many Egyptians are struggling to buy even basic goods. Amr Nabil/AP hide caption toggle caption Amr Nabil/AP An Egyptian man carries a bread tray in Cairo on Nov. 4. With the economy in crisis, prices have soared and many Egyptians are struggling to buy even basic goods. Amr Nabil/AP At the huge weekly market on the outskirts of Cairo, live chickens crowd wooden cages next to tables piled with ruby-red pomegranates, deep-orange persimmons and baskets of fresh dates from the countryside. But as Egypt endures its worst economic crisis in decades, many shoppers can barely afford the tomatoes and cucumbers that are a staple of the poor. They hurry past to a nearby square in the hope of buying cartons of government-subsidized food. Egypt is the Arab world's most populous country, with more than 90 million people, and one of the world's biggest food importers. The protests that swept Egypt and the Arab world five years ago and frightened off foreign investors and tourists collided with decades of a deeply inefficient, state-controlled economy. After the Egyptian government loosened exchange rates this month, the official value of the Egyptian pound plunged by almost half. One U.S. dollar bought less than nine Egyptian pounds before the devaluation, and these days buys more than 17 pounds. That means that anything imported \u2014 from sugar to medicine \u2014 became much more expensive and many items disappeared from the market. Article continues after sponsorship IMF Approves $12 Billion Bailout For Egypt After Austerity Measures \"I went to all the shops and even if you can afford to buy sugar you can't find it,\" says Saleh Attiya, a furniture maker out shopping with his son. \"A kid like that \u2014 how will he drink his milk without sugar?\" he said, pointing to 6-year-old son, also named Saleh. Attiya the father freely admits that his own missing teeth could be due to his habit of drinking each small glass of tea with four or five spoons of sugar. But for millions of Egypt's poor, sugar has been the only luxury they could afford. To ease the hardship of rising prices and broad subsidy cuts required by a $12 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the Egyptian government sent the army into neighborhoods with 8 million food boxes at bargain prices. Egypt's official figures indicate almost one-third of Egyptians are in poverty, defined as living on about $50 a month or less. Near the weekly market, a crowd of Egyptians, many of them elderly, crowded around a truck with subsidized food packages for sale. They sold out within minutes, leaving people shouting, \"I want a carton!\" and holding up tattered bills even as soldiers slammed shut the doors of the empty truck. The lucky ones walked away with a cardboard box containing margarine, macaroni, beans, tea, sugar and tomato paste. All for about $1.50 \u2014 less than half the normal price. Volunteers from a Cairo supermarket sell a kilogram of sugar for less than $1 in a poor neighborhood. Egypt imposed austerity measures in order to secure a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Nariman El-Mofty/AP hide caption toggle caption Nariman El-Mofty/AP Volunteers from a Cairo supermarket sell a kilogram of sugar for less than $1 in a poor neighborhood. Egypt imposed austerity measures in order to secure a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Nariman El-Mofty/AP The IMF loan is part of a wider economic restructuring aimed at encouraging investment and creating private sector jobs. The plunge in the currency has also sparked a shortage of medicines in pharmacies and hospitals, from contraceptives to cancer medicines. With Egypt's weaker currency, it costs companies nearly twice as much to import drugs. They are selling some at the old prices, but some have stopped importing pharmaceuticals altogether. The Egyptian government is negotiating an emergency plan with the pharmaceutical industry in which it would subsidize essential drugs. In the meantime, some Egyptians have set up an informal market on Twitter \u2014 offering to sell or give away extra insulin and other drugs to people in need. Even Egypt's upper classes have been hurt by the currency plunge. At the American University of Cairo, popular among middle- and upper-class Egyptian families, students held a sit-in last week at the prospect of sharply higher tuition. Fit For A King: Grand Museum Will Showcase Tut And Egypt's Ancient Culture Upscale online supermarkets normally full of imported foods are now full of \"out-of-stock\" notices instead. Many economists have welcomed the measures to overhaul the economy, but say they need to be part of structural rather than cosmetic change that would make it easier for companies to invest in Egypt and create jobs. \"We are a country with limited resources and we have to make choices on spending,\" says economist Ziad Bahaa el-Din, a former deputy prime minister in Egypt. The economic crisis has had political implications. Some Egyptians, who remained silent as security forces killed hundreds of protesters and imprisoned thousands more over the past three years, now openly criticize the government. Egypt's current government, led by former army general Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, took power after a military coup toppled the previous elected government. \"You did not wake up because of the blood and now you are because of sugar and rice?\" writes Mohammed Abo El-Gheit, a columnist for al-Araby al-Jadeed. El-Din, the economist, says despite the economic misery, he isn't expecting unrest. \"On the whole, Egyptians after five years of political change do not have a lot of appetite for dramatic change and most people are really willing to endure a lot to avoid other forms of turmoil,\" he says.

Mr. Huckabee, who said during the 2008 presidential campaign that Mr. Romney reminded voters of \u201cthe guy who laid them off,\u201d told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Mr. Romney would be \u201c a real insult \u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. Mr. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republican voters who turned out in large numbers to lift Mr. Trump to victory. Sean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Mr. Trump often privately solicits, has also been deeply critical of Mr. Romney on his show. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly after the election, Mr. Giuliani told associates that he believed the job was his. He had communicated to Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions. Photo Gen. John F. Kelly, the former head of the United States Southern Command, has emerged as an alternative to Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani. Credit Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But he began to run afoul of Mr. Trump when he told a Wall Street Journal forum that he would probably be a better candidate than John R. Bolton, who served as one of George W. Bush\u2019s ambassadors to the United Nations. And when reports surfaced about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s foreign business entanglements and highly compensated speechmaking, Mr. Trump grew even warier. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations. As a backup plan, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides encouraged him to meet with Mr. Romney. Though some in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, like Reince Priebus, his choice for chief of staff, thought that such a meeting would anger the president-elect\u2019s supporters, Mr. Trump went ahead. In the meantime, he started sounding out Mr. Giuliani on a different post, director of national intelligence. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have discussed the role for Mr. Giuliani, but there has been no indication he wants it. What many people believed would be a perfunctory meeting with Mr. Romney last weekend at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., turned into something more substantial. Mr. Trump liked Mr. Romney quite a bit, and was intrigued by the possibility of such a camera-ready option to represent the country around the globe, advisers to Mr. Trump said. The following day, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump and urged him to make a decision in one direction or the other. Mr. Romney, who was mocked in 2012 when he described Russia as the greatest geopolitical foe of the United States, has seen his stock in the Republican Party rise since his loss to President Obama, although he is still viewed skeptically by the party\u2019s grass-roots. His allies believe that his position on Russia has been vindicated, but it is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire for a better relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Privately, Mr. Giuliani has expressed his frustration at going from front-runner for secretary of state to a contender who has to convince Mr. Trump of his strengths. He is particularly irritated over the focus on his business ties. The option of a third person like General Kelly has gained currency in recent days inside the transition team. A respected leader, General Kelly served as the senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. He led the Southern Command, responsible for all United States military activities in South and Central America, for four years under Mr. Obama. And his appointment would fit Mr. Trump\u2019s inclination toward putting people with combat experience in senior foreign policy roles. Jeremy W.

USA TODAY NETWORK Jamal Hinton, 17, and Wanda Dench, right, and her family and friends, have Thanksgiving dinner at Wanda's home ,Thursday, November 24, 2016.  Hinton was accidentally invited by Dench through a text, but when they discovered the mistake and he asked for a plate anyway, she said \"come on over !\". (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) PHOENIX \u2014 It was a holiday story the Internet was quick to gobble up: A grandmother\u2019s accidental text to a Phoenix teen that led to a stranger\u2019s invitation to Thanksgiving dinner. Wanda Dench of Mesa had meant to send the Nov. 15 group message to a few family members, inviting them over for dinner. The text, meant for a grandson, was instead sent to Jamal Hinton, a 17-year-old from Phoenix. Hinton posted the screenshots of the conversation to Twitter, which was shared by his best friend and subsequently shared nearly 200,000 times. It seemed everyone was curious if the unlikely duo would spend the holiday together. \u201cWell, it\u2019s happening,\ufffd? Wanda said to The Arizona Republic Thursday afternoon. \u201cHe's showing up today with a pumpkin pie.\ufffd? A Thanksgiving pardon for friend of a feather Wanda and her family had been prepping all morning for the anticipation of their new guest. Waking up near dawn, Wanda put two turkeys back-to-back in her small oven so that there would be enough food to feed everyone. \u201cThe sad part is, I don\u2019t even cook,\ufffd? she said,\u00a0laughing. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll wonder what he\u2019s gotten himself into by accepting my invitation.\ufffd? \u201cYou don\u2019t do\u00a0... horrible,\ufffd? teased her grandson, Randall Burgoyne. The text that started all this had originally been intended for the 21-year-old Burgoyne, but he changed his number last May and had forgotten to mention it to his grandmother. Burgoyne found out about the mistaken identity exchange when he saw that he had missed several calls while at work that night. \u201cWhen I called my boyfriend he told me, \u2018Grandma is on the Internet,\u2019\ufffd? he said laughing. \u201cNow my grandma\u2019s everyone's grandma!\ufffd? Twitter | @ronalddoee Certo Nego on Twitter Burgoyne said he was not surprised by Wanda\u2019s decisions to invite Hinton, as their family has always had an open-door policy, welcoming any friends who wanted to join them for the holidays. Wanda\u2019s daughter, Lisa Dench, said she helped maneuver Twitter and the slew of texts sent to her mother\u2019s phone immediately following Hinton\u2019s post. Hinton forgot to remove her number from the screenshots, so she received about 600 texts from people asking if they, too, could be invited. \u201cAt first it was a slow trickle,\ufffd? Lisa said. \u201cBut then they came rushing in. I scrolled and scrolled and said to my mom, \u2018You\u2019ve got a lot of love. We\u2019ve got to make this into something.\u2019\ufffd? Wanda and her family believe that people were looking for a feel-good story during a time of tension following the presidential election and a series of police shootings, protests and violent incidents throughout the country. \u201cWe feel like it was fate that this occurred during such a rough time and right before Thanksgiving,\ufffd? Lisa said. Somebody grandma is coming in clutch this year!! Ayee!!! pic.twitter.com/laXmX6rotA \u2014 Certo Nego (@RonaldDoee) November 15, 2016 Burgoyne said he hopes when people see Hinton and his family sit down for their meal, that they see a message of kindness. \u201cI hope this shows people we don\u2019t need to care about the color of someone\u2019s skin, or even if we know each other, to know that we can all get along,\ufffd? he said. Wanda and Hinton had briefly met last week, so Thursday\u2019s dinner would allow the two to get to know each other, Wanda said. \u201cThe conversations tonight\u00a0... that\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about,\ufffd? Wanda said. As the sun began to set Thursday, the long table set with silver platters and sparkly candles was ready in the backyard. It was almost time for Hinton to arrive so the family went out front to greet him on the driveway. The excitement rose as Hinton pulled up along the street. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you came,\ufffd? Wanda said as he walked over and gave her a big embrace. \u201cI am, too,\ufffd? he said. And as if making a confession to his own grandmother, Hinton softly said he had forgotten the pumpkin pie while in the rush coming over. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty,\ufffd? Wanda assured. \u201cLet\u2019s go in and take a look at the turkeys,\ufffd? she said, leading him toward the house. 9484 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g0NX56 ",

Ross Cameron / Associated Press Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein also plans to request recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania with the millions she has raised online. Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein also plans to request recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania with the millions she has raised online. (D. Ross Cameron / Associated Press) Associated Press Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein on Friday formally requested a recount of election results in Wisconsin. President-elect Donald Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the initial count and has a small lead in Michigan. Stein has said she plans to request recounts in the three states \u2014 all reliably Democratic in recent presidential elections \u2014 to see whether hacking may have taken place, though there's no evidence voter results were hacked or electronic voting machines were compromised. Wisconsin Election Commission officials don't believe the state has ever conducted a presidential recount. They estimate the process could cost as much as $1 million, which Stein's campaign will have to cover. Stein's campaign has been raising money through online appeals since Tuesday to cover the cost of recounts, with $5.2 million raised as of Friday afternoon. Wisconsin's unofficial election results show Trump with 1,404,000 votes, Hillary Clinton with 1,381,823 votes and Stein with 31,000 votes. Wisconsin officials have already announced a limited audit of state voting machines, but the state is less vulnerable to cyberattacks because it uses electronic machines with voter-verifiable paper trails in most counties. \"There's no smoking gun here, but we're saying the American public needs to have it investigated to make sure our votes count,\" said George Martin, a member of the Wisconsin Green Party's coordinating council. \"We're doing this to ensure the integrity of our system.\" Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Mike Haas said Stein's campaign filed the request Friday afternoon, ahead of the state's 5 p.m. Friday deadline. Under state law, the state must comply with candidates' recount requests if the candidates can present a basis for one and cover the cost if the margin between the candidates is more than .25 percent of the total votes cast. Haas said the recount would likely begin next week and include a rigorous examination of all ballots, poll lists, absentee applications, rejected absentee ballots and provisional ballots. Federal deadlines require the state to complete the recount by Dec. 13, he said. Wisconsin Republican Party Executive Director Mark Morgan issued a statement calling the recount request \"absurd and nothing more than an expensive political stunt that undermines Wisconsin's election process.\" Martin said Republicans' response was expected and emphasized that the recount was about determining whether the system was secure, not who won or lost the fight for Wisconsin's 10 electoral college votes. During a news conference in Milwaukee, Martin said Stein's campaign would also ask for a \"reconciliation\" of voting records that would go beyond an audit, but he didn't provide details. Ross Hein, elections supervisor for the state commission, sent a memo to county clerks on Wednesday telling them to expect a recount. He said the process could be frustrating after a labor-intensive election season but that Stein was entitled to a recount under state law. Independent presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente also filed a recount request in Wisconsin on Friday. He got only 1,514 votes in Wisconsin. The deadline for requesting a recount in Pennsylvania is Monday. Michigan's deadline is Wednesday.

(Photo: Andres Leighton, AP) LAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 Three Olympic gold medals and one silver medal were stripped on Friday from athletes caught in the latest round of positive doping retests from the 2008 and 2012 Summer Games. Seven athletes from Belarus, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan were retroactively disqualified after testing positive for steroids in a reanalysis of their stored doping samples, the International Olympic Committee said. The IOC, which stores samples for 10 years, reanalyzed more than 1,000 samples from the 2008 Beijing Games and 2012 London Olympics with improved techniques that can detect the use of steroids going back weeks and months, rather than days. Weightlifter Ilya Ilyin of Kazakhstan was formally stripped of two gold medals \u2014 one each from the Beijing and London Games, both in the 94-kilogram class. He is believed to be the first summer Olympic athlete to lose two golds for doping. The Kazakhstan Olympic Committee had announced Ilyin's sanction on Wednesday. The IOC said in Friday's statement that he tested positive for stanozolol on his Beijing sample and for stanozolol and turinabol in his London test. Missy Franklin makes big change after feeling pressure In comments reported Wednesday by Kazakh media, Ilyin said he was \"shaken\" and \"in shock\" at the news and was considering an appeal. Ilyin is one of the biggest names in weightlifting, and the only athlete to win two Olympic gold medals for Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's weightlifting program, which had been one of the world's most successful over the last 10 years, has been almost wiped out by the retesting, with all five gold medals won by Kazakh lifters in 2008 and 2012 now stripped. Oksana Menkova of Belarus was stripped of the Beijing gold medal in the women's hammer throw after her retested samples came back positive for turinabol and oxandrolone, the IOC said. She also was disqualified from the London Games, where she finished seventh after testing positive for turinabol and stanozolol. Natalia Mikhnevich of Belarus was stripped of the silver medal in the women's shot put from Beijing after her samples were reanalyzed and tested positive for methandienone and stanozolol, the IOC said. Mikhnevich joins her husband, Andrei, in being stripped of shot put medals from Beijing. He lost his 2008 bronze medal when he was caught for doping in retests of samples from the 2005 world championships. While Andrei Mikhnevich is serving a life ban, Natalia also now faces a life ban for a second doping offense. She served a two-year doping ban in 2013-15. Katie Ledecky off to incredible start in first season at Stanford Also sanctioned Friday were: Pavel Lyzhyn of Belarus, fourth-place finisher in the men's shot put in Beijing; Svetlana Usovich of Belarus, eliminated in the semifinals of the women's 800 meters in Beijing; Boyanka Kostova of Azerbaijan, fifth place in the women's 58-kg weightlifting division in London; and Anastasia Mironchuk-Ivanova of Belarus, seventh in the women's long jump in London. No final decision has been made on reallocation of medals. Szymon Kolecki of Poland is in line to inherit Ilyin's weightlifting gold from Beijing, while Saeid Mohammedpour of Iran could take his 2012 gold. Miankova's hammer gold medal could be awarded to Yipsi Moreno of Cuba, with Zhang Wenxiu of China in line to be upgraded to silver and Darya Pchelnik of Belarus to bronze. The reallocation of medals in the Beijing women's shot put is complicated by the fact that another Belarusian, Nadzeya Ostapchuk, won the bronze. Ostapchuk was stripped of the London gold medal after testing positive at those games. The IOC recorded at least 98 positive tests across numerous sports from the London and Beijing retesting program, with more expected in the pipeline. The IOC also plans to retest samples from the 2014 Sochi Winter Games after the former Russian lab director said samples were manipulated to cover up doping by Russian athletes.

The school bus driven by Johnthony Walker, 24, crashed while transporting children home from the school Monday, killing at least five students. Walker was arrested Monday and charged with five counts of vehicular homicide including reckless driving and reckless endangerment, police said. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) \u00a0(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2013 \u00a0Students and administrators raised concerns about a Tennessee school bus driver's behavior behind the wheel in the weeks before a crash that killed six children. Police have charged driver Johnthony Walker with vehicular homicide after the Chattanooga crash. Federal authorities said Walker was driving off the designated bus route when he wrecked on a curvy road while carrying 37 children on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School. Records released by the school district Friday include two written statements by students complaining about Walker's driving. \"The bus driver drives fast,\" one student wrote earlier this month. \"It feels like the bus is going to flip over... When someone is in the aisle he stops the bus and he makes people hit their heads.\" Another student wrote: \"The bus driver was doing sharp turns and he made me fly over to the next seat. We need seat belts.\" On Nov. 2, a school official boarded the bus after the driver complained that students were not listening to him. One student had complained about the heat on the bus and cursed about it to the bus driver. \"The driver was now visibly upset and continued on by saying that he had another job and driving this bus was just a part-time job for him,\" wrote Carlis Shackelford, a behavioral specialist at the school. \"Driver stated that he could just leave him at the school. He then stated 'or I can just leave the student on the bus and I will get off the bus and leave the school.'\" \"Driver stated that he did not care about the students and proceeded to tell the students he did not care about them,\" Shackelford wrote. The school district's transportation supervisor, Benjamin Coulter, responded that \"we are addressing the issue with the driver.\" National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart said in a news conference earlier this week that Walker had taken on a second job at an Amazon fulfillment center, and part of the agency's investigation will look at whether fatigue played a role in the wreck. The bus driver had also complained to administrators that students would not listen to him when he told them not to stand in the bus or sit with their backs facing the front. The driver submitted 10 names of students he said were misbehaving. The transportation supervisor responded that the driver may have had some legitimate safety concerns but that the driver shouldn't report so many students. \"I don't want the driver to become discouraged, but he can't be turning 10 referrals in a day to you, either,\" Coulter wrote. Woodmore Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran asked for video of the bus leaving campus, noting that a few days earlier \"the driver, in my opinion, was driving way too fast when he pulled out of our school.\" It's unclear what the video showed; hyperlinks to it are redacted in the records. On Nov. 16, Adamson-Cothran wrote to Coulter to tell him six students had reported that the driver \"was swerving and purposely trying to cause them to fall today.\" Walker was in custody at the Hamilton County Correctional Facility on Friday and had a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Jail records do not indicate whether he has an attorney. The complaints about Walker appear to have begun in September when a parent wrote a letter to complain that the driver had cursed her kids and slammed on the brakes, causing them to hit their heads and fall out of their seats. The parent wrote that if it happened again, she would take it upon herself \"to beat his (expletive) my damn self.\" In the days immediately after the crash, school officials repeatedly declined to comment on whether anyone had complained or how they responded. The correspondence about the driver was released after public records requests by The Associated Press and other media outlets. Hamilton County schools spokeswoman Amy Katcher noted that Walker was employed by outside contractor Durham School Services, so the district may not have access to all the complaints about him. The bus company has not responded to questions about its safety record or Walker's employment history. Durham CEO David A. Duke released a video this week statement expressing condolences to the families and pledging to work with investigators. Coulter, the school district's transportation supervisor, said in a Nov. 2 email to Durham manager Domenic D'Amico that the Woodmore principal had to intervene several times when Walker was arguing with students. \"This may be a situation where he needs to be coached on how to deal with the students,\" Coulter wrote.

Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump, at Trump Tower in New York. (Getty Images) Chris Megerian Contact Reporter The election results were rolling in, and so were the phone calls for Donald Trump . But no matter who was on the other end of the line, the person handing the phone to the next president of the United States was the same.\u00a0 \u201cJared was screening the calls,\u201d said Armstrong Williams, a political ally who described the scene in Trump\u2019s Manhattan skyscraper on election night. That\u00a0would be Jared Kushner , Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and his election-night role provides\u00a0a glimpse of the enormous influence he\u00a0wields as Trump prepares to take office in January. As the husband of Ivanka Trump,\u00a0the president-elect\u2019s\u00a0elder\u00a0daughter, Kushner holds an unassailable position inside Trump\u2019s unruly ecosystem of advisors.\u00a0 Another sign came two days after the election, when Trump met with President Obama . Kushner strolled the White House complex\u00a0with Obama\u2019s chief of staff, a pairing that suggested his status in the incoming administration.

(Jim Watson / AFP-Getty Images) The 35-year-old Kushner\u00a0is not likely to have a formal role in the White House, said\u00a0Jason Miller, the communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team. An official appointment\u00a0would test an anti-nepotism law\u00a0enacted after President John F. Kennedy made his brother, Robert, his\u00a0attorney general.\u00a0 But Kushner, whom Miller described as Trump\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears\u201d during the campaign, is likely to remain a key figure. On Tuesday,\u00a0Trump suggested to the New York Times that Kushner, an observant Jew and dedicated supporter\u00a0of Israel, could help negotiate peace in the Middle East. He already participated in a meeting with Trump and Japan\u2019s prime minister last week. \u201cThe president-elect knows that the only person Jared is looking out for is the president-elect,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any other agendas or motives or fiefdoms. And in the world of politics \u2026 that\u2019s frequently hard to find.\u201d Past presidents have similarly turned to family members as advisors and, in some cases, enforcers. In the George H.W. Bush administration, for example, the president\u2019s son, George W. Bush, played an important\u00a0behind-the-scenes role in ensuring fealty was paid to the president.\u00a0 But Trump, who comes from the tribal world of real estate, has only a small circle of political professionals, giving relatives like Kushner an outsized voice in his orbit.\u00a0 Before Kushner joined Trump\u2019s family, he learned the role of loyalty from his own. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, is the son of Holocaust survivors and the architect of a real estate empire in New Jersey. He donated generously to schools, charities and Democratic politicians, but his finances caught the attention of federal authorities, led by the then-U.S. Atty. Chris Christie ,\u00a0who investigated him for tax evasion and improper campaign contributions. Follow coverage of the presidential transition on Trail Guide \u00bb The investigation took an ugly turn as the elder Kushner\u2019s\u00a0brother and sister cooperated with authorities,\u00a0and he sought revenge\u00a0in a sordid\u00a0sting operation. He hired a prostitute to seduce his sister\u2019s husband, videotaped the sexual encounter in a motel room, and mailed the recording to his sister. The scheme backfired, becoming one more piece of the federal case against him. He eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison. The case tore apart the family but did not shake Jared Kushner\u2019s devotion to his father. \u201cI felt what happened was obviously unjust in terms of the way [prosecutors] pursued him,\u201d he told the Real Deal, a real estate website, in 2014. The prosecution of Charles\u00a0Kushner was one of the high-profile cases that helped propel Christie, a Republican,\u00a0into New Jersey\u2019s governorship in 2010.\u00a0This year, Christie became a major\u00a0surrogate for Trump, whom he endorsed after ending his own White House bid. In the spring, Trump tapped Christie to head his transition planning. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, background, who helped send Jared Kushner's father to prison, later lost his job leading Donald Trump's transition team. L.M. Otero / Associated Press New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, background, who helped send Jared Kushner's father to prison, later lost his job leading Donald Trump's transition team. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, background, who helped send Jared Kushner's father to prison, later lost his job leading Donald Trump's transition team. (L.M. Otero / Associated Press) There was a d\u00e9tente between Christie and Jared Kushner\u00a0that lasted until after the election, when Christie was abruptly\u00a0sidelined.\u00a0 Kushner denied that he personally pushed out the governor. \u201cSix months ago, Gov. Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together,\u201d he told Forbes in the only interview he has given about the campaign. \u201cI was not behind pushing out him or his people.\u201d Exactly how Christie\u2019s downfall came about remains shrouded, but Kushner\u2019s ability to achieve goals without leaving obvious signs fits his pattern. \u201cThere are a lot of personalities in politics that when you cross them, you know it immediately. Jared won\u2019t show it,\u201d said Orin Kramer, a hedge fund executive and Democratic fundraiser who met Kushner through New Jersey political circles. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t cross him.\u201d Kushner was only 24 when his father went to prison, but\u00a0had already been groomed for the political and real estate worlds. Former U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) remembers him as a middle school student tagging along with his father to meetings with elected officials. \u201cHe was interested and willing to come to meetings with people far older to talk about seemingly esoteric subjects like the economy or foreign policy,\u201d Torricelli said. Kushner\u2019s father also paved the way for him to attend Harvard, pledging $2.5 million in donations, according to \u201cThe Price of Admission,\u201d a book by Daniel Golden about how the wealthy can\u00a0buy their way into elite institutions. His favorite extracurricular activity, Kushner later told the New York Daily News, was buying and flipping apartment buildings nearby. He started making political contributions in his own name when he was 18. Since then, he\u2019s donated $44,400 to New Jersey politicians and $135,450 to federal campaigns, according to reports filed with the government. With the exception of former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, almost all of the money went to Democrats, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton. At an age when many are hunting for their first jobs, Kushner was entering the upper levels of New York society. He purchased the New York Observer, a Manhattan-based\u00a0newspaper known for its elite readership, and a downtown\u00a0office tower that became his company\u2019s base of operations. \u201cHe looks young. But he doesn\u2019t act young,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a prestigious business group. \u201cI\u2019m double his age, and I take him very seriously.\u201d Kushner married Ivanka Trump in 2009 \u2014 the ceremony was held at her father\u2019s golf course in New Jersey \u2014 and they have three young children. \u201cIf Jared is going to call you in the morning, it won\u2019t be before 9 or 10 o\u2019clock, because he always has breakfast with his wife and kids,\u201d said Williams, who advised former Republican candidate Ben Carson during the presidential primary. Despite overseeing the purchase and sale of billions of dollars in property over the last decade, Kushner is the kind of person who cleans up after meetings even when they\u2019re not in his own office, said Asher Abehsera, a fellow real estate executive.\u00a0 \u201cPeople get caught off balance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really how he is.\u201d Kushner worked with Abehsera on transforming a series of Brooklyn buildings formerly\u00a0owned by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses into a campus for technology companies,\u00a0including\u00a0Etsy, the online marketplace for craft products.\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump kisses his daughter Ivanka.

Despite turmoil within the campaign leadership \u2014\u00a0Trump cycled through a succession of top advisors before settling on a winning team \u2014 Kushner reportedly helped create the online fundraising and data analysis operations that helped achieve victory. He became known as a trusted, behind-the-scenes power broker.\u00a0 \u201cI helped facilitate a lot of relationships that wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise,\u201d Kushner told Forbes. One of Kushner\u2019s only previous public comments about the campaign came in\u00a0a column in his own newspaper. Although Trump has attracted support from white nationalists and anti-Semites, Kushner defended him against charges of prejudice.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact is that my father-in-law is an incredibly loving and tolerant person who has embraced my family and our Judaism since I began dating my wife,\u201d Kushner wrote. It was yet another display of loyalty. No matter what, Williams\u00a0said, \u201che watches his father-in-law\u2019s back, like a hawk.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

Mr. Trump made foreign policy a centerpiece of his campaign, but has yet to name secretaries of defense, homeland security or state. The current fight on the transition team is over who will lead the State Department \u2013 a question that has Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle divided, reports CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett. I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2016 Mr. Trump was President-out-of-sight-elect Thursday, enjoying a Thanksgiving meal with family at his Mar-a-Lago resort. But he didn\u2019t take the holiday off, writing on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana).\u201d\u00a0 On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump frequently pointed to the air conditioning company as an example of how trade deals have negatively impacted American workers. \u201cCompanies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico, build new plants, make their product and sell it back into this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Carrier confirmed it\u2019s \u201c...had discussions with the incoming administration\u2026\u201d but has nothing to announce at this time.   Also Thursday, Kellyanne Conway, a senior transition adviser and former campaign manager, publicly discouraged Mr. Trump from choosing Mitt Romney as secretary of state. Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state https://t.co/HDtpjeJTc3 \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 Conway shared an article on twitter titled, \u201cSome Trump loyalists warn against Romney as secretary of state,\u201d and praised the loyalty of former state department secretaries, hinting at Romney\u2019s previous Trump criticisms. \u00a0 Insults between Mr. Trump and the 2012 nominee flew in both directions. \u201cHe\u2019s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat,\u201d Romney told a crowd at the University of Utah last March.\u00a0 \u201cThe last election should\u2019ve been won, except Romney choked like a dog. He choked. He went, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe!\u2019\u201d Trump mocked Romney at a rally in Rome, New York last April, grabbing his neck. Also currently on the list for the secretary of state slot is former CIA Director David Petraeus, Senator Bob Corker and longtime Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. Once seen as Mr. Trump\u2019s top pick, Giuliani has been making a public case for his appointment, listing various foreign trips and his close personal relationship with the Israeli prime minister as reasons why he\u2019s the most qualified.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission announced that it had received the petitions from Stein and Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, another former presidential nominee for his self-created American Delta Party, this afternoon. The Commission has received the Stein and Del La Fuente recount petitions. Details and news release posted soon at https://t.co/N3TrlOIqE1 . \u2014 Wisconsin Elections (@WI_Elections) November 25, 2016 Stein posted on Twitter as well, urging volunteers to join the recount. BREAKING: We've filed in Wisconsin! #Recount2016 will begin next week. Volunteer to help: https://t.co/Bvrs0iP3lv https://t.co/B7tS87ggpI \u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 25, 2016 Stein is also pushing for recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan -- the deadlines for filing are Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Green Party Candidate Jill Stein Denies Playing Spoiler in Donald Trump Upset \"There is no smoking gun,\" said George Martin, a former co-chair of the Wisconsin Green Party who's involved in Stein's recount effort, during a press conference today. \"There\u2019s not something we\u2019re pointing to say that this is wrong in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. What we are saying is that there\u2019s enough peripheral evidence to warrant that our system should be investigated.\" The campaign stresses that the recounts are not to change the outcome of the results but are rather a check and balance on the process of counting votes. Martin said that the Green Party has been approached by computer scientists, election lawyers and other experts advocating vote recounts because of what they see as persuasive evidence of tampered election results. So far there has not been any verifiable evidence or proof of tampering or hacking. Stein\u2019s campaign site promises \u201call money raised goes toward recounts,\u201d but also states, \u201cWe cannot guarantee a recount will happen in any of these states we are targeting. We can only pledge we will demand recounts in those states.\u201d Wisconsin Elections Commission Director Michael Haas said today in a statement that the commission is prepared to conduct a recount. Stein's campaign site adds: \"If we raise more than what\u2019s needed, the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform.\" Her campaign site breaks down the estimated costs -- $1.1 million for filing in Wisconsin, $500,000 for filing in Pennsylvania, $600,000 for filing in Michigan, $2-3 million for attorney fees, and additional money for statewide recount observers. Stein initially sought to raise $2.5 million to help fund recount efforts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The campaign has since blown past the number she requested on Wednesday, and it is now seeking a new goal of $7 million, the estimated amount needed to cover a recount in all three states. As of noon Friday, the campaign has raised $5 million -- enough to cover the recounts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, according to the campaign. On Tuesday, New York Magazine reported that a group of computers scientists and election lawyers had urged the Clinton campaign to challenge the election results in the three states. The Clinton campaign has not commented on the report. Stein received approximately 1 percent of the votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. ABC News' Margaret Chadbourn and William Gretsky contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

The number of consumers hitting the stores Friday has dropped to 23 percent, down from 28 percent two years ago. Those who do venture out are likely to be millennials. But 38 percent say they\u2019d rather shop online , according to Bank Rate.\u00a0 The biggest shift of all comes in the realm of mobile apps.\u00a0 Cyber Monday shoppers are cutting into Black Friday customers, creating a new challenge among businesses. CBS MoneyWatch's Jill Schlesinger discu... \u201cIt has completely enhanced your shopping abilities,\u201d Katty Sierra said. She is one of millions of consumers expected to push mobile revenue over $1 billion on Friday. If mobile sales continue at a record pace, 40 percent of all Black Friday shopping will be done on mobile apps.\u00a0 Target, for example, saw a 200 percent increase over last year in mobile app sales. The increased traffic even crashed Macy\u2019s site.\u00a0 Blogger Michelle Madhok said mobile apps have increased competition because it\u2019s so easy to compare prices. \u201cIt\u2019s a click to see what the other prices are. Before you had to drive from store to store to compare prices or go through tons of inserts in your newspaper,\u201d she said. Experts predict shoppers will spend more than $3 billion online for Black Friday sales, and Cyber Monday is expected to be the largest shopping d... Chris Mason said the most popular shopping apps include Amazon and Walmart. Mason is CEO of the largest retail mobile app designer, Branding Brands. But he also warned that mobile app popularity has opened the door to fraud . Criminals look for businesses that don\u2019t have apps, and create fake ones to fill those voices. Meanwhile, app stores can\u2019t keep up with the fraud.\u00a0 \u201cFor every hundred taken down, there would be 200 coming up and it became this big game of whack-a-mole,\u201d Mason said. Those mobile apps are game-changers, making Black Friday and Cyber Monday largely irrelevant.\u00a0 Customers can avoid fakes by only downloading the apps from the retailer\u2019s actual website, not app stores. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute The National Zoo's 15-month-old panda cub Bei Bei is recovering after veterinarians performed emergency bowel obstruction surgery Friday. The culprit? \"A dense, masticated lemon-sized mass of bamboo,\" according to a post on the zoo's website . Here's the tick-tock of the digestive drama: \"On Thursday, Nov. 24, giant panda cub Bei Bei showed signs of stomach discomfort and nausea. He was sleeping more than normal and not eating. Bei Bei was given an anti-nausea medication injection and remained in his indoor enclosure under observation. Zoo animal care and veterinary staff observed him closely throughout the day and made periodic checks overnight to monitor his condition. \"Earlier this morning, Nov. 25, Bei Bei was taken to the vet hospital for further evaluation. Volunteer Dr. Elyshia Hankin, board-certified veterinary radiologist at the Friendship Hospital for Animals, performed an ultrasound of his stomach and bowels revealing a blockage at the top of the small intestine. Following an initial endoscopic exploration, it was clear to the veterinary team that the mass would not resolve itself on its own and the blockage needed to be removed surgically.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"I'm extremely proud and thankful for our team of keepers, veterinarians, animal care staff, volunteer medical experts and all staff who have helped facilitate the urgent response,\" Director Dennis Kelly said in the release. According to the statement, Bei Bei will be in a separate enclosure and away from the panda cams for a few days as he recovers. But the zoo will post daily recovery updates on social media. \"Bei Bei's prognosis is very good,\" Kelly said. Panda Cub Bei Bei Is Set To Share His Adorableness With The World Bei Bei isn't quite out of the (bamboo) woods yet, though. The zoo statement said that in order to get his \"gastrointestinal tract moving smoothly\" again, Bei Bei \"will be given water overnight and will then be transitioned to soft foods such as sweet potatoes, pears and ground up leaf-eater biscuits.\" The statement added: \"When bamboo is added back to his diet, it will likely be finely cut leaves.\" ",

    "text": "Nov 25 2016, 6:56 pm ET Election Recount to Begin in Wisconsin Following Green Party Petition, Officials Say by Adam Howard and Alexandra Jaffe Share advertisement Wisconsin accepted Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein's petition for a statewide recount of votes for President of the United States, state officials said Friday. The recount is expected to begin late next week. \"The Commission is preparing to move forward with a statewide recount of votes for President of the United States, as requested by these candidates,\" Wisconsin Election Commission's Administrator Michael Haas said in a statement . The state's election commission is still waiting to receive a cost estimate from county clerks to calculate the fee that Stein's campaign will have to pay before the start of the recount, but Haas anticipates the recount will begin next week after the fee is paid. The Commission has received the Stein and Del La Fuente recount petitions. Details and news release posted soon at https://t.co/N3TrlOIqE1 . \u2014 Wisconsin Elections (@WI_Elections) November 25, 2016 Stein announced that she intends to mount a legal challenge to re-examine the vote totals in three states, including Wisconsin, that performed differently than polling suggested they would on Election Day. The other two states are Michigan, where NBC News has yet to officially call a winner, and Pennsylvania. Stein's Wisconsin filing came about an hour and a half before the afternoon deadline. Her campaign said Friday that it had surpassed its initial fundraising goal to fund the recount effort and crossed the $4 million mark. Costs are likely to be steep. In Wisconsin alone, past statewide recounts for a non-presidential year cost more than $520,000, according to an incomplete survey carried out by the Associated Press in the wake of a contested Supreme Court election in 2011. Nearly double the number of voters turned out to the polls this year compared to the previous recount election, Haas said. In addition, Wisconsin officials would need to scramble to finish the recount by the federal Dec. 13 deadline. \"The recount process is very detail-oriented, and this deadline will certainly challenge some counties to finish on time,\" Haas said in the statement. The Michigan and Pennsylvania recount deadline dates are next week.

President-elect Donald Trump still holds narrow leads in all three states, and his victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin provided him with the Electoral College advantage he needed to win the presidency. However, reports of irregularities in the vote count \u2014 brought to light by a collection of scientists and activists \u2014 along with concerns over whether Russia may have attempted to influence the results and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's historic and growing popular vote victory , have provided the momentum and emotion behind this admittedly long-shot fight to force a recount. Related: How Would a Contested Election Work? Five Things to Know \"After a divisive and painful presidential race, reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many American to wonder if our election results are reliable. These concerns need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified.\" Stein said in a Wednesday statement. \"We deserve elections we can trust.\" For its part, the Clinton campaign, which stands to benefit the most from overturned election results, has remained quiet on Stein's crusade. Two advocates for a recount, lawyer John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, did attempt to lobby members of her team to back the effort during a conference call last week, but were rebuffed.

If we can X out that second option, why not,\" a source who was privy to conversations with the Clinton camp recently told NBC News. The Clinton campaign was reportedly unmoved because there have no been widespread reports of fraud or vote tampering. Many experts believe that the real culprit behind the polling disparities in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania was an unmotivated Democratic base, which failed to turn out in full force on Election Day. The Trump campaign has also been dismissive of Stein's actions, with the president-elect's aide, Kellyanne Conway, mocking the Green Party candidate's supporters on Twitter: Look who \"can't accept the election results\" Hillary Clinton Supporters Call for Vote Recount in Battleground States https://t.co/D4t6HbPUXG \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 Still, Stein's push is moving forward and she is up against the clock. With Wisconsin's Friday deadline, Stein has said the initial $2.5 million she raised will cover that effort. Further funding will be redirected to Michigan, where the filing cost will be $600,000 and the challenge deadline is Monday, and Pennsylvania, where the filing cost is $500,000 and the deadline is Wednesday. Some critics have expressed skepticism about whether the money donated to Stein will really finance a recount effort, or will simply amount to a replenished war chest for the Green Party, which failed to reach the 5 percent threshold in the popular vote that could have led to federal funding in future elections. The fine print on her website tells donors that she cannot guarantee that a recount will happen and that any surplus money raised will go towards \"election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform.\" All of their money has come from private citizens, the Green Party does not accept corporate donations. A recount would mean a hand-counting of ballots, including those from electronic machines, which are the ones most in dispute, and experts believe it is highly unlikely that the process would overturn enough votes to help Clinton reduce her deficits. But according to Stein, that's not the point. \"This is not being done to benefit one candidate at the expense of the other,\" she said Thursday during an appearance on the PBS NewsHour . \"This is being done because Americans, you know, come out of this election not happy campers.\" Play ",

By Karoun Demirjian November 25 at 5:55 PM Follow @karoun Former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein filed a petition Friday for a recount of election results in Wisconsin. (Christopher Dolan/Citizens\u2019 Voice via AP) An election recount will take place soon in Wisconsin, after former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein filed a petition Friday with the state\u2019s Election Commission, the first of three states where she has promised to contest the election result. The move from Stein, who raised millions since her Wednesday announcement that she would seek recounts of Donald Trump\u2019s apparent election victories\u00a0in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, came just 90 minutes before Wisconsin\u2019s 5 p.m. Friday deadline to file a petition. Now it will keep some hope alive for many Hillary Clinton supporters for another few weeks while Wisconsin recounts ballots before a Dec. 13 deadline. Trump scored upset victories in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and seems on the path to declare a victory in Michigan as well, though the result of the election in that state will not be certified officially until Monday. Had Clinton won those three states, previously seen as part of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cfirewall,\u201d she would have secured enough electoral votes to win the election. Stein announced her intention to file the petition following reports that a group of data experts and election lawyers were urging Clinton to demand a recount in those three states, on suspicion that a cyberattack could have manipulated the results of the election in those states. While the group had no specific proof of hacking, they noted anomalies suggesting Clinton routinely did more poorly in Wisconsin counties that used voting machines, as opposed to those that relied on paper ballots. Trump secured a total of 1,404,000 votes in Wisconsin, according to the commission;\u00a0Clinton had 1,381,823. In the end, Stein, who secured 31,006 votes in Wisconsin, was not the only presidential candidate to demand a recount. Rocky Roque De La Fuente, the Reform Party nominee who got 1,514 Wisconsin votes, also filed a recount petition, according to the state\u2019s Election Commission. George Martin, a Green Party official, said on Nov. 25 in Milwaukee that his party is seeking a vote recount in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \"for the benefit of the American public.\" (Reuters) [ Why are people giving Jill Stein millions of dollars for an election recount? ] To be on the safe side, the group of experts urged a recount \u2014 but it was Stein\u2019s campaign that ended up demanding one, soliciting at first $2.5 million and later up to $7 million to fund the recounts. As of Friday evening, Stein\u2019s campaign reported taking in over $5.25 million in recount-related donations \u2014 the most by a third-party candidate in history. Wisconsin has the first deadline of the three states in question. If Stein\u2019s campaign wishes to file recount petitions in the other states as promised, she must do so by Monday to meet Pennsylvania\u2019s deadline, and Wednesday to meet the Nov. 30 deadline in Michigan. In a statement , Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Michael Haas guessed that the cost and complexity of the recount would be in excess of the state\u2019s last recount in 2011, which carried a price tag of more than $520,000. In that recount over a state Supreme Court seat, the commission had to recount 1.5 million votes \u2014 about half the 2.975 million ballot votes that were cast during the 2016 presidential election. Stein put a note on her Facebook page on Friday, asking supporters \u201cto consider volunteering to help in the recount process.\u201d The county boards of canvassers will conduct the recount, according to the commission\u2019s statement, and will have the authority \u201cto decide which ballots should and should not be counted,\u201d Haas said. If the candidates disagree with the results of the Wisconsin recount, they will have five business days to contest the outcome in court. powerpost ",

The shooting occurred around 11:07 p.m. in the 1400-block of West 65th Street, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) said in a statement. According to local ABC-owned station WLS , a family spokesperson identified the deceased as Kajuan Raye of Dolton, Illinois. The Chicago Tribune reports that the Cook County Medical Examiner identified the victim as Raye as well. Raye was shot multiple times in the stomach and later died from a gunshot wound to the back, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner, WLS reported. The death has been ruled a homicide, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner, WLS reported. According to police, an Englewood District sergeant, who has not been identified, was responding to call about a battery in progress when the sergeant observed a male matching a description of the suspect take off on foot. Police said in the statement that the suspect \"pointed a weapon in the direction of the Sergeant on two separate occasions during the pursuit.\" \"The Sergeant then indicated he discharged his weapon striking the offender,\" the statement reads. Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters on Thursday that no weapon has been recovered at the scene, according to the Chicago Tribune. \"Currently, CPD detectives and internal affairs investigators are conducting a grid search to locate any physical evidence and the offender's weapon,\" police said in the statement. In a statement to WLS, a family spokesperson said in part that the \"family and friends of Kajuan Raye are heart-broken\" by his death. \"The family has retained a very competent law firm to investigate, get answers and hold accountable this officer and Chicago Police Department. In the future a vigil will be held in the memory of this fun-loving and happy kid who had a bright future,\" the family statement reads. Raye's family maintains that he did not own a gun, according to WLS. The shooting is being investigated by the Independent Police Review Authority, police said. The sergeant has been placed on routine administrative duties for the next 30 days, according to WLS. 0 Shares ",

(Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Family and friends react at the scene where a man shot two people, one fatally, before he was killed by police near the intersection of West Harrison Street and Central Park Avenue on\u00a0Nov. 25, 2016, in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Elvia Malagon Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A\u00a0man was fatally shot by Chicago police after wounding two others, one fatally, early Friday in the Homan Square neighborhood, officials said.\u00a0 Kevin Navarro, first deputy superintendent\u00a0for the Chicago Police Department, said officers were responding about 12:25 a.m. Friday to a call of gunfire near the intersection of Harrison Street and Central Park Avenue in the Homan Square neighborhood on the West Side.\u00a0 When the officers arrived at the scene, they saw a man shooting another man while standing over him, Navarro said. The officers left their vehicles and engaged the shooter. At some point, the officers fatally wounded him, Navarro said. The man, who had not yet been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene.\u00a0 Investigators believe that the man police fatally shot had wounded two men. Navarro said one of those men was pronounced\u00a0dead and the other was shot in the arm. The surviving man's condition was stabilized at an area hospital.\u00a0 A weapon was found at the scene, according to a statement from police.\u00a0 There weren't any officers injured in the shooting. \u00a0 The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting. Mia Sissac, spokeswoman for IPRA, said investigators responded to the scene of the shooting to sort out what happened. If any video captured the shooting, Sissac said, it will be released to the public within 60 days. A\u00a0man was fatally shot by Chicago police after wounding two others, one fatally, early Nov. 25, 2016, in the Homan Square neighborhood, officials said.\u00a0 A large crowd of relatives, neighbors and people who had been at a nearby bar gathered early Friday in the 600 block of Central Park Avenue as more than 20 patrol officers stood guard at the edge of where police had taped off as part of the crime scene.\u00a0 Many in the crowd voiced their dismay at the police, with some yelling profanities at officers.\u00a0 \"That's somebody's cousin that you just murdered,\" one woman yelled. \"I bet if it was some white boy, the family would be getting consoled.\"\u00a0 One woman cried out that it was her brother who had been gunned down by police. She declined to comment.\u00a0 A man's body could be seen on the ground in the 3500 block of West Harrison Street near a vehicle. It was unclear if it was the man shot by police or if it was one of the men wounded allegedly by the suspect. The bodies of two men were removed from the crime scene early Friday.\u00a0 A small group of visibly shaken women\u00a0at one point was\u00a0escorted by police into a building near where the shooting took place. Anthony Johnson, 40, was among those who were standing outside the crime scene. Holding up his phone, Johnson live-streamed\u00a0the aftermath of the shooting. Johnson said he was inside the nearby bar and saw the man who was later shot by police talking to women inside the business. He recalled complimenting him on his clothes. \"The man was on nothing,\" he said, pointing out that bar patrons were searched before going into the business.\u00a0 After the shooting erupted, Johnson and others left the bar. He recalled seeing blood on the street.\u00a0 The shooting marks the third time within a week that Chicago police officers have been involved in a fatal shooting. Late Wednesday, a 19-year-old man was fatally shot by a sergeant in the West Englewood neighborhood. On Nov. 18, police fatally shot a man after seeing him shoot and wound another man in the West Englewood neighborhood.\u00a0 Check back for updates.\u00a0 ",

He has placed a staunch climate-change doubter and antagonist of mainstream science in charge of reshaping \u2014\u00a0or as Trump has suggested, dismantling \u2014\u00a0the Environmental Protection Agency . He has talked frequently\u00a0about reneging on the historic Paris global climate treaty the U.S. took a lead in drafting. And he has said he wants every federal green-energy program eliminated. Environmentalists take little comfort in Trump\u2019s recent comments that he accepts \u201cthere is some connectivity\u201d between human activity and climate change and that he has an open mind about it, as what\u00a0he\u2019s said elsewhere and done so far suggests otherwise. And even those comments gave\u00a0scientists cause for alarm. \u201cYou\u00a0can make a lot of cases for different views,\u201d Trump told the New York Times , casting doubt on the finding by more than 90% of climate scientists\u00a0that emissions are accelerating global warming. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody is ever going to really know.\u201d Yet few things on Trump\u2019s confrontational agenda put him more quickly on a collision course with the rest of the world, much of his own country and even some in his own party than his stated desire to abandon the fight against global warming. The looming assault on environmental regulation will test the resilience of California\u2019s leadership role in the world, which is defined in large part by aggressive action on climate change that became a blueprint for the Obama administration. \u201cDonald Trump will be about the only head of state who does not believe in climate science or the responsibility of his government to act,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, which signed up more members in the week after Trump won the election than during the rest of 2016 combined. \u201cThis makes the Bush-Cheney administration look like it came from an environmental training camp.\u201d But Trump may be picking a tougher fight than he knows. The last time the White House made the kind of retreat Trump envisions \u2013 when President\u00a0Bush walked away from the Kyoto protocol in 2001 \u2013 the policy landscape of climate change was drastically different. Much of the action on climate change in this country no longer plays out in federal agencies but at local commissions enforcing laws in 29 states that push public utilities to go green. Their\u00a0mandates are to encourage investment in cleaner plants and technology development. Major U.S. trading partners that signed on to the nearly 200-nation accord reached in Paris last year are already signaling that they will retaliate if the United States\u00a0backs out, possibly by slapping environmental trade tariffs onto some American products. Trump names first women to Cabinet with Haley for U.N., DeVos at Education Nov. 25, 2016, 11:19 a.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now: Trump tweaks his views on a trio of major issues, complicating... (Michael A. Memoli) Bailing on the deal could also increase the\u00a0influence\u00a0of China, itself once a chief climate pariah and now a green-energy powerhouse and lead instigator of international climate agreements. Trump is poised to create a leadership vacuum in the fight against climate change that would only expand Beijing\u2019s reach, Chinese officials\u00a0say.\u00a0 None of those potential consequences\u00a0faze\u00a0the free-market think tanks urging Trump to go rogue. Just weeks ago, these groups were on the lonely fringe, pursuing an agenda written off as wacky by the mainstream science community, but\u00a0now find themselves helping drive policy at the highest levels. \u201cWe disagree with President Obama that climate change is the end-all\u00a0and we ought to reorient the global economy around this phenomenon,\u201d said William Yeatman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. One of the organization\u2019s most outspoken scholars, Myron Ebell, was tasked by Trump to oversee the transition to the new administration at the EPA. Ebell accuses the mainstream science community of unnecessarily alarming the public about global warming. Where many erstwhile allies abandoned that position in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary,\u00a0Ebell doubled down. Last year, he attacked the call by Pope Francis for action on climate change as \u201cscientifically ill-informed, economically illiterate, intellectually incoherent and morally obtuse.\u201d That Ebell is now setting the direction of the EPA is horrifying to no small number of policymakers and scientists who have worked on this issue since even before the Kyoto talks. Some don\u2019t even accept it. They expect Ebell will stir so much public outrage that his influence in the new administration will quickly wane. \u201cHe is a fanatical ideologue,\u201d said David Doniger, who directs the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIf this were a corporation, would you turn a sales unit over to a nut like that?\u201d But Trump, who shook up his transition team after winning the election, has left Ebell in charge of the shift at the EPA and may keep him in place to run the agency. Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request to interview Ebell. In California, state officials are already dusting off their playbooks from the George W. Bush years, when the state launched its ambitious climate agenda in spite of the White House. The state\u2019s clean-energy start-ups and innovation labs are redrafting business plans to focus on serving customers in places likely to be more hospitable to green tech during the Trump administration. Home-grown California technologies thought to be destined for Pittsburgh or Cincinnati may now divert to Paris or\u00a0Shanghai. \u201cI don\u2019t see this impacting California one bit,\u201d said Yuan-Sheng Yu, an analyst at Lux Research\u00a0who wrote a\u00a0report on the future of climate policy under Trump.\u00a0\u201cCalifornia has made clear it is going to move forward regardless of\u00a0who is president, just as it did before Obama.\u201d Trump faces an even more politically daunting barrier: many fellow Republicans. Generous federal tax credits for wind and solar production have provided an economic boost to states red and blue alike. Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa put Trump on notice, saying this year that only \u201cover my dead body\u201d\u00a0would Congress allow a repeal of the wind tax credits Trump has proposed eliminating. Still,\u00a0U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, which have been dropping for years, are projected to turn sharply upward under Trump, according to the Lux report, even as California and many other states push ahead with their climate plans.\u00a0 For starters, Trump\u2019s agenda would enable unfettered operation of America\u2019s most polluting power plants. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2013 which Trump said he will immediately kill \u2013\u00a0aimed to shut those down.\u00a0Without those federal regulations in place, states resistant to the California-type approach are free again to go their own way. Combine that with Trump\u2019s plan to strip all subsidies for green power,\u00a0and add a Trump environmental agenda that includes none of the aggressive goals Hillary Clinton set for accelerating solar installations,\u00a0and the amount of carbon released into the environment surges. The public remains alarmed by climate change, and Trump will pay a heavy political price if he proceeds, environmental groups warned.\u00a0 But even the climate contrarians at the Competitive Enterprise Institute are skeptical about how far he will go. Yeatman pointed to a postelection report in an energy industry publication that said Trump is already putting on the back burner his plan to end the wind and solar subsidies driving so much of America\u2019s green economy. And the energy plan the Trump campaign has now posted on its website also concerns him. Along with a massive surge in fossil fuel production, Trump promises to \u201cmake full use\u201d of \u201crenewable energy sources.\u201d And on Tuesday, Trump walked back a few more steps. Asked whether he was dead set on abandoning the Paris accord, the president-elect wavered. \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely,\u201d he said. \u201cI have an open mind to it.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Iraqi doctors work round the clock in hospitals outside of Mosul, Chinese students are flocking to U.S. high schools, about 7 million working-age men don\u2019t have a job and aren\u2019t looking for one, Trump the president vs. Trump the businessman, Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week, New York City has seen a surge of swastika vandalism, and how to make the most of your Thanksgiving leftovers.

Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump holds stock in the company building the disputed Dakota Access oil pipeline, and pipeline opponents warn that Trump's investments could affect any decision he makes on the $3.8 billion project as president. Concern about Trump's possible conflicts comes amid protests that unfold daily along the proposed pipeline route. The dispute over the route has intensified in recent weeks, with total arrests since August rising to 528. A recent clash near the main protest camp in North Dakota left a police officer and several protesters injured. Trump's most recent federal disclosure forms, filed in May, show he owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. That's down from between $500,000 and $1 million a year earlier. Kelcy Warren John L. Mone / AP Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren reviews documents at his office in Dallas on the Dakota Access oil pipeline that is mired in controversy after thousand of protestors have sought to block its expansion underneath a water source close to the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation in North Dakota.\u00a0 Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren reviews documents at his office in Dallas on the Dakota Access oil pipeline that is mired in controversy after thousand of protestors have sought to block its expansion underneath a water source close to the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation in North Dakota.\u00a0 (John L. Mone / AP) Trump also owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in Phillips 66, which has a one-quarter share of Dakota Access. While Trump's stake in the pipeline company is modest compared with his other assets, ethics experts say it's among dozens of potential conflicts that could be resolved by placing his investments in a blind trust, a step Trump has resisted. The Obama administration said this month it wants more study and tribal input before deciding whether to allow the partially built pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. The 1,200-mile pipeline would carry oil across four states to a shipping point in Illinois. The project has been held up while the Army Corps of Engineers consults with the Standing Rock Sioux, who believe the project could harm the tribe's drinking water and Native American cultural sites. The delay raises the likelihood that a final decision will be made by Trump, a pipeline supporter who has vowed to \"unleash\" unfettered production of oil and gas. He takes office in January. \"Trump's investments in the pipeline business threaten to undercut faith in this process \u2014 which was already frayed \u2014 by interjecting his own financial well-being into a much bigger decision,\" said Sharon Buccino, director of the land and wildlife program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

By Steven Mufson November 25 at 6:20 PM Follow @StevenMufson In the Dakota language, the word \u201coahe\u201d signifies \u201ca place to stand on.\u201d And that\u2019s what the Standing Rock Sioux and its allies in the environmental and activist movements say they are doing: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the controversial $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline. Their confrontations with police \u2014 who have responded with water cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets \u2014 have steered attention to the 1,170-mile-long oil pipeline project and its owner, Energy Transfer Partners. But the real source of Native Americans\u2019 grievance stretches back more than a century, to the original government incursions on their tribal lands. And those earlier disputes over their rights to the land, like the one over the Dakota Access pipeline, pitted the tribes against a persistent force, the Army Corps of Engineers. The federal government has been taking land from Lakota and Dakota people for 150 years, tribal leaders say, from the seizure of land in the Black Hills of South Dakota after the discovery of gold in the 1870s to the construction of dams in the Missouri River that flooded villages, timberland and farmland in the Dakotas in the 1950s. Through the ages, the warring tribes of the Northern Plains lived, hunted and fought across a sprawling expanse of land. Many were migratory, moving with the seasons. Each treaty with the U.S. government, most notably the 1851 and 1868 treaties of Fort Laramie, restricted their movement further, although they left them large areas west of the Missouri River and recognized them as sovereign nations. In freezing temperatures, police used water cannons on protesters just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota Nov. 20. In a Facebook post, law enforcement officials said they were involved in an \"ongoing riot.\" (Zoeann Murphy,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Much of this was contested, leading to Gen. George A. Custer\u2019s ill-fated military campaign to protect miners. Land was later taken to make way for homesteading. In 1889, Congress passed legislation that created the modern reservation system, pushing the Sioux, also known as Lakota, into smaller areas. And later in the 1900s, a series of dams across the Missouri River rolled back the scope of those reservations, too. \u201cThis government honors international treaties like they are the Holy Grail, but within our own homeland, they find ways to break them,\u201d said Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault, who, under the treaties and U.S. law, is the head of a domestic sovereign nation. Lake Oahe illustrates his point. The lake, the site of the current dispute, exists because of a dam project built by the Army Corps of Engineers, the same agency that has been weighing whether and where the Dakota Access pipeline could be built. Empowered by the Flood Control Act of 1944, the Army Corps erected the Oahe Dam in central South Dakota, forming a reservoir that extends about 250 miles upstream to within a short distance of Bismarck, N.D. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy dedicated the dam, hailing it as a symbol of a free society tapping its natural resources. But for the Lakota tribes, the dam didn\u2019t exploit natural resources. It buried them. The project inundated and destroyed the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\u2019s \u201cmost fertile bottom lands,\u201d home to medicinal plants, wildlife and timber, said Everett J. Iron Eyes Sr., former water and natural resource director for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and now a water consultant. In the process, he said, the Army Corps acquired 56,000 acres of land and destroyed 90 percent of the tribe\u2019s timberland. 1 of 47 On the scene as Native Americans protest construction of a pipeline in North Dakota View Photos An encampment has grown near the work site, where security guards face off with demonstrators. Caption An encampment has grown near the work site, where security guards face off with demonstrators. \u00a0Nov. 20, 2016 Police use a water cannon on demonstrators during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. Stephanie Keith/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The Army Corps simply condemned the land and paid little to no compensation. The Standing Rock Sioux sued and won compensation \u2014 $90.5 million in a trust fund from which it can draw only from the interest on the account to spend on social welfare and economic development. Iron Eyes said that the government also changed the tribe\u2019s water boundaries. Originally, according to the law passed by Congress in 1889, the tribe\u2019s territorial boundary stopped at the low water level mark on the east bank, giving it ownership of the water and river bed. After building the dam, the Army Corps seized strips of land on either side of the river. Those strips are the areas in dispute now, giving the Army Corps a central role in letting Energy Transfer Partners complete the line, or not. \u201cWhen they dammed the Missouri River, they did it specifically and purposely so that it would flood the Standing Rock reservation,\u201d said Harry Sachse, a partner at the Washington firm of Sonosky, Chambers, Sachse, Endreson & Perry who has represented other Native American tribes. \u201cSo the Standing Rock tribe still feels very abused. The government drowned all of the towns the tribe built along the river.\u201d Under the Fort Laramie treaties, the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s northern border was recognized as the Heart River, which winds up to Bismarck, about 25 miles north of the Cannonball River that was declared the northern border by an act of Congress in 1889. The pipeline battles of the past three months have taken place near the Cannonball. \u201cThey violated every treaty ever made with the tribe,\u201d Iron Eyes said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to lose sight of the greater sovereignty issue,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a senior associate at the law firm Fredericks Peebles & Morgan who has represented tribes. \u201cThat\u2019s what the [Dakota Access pipeline] fight and all the fights against these ticking environmental bombs really boil down to. To overlook that would be to not do justice to such an important cause.\u201d The Standing Rock Sioux are not alone in harboring old grievances, many involving the Army Corps and its dams, Sachse says. The Kinzua Dam in Pennsylvania on the Allegheny River, built in the 1960s, forced more than 600 Seneca families to leave their homes and submerged 10,000 acres of ancestral land. Indians say the project, built by the Army Corps, broke a 1794 treaty signed by President George Washington. The Colville Confederated Tribes sued the government over the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state, which blocked salmon fishing sites the tribes had used for centuries. The tribes were eventually awarded $52 million and a percentage of the dam\u2019s electricity, which turned out to be worth about $25 million a year, said Sachse, who represented the Colville tribe. In Minnesota this year, the Prairie Island Indian Community bought 112 acres of agricultural land near St. Paul to secure a future home. On its reservation, about 30 miles southeast of the Twin Cities, the tribe has wrestled with flooding from the Mississippi and Vermillion rivers. The reservation has about 3,100 acres of land held in trust by the U.S. government. Located in the 100-year floodplain, the land is unusable for development. In addition, increased rail traffic, including trains carrying crude oil, often blocks the only access point to Prairie Island, according to the tribe\u2019s website . Native American disputes are not just history; they are still alive. In 1980, the Supreme Court affirmed a Court of Claims ruling and awarded $106 million to the Sioux tribes for the illegal seizure of the Black Hills. \u201cA more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never, in all probability, be found in our history,\u201d the court said. But the Sioux rejected the money and continue to seek the return of the land. Will the Dakota Access pipeline take its place in a bitter history? The pipeline would carry as much as 570,000 barrels a day of shale oil from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken field to the pipeline networks in Patoka, Ill. Along the way, it crosses more than 200 waterways, including the Missouri upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s facilities for siphoning off drinking water. Energy Transfer Partners did not advance its cause when its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, said in an interview on PBS that he wished the tribe had consulted with the company earlier. Nor did Julie Fedorchak, the North Dakota Public Service Commission chair, who told NPR that the Standing Rock Sioux failed to take part in the 11-month permit process or in 30 hours of open hearings, and that their efforts to reach chairman Archambault were futile. Archambault said in an interview with The Washington Post that the tribal council had in fact met with Energy Transfer executives at the tribal headquarters in September 2014 and that the tribal leaders had clearly stated their opposition to the pipeline. The tribe had passed a resolution in 2012 opposing new pipelines and declared a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or\u201cfracking,\u201d within its borders \u201cbecause we see the destruction done to Mother Earth,\u201d Archambault added. Shale oil produced by fracking in western North Dakota is the main source of crude for the Dakota Access pipeline project. In mid-November, the tribe posted on its Facebook page a recording of the 2014 meeting, in which Archambault warned pipeline company representatives that the tribe still recognizes the Fort Laramie borders, and therefore the pipeline that the company considered 1,500 feet north of the reservation was, in fact, part of the tribe\u2019s territory. \u201cSo just that you know this is something that the tribe is not supporting,\u201d he said on the recording. Archambault, in his interview with The Post this year, said Energy Transfer Partners and public officials fundamentally didn\u2019t understand the issue around the pipeline. \u201cThey would consider us a stakeholder, but we\u2019re a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would hope and pray they would understand that and consider a more formal government-to-government relationship with the tribe rather than treat us as a stakeholder.\u201d Energy Transfer Partners, which on Monday announced a merger with Sunoco in an exchange of shares, had once hoped to keep the Dakota Access pipeline out of the limelight. It has argued that this pipeline isn\u2019t unusual. A natural gas pipeline lies along a similar route. And railroads pose similar hazards. This pipeline, the company says, is just one of hundreds of pipelines that carry crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products across the country. The Standing Rock Sioux have raised concerns about a possible pipeline leak in the Missouri River; other pipelines have leaked into rivers over the past five years, including some relatively new ones. Warren, the chief executive, says the pipeline\u2019s foes need not worry about leaks or accidents. The pipeline, he says, is made of extra-thick steel and will run 90 to 115 feet below the bottom of Lake Oahe. But the Native American opposition to the pipeline project runs much deeper than that. business ",

There are just over 4,000 political appointments to be made by the incoming Trump administration -- about 1,200 of them will require Senate confirmation -- the cabinet secretaries and their deputies, as well as those appointees who will head independent agencies, like the CIA and EPA, for instance. These nominees will go through a vetting process and Senate hearing. Trump transition to the White House - live blog A smaller number -- 353 -- do not require Senate confirmation -- those are largely the White House staff positions, according to the Center for Presidential Transition.

(Photo: NY Post) LOS ANGELES \u2014\u00a0No, despite what you read, CNN did not run porn for 30 minutes last night, as was\u00a0reported by Fox News , the\u00a0 New York Post , Variety and other news organizations, several\u00a0of which later corrected their stories. User @solikearose\u00a0tweeted that Anthony Bourdain's \"Parts Unknown,\" travel show had been replaced, instead, by 30 minutes of porn, via\u00a0the RCN Boston cable network. That tweet, bolstered by a statement from CNN that seemed to confirm the mishap,\u00a0was the basis of stories\u00a0from the U.K Independent and other outlets. The tweet with fake info lit up Twitter \u00a0(Photo: Medialite) \"Despite media reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption of CNN\u2019s programming in the Boston area last night,\" said CNN in a statement. RCN chimed in with a similar statement, \"We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned,\" it said in a tweet to @solikarose. Many of the news outlets have updated their original report with corrections or\u00a0near total rewrites. The Next Web still has the original headline about the 30 minutes of porn with an addendum (\"probably not.\") The Independent switched the headline to \" CNN\u00a0denies airing 30 minutes of hardcore porn .\" The Blaze suggests the same, but adds \"or did the media fall for a hoax?\" The original NY Post story is still up: \"CNN viewers feasted their eyes on more parts than they bargained for Thanksgiving night when they tuned in for \u201cAnthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.\u201d\u00a0Boston viewers hungry for the popular culinary travelogue instead got a hefty serving of hardcore porn for 30 minutes because of a mistake by cable provider RCN, which provides CNN\u2019s broadcasting down the East Coast.\" CNN initially seemed to confirm the mistake,\u00a0telling\u00a0Variety that the \"RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night.\" Little is known about @solikearose, but the account is now private. \"Sorry guys, weirdos sending me hate mail & dick pics in the wake of\u00a0 #bourdainporn ,\" she says on her\u00a0Twitter page. \"Good luck out there.\" But as The Verge points out, \"this is exactly how fake news spreads.\" A click-bait worthy tweet sounds like catnip to reporters, who take the info as fact, and run with it. Fake news shared on\u00a0social media, primarily Fakebook and Twitter, was rampant in the run-up in the recent presidential election, when headlines touting Hillary Clinton's sale of arms to ISIS and the Pope's supposed endorsement of Donald Trump made the rounds, even though they weren't true. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg says he is trying to get to the bottom of the fake news outbreak. \"The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,\" he wrote in a Facebook post recently. \"We take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.\" 4796 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g19YAZ ",

The French gendarmerie says a masked gunman has burst into a retirement home for monks in southern France and killed an elderly woman with a knife. The press service for the national military police couldn't immediately say whether the incident is linked to a terror act or not. (AP Photo) 0 Shares Email Police on Friday arrested a suspect in the fatal knife attack on a woman at a retirement home for Catholic missionaries in southern France after a vast manhunt, authorities said. The 47-year-old suspect \u2014 with no apparent links to Islamist extremism \u2014 was arrested about 100 meters (yards) from his home in a town not far from the scene of the attack on Thursday night, a gendarmerie press official said. The official said reports that the suspect was a former member of the French military had not yet been confirmed, adding that investigators had uncovered information that contradicted a past military link. The suspect was not identified by name in keeping with French custom. A masked intruder tied up two women at the retirement home for former missionaries in Africa. One of the women managed to call police, who found the victim, a 54-year-old employee, bound and tied up outside the building with three stab wounds, prosecutor Christophe Barret told a news conference before the arrest. Barret said the suspect was believed to be someone \"in the entourage of this retirement home.\" The retirement residence is located in Montferrer-sur-Lez, just north of Montpellier. The suspect was arrested in Saint-Mathieu-de-Treviers, a few kilometers further north. France has been in a state of emergency since the Paris attacks one year ago that killed 130, and reacted quickly to the attack. Some 130 police officers searched the area for the masked attacker on foot, in vehicles and by helicopter. Officials worked quickly to exclude a link between Islamist extremists and the retirement home attack. \"There is no element linking the facts with Islamist terrorism,\" Barret, the prosecutor, said. What drove the masked intruder to attack and kill remained a mystery. A car found near the retirement residence helped identify the suspect, the prosecutor said, adding that an air gun and other elements were found inside the vehicle. A gendarmerie official close to the investigation who had asked to remain anonymous while the manhunt was underway said military decorations were among the items. The residence, called \"Green Oaks,\" is operated by the African Missions Society, and takes in retired priests, nuns and others who have worked on missions in Africa. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH Wayne State Police Officer Dies After Being Shot 0 Shares Email The man suspected of killing a Wayne State University police officer in Detroit has been charged with first-degree murder , prosecutors said today. The suspect, identified as 31-year-old DeAngelo Lamar Davis of Detroit, was arraigned this morning in 34th District Court in Romulus, Michigan, on charges of first-degree murder as well as murder of a police officer, felon in possession of a firearm and two counts of felony firearm, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. Wayne State Police Officer Dies After Being Shot in Head Davis is accused of shooting officer Collin Rose in the head during a traffic stop while the officer was patrolling off-campus in Detroit on Tuesday evening, prosecutors said. Rose was reportedly attempting to take Davis into custody at the time. Davis, who police said was riding a bicycle, allegedly fled the scene on foot after the shooting. He was taken into custody Tuesday night after an intensive manhunt, police said. Rose, 28, a five-year veteran of the force, was transported to the hospital in critical condition and underwent surgery for his wound, police said. He died Wednesday. \"Universally, Officer Rose was respected, admired and one that had an excellent work ethic,\" Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement today while announcing the charges against Davis. \"Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Officer Rose. All of us at the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office grieve along with the Wayne State University community and the law enforcement community. This case strongly illustrates the dangers that police officers face every minute of every day,\" Worthy added. ABC News' Dominick Proto contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Nov 25, 2016 4:49 PM EST COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The white man charged in the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church last year is competent to stand trial, a federal judge ruled Friday. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel\u2019s decision clears the way for jury selection to restart Monday in the hate-crimes trial of 22-year-old Dylann Roof. The judge had delayed the process of narrowing the final jury pool on Nov. 7 when Roof\u2019s lawyers suggested their client either didn\u2019t understand the charges against him or couldn\u2019t properly help them with his defense. The lawyers did not say what led them to question Roof\u2019s fitness for trial. In a similarity with the Boston Marathon bombing trial, the key question now will be whether Roof will receive the death penalty in the likely event that he\u2019s convicted, CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid reports. View Gallery Police lead suspected shooter Dylann Roof into the courthouse in Shelby, North Carolina, on June 18, 2015. Reuters/Jason Miczek Roof is charged in federal court with hate crimes, obstruction of religion and other counts in connection with the June 17, 2015, attack at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The decision came after Gergel wrapped up a hastily called two-day hearing to determine if Roof is mentally fit to stand trial. The judge said he took the rare step of keeping the hearing closed to the public and media because Roof made statements to a psychologist that might not be legal to use at his trial and could taint potential jurors. The judge said Friday that he refrained from releasing a transcript of the hearing for the same reason, reversing an earlier pledge to release a redacted transcript. Family members of the victims have complained about the secrecy surrounding the proceedings, but Gergel maintains that the steps he has taken are to ensure that Roof receives a fair trial and that pre-trial exposure doesn\u2019t provide grounds for an appeal. 17 Photos South Carolina church shooting victims At Roof\u2019s competency hearing, Gergel heard testimony from psychologist James Ballenger and four other unnamed witnesses and reviewed sworn statements from three others, the judge wrote in his order. Roof also has already been found competent in state court, where prosecutors plan a second death penalty trial on nine counts of murder. According to police, Roof sat through nearly an hour of prayer and Bible study at the church with its pastor and 11 others before pulling a gun from his fanny pack near the end of the class and firing dozens of shots. Roof hurled racial insults at the six women and three men he is charged with of killing and the three people left alive, authorities said. He said he left the three unharmed so they could tell the world the shootings were because he hated black people. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger November 25 at 5:45 PM Follow @PostRoz Follow @thamburger Days after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, a news agency in the former Soviet republic of Georgia reported that a long-stalled plan for a Trump-branded tower in a seaside Georgian resort town was now back on track. Likewise, the local developer of a Trump Tower planned for \u00adBuenos Aires announced last week, three days after Trump spoke with Argentina\u2019s president, that the long-delayed project was moving ahead. Meanwhile, foreign government leaders seeking to speak with Trump have reached out to the president-elect through his overseas network of business partners, an unusually informal process for calls traditionally coordinated with the U.S. State Department. All of it highlights the muddy new world that Trump\u2019s election may usher in \u2014 a world in which his stature as the U.S. president, the status of his private ventures across the globe and his relationships with foreign business partners and the leaders of their governments could all become intertwined. In that world, Trump could personally profit if his election gives a boost to his brand and results in its expansion overseas. His political rise could also enrich his overseas business partners \u2014 and, perhaps more significantly, enhance their statuses in their home countries and alter long-standing diplomatic traditions by establishing them as new conduits for public business. Donald Trump is greeted by Vera Kobalia, left, in April 2012, upon arriving in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. At the time, she was Georgia's minister of economy and sustainable development. Georigan businessman Giorgi Ramishvili is on the right. (David Mdzinarishvili/REUTERS) It is also possible, of course, that a controversial presidency inflaming international opposition could cause damage to the brand. Trump has done little to set boundaries between his personal and official business since winning the presidency. He has indicated that his children may take over the business, but he has also appointed them to formal roles with his presidential transition and included daughter Ivanka on calls with world leaders. And he has continued to offer signs that he may remain engaged, at least on some level, in his private ventures. For instance, Trump took a break from selecting his Cabinet last week for a brief meeting in his Trump Tower office with the developers of a Trump project in Pune, India, shaking hands and posing for photos with the men. When asked about the meeting, Trump told the New York Times: \u201cI mean, what am I going to say? \u2018I\u2019m not going to talk to you, I\u2019m not going to take pictures\u2019?\u201d Trump also acknowledged to the Times, after he received a congratulatory visit the weekend after the election from British politician Nigel Farage, that he \u201cmight have\u201d encouraged the leader of the UK Independence Party to oppose offshore windmill farms, like one he has fought off the Scottish coast because he believes it will mar the view from his Trump Turnberry golf resort there. Trump has reacted defensively to suggestions that his conversations about his private business are somehow inappropriate. He told the Times this week, \u201cthe law\u2019s totally on my side. The president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest.\u201d On Monday evening, he tweeted: \u201cPrior to the election, it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!\u201d Donald Trump and George Ramishvili, chairman of the development company Silk Road Group, appeared together at a news conference in New York in March 2011, at which they discussed plans to build a Trump-branded tower in Georgia. (Mark Lennihan/ASSOCIATED PRESS) Ethics experts say that if Trump takes no action to distance himself from his business holdings, he is likely to face questions about whether he is pursuing policy in the national interest or for his own business advantage. It is also possible that Trump could run afoul of a constitutional provision prohibiting presidents from accepting favors, or \u201cemoluments,\u201d from foreign leaders. Trump representatives did not respond to questions this week about his business interests in Argentina, Georgia or elsewhere. [ FACT CHECKER: Trump\u2019s claim that \u2018the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest\u2019 ] It is unclear how much real progress Trump\u2019s election has prompted for some of these foreign projects, several of which had stalled in recent years. Some of the promises of renewed activity could be the work of foreign partners who have paid for the use of his name and who may be looking to take advantage of the moment as a marketing opportunity. The Trump project in Argentina, for instance, has not been issued new permits since Election Day, a city official in Buenos Aires said. But public reports that the project is moving ahead show how foreign developers could stand to benefit if their governments were to grease the skids for Trump-branded projects as a way to curry favor with the new American president. In Argentina, President Mauricio Macri connected by phone with President-elect Trump and his daughter Ivanka on Nov.\u00a014. Three days later, Trump\u2019s development partner in Argentina, the YY\u00a0Development Group, put out word that the $100\u00a0million project was moving forward, featuring on its website a South American news report touting the progress. \u201cThe magnate Donald Trump expands his \u2018ultraexclusive\u2019 towers in South America,\u201d the story read. The development firm\u2019s chief executive, Felipe Yaryuri, has touted his personal relationship with the Trumps, particularly with Trump\u2019s son Eric. He was in Trump campaign headquarters on election night, posting a photo of himself with Eric Trump and tweeting that he had breakfast with Eric Trump the day after the election. Again, Trump officials declined to respond to inquiries about the tweets. Yaryuri declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that his company has filed permit requests with the city of Buenos Aires that are awaiting approval. A city official said the request was made earlier this year but that no determination had been made. Macri, the president, denied reports in local media that Trump had mentioned the project to him in their post-election conversation. However, a spokesman confirmed that Macri had relied on the Trump business partner to put him in touch with the newly elected president, a sign of how the local developer\u2019s stature has risen since the American election. [ Argentina denies news report that Trump sought personal favors ] Entanglements between Trump\u2019s business interests and his official relationships also appear possible in Georgia, a U.S. ally where many are fearful of Trump\u2019s potential rapprochement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump swept into the Black Sea resort town of Batumi in 2012 and announced that a new luxury Trump Tower would soon rise from the empty field in which he stood with the country\u2019s then-president. Once scheduled to break ground in 2013, however, the project was halted by an economic downturn, a local land planning dispute and, some analysts said, the electoral defeat of then-Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, a personal friend of Trump\u2019s who had championed the deal. In recent months, long-standing roadblocks to the project\u2019s groundbreaking resolved without government assistance, said \u00adGiorgi Rtskhiladze, a U.S.-based partner working with the local developer, the Silk Road Group, which paid Trump a licensing fee to put his name on the building. Rtskhiladze said the developers informed the Trump Organization in September or October that the project could now proceed. After Trump was elected, he said he emailed a congratulatory note to Trump\u2019s adult children and to a top Trump Organization executive \u2014 and reiterated that developers are prepared to move forward. He said Trump executives have indicated the project is being \u201creevaluated,\u201d as they discuss how his company will be operated after Trump takes office. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Rtskhiladze said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for them to give us the green light.\u201d He said it would add distinction to the project to bear the name of the U.S. president. \u201cThere\u2019s only one word: Pride,\u201d he said of how he would feel to help construct a building bearing Trump\u2019s name. \u201cWhat else can you possibly feel? You can\u2019t even imagine it, and then suddenly it happens.\u201d Although the United States stood beside Georgia when it was invaded by Russia in 2008, leaders of the small nation fear that an ascendant Russia could escalate simmering hostilities. The current Georgian government is led by political rivals of Saakashvili\u2019s, the president who brought Trump to Georgia in 2012 but who has since left the country. Georgian officials antsy with Trump\u2019s rhetoric on Russia and eager to forge their own good relationship with the new American president could be tempted to curry favor by pushing ahead with the proposed 47-story building bearing his name, predicted Lincoln Mitchell, an American expert on Georgian politics who served as a paid adviser to the current governing party in 2012. \u201cThe gray areas Trump has between where his job as president ends and where his business interests begin, that\u2019s normal in that part of the world. Renewing this deal, that\u2019s just an obvious thing to do,\u201d said Mitchell, who opposed Trump\u2019s election, quitting his job this summer writing for the New York Observer, which is owned by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Indeed, on Georgian state television last week, a U.S.-based Georgian real estate entrepreneur enthusiastically predicted that Trump\u2019s win would mean a new era of economic cooperation and growth for both countries. In a separate interview with The Washington Post, the entrepreneur, Roman Bokeria, expressed optimism that a new Trump Tower would soon rise in Batumi. \u201cCutting the ribbon on a new Trump Tower in Georgia will be a symbol of victory for all of the free world,\u201d said Bokeria, chief executive of Miami Red Square Realty. Rtskhiladze said the project will move forward based only on the \u201cattractive business case\u201d that can be made for it, not any government intervention. While Trump and his advisers have noted that U.S. conflict of interest and gift laws do not apply to the president, a bipartisan group of ethics experts has emphasized that the U.S. Constitution prohibits the president from accepting favors \u2014 emoluments is the constitutional term \u2014 from foreign leaders. \u201cIt appears from the reports we\u2019re seeing this week that Donald Trump may be opening up a wholesale emoluments business,\u201d said Norm Eisen, former White House ethics counsel to President Obama, who is joining with colleagues from both parties to sound an alarm about the perils of Trump\u2019s business holdings. \u201cThe pattern we are seeing this week of stalled Trump projects jump-starting and the president-elect himself conceding that he may have raised business issues with a foreign official is stunning,\u201d he said.

    "text": "$20K Reward Offered for 2 Men Who Escaped California Jail By The Associated Press SAN JOSE, Calif. \u0097 Nov 25, 2016, 7:26 PM ET 0 Shares Email Authorities offered a $20,000 reward Friday for information leading to the capture of two dangerous prisoners who broke out of a Northern California jail on Thanksgiving Eve after sawing through bars across a second-floor window. Authorities believe the men are still in the San Francisco Bay area based on numerous sightings reported since they escaped late Wednesday night, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said. \"I want to remind the community that these are dangerous people,\" she said. \"They are not to be approached. Please just dial 911 .\" Rogelio Chavez and Laron Campbell escaped with two other prisoners by cutting through the bars and rappelling to the ground. The others were quickly apprehended. Chavez, 33, of San Jose and Campbell, 26, of Palo Alto are facing possible life sentences if convicted of the burglary, extortion, false imprisonment and other charges against them. The Associated Press This photo provided by the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office shows Rogelio Chavez. The Associated Press This photo provided by the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office shows Laron Campbell. At one point in the search, police dogs picked up their scent but lost it near a river. \"We will find these two, and any person who is harboring or aiding and abetting in their escape we will attempt to prosecute,\" Smith said. She added that authorities haven't found the tools used to cut through the bars and don't know how they were obtained. \"That's one of our big concerns,\" the sheriff said. \"To think that we have inmates in there with those kinds of tools is pretty disheartening.\" The four prisoners who escaped were being held in a dormitory designed to hold 20 people. Conditions there are often loud, Smith said, making it hard for guards to hear any suspicious noise. The section of the jail was built in the 1950s and doesn't have cameras. \"From the officers' station you cannot see in,\" she said, adding there are plans to install cameras. The escape was discovered by a deputy patrolling the jail's perimeter. \"He kind of thought he saw some movement in the shadows, looked up and saw some bedding in the window,\" Sheriff's Sgt. Rich Glennon said. Chavez has a distinctive face tattoo resembling an inky gash going through his left eye. He was booked into the jail in August. Campbell, who stands 6-feet-4, had been jailed there since February 2015. Glennon said deputies were being assisted by other local and federal law enforcement agencies. A similar escape was made from a Southern California jail in January by three men authorities later determined had planned it for weeks. They cut through the main Orange County jail's fifth-floor bars with tools smuggled in by an outsider, rappelled to the ground and escaped in a get-away car. They later abducted a cab driver and forced him to drive them to Northern California. The escape began to unravel when one of the men, fearful the others would kill the driver, fled to Southern California with him and surrendered. The others were captured in San Francisco. 0 Shares ",

Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein during the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 27, 2016, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Patrick T. Fallon / AFP/Getty Images) Karoun DemirjianThe Washington Post An election recount will take place soon in Wisconsin, after former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein filed a petition Friday with the state's Elections Commission, the first of three states where she has promised to contest the election result. The move from Stein, who raised millions since her Wednesday announcement that she would seek recounts of Donald Trump's apparent election victories in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, came just 90 minutes before Wisconsin's 5 p.m. Friday deadline to file a petition. Now it will keep some hope alive for many Hillary Clinton supporters for another few weeks while Wisconsin recounts ballots before a Dec. 13 deadline. Trump scored upset victories in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and seems on the path to declare a victory in Michigan as well, although the result of the election in that state will not be certified officially until Monday. Had Clinton won those three states, previously seen as part of the Democrats' \"firewall,\" she would have secured enough votes in the Electoral College to win the election. Stein announced her intention to file the petition following reports that a group of data experts and election lawyers were urging Clinton to demand a recount in those three states, on suspicion that a cyberattack could have manipulated the results of the election in those states. While the group had no specific proof of hacking, they noted irregularities suggesting Clinton routinely did more poorly in Wisconsin counties that used voting machines, as opposed to those that relied on paper ballots. Trump secured a total of 1,404,000 votes in Wisconsin, according to the commission; Clinton had 1,381,823. Stein secured 31,006 votes. To be on the safe side, the group of experts urged a recount - but it was Stein's campaign that ended up demanding one, soliciting at first $2.5 million and later up to $7 million to fund the recounts. As of Friday evening, Stein's campaign reported taking in over $5.25 million in recount-related donations - the most by a third-party candidate in history. Wisconsin has the first deadline of the three states in question. If Stein's campaign wishes to file recount petitions in the other states as promised, she must do so by Monday to meet Pennsylvania's deadline, and Wednesday to meet Michigan's deadline. ",

    "text": "Students complained about erratic driving before bus wreck Five children killed in Chattanooga bus crash Chattanooga police say an elementary school bus crash killed five children and sent at least 23 people to area hospitals. Chattanooga police say an elementary school bus crash killed five children and sent at least 23 people to area hospitals. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Students and administrators raised concerns about a Tennessee school bus driver's behavior behind the wheel in the weeks before a crash that killed six children. Police have charged driver Johnthony Walker with vehicular homicide after the Chattanooga crash. Federal authorities said Walker was driving off the designated bus route when he wrecked on a curvy road while carrying 37 children on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School. Records released by the school district Friday include two written statements by students complaining about Walker's driving. \"The bus driver drives fast,\" one student wrote earlier this month. \"It feels like the bus is going to flip over... When someone is in the aisle he stops the bus and he makes people hit their heads.\" Another student wrote: \"The bus driver was doing sharp turns and he made me fly over to the next seat. We need seat belts.\" On Nov. 2, a school official boarded the bus after the driver complained that students were not listening him. One student had complained about the heat on the bus and cursed about it to the bus driver. (Tribune news services) \"The driver was now visibly upset and continued on by saying that he had another job and driving this bus was just a part-time job for him,\" wrote Carlis Shackelford, a behavior specialist at the school. \"Driver stated that he could just leave him at the school. He then stated 'or I can just leave the student on the bus and I will get off the bus and leave the school.'\" \"Driver stated that he did not care about the students and proceeded to tell the students he did not care about them,\" Shackelford wrote. The school district's transportation supervisor, Benjamin Coulter, responded that \"we are addressing the issue with the driver.\" National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart said in a news conference earlier this week that Walker had had taken on a second job at an Amazon fulfillment center, and part of the agency's investigation will look at whether fatigue played a role in the wreck. The bus driver had also complained to administrators that students would not listen to him when he told them not stand in the bus or sit with their backs facing the front. The driver submitted 10 names of students he said were misbehaving. The transportation supervisor responded that the driver may have had some legitimate safety concerns but that the driver shouldn't report so many students. \"I don't want the driver to become discouraged, but he can't be turning 10 referrals in a day to you, either,\" Coulter wrote. At least five children were killed and many more injured when a school bus crashed in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Nov. 21, 2016. Woodmore Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran asked for video of the bus leaving campus, noting that a few days earlier \"the driver, in my opinion, was driving way too fast when he pulled out of our school.\" It's unclear what the video showed; hyperlinks to it are redacted in the records. On Nov. 16, Adamson-Cothran wrote to Coulter to tell him six students had reported that the driver \"was swerving and purposely trying to cause them to fall today.\" Walker was in custody at the Hamilton County Correctional Facility on Friday and had a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Jail records do not indicate whether he has an attorney. The complaints about Walker appear to have begun in September when a parent wrote a letter to complain that the driver had cursed her kids and slammed on the brakes, causing them to hit their heads and fall out of their seats. The parent wrote that if it happened again, she would take it upon herself \"to beat his (expletive) my damn self.\" In the days immediately after the crash, school officials repeatedly declined to comment on whether anyone had complained or how they responded. The correspondence about the driver was released after public records requests by The Associated Press and other media outlets. ",

Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump walks through the lobby of The New York Times building following a meeting with editors at the paper last week. Spencer Platt/Getty Images We are all in transition these days. Washington is getting used to the idea of a new and very different president, who is getting used to the idea of Washington. One thing we are learning about the mind of President-elect Donald Trump is that his train of thought rarely runs on a single track. Trump Chooses Betsy DeVos For Education Secretary Consider the Cabinet announcements this week, dramatically at odds with those of the previous week. Trump named South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as United Nations ambassador and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos as secretary of education. Critics will no doubt dissect these choices, including the curious fit between the resumes and the new duties of Haley and Ben Carson, who has been discussed as secretary of housing and urban development. DeVos will displease teacher unions, among others. But all are mainstream GOP picks who might have been named by any new Republican president, or by the party's national chairman, Reince Priebus, who happens to be the new White House chief of staff. And all stand in contrast to the hardcore crew that emerged in Trump's first week of cabinetmaking. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Chooses South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley As U.N. Ambassador The biggest waves followed the emergence of former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon as the president's senior adviser. But Bannon, who had been CEO of the Trump campaign since August, was soon followed by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, former Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as director of the CIA. Trump also introduced his old pal Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, as a potential secretary of state. Many noticed that these early picks were all white males, but the selections also shared an early and constant faith in Trump's candidacy and a deep animosity toward the administration of President Obama \u2014 especially his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. Bannon and Breitbart have made a crusade of prosecuting Clinton, and Giuliani has been on the anti-Clinton bus for many years. Sessions was not only Trump's first (and almost only) backer in the Senate, he has been a Clinton antagonist from the 1990s on. Pompeo was one of two Republicans who refused to accept the report of the special congressional probe into the 2012 Benghazi tragedy because its scathing report was not critical enough of Hillary Clinton. Trump Names Picks For National Security Adviser, Attorney General, CIA Director Beyond the Cabinet picks there were the media stories about alt-right white nationalists rallying near the White House and giving Nazi salutes for the cameras. Trump himself got into the act, as usual via Twitter, denouncing the cast of Hamilton for sending a message from the stage to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and snarling at a parody of himself on Saturday Night Live. For a few days, exultation ruled on the right, while more traditional conservatives shuddered. And of course everyone who thought Trump could never be president in the first place was simply in shock. But just as this narrative sank in, Trump switched to diversity and moderation in the second wave of Cabinet choices. Even more jarring was the reversal on the media front. On Monday, Trump and Priebus arranged a sit-down with The New York Times. Polls Suggest Americans Warming To Donald Trump, But With Reservations If not quite the nemesis of candidate Trump, the Times has surely been one of his most strident critics. The editors and writers who attended the meeting showed no sign of repentance, yet also seemed open to the new reality. The man they said could not be president is going to be president. For his part, Trump offered up several gestures of accommodation. In addition to admitting he reads the Times (voraciously, by some accounts), he called it \"a great, great American jewel, a world jewel\" as though he had not called it \"the failing NYTimes\" on Twitter that very morning. Telling the journalists \"I hope we can all get along,\" Trump seemed to have forgotten the Times editorial board called him \"the worst [presidential] nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.\" The Times' coverage of the confab spoke of \"hope\" and \"signs of moderation.\" Trump said he was keeping \"an open mind\" about climate change, had turned against the idea of torturing terror suspects and no longer wished to pursue the criminal prosecution of Hillary Clinton as he had promised to do in their second debate. On Conflict Of Interest And Climate Change: What Trump Told 'Times' Journalists So when people talk about the presidential transition period, is it Trump going through a transition or is it the rest of us? For many who had thought they knew what to expect \u2014 either from the election itself or from a prospective Trump presidency \u2014 this is a time of transition to reality. He may not be the deranged demagogue feared by his opponents, or the agent of the right's revenge \u2014 and least of all the populist hero of forgotten America. What is necessary now is a profound change of perspective for the vast majority of us who have gazed upon the Trump phenomenon all year with disbelief. That includes those who thought he could never be nominated, or never make it through a fall campaign, or accumulate enough votes in the Electoral College. It also includes those who thought they knew what a Trump presidency would look like, because that is still a work very much in progress. Not Afraid To Ruffle Feathers: How Michael Flynn Became A Trump Confidant Some therapists speak of \"radical acceptance.\" Oversimplified, the phrase implies a rigorous mental determination to meet head on the most powerful negatives in our lives: grief, loss, disease, disappointment. All of us experience these emotions, in varying degrees at various times. But for many, they are a continuing, even lifelong challenge. Attempting to deny that something has happened, or to find some exemption from the consequences, only prolongs the worst phase of the struggle. There seemed to be something of that at work in Trump's meeting at the Times. How that specific relationship develops may be an indicator of Trump's acceptance by the media and of the media. But ultimately, the more important determination will take place among the voters \u2014 including those who voted for Trump as well as those who did not. ",

Acting Atlantic County Prosecutor Diane Ruberton said the shooting happened around 1 a.m. outside the Macy's store at the Hamilton Mall in Mays Landing, about 12 miles west of Atlantic City . Twenty-one-year-old Demond Cottman, of Atlantic City, was shot multiple times and pronounced dead at the scene. Twenty-six-year-old Shadi Cottman, of Clayton, was shot in the leg and was listed in stable condition. Authorities haven't identified any suspects or said what may have sparked the shooting. Demond Cottman was a 2013 graduate of Atlantic City High School, where he was a standout football player and runner, and he recently became a father and was an electrical apprentice, a family member told The Press of Atlantic City. He graduated from basic training in the U.S. Air National Guard in 2014, the newspaper reported. The Macy's store had opened at 5 p.m. Thursday. The mall, which was open from 7 p.m. to midnight Thursday, reopened at 6 a.m. for Black Friday shoppers. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show Demond Cottman is 21, not 20, and to show Ruberton is acting prosecutor, not prosecutor. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Susan Page, USA Today's Washington bureau chief, joins \"CBS This Morning\" from Washington to discuss third party candidate Jill Stein's push for ... What happens next? The recount is expected to begin late next week, after the Stein campaign pays the recount fee, which is still be calculated.\u00a0 Early estimates suggest the cost of the recount could reach the $1 million range, and Stein\u2019s campaign will have to pay for it under Wisconsin\u2019s rules. If the margin had been under 0.5 percent, the state would pay for the recount, but the current margin of 27,257 is just under one percent -- the tally currently stands at 1,409,467 for Mr. Trump and 1,382,210 for Clinton. Money won\u2019t be a problem -- Stein has so far raised over $5 million for recount efforts in three states including Wisconsin, and she has now specifically set aside $2.5 million for that effort. Haas noted in the commission\u2019s statement that the last statewide recount was in 2011 after the Supreme Court election, and that cost over half a million dollars. That election had about 1.5 million votes, roughly half as many as the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin. Over 100 reporting units from across the state have been randomly selected for audits of their voting equipment -- this has already begun. All ballots will be examined to determine voter intent before being retabulated, the statement said. And the canvassers will also examine poll lists, absentee ballots and provisional ballots as part of the recount. Should the candidates disagree with the result of the recount, they are able to appeal in circuit court within five days of the completion of the recount. \u00a0Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have yet to weigh in on the effort. Stein is seeking recounts in three states: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Michigan has not yet been called, and it\u2019s the closest of the three states. If the three states were to move into Clinton\u2019s column, she would win, with 278 electoral votes, but this seems very unlikely. It\u2019s rare that recounts change the result of a race. \u00a0 Wisconsin, worth 10 electoral votes, has never held a presidential recount, but the effort isn\u2019t without precedent. In 2004, the Green Party did succeed in obtaining a recount in Ohio in the presidential race. The New York Times noted at the time that the statewide recount of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties resulted in a net difference of 285 votes, meaning that George W. Bush beat John Kerry in Ohio by 118,457 votes, instead of 118,775. The recount concluded on Dec. 28, 2004, nearly two months after the election took place.

But after assisting in a federal drug raid early one morning last month, he seemed out of sorts. \"He wouldn't drink water. He would release his toy very easily. And he was looking lethargic, almost sedated,\" said Detective Andy Weiman, the head of dog training for the Broward County Sheriff's Office. \"We knew something was wrong.\" Primus was rushed to a local animal hospital. By the time he arrived 10 minutes later, the German short-haired pointer was in serious distress \u2014 his tongue was hanging out of his mouth, his breathing had slowed dramatically and he seemed to be staring off into the distance. \"He had to be carried in,\" Weiman said. These were classic signs of a drug overdose, and it turned out that while Primus and two other dogs sniffed their way through the suspect's house, they were exposed to unseen fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin sold on the streets. Fentanyl, much of it coming from Mexico and China, has killed hundreds of users, including music legend Prince , since its availability spiked in 2013. But the Drug Enforcement Administration says it also poses a \"grave threat\" to first responders and law enforcement officers \u2014 human and canine. It's so potent that a few grains can be deadly. It can be ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. And because dealers cut other drugs with it, fentanyl is often a hidden menace, especially for dogs using their noses to pick up a scent. Fentanyl Citrate Joe Amon / Denver Post via Getty Images In the Broward County raid, investigators believed there was likely no fentanyl at the site because the supplier was arrested weeks before the search warrant was executed. The handlers of Primus and his fellow K-9 unit members Packer and Finn swept the house looking for any dangers before the dogs were sent in. \"If fentanyl is loose in an environment, it can spread out where a dog can absorb it through his pads. He could sniff it up through his jowls,\" Weiman said. \"And fentanyl is so toxic, so strong that the very smallest amount of it \u2014 that you couldn't even see \u2014 could affect the dog. You wouldn't know they've even ingested it.\" At Coral Springs Animal Hospital, staffers who examined Primus and the other dogs immediately realized they were dealing with classic opioid overdoses and that speed was critical. \"Usually when a person dies of an opioid overdose, they stop breathing. Same with animals,\" said veterinarian Christopher McLaughlin. \"And the treatment for dogs is the same as it is for people.\" Primus, a K-9 dog who overdosed on Fentanyl. NBC News Narcan, the brand name of the opioid antagonist naloxone, is metabolized as quickly as fentanyl and can reverse an overdose if administered in time. All three dogs got shots of it and perked up within a few minutes. \"By 4 p.m. that afternoon he was fine,\" Weiman said of Primus, who is a currency detection dog. \"And we went back to work the next day.\" Even before Primus' brush with death, police officers across the country knew fentanyl in powder or pill form could be hazardous during a raid. In August, two Atlantic County, New Jersey, detectives were hospitalized after inhaling the pain killer when a puff of it escaped from a plastic bag of heroin and cocaine during a field test. \"I felt like my body was shutting down,\" Detective Eric Price said of the experience. \"I thought I was dying.\" Play ",

Try 'Green Friday' at legal marijuana stores Trevor Hughes , USA TODAY 4:21 p.m. EST November 25, 2016 A cannabis buyer reads an informational leaflet given to customers by a Native Roots dispensary store worker during his purchase. Because marijuana laws vary from state-to-state -- and because so many buyers in Colorado are tourists -- stores heavily emphasize education. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) DENVER \u2013 Move over Black Friday, because there\u2019s a new way to celebrate the start of the holiday season: Green Friday. Marijuana stores around the country have been offering discounts, sales and other incentives to bring in cannabis buyers over the long Thanksgiving weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a baby walking into a candy store,\u201d said Dallas resident Mike Ivy, 27, after he and two friends spent hundreds of dollars at a Native Roots dispensary in downtown Denver. The three men were visiting Colorado specifically to check out the state\u2019s legal recreational marijuana, buying joints, edibles, a bong and flower marijuana. Last year, it was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving \u2013 Weed Wednesday \u2013 that saw the largest increase in sales over a normal day: a 55% increase in transactions and a 25% increase in average order size, said the marijuana-services company Baker. Store workers reported brisk pre-Thanksgiving sales of marijuana-infused candies or other foods known as edibles . Last year, sales at Oregon\u2019s dispensaries rose 14% higher than an average day, and Colorado followed with a 7.01% increase in sales, Baker\u2019s analysis found. April 20, known as 4/20, remains the biggest marijuana sales day nationally, said Baker. Marijuana flower or \"bud\" on display at the Native Roots cannabis dispensary in Denver. \u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) Inside the Native Roots store, manager Brandon Maniez watched as budtenders explained different strains to customers and advised first-time edibles users to take things slowly. Edibles can be highly potent, and it\u2019s hard for many people to judge their consumption because they might not take effect for up to two hours. Tourists represent a large proportion of the store\u2019s customers, and a steady stream of buyers filtered through the secure doors to have their IDs checked and rechecked before being allowed to buy. \u201cThis is like a dream come true for a lot of people,\u201d Maniez said. \u201cDrinking is always the socially acceptable thing, but around here, so is cannabis.\u201d Next Thanksgiving may see even more legal marijuana stores across the country, following votes to legalize recreational cannabis in California, Maine and Massachusetts.

Police said Sherri Papini, 34, who was bound in restraints, flagged down a passing motorist, who immediately alerted law enforcement. \"We are ecstatic to report that Sherri Papini has been located and has been reunited with her family on this day of Thanksgiving,\" Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko told reporters Thursday during a news conference. The sheriff said that he did not yet know who the captor or captors were, what the motive was or where Papini had been held these three weeks. Sherri Papini Andrew Seng / The Sacramento Bee A \"missing\" sign for Mountain Gate, Calif., resident Sherri Papini, 34, is placed along side Sunrise Drive, near the location where the mom of two is believed to have gone missing while on a afternoon jog on Nov. 2.\u00a0 A \"missing\" sign for Mountain Gate, Calif., resident Sherri Papini, 34, is placed along side Sunrise Drive, near the location where the mom of two is believed to have gone missing while on a afternoon jog on Nov. 2.\u00a0 (Andrew Seng / The Sacramento Bee) He released few details, explaining it is an ongoing police investigation, and he asked the media to respect the family's privacy at this time. The sheriff said Papini, from the Redding area, had gone for a late-morning jog Nov. 2 while her husband, Keith, was at work; when she did not pick up her children from day care or return home that evening, her husband started to worry. He started searching for Papini, Bosenko told reporters, and found her cellphone and ear buds about a mile from their home. The Shasta County Sheriff's Office listed Papini as a missing person who was at risk and search-and-rescue teams conducted both ground and aerial searches throughout the area, authorities said in a news release at the time. The sheriff said throughout that tragic time, Papini's family members and friends were pleading for her safe return. A GoFundMe page, which was created to help raise funds for search-and-rescue efforts, garnered more than $49,000. A Facebook group called Help Find Sherri Papini was set up to raise awareness about her disappearance and keep people informed of developments in her case.

Keith learned that the children had not been picked up from day care as customary and subsequently checked his find my I-phone app and located Sherri's phone near the intersection of Old Oregon Trail and Sunrise Drive in Redding. \"Sherri was not at the location and he called 911 for assistance. The children were picked up from day care by family and are safe. \"Deputies have searched in the area and learned that Sherri was last seen on Sunrise Drive at approximately 2:00 p.m. jogging/walking alone, which is normal for her. Sherri was last seen wearing a pink running top. Sherri is described as a 34 year old, white female, 5'04: tall, 100 pounds, blonde hair and blue eyes. Family has not heard from Sherri and she is considered a missing person/at risk. \"Sherri does not have any known medical or mental health issues. --- Bosenko told reporters that about 4:30 a.m. Thursday the Shasta County Sheriff's Office learned that Papini had been found safe near Interstate 5 in Yolo County, not far from Sacramento. Papini had suffered injuries, Bosenko said, though he would not say what the injuries were or exactly how she was restrained; she was taken to an undisclosed hospital for treatment, he said. Bosenko said Papini was able to speak with her husband on a law enforcement officer's cellphone. He met her at the hospital, where he has been \"at his wife's side,\" Bosenko said. When asked by reporters how Papini is doing, Bosenko said, \"Obviously she is very relieved to be returned home safely and be reunited with her husband.\" After Papini's homecoming was announced, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office wrote on Facebook: \"It's an absolute miracle, and on Thanksgiving Day.\" The sheriff stressed that the case is still an active investigation and said he \"will not rest until Sherri's captor or captors are identified and brought to justice.\" Authorities are searching for two Hispanic women in a dark-colored SUV; they are considered armed and dangerous, police said. Bosenko did not elaborate on the women's relationship to the case. \"Even though Sherri has been located and reunited with her family, this investigation is far from over; this has only begun a new chapter in the investigation,\" Bosenko said. \"As details come to the surface, we will work to keep the public informed. There is sensitive information that is being withheld at this time - I'm not able to put out. And please respect this until such time when we're able to make an arrest and bring these criminals to justice in Sherri's abduction.\" Bosenko said law enforcement officers are \"overjoyed\" that Papini is home. \"This investigation has not only touched our entire community,\" he said, \"but has circulated the nation as well.\" ",

    "text": "California Police Officer in Critical Condition After Being Assaulted With Skateboard By Catherine Thorbecke Nov 25, 2016, 4:19 PM ET 0 Shares A California police officer who was assaulted with a skateboard on Thanksgiving Day is in critical condition, according to the South San Francisco Police Department. The officer, who was not identified, sustained a major head injury and remains hospitalized, police said today. The incident occurred on Thursday at approximately 2:20 p.m. Pacific time in South San Francisco, after the officer was waved down by someone who was reporting a person causing a disturbance at a local business, South San Francisco Police Chief Jeff Azzopardi said at a news conference today. \"Several patrons reported a subject acting aggressively and irrationally. The officer made contact with the suspect, who immediately became confrontational. During the contact, the suspect attempted to flee from the officer,\" Azzopardi said. \"After a short foot chase, the subject turned on the officer and intentionally struck him in the head with a skateboard, knocking him unconscious.\" Florida Boy Calls 911 to Invite Police Officers to Thanksgiving Dinner He continued, \"The subject continued running and was taken into custody moments later by additional South San Francisco police officers. \"The injured officer was immediately transported to a San Francisco trauma center. The officer underwent emergency surgery for traumatic head injuries. He remains hospitalized and in critical condition at this time,\" Azzopardi said. The police chief went on to say that the injured officer is a 12-year veteran of the South San Francisco Police Department, is married and has two young children. \"The suspect has been identified as ... 28-year-old Luis Alberto Ramos-Coreas,\" Azzopardi said, adding that Ramos-Coreas has a \"lengthy history of criminal contacts with the South San Francisco Police Department.\" \"The suspect remains in custody at the San Mateo jail, facing numerous felony charges, to include attempted murder on a police officer,\" Azzopardi said. ABC News was not able to immediately determine whether Ramos-Coreas has obtained a lawyer. South San Francisco Mayor Mark Addiego said in a statement, \"This is so disheartening to hear of this incident, in a city such as South San Francisco. We are a tight-knit community, with a police force that is our family. Our thoughts and prayers are with this officer and his family.\" 0 Shares ",
