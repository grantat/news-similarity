The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin congratulated Trump, and pledged to build \"dialogue with the new administration on the principles of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of each other.\" The U.S. and Russian leaders also agreed to set up a face-to-face meeting soon. The two men \"agreed to assess the current very poor state of Russian-American relations\" and to work for \"constructive cooperation on a wide range of issues.\" Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Trump over his praise of Putin during the campaign.\u00a0She and other Trump critics pointed to a U.S. intelligence assessment that Russian interests were behind the hackings of Democrat Party members and may have tried to influence the U.S. elections. Putin denied the allegations. Trump also expressed skepticism, and said the United States\u00a0should seek better relations with Putin and Russia. The Kremlin said that Putin and Trump \"agreed to continue contacts on the phone and in the future to provide for a personal meeting.\" The Trump team said that he \"noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.\" ",

By Amber Phillips November 14 at 12:18 PM Follow byamberphillips President-elect Donald Trump, with his wife Melania Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, gives the thumbs up after a meeting in the majority leader's office in the U.S. Capitol . (EPA/SHAWN THEW) President-elect Donald Trump and establishment Republicans did not really get along during the campaign. The last time we counted, earlier this fall, we calculated that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) disagreed with or denounced Trump on average every week-and-a-half or so. But the campaign is over, and Republicans and Trump are trying to play nice. In interviews since the election, they've stressed they agree\u00a0with their president on tax reform, repealing Obamacare and securing the border. It's not uncommon for the party in the White House to have some disagreements with its own members in Congress. But if you take Trump's campaign promises at his word, Republicans have fundamental disagreements with\u00a0their incoming president on his proposals to spend billions on infrastructure, deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally and institute more protectionist trade policies. And the cracks on those issues are starting to show. Here are six areas where Republicans have given Trump's agenda a lukewarm response. 1. Deportation \"60 Minutes\" aired the first extensive interview with President-elect Donald Trump Nov. 14. Trump said up to 3 million people who are \"criminal\" and undocumented could be deported or incarcerated. (CBS 60 Minutes) Trump: \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminals and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, a lot of these people, probably 2 million. It could even be 3 million,\" he told CBS's Lesley Stahl in a \"60 Minutes\" interview \u00a0that aired Sunday. \"After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about, who are terrific people.\" Ryan: \"We are not planning on erecting a deportation force,\" he told Jake Tapper on Sunday's CNN \"State of the Union.\" \"Donald Trump is not planning on that.\" (To that, hard-right\u00a0news site Breitbart.com \u2014\u00a0whose former chief will be a top strategist to Trump \u2014\u00a0 blasted out an article declaring: \"Paul Ryan: No Deportations\") Newt Gingrich: \"There are going to be substantial deportations. They're called criminals,\" the former House speaker and Trump ally told John Dickerson on Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0\"I mean, 2 million people would be a lot of people to deport.\" President-elect Trump's campaign surrogate Newt Gingrich, said Sunday, Nov. 13, that there will likely be \"substantial deportations\" of undocumented aliens under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Reuters) Kevin McCarthy: \"Well, I think it's difficult to do,\" the House majority leader (R-Calif.) said Sunday in\u00a0response to a question by Fox News's Chris Wallace on whether he'd get behind Trump's proposal for\u00a0mass deportations. 2. A border wall Trump: \"Yes.\" (In response to a question by Stahl: \"Are you really going to build a wall?\") Trump did say he'd accept some proposals circulating in Congress for some fencing: \"For certain areas, I would. But certain areas, a wall is more appropriate.\" McCarthy: \"You have to put a wall, it could be all virtual with the UAV airplanes as well, but I think that is doable and one of the first things that needs to be done. The terrain is different, so you can't always build in just a specific place, but you can protect it.\" 3. Trade Trump: Has repeatedly said he'd like to renegotiate or rip up trade deals. And he has promised to establish tariffs in his first 100 days. Ryan: \"Well, I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue,\" Ryan said on CNN in response to a question about Trump's tariffs plan. \"We think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it's fixing our tax code.\" 4. Term limits for members of Congress During a rally in Colorado, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to introduce a constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on members of Congress. (The Washington Post) Trump:\u00a0 \"We're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits,\" he said on \"60 Minutes.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): \"I say we have term limits now. They\u2019re called elections. It will not be on the agenda in the Senate,\" McConnell told reporters the day after the election. 5. Infrastructure spending Trump: \"We\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none,\" Trump said on \"60 Minutes.\" During the campaign, Trump pitched a 10-year, $500 billion infrastructure plan. \"And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\" Ryan: In September, Ryan indicated such a plan as proposed by Trump would be too expensive. \"We passed the biggest highway bill, the long-term highway bill, for the first time since the 1990s just a few months ago. That's already in place at 10 percent above baseline spending on mass transit and highways.\" McCarthy: McCarthy said on Fox News that \"there is a place we could find common ground with Republicans and Democrats\" on infrastructure. But he seemed unable to explain\u00a0how Trump's infrastructure spending plan differs from President Obama's 2009 stimulus. \"Obama never had infrastructure in his stimulus,\" he said. (Infrastructure spending was a major part of Obama's stimulus.) 6. Whether Republicans have a mandate Ryan: \"He just earned a mandate, and we now just have a unified Republican government. The opportunity is to go big, to go bold and to get things done,\" he said in a news conference Wednesday. McConnell: \" I think it\u2019s always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it\u2019s going to be forever,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"Nothing is forever in this country.\" Where Trump and Republicans are\u00a0in agreement There are a handful of areas that Trump and Republicans seem genuinely in agreement on. They are: Obamacare: Trump wants to repeal it; Republicans want to repeal it. Trump wants to keep the parts of the law that allow people under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health-care plans and that require insurance companies to insure people with preexisting conditions. It looks like\u00a0Republicans do, too. Ryan on CNN said: \"We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions. In our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan.\" Secure the border: Republicans and Trump agree this is a priority, perhaps even before deporting immigrants in the country illegally. Trump on 60 Minutes: \"But before we make that determination, Lesley, it's very important \u2014\u00a0we want to secure our border.\" Ryan on CNN: \"We think that's first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who's coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border.\" Tax reform: Ryan's top policy priority appears to be one of Trump's as well. \"We're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes,\" Trump said. Steve Bannon: Trump tapped the controversial Breitbart chief \u00a0Sunday to\u00a0make him his chief strategist. On Sunday, Ryan said: \"I don\u2019t know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns. I trust Donald\u2019s judgment.\" On Monday in an interview with MSNBC, Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Bannon is \"a force for good.\" But on this key appointment,\u00a0there is the potential for division between Republicans and Trump. Hill Republicans were effusive in their praise and congratulations Sunday\u00a0for Priebus \u2014\u00a0currently the head of the Republican National Committee and a buddy of Ryan's \u2014\u00a0getting the top job. But they were nearly silent on Bannon's appointment. More from The Fix:\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Email Reported hate crimes against Muslims rose in 2015 to their highest number since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to FBI statistics released Monday. Overall, the total number of hate crimes against all groups reported by law enforcement agencies to the FBI increased from 5,479 in 2014 to 5,850 last year. That remains far lower than the numbers seen in the early 2000s, but the FBI release comes amid numerous reports of attacks nationwide based on race and religion following last week's presidential election . The most recent reporting covers calendar year 2015, which included the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, as well as Republican Donald Trump's call for a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. All of those, however, did not occur until the final two months of the year. It's not yet known whether Trump plans to implement such a ban now that he has won the presidency. Critics say his pledge has contributed to anti-Muslim sentiment. \"We've seen how words from public figures like Donald Trump translate into violence,\" said Mark Potok with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups in the U.S. Last year, there were 257 reported incidents of anti-Muslim bias compared to 154 the year before, a 67 percent increase. The number of reported hate crimes against Muslims peaked at 481 in 2001. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he was not surprised to see the large increase in 2015 and said he expects the trend to continue. \"We saw a spike in anti-Muslim incidents nationwide beginning toward the end of 2015. That spike has continued until today and even accelerated after the election of President-elect Trump,\" Hooper said. There have been reports of racist and anti-religious incidents around the country since the Nov. 8 election. Two students at a vocational school in York County, Pennsylvania, held a Donald Trump sign in a hallway as someone shouted \"white power,\" an incident captured on video and widely shared on Facebook. In Silver Spring, Maryland, a banner advertising a Spanish-language service at an Episcopal church was slashed and the words \"Trump nation. Whites only\" were written on the back. Authorities on two California State University campuses, in San Diego and San Jose, were investigating reports that two women wearing headscarves were attacked. At San Diego State University, authorities said a Muslim woman had her car keys and vehicle stolen by two men who targeted her while she wore a hijab and made comments about Donald Trump's election. At the same time, a videotaped assault in Chicago showed black men beating a white man as onlookers screamed, \"You voted Trump!\" On Sunday, Trump said he had not heard reports that some of his supporters might be harassing minorities. \"I am so saddened to hear that,\" Trump said during an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes.\" ''And I say, stop it. If it, if it helps, I will say this and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\" According to the FBI report, the majority of hate crimes were motivated by bias against race or ethnicity. Of the 4,216 victims of a hate crime motivated by race or ethnicity, 52 percent were black, 18.7 percent were white and 9.3 percent were Hispanic or Latino. Crimes against Jews increased about 9 percent, while bias incidents involving sexual orientation were up 3.5 percent. Civil rights groups have expressed concern that a Trump administration could radically reshape the U.S. Department of Justice, particularly when it comes to policing but also in terms of the priority placed on hate crimes. Those concerns were compounded over the weekend after Trump named as his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who came to his campaign from Breitbart News. Under his leadership, the Breitbart website became one of the leading outlets of the so-called alt-right, a movement often associated with far-right efforts to preserve \"white identity\" and oppose multiculturalism. Michael Lieberman with the Anti-Defamation League said there have been \"unprecedented efforts\" to address hate crimes in recent years, from outreach to law enforcement, community meetings and an emphasis on cooperation among federal agencies. Any increases, including the ones seen in anti-Muslim crimes, could be due in part to more reporting by victims as well as better reporting and tracking by law enforcement agencies. The number of law enforcement agencies sending data on hate crimes to the FBI decreased by about 3 percent in 2015. An AP investigation earlier this year found 17 percent of local law enforcement agencies had not submitted a single hate crime report during the past six years as part of the FBI's tracking program, prompting concerns that an undercount was masking the true scope of hate and bias crimes in the U.S. \"Gaps in participation and incomplete reporting demonstrate materially that this work must continue, and we will be pressing the Trump Justice Department and U.S. attorneys so this important work will be ongoing,\" Lieberman said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Deepti Hajela in New York City and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Christina Almeida Cassidy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/AP\u2014Christina. 0 Shares ",

Keith Ellison Says Most Important Criteria for DNC Chair is 'Vision' 0 Shares Email Rep. Keith Ellison formally announced his candidacy for chair of the Democratic National Committee today, an expected move by the Minnesota congressman who, with the support of several prominent Democrats, is considered to be the front-runner for the position. Ellison, 53, a five-term representative from the progressive wing of the party, had been floated as a potential chair in the aftermath of last week's general election, which saw Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton defeated by Republican Donald Trump. \"I am proud to announce my candidacy for Chair of the Democratic National Committee, and if given the opportunity to serve, I will work tirelessly to make the Democratic Party an organization that brings us together and advances an agenda that improves people\u2019s lives,\" Ellison said in a statement today. Harry Reid Backs Rep. Keith Ellison for DNC Chair, Cites Need for 'New Thinking' The congressman can count on the backing of a number of party leaders who emerged last week to support Ellison, widely viewed as a rising star in the party. \"My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement over the weekend. \"Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.\" Ellison has also been endorsed by Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., who is expected to succeed Reid as senate minority leader next year, and Sen. Bernie Sanders , whose challenge of Clinton for the party's presidential nomination rallied young Democrats and led the party to craft the most progressive platform in its history. A progressive himself, Ellison was the first Muslim American elected to the House of Representatives upon winning his seat in 2006. The 53-year-old is co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and sits on the Financial Services Committee. The DNC chair position opened this summer when Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from the post in the aftermath of a scandal surrounding leaked emails that appeared to show party officials conspiring against Sanders' primary bid. Donna Brazile followed Wasserman Schultz in an interim capacity, though was implicated herself in assisting Clinton in further leaked emails that purportedly show her providing the candidate with question topics prior to last year's primary debates. Ellison's announcement includes endorsements from an assortment of elected officials and party members, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar , D-Minn., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Reps. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton . 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH Nation Divided as Protesters Take to the Streets in Several Major Cities 0 Shares Email Protests continued throughout the U.S. on the sixth consecutive day following Donald Trump 's surprise electoral victory, targeting both the president-elect's anti-immigration policies and factions of white supremacist support, as well as the leadership of Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who is widely expected to be elected Senate minority leader to replace outgoing Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada. Hundreds of high school students held a walkout in East Los Angeles, California, a diverse neighborhood with a large Hispanic population, demanding protection for the people they said were being targeted by Trump's supporters in the wake of his election. High school students from Portland, Oregon, and Silver Spring, Maryland, also staged walkouts today, protesting Trump's words and policies. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., at least 40 protesters occupied Sen. Schumer's office, according to Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for #AllofUs, the group that staged the sit-in. SLIDESHOW: Dramatic Scenes as Thousands March in Protest Against Donald Trump Shahid said that #AllofUs is composed of young men and women who participated in the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, as well as Black Lives Matter , climate activists, and organizers from Sen. Bernie Sanders ' campaign for president. He said the protesters were concerned about Democrats collaborating with Trump, citing Schumer's ties to Wall Street as evidence that he was part of the same party establishment that lost the election to Trump. Alex Brandon/AP Photo In this June 23, 2016 file photo, Sen. Charles Schumer speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. Seventeen protesters were arrested in the hallway to Schumer's office today, according to Eva Malecki, the communications director for the U.S. Capitol Police. They were charged with a misdemeanor offense of \"crowding, obstructing and incommoding,\" Malecki said. Today's protests are building off a wave of rallies over the weekend, including the #HeretoStay march that began at Columbus Circle in Manhattan yesterday and then moved to Trump Tower, speaking out against the president-elect's hard-line anti-immigration policies. David McNew/Getty Images Students from numerous area high schools walk out of class to protest near City Hall against the election of Donald Trump on Nov. 14, 2016 in Los Angeles. The #HeretoStay rally featured some participants whose families could be torn apart if Trump is able to enact widespread deportations once in office. Trump vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the U.S. in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired on Sunday, saying that as many as 3 million people could be removed. Immigrants March in New York to Tell Trump They Are 'Here to Stay' Shahid, who is a Muslim, told ABC News that he believed Trump won the election because of the \"massive corporate influence\" in the Democratic Party , which he said was \"negotiating away the future of young people.\" He said that the protesters at the sit-in wanted a change in party leadership to ensure a strong opposition to Trump's policies, citing Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Keith Ellison as examples. Shahid added that his group was protesting both Trump and the establishment wing of the Democratic Party to help prevent any potential collusion between them. \"I'd rather go to jail than sign my name to a Muslim registry,\" he said, referring to a proposal Trump announced in November 2015 involving implementing a database of Muslim Americans to prevent terrorism . Regarding his identity as a Muslim, Shahid said he feels frightened and he has been working on \"adrenaline and no sleep\" since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton . \"A lot of people in my family are really scared right now,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

It said Bannon and Priebus would be \"equal partners.\" Under Bannon's leadership, Breitbart espoused anti-Semitic and nationalist views. The site faced regular criticism \u2014 including from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 for its close ties to the \"alt right,\" an online-based counterculture movement associated with white nationalism. Related: Breitbart's Steve Bannon Leads the 'Alt Right' to the White House There was no shortage of reaction to Bannon's ascension to the West Wing.

Be very vigilant America. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is a top contender to be next chair of Democratic National Committee : \"Mr. Bannon is adored by white supremacists, white nationalists, anti-Semites, neo-Nazis, and the KKK. It's not hard to see why. If the President-elect is serious about rejecting bigotry, hatred, and violence from his supporters, he must rescind Stephen Bannon's appointment,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"This man shouldn't be allowed to visit the White House \u2014 let alone run it.\" Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League: We at @ADL_National oppose the appt of Steve Bannon to sr role at @WhiteHouse bc he & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values pic.twitter.com/qCVEPKoa7q \u2014 Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) November 14, 2016 Greenblatt praised Trump's choice of Priebus, but bashed Bannon's new role. \"It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the 'alt-right' \u2014 a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists \u2014 is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'people's house,'\" he added. Joel Pollak, who worked for Bannon at Breitbart: I've worked closely w/ Steve Bannon at Breitbart. He's an American patriot who also defends Israel & has deep empathy for the Jewish people. \u2014 Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) November 13, 2016 Pollak told NBC News that the soon-to-be White House chief strategist was not anti-Semitic, racist or anti-woman. He called Bannon a champion of a diverse range of conservative voices. \"I think Steve is a national hero,\" Pollak told NBC News. \"From my perspective, in terms of what I believe, I'm an Orthodox Jew, I am an immigrant, I'm married to a black woman, and I live in a liberal city. And Steve saved this country by helping Donald Trump win and restoring balance in the Supreme Court and giving Americans an opportunity to take their government back.\" Marion Le Pen, the granddaughter of the founder of France's far-right National Front party: I answer yes to the invitation of Stephen Bannon, CEO of @realDonaldTrump presidential campaign, to work together. https://t.co/tPSoY5A2vS \u2014 Marion Le Pen (@Marion_M_Le_Pen) November 12, 2016 The Council on American-Islamic Relations: CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad that Bannon's appointment adds fuel to the fire of racial and ethnic hatred and division in America. \"The appointment of Stephen Bannon as a top Trump administration strategist sends the disturbing message that anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and White nationalist ideology will be welcome in the White House,\" Awad added. \"We urge President-elect Trump to reconsider this ill-advised appointment if he truly seeks to unite Americans.\" #BREAKING : #CAIR Decries Appointment of Islamophobe, White Nationalist Bannon as Top Trump Strategist https://t.co/0nh9EAsHvH \u2014 CAIR National (@CAIRNational) November 14, 2016 The organization said Bannon \"promoted conspiracy theories that \"paint a dark and paranoid picture\" of American Muslims. Breitbart News traffics in misogynistic and racist stories targeting women, people of color and immigrants.\" Congressman Mark Meadows, who represents North Carolina's 11th district: Congrats to both Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon -- Ready to work together to have the most productive 'first 100 days' in modern history. \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) November 13, 2016 A spokesman for Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader: \"President-elect Trump's choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that white supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House,\" Adam Jentleson said. \"It is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of white supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide ... Sworn testimony in a court case alleged that Bannon committed violent domestic abuse and stated that he 'didn't want the girls going to school with Jews.'\" Scot Vorse, a longtime friend and ex-business partner of Bannon: Vorse did not dispute Bannon's reputation as a hard-charging boss who demands success and performance from his employees, but said the criticism of him as a racist or anti-Semite is unwarranted. \"I know this guy. He's not perfect. But is he a racist, a sexist, an anti-Semitic? The answer is no. That's not the guy I know,\" Vorse told NBC News.

The Dodgers' Corey Seager hits an RBI single in Game 3 of the NLCS against the Chicago Cubs at Dodger Stadium on Oct. 18. (Sean M. Haffey / Getty Images) Bill Shaikin Contact Reporter For their latest rookie of the year, the Dodgers can thank one of their owners.\u00a0The basketball-playing one. Cal Ripken Jr. stood tall. Shortstops did not, at least not in a baseball world populated by the likes of Ozzie Smith, Mark Belanger and Luis Aparacio. Ripken wanted to play shortstop, so he drew his inspiration from an out-of-the-box wizard in another sport. \u201cI remember thinking about Magic Johnson playing the point,\u201d Ripken said. The lineage of big shortstops \u2014\u00a0big bodies and big success \u2014\u00a0officially extended to Corey Seager on Monday. Seager was the unanimous winner of the National League rookie-of-the-year award. He joined Mike Piazza (1993) and Raul Mondesi (1994) as the only Dodgers to win the award in a unanimous vote. Although  Dodgers players have won the award a record 17 times \u2014\u00a0more than twice as many times as any other club \u2014\u00a0Seager is the first since Todd Hollandsworth in 1996. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to be able to bring it back,\u201d Seager said. Said Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts: \u201cHe is everything that is good about our game.\u201d Washington center fielder Trea Turner, 23, who did not win a place in the Nationals\u2019 lineup until July, finished second in the voting. Dodgers pitcher Kenta Maeda, 28, placed third. The soft-spoken Seager, 22, said he had no expectations about winning but declared himself \u201cextremely happy\u201d and \u201cextremely excited.\u201d The family and friends gathered for the announcement and subsequent celebration included big brother Kyle, 29, an All-Star third baseman for the Seattle Mariners. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of been the angel on my shoulder,\u201d Corey Seager said. The 6-foot-4 Ripken won the American League rookie award in 1982, the first big step in his Hall of Fame career and in broadening the shortstop prototype to include Alex Rodriguez and Troy Tulowitzki, each 6 feet  3, and Seager, at 6 feet 4. \u201cThere hadn\u2019t been a model, really,\u201d Ripken said. \u201cYou always looked at the smaller guys who could cover ground. All of a sudden, when someone has some success at the position outside the stereotype, it provokes conversation.\u201d Ripken noted he was not as acrobatic as the lighter shortstops but made up for it with superior defensive positioning, an aspect of the game at which  the Dodgers\u2019 analytics staff and front office excel. Although Seager wearied of being told from the day he was drafted that his size would force an eventual move to third base, he said he did not consider Monday\u2019s award as evidence he had made it to the top of his profession as a shortstop. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously an honor just to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to shove in anybody else\u2019s face. It\u2019s a hard game. You don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d He established himself alongside two second-year players \u2013 Francisco Lindor of the Cleveland Indians and Carlos Correa of the Houston Astros \u2013 at the head of a star-studded group of rising young shortstops.He established himself alongside two second-year players \u2013 Francisco Lindor of the Cleveland Indians and Carlos Correa of the Houston Astros \u2013 at the head of a star-studded group of rising young shortstops. The group also includes Addison Russell of the Chicago Cubs, Xander Bogaerts of the Boston Red Sox, Aledmys Diaz of the St. Louis Cardinals and Trevor Story of the Colorado Rockies, who hit 27 home runs before suffering a season-ending injury in July. Seager already has been announced as one of the finalists for the NL most-valuable-player award, expected to be won Thursday by the Cubs\u2019 Kris Bryant, the 2015 rookie of the year. Seager is expected to finish second or third in the MVP vote. The highest finish for a Dodgers rookie in the MVP vote: third, by pitcher Joe Black in 1952. Seager, a minimum-wage shortstop on the team with the highest payroll in the league, was the youngest of the Dodgers\u2019 24 position players this year. None of the veteran position players on the team\u2019s current roster has finished higher than fourth in an MVP vote. Dodgers icon Jackie Robinson was the first winner of the rookie award, in 1947. The award is now presented in Robinson\u2019s honor to a player in each league. On Tuesday, the Dodgers could win again, when the NL manager-of-the-year award is announced.  Roberts is one of the finalists, along with Dusty Baker of the Nationals and Joe Maddon of the Cubs. ",

Stressed was, among other things, the importance of the creation of a stable foundation for bilateral relations by developing their trade and market component.\" Citing the Russian leader, the Kremlin statement added that this new relationship will be based \"on the principles of equality, mutual respect and respective non-involvement in the other party's domestic affairs.\" The statement from the Russians said that Putin and Trump agreed on combating \"global enemy number one\" \u2014 international terrorism and extremism. \"To that end, they also discussed the Syrian settlement,\" the statement said without providing additional details. Officials are now working to arrange a personal meeting between the two leaders, the statement said. Russia played an outsize role in the presidential campaign, with U.S. officials and cyber security experts saying they were certain state-sponsored Russian hackers targeted Democratic National Committee email servers. During a campaign stop in Florida earlier this year, Trump publicly asked Russia to \"find\" emails that he said had gone missing from Hillary Clinton's email server. Tim Stelloh ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Petula Dvorak Columnist November 14 at 3:47 PM Follow @petulad What was lost in the election last week? Decency. Humanity. Morality. All the way around. From protesters destroying property in Portland, Ore., to racists destroying a sense of safety in Silver Spring, Md., too many people are undermining the foundation of our country in the aftermath of a polarizing election. And our first order of business is to fix it. Because this is about democracy, really. Donald Trump is going to be our president. And saying #notmypresident is the same as saying #notmyconstitution or #notmycountry or #notmyAmerica. It is our America. All of us. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. A majority of Americans who voted last week \u2014 and a totally shameful 43 percent of y\u2019all stayed home, and you better not have been at those protests if you did \u2014 voted for her. But the same constitution that gives protesters the right to peaceful assembly also created the electoral college that gave Trump the White House. [ American women have always had to fight for our rights. We can\u2019t stop fighting now .] This is what democracy looks like. And smashing windows in cities or burning flags on college campuses or staging walkouts at high schools won\u2019t change that. And shouldn\u2019t change that. All it does is provide Dave Chappelle solid gold material for his Saturday Night Live monologue. Decent Americans have somehow lost their ability to control all the wrong impulses. Sore losers protesting the democratic process are just as useless as hate-filled winners sneaking around towns painting swastikas and racist graffiti. I want to say that the only difference between the two is that one is ridiculous while the other is dangerous. But that\u2019s not totally true, either. The \u201cWhites Only\u201d graffiti scrawled on an Episcopalian church in Silver Spring and the swastikas drawn in a Bethesda middle school bathroom are references to real and bloody horrors in history. So was the swastika used to deface a church in Indiana and the \u201c#Whitesonly\u201d written on a door in Minnesota. The connective tissue between all the hated? The word \u201cTrump,\u201d which accompanied most of the vandalism. Indiana even got \u201cHeil Trump\u201d on the outside of one church. There were the fifth graders in Ventura, Calif ., chanting \u201cBuild a Wall!\u201d and walls in Durham, N.C. defaced with \u201cBlack Lives Don\u2019t Matter and Neither Does Your Vote.\u201d Confederate flags fluttered at a Veteran\u2019s Day parade in Petaluma, Calif. Women in hijab reported having them yanked off in public, and a disturbing note to a Muslim elementary school teacher in Georgia told her to go hang herself with her head scarf. A student at the University of Michigan was told she would be set on fire if she didn\u2019t remove her hijab. These are the deplorable acts that are intended to terrify religious and racial minorities. They must be condemned and not with a dispassionate, timid \u201cStop it,\u201d which is what Trump said during a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired Sunday night. And Trump\u2019s decision to appoint his campaign chairman Stephen Bannon \u2014 denounced by critics as a proponent of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views \u2014 as his White House chief strategist was absolutely chilling. Even so, it doesn\u2019t justify protesting the outcome of the election itself, which is the beating heart of American democracy. When young people respond by burning flags and walking out of class, they might be making themselves feel better. But remember when President Obama was elected in 2008 and 2012, and it wasn\u2019t all rainbows and unicorns? When black families found burning crosses on their lawns, protesters carried signs with nooses and racist caricatures and mobs burned him in effigy? They were protesting his victory. They probably made themselves feel better in their fellowship of hatred, but they did nothing to change the Obama family\u2019s address for eight years. That brings us to the part where protesting the simple fact of our democratic process is dangerous, too. Protest Trump\u2019s actions and policies. Pressure members of Congress. Work like mad to get rid of the electoral college if you\u2019ve had it with the system. Support candidates in the 2018 elections that can make real change. That is what democracy looks like. Trump in the Oval Office? That is what democracy looks like, too. Twitter: @petulad ",

Once it finishes its run at Chicago\u2019s United Center later this month, it won't be returning to that arena. (Feld Entertainment photo) Chris Kuc Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The animals and acrobats are moving in, and once again the Blackhawks and Bulls are headed out. The United Center tenants have reached that point in their schedules when they are forced to vacate their home at 1901 W. Madison for two weeks or so while the circus takes over. The disruption in the schedule \u2014 which dates to when the Hawks and Bulls played at the Chicago Stadium \u2014 has often proved problematic as the teams endure grueling trips that have had negative impacts on their seasons. But the shows won't go on. The Tribune has learned that the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus won't return to the UC after it ends its run this month. And Disney on Ice, which forces the teams to take another extended trip in February, will have its UC shows condensed to a one-week run beginning in 2018. The news confirms a July 2015 Tribune report that Blackhawks Chairman Rocky Wirtz, who co-owns the UC with Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, likely would let the circus and ice show contracts lapse by 2017. \"The reason we're doing this is twofold,\" said Terry Savarise, senior vice president of operations for the UC. \"One is that in future years the Bulls and Blackhawks no longer have to endure two two-week road trips, and a subset of that is that those trips had resulted in a compression of our home schedules. There were times when you'd have four home games in a one-week period, which fans didn't like. ",

The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, The Netherlands. (Martijn Beekman / AFP/Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter U.S. armed forces and the CIA may have committed war crimes by torturing detainees in Afghanistan, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said in a report Monday, raising the possibility that American citizens could be indicted even though Washington has not joined the global court. \"Members of US armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity on the territory of Afghanistan between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2014,\" according to the report issued by Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's office. The report added that CIA operatives may have subjected at least 27 detainees in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania to \"torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity and/or rape\" between December 2002 and March 2008. Most of the alleged abuse happened in 2003-2004, the report said. Prosecutors said they will decide \"imminently\" whether to seek authorization to open a full-scale investigation in Afghanistan that could lead to war crimes charges. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the U.S. does not believe an ICC investigation is \"warranted or appropriate.\" \"The United States is deeply committed to complying with the law of war, and we have a robust national system of investigation and accountability that more than meets international standards,\" Trudeau said. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said officials were awaiting more details about the ICC findings before commenting. Established in 2002, the International Criminal Court is the world's first permanent court set up to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. More than 120 countries around the world are members, but superpowers including the United States, Russia and China have not signed up. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Rome treaty that established the court on Dec. 31, 2000, but President George W. Bush renounced the signature, citing fears that Americans would be unfairly prosecuted for political reasons. Even though the United States is not a member of the court, Americans could still face prosecution at its headquarters in The Hague if they commit crimes within its jurisdiction in a country that is a member, such as Afghanistan, and are not prosecuted at home. So far, all of the ICC's trials have dealt with crimes committed in Africa. Prosecutors say investigations also are reportedly under way in Poland, Romania and Lithuania \u2014 all signatories to the Rome Statute \u2014 into possible crimes at CIA detention facilities in those countries. The abuse allegations came in a wide-ranging annual report into the prosecution office's so-called preliminary examinations, which involve studying reports of possible crimes to establish if they fall under the court's jurisdiction. The same report said that Taliban and Afghan government forces also may have used torture and committed other atrocities in that country's long and bitter conflict. The report says that the Taliban and its affiliates killed thousands of people and are suspected of committing war crimes including murder, recruiting and conscripting child soldiers and attacking civilians and humanitarian workers. Referring to the alleged U.S. war crimes, the report said they \"were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals. Rather, they appear to have been committed as part of approved interrogation techniques in an attempt to extract 'actionable intelligence' from detainees.\" The report adds that, \"The information available suggests that victims were deliberately subjected to physical and psychological violence, and that crimes were allegedly committed with particular cruelty and in a manner that debased the basic human dignity of the victims.\" Before deciding to open a full-scale investigation, ICC prosecutors have to establish whether they have jurisdiction and whether the alleged crimes are being investigated and prosecuted in the countries involved. The ICC is a court of last resort that takes on cases only when other countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute. The report noted that U.S. authorities have conducted dozens of investigations and court-martial cases and says ICC prosecutors are seeking further clarifications on their scope before deciding whether any American cases would be admissible at the ICC. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the administration of President George W. Bush allowed the use of waterboarding, which simulates drowning, and other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists. President Barack Obama banned such practices after taking office in 2009. During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump suggested that as president he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques, arguing that banning them puts the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage against Islamic State militants.

    "text": "Questionable reports of Trump-fueled violence proliferate on social media Published               November 14, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 As if the 2016 climate couldn\u2019t get any more divisive, false or questionable reports of violence linked to Donald Trump\u2019s victory have gained steady traction on social media since last week \u2013 complicating efforts to distinguish fact from fiction amid very real political unrest.\u00a0 In one case, a student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette claimed that two white men \u2013\u00a0one wearing a Trump hat \u2013 jumped out of a sedan, attacked her, and stole her hijab and her wallet. The unnamed woman also said the men knocked her to the ground and screamed racial slurs at her. News of the attack quickly spread on social media, and soon some national media outlets including CNN began reporting it. The attack also was quickly condemned by the state branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThe ACLU of Louisiana is outraged at the news of a young Muslim woman being assaulted and robbed of her hijab in Lafayette yesterday morning,\u201d the organization said in a written statement. \u201cThe report that her attackers also shouted slurs and wore Donald Trump clothing is especially troubling in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent use of anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail.\u201d The problem is: the incident was fabricated. \u201cThere were a lot of things that didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Lafayette police spokesman Karl Ratcliff told The Acadiana Advocate. Ratcliff said the student ultimately confessed to making up the entire story after police pressed her for details. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Another report of questionable origin making the rounds involves a supposed surge in transgender teen suicides tied to the election. Claims that Trump's victory triggered at least 10 suicides surfaced Wednesday when some started posting Facebook updates saying the information came from private support groups for parents with transgender children. The stat was given a global spotlight after Guardian writer and Out magazine editor-at-large Zach Stafford tweeted that \u201cat least 8 trans youth have committed suicide in the wake of Trump\u2019s win.\u201d He went on to report 10 teens took their lives. Stafford later admitted he had no evidence to back up claims that any transgender teens had killed themselves because of Trump. Such accounts have only muddled the picture of the very real unrest to seize the country since last week's election. Harassment or violence has been attributed to both sides, in several documented cases.\u00a0 In the upstate New York town of Wellsville, police have launched an investigation after someone drew a swastika symbol and spray-painted \u201cMake America White Again\u201d on the back wall of a community softball league\u2019s dugout. In Michigan\u2019s Royal Oak Middle School, students were caught on video during their lunch period chanting \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d Royal Oak Schools Superintendent Shawn Lewis-Lakin wrote in a statement\u00a0that officials \u201caddressed this incident when it occurred.\u201d \u201cWe are working with our students to help them understand the impact of their words and actions on others in their school community,\u201d Lewis-Lakin wrote. In Silver Spring, Md., an Episcopal church in a heavily Latino suburb was vandalized. A banner advertising the church's Spanish-language service was slashed Saturday night and the words \u201cTrump nation. Whites only\u201d were written on the back. The same phrase was written on a brick wall in the church\u2019s memorial garden. Last week, the beating of a suspected Trump supporter also was captured on video in Chicago. Two Florida homes reportedly were vandalized with anti-Trump messages \u2013 this, as protests broke out in cities across the country, with one in Portland causing significant property damage.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the Ku Klux Klan announced it plans to hold a victory rally for Trump in North Carolina next month. Trump addressed the recent outbreak of racist rhetoric during an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired on Sunday. \u201cI am so saddened to hear that and I\u2019ll say stop it, if it helps,\u201d he said when asked about the reports. \u201cI\u2019ll say it right to the camera \u2013 stop it.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Paul Ryan is determined to gut Medicare. This time he might succeed Paul Ryan Associated Press House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) may be a bigger threat to Medicare than the president-elect. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) may be a bigger threat to Medicare than the president-elect. (Associated Press) Michael Hiltzik Contact Reporter Bursting with the policymaking power that control of both houses of Congress and the White House gives Republicans , House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)\u00a0has lost no time in teeing up a favorite goal: gutting Medicare .\u00a0 In an interview with Fox News Channel last Thursday, Ryan said:\u00a0\u201cObamacare rewrote Medicare \u2026 so if you\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well. \u2026 What people don\u2019t realize is that Medicare is going broke, that Medicare is going to have price controls. \u2026 So you have to deal with those issues if you\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Medicare has got some serious problems because of Obamacare. Those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare.\u201d There\u2019s no secret about what specifically Ryan has in mind. He intends to replace traditional Medicare, an efficient program offering guaranteed treatment and featuring\u00a0 rock-bottom administrative costs , with a privatized program. Seniors would get a federal voucher to help them pay premiums charged by commercial insurance plans. Ryan calls this system \u201cpremium support.\u201d Medicare has got some serious problems because of Obamacare. \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) But since the value of the vouchers would rise at less than the rate of healthcare inflation, and the costs of private insurance typically rise faster than those of Medicare, an ever-larger share of healthcare costs would land on seniors\u2019\u00a0shoulders. In 2011, when Ryan first proposed this change, the Kaiser Family Foundation calculated \u00a0that by 2022, healthcare spending would consume roughly half of the typical 65-year-old\u2019s Social Security check, compared to only 22% under the existing\u00a0Medicare system. Under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to \"save\" Medicare, total costs would rise and enrollees' share of the total would soar. Kaiser Family Foundation Under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to \"save\" Medicare, total costs would rise and enrollees' share of the total would soar. Under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to \"save\" Medicare, total costs would rise and enrollees' share of the total would soar. (Kaiser Family Foundation) Ryan\u2019s plan would do nothing to rein in healthcare costs, but would likely increase them, in part\u00a0because Medicare beneficiaries would be saddled with paying not only for their care, but for the shareholder dividends and executive pay of private insurance companies. The savings Ryan touts would be illusory: They would merely be shifted from government to seniors. Seniors would pay on average, under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan, almost half of their Social Security income on healthcare by 2022, compared to 22% under the existing program. Kaiser Family Foundation Seniors would pay on average, under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan, almost half of their Social Security income on healthcare by 2022, compared to 22% under the existing program. Seniors would pay on average, under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan, almost half of their Social Security income on healthcare by 2022, compared to 22% under the existing program. (Kaiser Family Foundation) Ryan has surrounded his Medicare proposal with a bodyguard of lies. In his Fox News appearance, he said Medicare is \u201cgoing broke\u201d and\u00a0ascribed its\u00a0problems to the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0Neither is true. Medicare faces fiscal problems, but it\u2019s not going broke, and according to both the Medicare trustees and the Congressional Budget Office , the Affordable Care Act has in fact alleviated those problems rather than caused them. The trustees reported in 2010 that passage of Obamacare had postponed the projected exhaustion date of the Medicare trust fund by 12 years \u2014 to 2029 from 2017. Projections of Medicare spending growth have consistently come down, year after year, at least in part due to changes in the program imposed through Obamacare. The program\u2019s fiscal situation would be \u201csubstantially improved,\u201d the trustees said, because the ACA instituted new cost controls and provided new tax revenues for the program. Both those features would disappear if the GOP repeals the ACA, as is its intention. Also at risk as a result of repeal would be an ACA provision closing the Medicare prescription drug\u00a0\u201cdonut hole,\u201d which exposes seniors to a sudden jump in out-of-pocket drug expenses once they\u2019ve exceeded a certain level of benefits. The ACA would close the donut hole by 2020; Ryan is silent on whether, or how, his proposal would manage that hit. Projections of Medicare spending have been revised downward by the Congressional Budget Office every year since Obamacare's passage. Congressional Budget Office via the New England Journal of Medicine Projections of Medicare spending have been revised downward by the Congressional Budget Office every year since Obamacare's passage. Projections of Medicare spending have been revised downward by the Congressional Budget Office every year since Obamacare's passage. (Congressional Budget Office via the New England Journal of Medicine) In his Fox News interview, Ryan also took aim at the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. This body, created by the ACA, is empowered to recommend changes in Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals if the program\u2019s projected growth exceeds a target rate. IPAB hasn\u2019t actually been created yet, but that\u2019s not much of a problem because the Medicare growth rate has been well within bounds. IPAB has been a major target of conservative ACA critics from the start, for reasons that have never been very clear. The board has no authority to recommend changes in benefits, enrollee costs or anything other than what doctors and hospitals get paid. Ryan wrung his hands on Fox about this board\u2019s ability to impose \u201cprice controls on Medicare,\u201d but he forgot to mention that it\u2019s empowered to step\u00a0in only once all other efforts to control costs have failed. The ACA includes all sorts of cost-control provisions aimed at how physicians bill patients and how hospitals manage their treatments, some of which already have yielded evident improvements in how American healthcare is delivered. Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan offers no alternatives to these ideas, other than airy promises to \u201cstrengthen \u2026 health and retirement security\u201d for seniors and to \u201cfoster a more patient-centered system,\u201d a GOP shibboleth with no discernible meaning.\u00a0 Ryan\u2019s lies and misdirections have been abetted by ill-informed and supine press coverage. In 2011, for instance, the fact-checking outfit Politifact labeled as \u201cthe lie of the year \u201d the accusation that Ryan and his fellow Republicans had\u00a0\u201cvoted to end Medicare.\u201d This was a remarkably ignorant finding, contradicted by Politifact\u2019s own description of the Republican plan. Politifact acknowledged that\u00a0for anyone then younger than 55, the vote \u201cdramatically changed the program \u2026 by privatizing it and providing government subsidies.\u201d It takes a surfeit of obtuseness not to notice that privatizing a government program is tantamount to killing it, and bifurcating it into separate pools of young workers and people 55 and older is a formula for fiscal chaos and, eventually, annihilation. It takes a surfeit of obtuseness not to understand how a voucher program works to increase costs on beneficiaries. Ryan\u2019s assault on Medicare, like other policies likely to be advanced by Republicans in the next few years, will place a premium on informed journalism, as well as concentrated organizing by defenders of programs that have been working very well for Americans and that need improvement, not evisceration. Medicare advocates beat down Ryan\u2019s initial sally against the program in 2011, but they need to remain vigilant. And unlike Politifact, reporters and editors covering these\u00a0programs will need to know what they\u2019re talking about. The challenge is on.

David Machado was arrested about 150 miles south in Tulare County around 12:30 p.m. Sunday after he allegedly tried to steal a woman\u2019s purse at a convenience store, according to a statement from the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department. Machado is also suspected of a carjacking and a previous theft of a van, the statement said. He has since been taken to Stanislaus County where he is in custody and awaiting charges, the Stanislaus County Sheriff told ABC News. Stanislaus County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Dennis Wallace was shot while answering a call at about 8:25 a.m. Sunday about a suspicious van near Fox Grove Fishing Access in Hughson, about 10 miles from Modesto, according to the Sheriff's Department release. Wallace was alone at the time but called for backup after a dispatcher told him the van was stolen and that the suspected thief, whom the dispatcher identified as Machado, was \"possibly armed,\" the statement said. Moments after Wallace called for assistance, \"attempts to reach the deputy over the radio were unsuccessful,\" the statement said. When backup officers arrived on the scene, they found Wallace near his patrol car suffering from what were apparently two shots to the head at point-blank range. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. 2 Police Officers Ambushed and Shot in Pennsylvania, 1 Killed The van and suspect were not at the scene when the assisting officers found Wallace, and police broadcast a message to all area law enforcement agencies to help them in the search. \"We believe that Deputy Wallace was killed outside of the car, and we know for a fact that the gun used in this crime was in direct contact with his head when the trigger was pulled twice,\" Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson said at a news conference Sunday. \"This was an execution.\" About 15 minutes after Wallace had responded to the call about the suspicious van, police responded to a reported carjacking in the community of Keyes in the same county. \"The victim in the carjacking identified David Machado as the suspect,\" the Sheriff's Department statement said. Police then broadcast information about Machado throughout the state as the manhunt continued. At 12:33 p.m., the Stanislaus County Sheriff's office heard from police in Lindsay in Tulare County, about 150 miles south of where the carjacking occurred. Lindsay police had arrested Machado after he allegedly tried to steal a purse from a woman in a convenience store. Once Machado was in custody, Lindsey police identified him as the suspect wanted in Stanislaus County, Sheriff Christianson said at the news conference. \"We expect the district attorney to file a criminal complaint today,\" with the arraignment tomorrow, Christianson told ABC News today. A vigil for Wallace held in Hughson on Sunday night drew hundreds of people, according to ABC affiliate KXTV in Sacramento. Among those who spoke was the fallen officer's brother, Dave Wallace, who said he is also in law enforcement as was his and Dennis\u2019 father. \"We truly loved each other,\u201d Dave Wallace said of his brother. \u201cAnd I can tell you that Dennis fully loved this community \u2026 We were both sons of a law enforcement officer. That's all he ever wanted to do as kids. We were both able to fulfill that dream.\" The Associated Press contributed to this story. 0 Shares ",

He has harshly criticized the U.S.-brokered international deal to limit Iran's nuclear weapons program. Newspapers in Tehran announce the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. He has harshly criticized the U.S.-brokered international deal to limit Iran's nuclear weapons program. (AFP/Getty Images) Tracy Wilkinson Contact Reporter President Obama said Monday that the historic accord to curb Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons \u2014 the most important arms control agreement in decades \u2014 is working, and he expressed hope that Donald Trump will keep it intact. \u201cMy suspicion is that when the president-elect comes into office \u2026 he will look at the facts,\u201d Obama said at a news conference. Abandoning the deal would remove obstructions that blocked Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and could force the United States to sanction European allies that continued to honor the accord. \u201cWhen you are \u00a0not responsible for it, you can call it a terrible deal,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen you are responsible \u2026 you are more likely to look at the facts.\u201d The question remains whether the deal, ratified by six world powers and implemented under a United Nations Security Council resolution, will survive under a Trump administration. Donald Trump \u2019s closest confidants and most determined field lieutenants throughout the presidential campaign; now he has become President-elect Trump\u2019s first major postelection\u00a0political problem. The angry backlash against\u00a0Trump\u2019s announcement that the Breitbart News executive... Steve Bannon was one of Donald Trump \u2019s closest confidants and most determined field lieutenants throughout the presidential campaign; now he has become President-elect Trump\u2019s first major postelection\u00a0political problem. The angry backlash against\u00a0Trump\u2019s announcement that the Breitbart News executive... (Evan Halper) As a candidate, Trump targeted the Iran deal with special scorn but wavered on his intentions. He vowed at times to tear it up and at other times indicated he would negotiate stiffer concessions from Iran. In speeches, he vastly inflated Iran\u2019s financial gains from the agreement, suggesting Tehran benefited unfairly. And he complained that it only limited Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program, not its ballistic missiles or other issues of concern to U.S. policymakers. But the United States enforces separate sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles, its support for foreign terrorist groups and human rights abuses. The Treasury Department twice added sanctions to Iranian companies and individuals this year after the nuclear deal went into effect. \u201cWe have seen that this agreement has done what we said it was going to do, which is limit\u00a0Iran\u00a0from obtaining a nuclear [weapon],\u201d said Mark Toner, the State Department spokesman. \u201cIt wasn't focused on changing\u00a0Iran's behavior at large. It was focused\u00a0on preventing it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\u201d Trump\u2019s advisors make clear that revisiting the agreement is a priority for Trump even if the plan ahead is still a work in progress. \u2018Ripping up\u2019 is maybe a too strong a word. He\u2019s gonna take that agreement, it\u2019s been done before in international context, and then review it. \u2014 Walid Phares, Trump foreign policy advisor \u201c\u2018Ripping up\u2019 is maybe a too strong a word. He\u2019s gonna take that agreement, it\u2019s been done before in international context, and then review it,\u201d Walid Phares, a Trump foreign policy advisor, told BBC radio.\u00a0 \u201cHe will take the agreement, review it, send it to Congress, demand from Iranians to restore a few issues or change a few issues. And there will be a discussion. It could be a tense discussion.\u201d Another advisor, R. James Woolsey Jr., who headed the CIA from 1993 to 1995 under President Clinton, was more hawkish. Speaking on CNN, he called the deal \u201cthe worst single international agreement the United States has ever signed.\u201d Woolsey said the deal was neither implementable nor verifiable. \u201cIt is truly rotten,\u201d he said. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is formally known, Iran has met its commitments to curtail access to nuclear fuel and technology and is submitting to verification systems set up to monitor its compliance, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency. U.S. officials and most arms control experts say\u00a0Washington would be isolated if it withdraws from the deal. It could put the United States in violation of the Security Council resolution that it endorsed, kill any chance of another diplomatic deal with Iran and hurt U.S. credibility with the five other major powers who negotiated it: England, France, China, Russia and Germany. Even Israel, which fiercely opposed concessions to the Islamic Republic during the negotiations, has accepted that the deal is working and that Iran no longer poses an imminent nuclear threat. Worse, according to arms control experts, it could give Iran a free hand to cast off its commitments \u2014 and give the U.S. few options short of military force to respond. \u201cIran would be free to resume its nuclear program , and it would be difficult to impose new sanctions,\u201d said Gary Samore,\u00a0a former arms control advisor to Obama who now is research director at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard.

It's good news for people who have to take pills every day for chronic pain, but the drugs are not completely safe. Ibuprofen, naproxen and the prescription drug celecoxib all can cause heart problems, especially when taken long term in high doses. Ibuprofen NBC News The findings only apply to people taking high doses over time - they do not apply to people who take ibuprofen or naproxen for fevers, headache or the occasional aches and pains. But even occasional use should be limited, experts say. \"My advice to the public is to take the lowest dose you can for the shortest period you can,\" said Dr. Steve Nissen, the heart expert at the Cleveland Clinic who ran the study. The study was started because of a scandal going back to 2004, when the new arthritis drug Vioxx was pulled from the market when it was shown to cause heart attacks and other heart deaths. It was a shocker because Vioxx, approved in 1999, was designed to be a more refined version of the drugs in the same class as aspirin and ibuprofen, which both can cause dangerous stomach bleeding. Since then there has been a bit of suspicion surrounding other so-called COX-2 inhibitors, including celecoxib, sold generically and under the brand name Celebrex. \"We gave everybody a drug to protect the stomach and it happened anyway.\" The Food and Drug Administration now mandates a black-box warning on all COX-2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other over-the-counter pain relievers. Nissen's team did a long-term, head-to-head comparison of celecoxib, ibuprofen and naproxen in 24,000 volunteers with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis for almost three years. As expected, naproxen and ibuprofen caused some gastric bleeding and celecoxib caused less, Nissen's team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine and at a meeting of the American Heart Association. \"We gave everybody a drug to protect the stomach and it happened anyway,\" Nissen told NBC News. All the patients got a stomach drug called esomeprazole or Nexium. And all three drugs caused small numbers of heart events such as heart attacks or strokes- 2.3 percent of those assigned to take celecoxib, 2.5 percent of those assigned to take naproxen and 2.7 percent of those given ibuprofen. The team saw other expected side-effects. \"The effect of Celebrex on blood pressure was zero,\" Nissen said. \"Ibuprofen caused a clear increase in hospitalizations for high blood pressure. Naproxen had intermediate effects.\" \"We are not saying that if you take an occasional 200 mg of ibuprofen that you are going to die.\" \"We've known these drugs have heightened risks, and we've known ibuprofen is less safe than naproxen,\" noted Dr. Alan Taylor, chief of cardiology at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the study. \"If your doctor prescribes celecoxib, it's probably pretty safe.\" The study did not necessarily reflect what happens in real life. Most of the patients - more than two-thirds - dropped out before the end of the trial and more than a quarter did not show up for follow-up visits. And the patients got extremely high doses of ibuprofen - 600 mg three times a day. The usual dose is 200 mg, or one tablet. The people given naproxen got 375 mg twice and day and those given celecoxib got low doses of 100 mg twice a day. \"We are not saying that if you take an occasional 200 mg of ibuprofen that you are going to die,\" Nissen said. It's not completely clear why the drugs affect heart attack and stroke rates. COX-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of heart attacks by raising blood pressure and making the blood more likely to clot, researchers say. COX, or cyclooxygenase, is an enzyme that comes in two forms -- COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin and other NSAIDS affect both COX-1 and COX-2. The COX-2 inhibitors were meant to be safer by targeting only COX-2. Nissen believes people who take high doses of ibuprofen, naproxen and other NSAIDs may be bleeding just a little. \"You are losing blood and you gradually trickle down to where you get to an anemic level. And anemia is not good for the heart,\" he said. \"One of the most important messages is if you are going to take these drugs, you should take the lowest dose that's effective for the least possible period of time.\" And people take too much, he added. \"The term the FDA uses is dose creep. One of the most important messages is if you are going to take these drugs, you should take the lowest dose that's effective for the least possible period of time.\" It's a huge market. Millions of Americans take NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors, spending $1 trillion in 2015 for naproxen, ibuprofen and celecoxib. That's a big drop from 2014 when it was a $2.8 trillion market. Celecoxib sales also were $2.5 trillion, almost all of them for the brand-name drug Celebrex. Now most sales are for the much cheaper generic form. Maggie Fox ",

Donald J. Trump\u2019s effect on the city is difficult to predict. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Michelle Obama has burned off her date-night meals at Washington\u2019s new generation of acclaimed restaurants by pedaling at SoulCycle . President Obama has shopped for Jonathan Franzen novels with his daughters at local independent bookstores . Obama administration staff members, their barhopping chronicled in the gossip pages, have hit the 14th Street hot spots hard. Decades ago, Washington was broke and run by a mayor best known for smoking crack with a prostitute on a surveillance tape. Neighborhoods had not fully recovered from the 1968 riots, and an aging Georgetown elite still set the tone. The administrations of two Bushes and a Clinton in between hardly had an effect on the city. But Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival in 2009 coincided with an urban renaissance. Economic development, federal and private investment, and an influx of highly educated young, gay and diverse professionals gentrified neighborhoods, leading to an explosion in restaurants, bars and cafes. And the Obama family \u2014 African-American, youthful, attractive and urbane \u2014 were archetypes of a modern city on the upswing. What the effect on Washington will be when Donald J. Trump moves into the White House is hard to predict. But many Washingtonians fear the worst. Among them is Vincent Gray, the city\u2019s mayor during much of the Obama administration. \u201cI\u2019m worried about people not wanting to come here because of the image they have of the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Gray said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now a member of the City Council, Mr. Gray said the engagement of Mr. Obama and his family with the city has been \u201ctremendously uplifting.\u201d \u201cTheir presence in the city brought a level of dynamism that just wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d he said. Photo President Obama and his daughters, Sasha and Malia, purchased books at Politics and Prose in Washington. Credit Pool photo by Dennis Brack By contrast, Mr. Trump seems unlikely to drop in at Oyamel, the Mexican restaurant and Obama favorite owned by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a star chef and devoted Trump critic. For that matter, it is even unclear whether Mr. Trump, who has used his new Trump International Hotel as an outpost here, will spend weekends in the White House or in New York. And he is unlikely to feel a debt of gratitude to a city where Hillary Clinton won 93 percent of the vote. \u201cD.C. is going to take a really hard hit, culturally, socially, everything. We were really finding our footing; we weren\u2019t second to New York,\u201d said Jazmine Johnson, a graphic designer who said she now planned to move to New York. Ms. Johnson, 25, was speaking in the Coffee Bar, a fashionable cafe on M Street where Mr. Trump\u2019s pseudo-anthem, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want,\u201d played in the background. In the aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory on Tuesday, she sought solace in caffeine. Others around town signed up for free tension-relieving sessions at yoga studios, or meditated on emails from their progressive rabbis reminding them of the Jewish mantra \u201cOd lo avda tikvateinu,\u201d or, \u201cWe have not yet lost our hope.\u201d Reports abounded of federal workers and nonprofit employees crying at their desks, scanning the web for out-of-town rentals or accepting the free hugs on offer in Farragut Square. \u201cThe world has definitely shifted on its axis, and we\u2019ve taken a step into the abyss,\u201d said Michael Steel, an establishment Republican by virtue of having worked for former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and departed House Speaker John Boehner, and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump. Mr. Gray said he worried that a Trump administration could set the city back because the federal government still controls its purse strings and could enact abortion restrictions, cut vital investment and relax gun control laws.

(Photo: FriendFinder) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014\u00a0More than 412 million names and passwords used to login to adult connection sites run by FriendFinder Networks may have been compromised, according to a site that posts information and data from breaches. The\u00a0Campbell, Calif.-based company\u00a0runs several sites for adult social and sexual connections. The largest breach, according to LeakedSource.com , was of 340 million credentials from Adultfriendfinder.com, which says it allows users to \u201cfind sex, hook-up, and chat.\u201d Others included 7.1 million users from Penthouse.com, 1.1 million from iCams.com and 1.4 million from Stripshow.com. The stolen information includes usernames, passwords, and email addresses for users of the sites. LeakedSource generally makes stolen credentials searchable on its site. However, in this case it said\u00a0\"after much internal deliberation by the LeakedSource team and for various reasons, we have decided that this data set will not be searchable by the general public on our main page temporarily for the time being. FriendFinder Networks Inc. told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that it was investigating reports of\u00a0\"potential security vulnerabilities\u201d and was notifying affected users to give them information on how to protect themselves. An emailed request for more information\u00a0to FriendFinder Networks Inc. was not immediately answered. AdultFriendFinder was also breached in May of 2015, when information including sexual preference, marital status and other personal data for as many as 4 million members may have been stolen. Large online dating site AdultFriendFinder confirms data breach According to a blog posted by LeakedSource on Sunday, the FriendFinder Network was hacked in October 2016 and 20 years worth of customer data was stolen. If that number proves to be correct, it would make it the second-largest hack on record after the Yahoo data breach in September, which affected 500 million accounts. ",

    "text": "NOV. 14, 2016 By The New York Times | Source: Reuters \u201cInvestors have been frustrated with the limits of monetary policy,\u201d said Michael Zezas, a bond strategist with Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere has been a presumption of the necessity of fiscal stimulus. With a Trump presidency, the political rationale aligns with the economic rationale.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soaring bond yields are not the only way that this new \u201creflation trade\u201d is playing out. Investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like copper, the price of which was up 20 percent in the last month. Bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest rates, which help their lending margins. Even the long-suffering stock price of Deutsche Bank, for example, has bounced back by nearly 20 percent in the last week. More broadly, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 3.8 percent last week, while on Monday, the major market measures ended largely flat. Of course, such an investment trend carries with it serious risks. If bond yields shoot up too starkly, investors in the stock market will get jittery and all the fast money that has recently piled into stocks could turn tail, leaving chaos in its wake. For example, $22 billion has poured into exchange-traded funds that invest in the United States stock market in the last three days alone. Moreover, a sharp increase in bond market rates will put pressure on emerging markets, which have enjoyed a renaissance in recent months. Stock markets ranging from Brazil, India and Taiwan have been down sharply over the last week. The exchange-traded fund that invests in these and similar countries and is the market\u2019s truest gauge of sentiment toward developing markets is off more than 7 percent since Mr. Trump was elected. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is worth recalling that the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies, was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar \u2014 which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now. A Trump-inspired inflationary surge could also force the Federal Reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates, a dynamic that no investor wants to see. The trick, of course, for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and, in addition to pushing for a building boom, cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures. That could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control. For now, such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in Mr. Trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth, low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny, all of which pushed them into the safety and security of low-yielding government bonds. Some even suggest that a President Trump will not be unlike President Reagan in showing a devotion to bedrock laissez-faire principles, even if many of those philosophies were called into question when American investment banks nearly torpedoed the global economy. \u201cThe global impact of this stuff is that once you start it, you can\u2019t stop it,\u201d said Arthur Laffer, a supply-side evangelist who advised Ronald Reagan and was among a core group of economists who cobbled together Mr. Trump\u2019s own tax-slashing program. \u201cThat is the way it was with Reagan.\u201d ",

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP - Getty Images Share advertisement So much for machismo. You've been hearing of the women who voted for Donald Trump, but here's something you aren't hearing much about: Latino men voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. According to Latino Decisions' election eve polling of high-propensity Latino voters, 71 percent of Latino men voted for Clinton. In national exit polls, the number of Hispanic men who voted for the Democratic nominee was 62 percent. That's not as high as Latinas (women), 86 percent of whom backed Clinton in the Latino Decisions poll and 68 percent in national exit polls. But Latino men's votes for Clinton are much higher than white men: only 31 percent of white men voted for Clinton, whereas 63 percent voted for Donald Trump. An even higher share of Latino men in Nevada, 76 percent, voted for Catherine Cortez-Masto to be the state's senator, helping her defeat her male challenger Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican in the race. Play Trump forges 'white, working class path' 3:06 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161115035411if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/804505667824\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The huge support for Clinton defies the macho male stereotype often associated with Latinos. The negative stereotype usually connotes an image of a sexist, dominant male full of bravado and perhaps sexually aggressive. \"Machismo is a stereotype that does not allow us to see the diversity of masculinities in different communities,\" said A\u00edda Hurtado, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz who specializes in gender equity. She co-authored \"Beyond Machismo\" that was released in March. Certainly Latinos are more likely to vote Democrat and consider the Democratic Party more likely to care about issues of concern to Latinos, according to polling. But at the least, the election results show Latino men were willing to put aside gender to consider which party or candidate might best serve them, their family and/or their community. The stereotype of machismo tends to apply to Latino men, yet it \"does make us blind to how male privilege is consistent across different cultures,\" said Hurtado. As an example, she point to Trump himself. \"If you look at the rhetoric the president-elect has used about women, it is the archetype of machismo,\" yet he wasn't called a machista (male chauvinist),\" she said. Hurtado has conducted surveys of young male Latinos who had schooling beyond high school and asked how they defined manhood and who were men they admired. None mentioned machismo as defined by the stereotype and many identified male family members who they admired for characteristics such as being open hearted, helping the family and being honest people. In her own family, said Hurtado, she can point to her father, who gave his daughters the resources to go to school and encouraged them to get better educations without regard to gender. Related: Exit Polls: NBC News' Analysis of 2016 Votes and Voters Hurtado said Latino men's votes for Clinton could also be seen in a different light, apart from politics. \"Most men have incredible respect for their mothers and grandmothers; it would make sense, Hillary Clinton being older and having cast herself as an elder \u2014 she said I'm a grandmother \u2014that there would be room to think of her as a leader,\" Hurtado said. \"If you only think of (the stereotype) machismo, you would never catch that.\" Follow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

By Danielle Douglas-Gabriel November 14 at 6:50 PM Follow @DaniDougPost Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders elevated the issue of college affordability with campaign proposals to make public higher education free for the vast majority of American families, but those prospects have faded with the election of Donald Trump. Trump policy adviser Sam Clovis made it clear during the campaign that the Republican would not support free public higher education, calling the idea \u201cabsurd\u201d in an interview with Inside Higher Ed. And with congressional Republicans calling for the federal government to dial back its role in education, the chances of a federal-state partnership to lower the cost of college appear slim. Proponents of debt-free college, nevertheless, remain convinced that the movement still has legs. They say underlying concerns about skyrocketing student debt and price barriers in higher education are as relevant as ever. And even without federal support, they say, there\u2019s enough momentum at the state level to keep the movement alive. \u201cWe woke up Wednesday morning and the anxiety around college prices, around student debt didn\u2019t go away,\u201d said Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning think tank Demos who helped build the framework for the debt-free-college initiative. \u201cThe movement and the energy around meaningfully addressing college affordability doesn\u2019t go away. The tactics just shift.\u201d [ Trump just laid out a pretty radical student debt plan ] Though Trump has largely been silent on higher-education policy, late in the campaign he promised to work with Congress to ensure universities, especially those with hefty endowments, are making a good-faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt in exchange for federal tax breaks and funding. Exactly what that would entail is unclear; Trump\u2019s transition team, which did not respond to requests for comment, has been silent on the issue. Clovis has argued that there is no need for the federal government to partner with states to make community college free, a plan heralded by President Obama, because two-year schools are already affordable. [ Trump\u2019s win leaves Obama\u2019s higher-education initiatives in doubt ] There are at least 85 initiatives at the municipal and state level aiming to cover the cost of tuition at community colleges, according to the Upjohn Institute. Tennessee, Oregon and Minnesota have free community-college programs, with Tennessee\u2019s model getting praise from Obama as a viable path for reducing higher-education costs. \u201cAll we can do is go to the places where the conditions are friendly and see how this model works to the best of our ability,\u201d said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher-education policy and sociology at Temple University. \u201cAnd then when there are more-favorable conditions at the federal level, hopefully we\u2019ll have evidence and the case will be strengthened.\u201d State legislatures have been paying greater attention to college costs as local employers demand some form of postsecondary education. Workforce development anchors proposals making their way through solidly red states such as Mississippi and Oklahoma. At least eight other states with varying political leanings are considering legislation, while dozens of cities are taking it upon themselves to establish programs, said Celeste Carruthers, an associate professor at the University of Tennessee. \u201cThese programs are gaining popularity at the state level and would be hard to walk back even if there is no support at the federal level,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine how this patchwork of very different programs would have coalesced under one federal movement.\u201d Even as the idea of debt-free college gained national attention during the presidential campaign, it created division within higher education. Policy experts bristled at the idea of subsidizing the education of wealthy students and pointed out that tuition is just one of many expenses contributing to higher college costs. Others said public universities simply do not have the capacity to absorb the additional students who would be enticed to enroll and worried that covering tuition for everyone would be a waste of scarce resources. Clinton\u2019s higher-education plan called for a $450\u00a0billion investment. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a policy that was really ready for prime time at the federal level,\u201d said Matthew Chingos, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. \u201cThere were too many unanswered questions about whether this was the best use of limited public resources. If we\u2019re going to make college free, that means doing less for low-income people.\u201d Leaders at private universities also took issue with the idea of the federal government giving public colleges and universities an advantage in enrolling students. Small liberal-arts schools fighting against waning enrollment and tuition revenue were especially vocal in their dissent. Susan West Engelkemeyer, president of Nichols College in Massachusetts, wrote in The Washington Post that she had major concerns about the impact free public college would have on private schools such as hers, and she encouraged lawmakers to consider alternatives. She said the federal government could instead double the investment in the Pell grant program, a federal financial aid program aimed at families making less than $60,000 a year. Pouring more money into that effort could knock out a substantial amount of the cost of college, she said. \u201cWe could increase Pell 10 times and be under Clinton\u2019s estimated costs,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are ways that we can approach this that are more rational, less disruptive for small privates that are tuition driven and public institutions that rely on out-of-state tuition for their budget.\u201d Pell plays a critical role in the tuition-free proposals in the states, as many of them would cover tuition after the federal grant is applied. While Senate Republicans have backed efforts to expand Pell funding, their colleagues in the House have stymied legislation that would make the grant available throughout the academic year. That not only leaves the prospects for an expansion up in the air but also calls into question whether the existing funding levels will continue in the next administration. local ",

Harris, 35, faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced Dec. 5 in Cobb County, near Atlanta, on the eight counts of malice murder, felony murder, cruelty to children and dissemination of harmful materials to a minor. He has 30 days to appeal the convictions. Cooper Harris died June 18, 2014, after having remained in his father's Hyundai Tucson for seven hours outside the Home Depot office where Harris worked in the Atlanta suburbs. Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark moved the trial 275 miles to the southern Georgia city of Brunswick, citing pretrial publicity in the Atlanta area. Prosecutors contended that Harris intentionally planned to kill his son to escape his family responsibilities while he pursued sex with prostitutes and other women he met online. The dissemination charges stemmed from sexually explicit texts and photos he sent to an underage girl. Play ",

    "text": "Alshon Jeffery suspended 4 games for performance-enhancing drugs violation Photos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. The news arrived Monday afternoon at Halas Hall, blindsiding an already discouraged football team. Receiver Alshon Jeffery : suspended. Four games. Violation of the NFL 's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Just when it seemed like things couldn't get any worse \u2026 The Bears left Tampa on Sunday night reeling from a 36-10 loss to the Buccaneers that dropped them to 2-7. Then out of nowhere, they somehow suffered an even greater setback \u2014 and arguably a greater embarrassment \u2014 with Monday's development that Jeffery will be punished severely, suspended without pay and ineligible to return to the active roster before Dec. 12, the Monday of Week 15. \"Obviously we're very disappointed,\" Bears coach John Fox said. \"I think he's fairly embarrassed about it. But we'll support him and welcome him when he gets back.\" On Monday evening, Jeffery released a statement via his Twitter account (@TheWorldof_AJ) asserting that his suspension had been the result of taking \"a recommended supplement to combat inflammation.\" \"Unfortunately,\" Jeffery wrote, \"this supplement contained an ingredient that was on the NFL's banned substance list. I take full responsibility and I'm deeply upset with myself for not doing the proper research on this supplement. I want to apologize to my family, the Bears organization, my teammates, and Bears fans. I will work hard to earn back the respect and trust of the Bears nation and look forward to being back on the field.\" The Bears were separated into offensive and defensive meetings Monday when word on Jeffery's suspension came in. The initial shock gave way to acceptance. Still, the Bears had few ways to downplay the significance. \"It's not good at all,\" tight end Zach Miller said. \"It sucks not having your top weapon on offense. We have to figure out ways to do better collectively. But I don't think you really replace Alshon Jeffery that easily.\" For Jeffery, the setback is a costly one. Playing on a franchise tag worth $14.6 million this season, Jeffery will forfeit more than $3.4 million during his four-week absence. In a contract year, he'll also take a hit to his reputation. Coming into this season, questions swirled about Jeffery's durability, concerns that steered the Bears away from signing him to a long-term extension this summer. Now, even after the standout receiver played in this season's first nine games, recording 40 catches for 630 yards with one touchdown, additional questions will arise about his trustworthiness. Those questions figure to factor into Jeffery's quest for his next deal, whether it's with the Bears or another team. Fox couldn't say Monday whether Jeffery had appealed. Whether he had or not, the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances notes that a suspension is implemented only after an appeal has been lost or after a player has accepted discipline and opted not to appeal. Attempts to reach Jeffery's agent, Tory Dandy, were unsuccessful. Added Fox: \"I know Alshon's embarrassed by it and I'm sure disappointed would be a good word for the rest of us.\" As if Fox didn't already have enough on his plate trying to rejuvenate his struggling team and assure a disheartened franchise that he'll have things turned around soon. Now the Bears are headed into a daunting four-game stretch in which the offense will be without its top receiver. Furthermore, they could also be without Pro Bowl guard Kyle Long for the remainder of the season after he suffered a serious ankle injury Sunday. The Bears already rank last in the NFL in scoring, averaging 15.7 points per game. And they're coming off a woeful effort Sunday in which their only touchdown came on a 50-yard Hail Mary to Cameron Meredith to end the first half. Fox said the Bears would have to treat Jeffery's absence as if it were an injury and tried to assert that the potential return of fellow receiver Marquess Wilson could be a silver lining. But Wilson has been on the physically unable to perform list since training camp opened, recovering from a broken foot. As a former seventh-round pick, Wilson has only 47 career catches in his four seasons to date. If that's the silver lining, that's additional evidence that the floundering Bears are grasping. As for Jeffery's hiatus, with a potential return scheduled for Game 14 against the Packers, Fox communicated his wishes to the standout receiver. \"I hope he stays in shape,\" Fox said. \"He's done a pretty good job of that in the past. I think he understands how he has to go about it. I'm fairly confident he will.\" Still, in what's been a miserable season, Jeffery's transgression may be the most upsetting loss of the year. dwiederer@chicagotribune.com ",

I certainly hope so because our country needs it more than ever,\u201d incoming Florida Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist said between exiting a cab and heading for House freshman orientation. Crist, a former Republican and Florida governor, was among several incoming House members enthusiastic about Democrats and Republicans agreeing on a multi-billion-dollar spending package to create jobs and improve the country\u2019s crumbling roads, transportation hubs and other infrastructure. While President Obama took heat for years for his costly stimulus package that backed similar projects, infrastructure spending was touted this year by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \u201cI know that President-elect Trump has talked about the fact that our airports and seaports need to be fixed, as well as our highways and byways,\u201d Crist also said. \u201cSo I\u2019m optimistic about that.\u201d Monday also marked the return of sitting senators and House members, who after a two-month recess for the elections have just six weeks to pass a budget to avoid a government shutdown. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 On the Senate side, Sen.-elect Catherine Cortez-Masto, who won the seat in Nevada of fellow Democrat and retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, was on Capitol Hill, with the six other new members still arriving. Related Image Expand / Contract Nov. 14, 2016: Florida Democratic Rep.-elect Charlie Crist arriving on Capitol Hill for House freshman orientation. Fox News \"I'm honored to be the Senate-elect for the great state of Nevada,\" Cortez-Masto said during a brief press conference with Reid. \"Thank you.\" Perhaps the most activity in the upper chamber centered on the arrest of several demonstrators outside the office of New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, the expected next Senate minority leader. One of the demonstrators told Fox News the group was made up of disaffected millennials who hold Wall Street-backed Democrats partly responsible for Trump's victory over Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. They sat outside Schumer\u2019s office and called on him to withdraw his leadership bid. House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy told Fox News that Trump -- whose promise to dismantle the Washington establishment helped him win the White House -- is \u201cgoing to shake this place up.\u201d McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in the GOP-controlled House, declined to say how his chamber will pass a spending bill to keep the federal government fully operational after Dec. 31, though it will almost certainly take the form of a stopgap measure known as a continuing resolution. Trump\u2019s victory and Republicans keeping control Nov. 8 of their Senate majority will certainly help the GOP achieve its goals of further securing the southern U.S. border and finally getting to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d ObamaCare. Neither issue is expected to face any sort of final vote in this so-called lame duck session of Congress. However, McCarthy, of California, suggested the House will be working on the issues long before Trump is sworn in Jan. 20. House Republicans still have their internal vote for House speaker scheduled for Tuesday and are likely to nominate GOP Rep. Paul Ryan for another term, despite rumblings from some of the most conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill about delaying the vote or an outright change in leadership. The announcement Sunday that Ryan\u2019s Wisconsin hometown friend and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus will be Trump\u2019s chief of staff may have helped blunt those efforts. Even Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Monday he'll back Ryan for the post.\u00a0 Meanwhile, a group of about 25 House Democrats on Monday reportedly asked for a delay on voting to reappoint House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat predicted her party would retake control of the chamber but won only a handful of seats. \u201cOur data and ground game and Trump\u2019s momentum was a recipe for success up and down the ticket,\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday. The House will have 59 new members, though incoming New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter has already served in Congress. And four races remain undecided. The Senate has six new members, including three newly-arriving Democrats: Cortez-Masto, Kamala Harris of California, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. The three others come from the House: Reps. Todd Young, R-Ind.; Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.; and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. \u00a0 Fox News' Kara Rowland and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Free agent center fielder Dexter Fowler , as expected, declined the Cubs' one-year qualifying offer of $17.2 million. The Cubs will receive a compensation pick in the 2017 draft as long as Fowler signs elsewhere. Fowler, 30, who set a career-high with a .393 on-base percentage in 125 games, is expected to receive a multi-year offer, with the rival Cardinals , Giants, Mariners and Rangers among his projected suitors. The Cubs have options in the likely event they don't re-sign Fowler. Albert Almora could take over in center field if Gold Glove right fielder Jason Heyward shifts over, with Jorge Soler or Ben Zobrist taking over in right. The Cubs also must finalize their 40-man roster by Friday night. They currently have 34 players on their roster, but could leave a few spots open in the event they add a player through free agency or trade. Catcher Victor Caratini, outfielder Jacob Hannemann and pitcher Duane Underwood Jr. are among those who would be exposed to the Rule 5 draft if not placed on the 40-man roster. But Hannemann, 25, a third-round pick in the 2013 draft out of Brigham Young, batted only .247 to go with 26 stolen bases in only 74 games at Double-A Tennessee. Underwood, 22, a second-round pick in the 2012 draft out of Pope High School in Marietta, Ga., was limited to 18 starts and was a combined 0-6 with a 4.32 ERA at four minor league levels. Underwood pitched in only two games in the Arizona Fall League, allowing six runs on eight hits in six innings. Eligible players who aren't protected on the 40-man roster could be subject to the Rule 5 draft on Dec. 8 at the Winter Meetings in National Harbor, Md. Extra innings: According to the Cubs\u2019 website, the 2017 opener in St. Louis was moved from April 3 to April 2 at 7:30 p.m., presumably to accommodate a national television audience. The series will resume with games on April 4 and 5. ...

(Nov. 14) AP President Obama speaks during a press conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on Nov. 14, 2016. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) President Obama said Americans had to \"reconcile themselves\" to the Trump presidency, and \u2014 in a surprising turnabout from his pre-election rhetoric \u2014 spoke optimistically about the president-elect's ability to govern. Answering questions from reporters for the first time since voters handed the White House over to a candidate who promised to dismantle his agenda , Obama also pledged Monday to give President-elect Donald Trump the space he needs to put together a new government. He declined to comment on the appointment of alt-right firebrand Stephen Bannon to a top role in his White House, and steered clear of his campaign remarks that Trump was unfit for the\u00a0presidency. \"Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next president, the 45th president of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates,\" he said. \"Whenever you have got an incoming president of the other side, particularly after a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts.\" He did give Trump plenty of presidential advice\u00a0\u2014 on staffing, on reaching out to women and minorities, and even on his temperament.\u00a0He said an offhand remark from the president can move markets and impact national\u00a0security. \"There are going to be certain aspects of his temperament that will not serve\u00a0him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them,\" Obama said. Trump speaks with Putin by phone But on the whole, Obama spoke almost admiringly of Trump's political skills. \"What's clear is that he was able to tap into \u2014 yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive,\" he said. And that connection with his supporters made him \"impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate. \"That's powerful stuff,\" he said. Trump \"is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with,\" Obama said. \"I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately he is pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.\" The news conference provided a way for Obama to get domestic politics out of the way before he departs Monday night for a weeklong, three-country foreign trip that's expected to be the last of his presidency. \"I figure, why wait?\" he told reporters. That trip\u00a0\u2014 to Greece, Germany and Peru\u00a0\u2014 will give Obama a chance to reassure allies that bipartisan commitments are more enduring than any one administration. He's scheduled three news conferences during the trip, one on each leg, adding up to an extraordinary one-week stretch in\u00a0which he'll face the press four times. At the Monday news conference, Obama addressed: \u25ba The future of the Affordable Care Act: \"Obviously, this has been a holy grail for Republicans over the past six, seven years: 'We\u2019ve got to kill Obamacare.' That's been taken as an article of faith. 'It\u2019s terrible. It doesn't work, and we have to undo it,\" Obama said. But he argued that the GOP now has the challenge of how to improve on something that, Obama contends, is already doing well. \"On a lot of issues, now comes the hard part,\" he said. \u25ba His Oval Office meeting with Trump:\u00a0\"We had a very cordial conversation and that didn't surprise me,\" he said. \"I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He's somebody who I think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.\" Obama gave Trump some practical advice on staffing.\u00a0\"Probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff, particularly the chief of staff, the national security adviser, the White House counsel ... that's something that has to be attended to right away,\" he said. \"I think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that.\" Obama said he told Trump he was encouraged by his more conciliatory tone since the election, but said he needs to reach out to women and minority groups to assure them he can be their president, too.\u00a0\"Gestures matter,\" he said.\u00a0\"And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he has actually taken office.\" \u25ba The future of the Democratic Party: \"It\u2019s\u00a0a healthy thing for the Democratic party to go through some reflection. I think it's\u00a0important for me not to be bigfooting that conversation. We want to see new voices and new ideas emerge,\" he said. He defended the Democratic platform on economic and social issues. \"I believe we have better ideas, but I\u00a0also believe that good ideas won't happen if people don't hear them,\" he said. \"Given the population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. we have to show up everywhere.\" \u25ba\u00a0The closing of Guantanamo Bay prison:\u00a0\"It is true that I have not been able to close the darned thing, because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us,\" he said of the Cuban naval base that houses detainees from the war on terror. \"What is also true is that we\u2019ve significantly reduced the population.\" There are now just 60 detainees, down from a peak of about 770. He said there remains a \"group of very dangerous people\" who cannot be tried in civilian courts, often because of the sensitive nature of the evidence against them, but that they could be housed more efficiently in facilities on U.S. soil. \u00a0\"Congress disagrees with me, and I gather the president-elect does as well,\" he said. Obama: 'We have to change course' on Guantanamo \u25ba His legacy: Obama said his White House team should be proud of what they've accomplished. \"We've already ensured that when we turn over the keys, the car is in pretty good shape. We are indisputably in a better position now than we were when I came in eight years ago,\" Obama said, running through his usual litany of accomplishments including the auto bailout, job growth and health care costs. But he also added one that he doesn't often boast of: \"I am very proud of the fact that we will, knock on wood, exit this administration without significant scandal.\" While he admitted that there have been \"screw ups\" in the federal government, he said the federal government acts more ethically than in the past. \"The reason is, frankly, we listen to the lawyers,\" he said. \"You wouldn\u2019t know this if you were listening to some news outlets, or some members of oversight committees in Congress. But if you actually look\u00a0at the facts, it works.\" ",

    "text": "Nov 14 2016, 4:36 pm ET How Trump Can Gut Obama's National Security Policies on Day One by Ken Dilanian advertisement President Obama made aggressive use of the CIA and Special Operations Forces to hunt and kill al Qaeda, ISIS and other terror groups. But he also imposed a set of rules designed to regulate the conduct of U.S operatives \u2014 banning torture, for example, and minimizing the risk of civilian casualties in drone strikes. President-elect Trump, who campaigned against those rules, would be able to undo most of those rules in his first hour in office. In fact, if he chooses to do so, Trump can quickly reshape large swaths of American national security policy, much of which is governed by executive orders and presidential policy guidance that can be overridden by the president's signature. That includes U.S. sanctions on Russia, and its recent rapprochement with Cuba. \"The range of unilateral presidential authority is astonishingly broad,\" said Steven Aftergood, who directs the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. \"If you look at the presidential policy directives issued by Obama, they cover topics as diverse as biological weapons, nuclear weapons policy, intelligence surveillance policy, cyber operations, maritime security, arms-transfer policy, and on and on. And because it is based on presidential authority, it can also be revised and reshaped by a new president.\" An MQ-9 Reaper drone. SSgt Brian Ferguson / Department of Defense \"I think it would disastrous if Trump reverses a number of the president's executive policies, including repopulating Guantanamo,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Many of those policy documents are technical and uncontroversial, but Obama's counterterrorism rule book was a signature issue in Trump's campaign, as the target of his ire. Accusing Obama of not being ruthless enough, Trump advocated \"bombing the hell out of\" ISIS, bringing back interrogation techniques \"worse than waterboarding,\" and even killing the families of terrorists. Days after Obama took office in 2009, he signed executive orders banning the CIA from engaging in harsh interrogation techniques and from operating detention facilities, something it did under George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks. The torture ban later was enacted into law, but not the prohibition on the CIA operating so-called \"black sites,\" or secret detention facilities. Many current and former CIA officials say they would never again engage in harsh interrogations \u2014 even if ordered to do so \u2014 for fear they would be punished when the political winds changed under a new administration. But Trump easily could rescind Obama's orders and direct the CIA to capture and humanely interrogate terror suspects in secret overseas, something many Republicans have urged. Human rights groups oppose such a move, saying captured terrorists should be brought to justice in U.S. courts. Trump also has some wiggle room via executive order on what constitutes torture, despite the change in the law. Trump's comment about killing the families of terrorists, which would amount to a war crime, is not taken seriously by many national security scholars. Play ",

    "text": "Obama Says Despite Reservations, He Hopes Trump 'Makes Things Better' By MARGARET CHADBOURN Nov 14, 2016, 4:53 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH SPECIAL REPORT: Obama Holds 1st Press Conference Since Election 0 Shares Email Barack Obama today called for unity as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to takes over in January, despite the president's reservations about Trump's ability to lead the U.S. Obama said that the outcome of the election leaves him with \"concerns\" and that many didn't foresee Trump's victory. \"There was a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon ... that connection that he was able to make ... that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate. That's powerful stuff,\" Obama said in his first press conference since the 2016 election. \"What's clear was that he is able to tap into, yes, the anxieties but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive.\" While he promised his administration is working with Trump's transition team, Obama said he has reservations about Trump's temperament, adding that the presidency often magnifies any personal weaknesses. \"There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them,\" Obama said. He talked about his own inability to keep track of \"stacks of briefing books\" and said he has surrounded himself with \"people who can help\" and he hopes Trump does the same. \"The people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next president,\" Obama said. \"It will be up to him to set up a team that will serve his policies.\" Obama added, \"My hope is he makes things better. And if he does, we'll all benefit from it.\" He also said Trump is going to have to reach out to those who disagree with him. \"Because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and the ferocity of the campaigns ... it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to try to reach out to minority groups and women and others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,\" he said. President Obama's Long History of Insulting Donald Trump Obama added, \"It is important for us to let him make his decisions.\" And in the end, the American people will judge \"if they like what they see.\" He said he felt that Trump is \"sincere\" in wanting to move the country forward. \"[Trump] is going to try and make sure he delivers\" for his supporters and for those who voted for Hillary Clinton, Obama said. \"People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight,\" he added. Asked what he thought about Breitbart News Chairman Stephen Bannon's appointment as chief strategist, Obama declined to comment, citing his desire for a smooth transition of power. \"I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.\" In talking with Trump last week, Obama said he learned the incoming administration is committed to maintaining the role the U.S. plays with NATO and its allies. \"In my conversation with the president-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships, and so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance,\" Obama said. He offered his advice to the Democratic Party for the future, saying, \"We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere.\" Later today, Obama will depart on his final foreign trip as commander in chief and will make stops in Europe and Peru. He said his administration has \"stabilized the American economy\" and will continue to do so as the hand-off to Trump and his team occurs. Trump has stated he will dismantle some of Obama's top initiatives after he becomes president. \"This office is bigger than any one person, and that's why ensuring a smooth transition is so important,\" Obama said at the start of the press conference. \"The learning curve always continues,\" he added. \"This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on earth, and it is a constant flow of information, challenges and issues. That is true now more than it ever has been.\" 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports) New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski might have suffered another ailment that could threaten his playing time. Gronkowski suffered what is believed to be a punctured lung in Sunday night's 31-24 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. His timeline for return was unclear, though he could miss just one game, according to Rapoport. The Patriots play the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. During the second quarter, Gronkowski took what he later called \"one of the hardest\" hits in his career when he was struck by Seahawks safety Earl Thomas on an incompletion. He played throughout the game and was targeted on an end zone fade that fell incomplete in the final seconds to seal the Seahawks' win.\u00a0He finished with\u00a0three catches for 53 yards. Gronkowski missed the first two games of the season while dealing with a hamstring injury. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 10 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Richard Vogel/AP hide caption toggle caption Richard Vogel/AP A man carrying a sign that reads \"United Against Hate\" dances with other demonstrators during a protest against President-elect Donald Trump in Oliveira Plaza in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. Richard Vogel/AP Michigan middle school students chanting \"build a wall\" at Latino classmates . A woman speaking a foreign language on a San Francisco Bay Area train being called an \"ugly, mean, evil, little pig.\" A Los Angeles student reportedly teased that she was going to be deported . Since the presidential election, reports of intimidating and aggressive incidents toward minorities and women have surfaced across the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate incidents, has recorded more than 300 such reports in the past six days. SPLC spokesman Ryan Lenz tells The Two-Way that they \"span a number of different sorts of ideological motivators,\" including anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and anti-women attitudes. Rights groups have called for President-elect Donald Trump and other politicians to take a strong stand against intimidation. \"After a long campaign in which various ideologies from the radical right were given a direct conduit into the mainstream of American politics,\" Lenz says, \"it seems that with the election of President-elect Donald Trump, that these ideologies and those who adhere to them feel that they are legitimized or authorized in some way to act out in the public space where previously they existed only online.\" Article continues after sponsorship The only other comparable moment in this country since the turn of the century was the flood of anti-Muslim incidents immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, he adds. Trump was asked in a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday night about the widespread reports. He said he was \"saddened\" and called the reports \"terrible.\" Looking into the camera, he told the perpetrators to \"stop it\" and vowed to \"bring this country together.\" But a major political appointment on Sunday might fuel divisions: Trump tapped Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon has served as head of Breitbart News, a far-right media outlet that has been a platform for the so-called alt-right movement, which espouses white nationalism. The SPLC says it hasn't been able to independently verify all of the recent reports. And it's worth noting that \"some anti-immigrant and other bullying stories are spreading unchecked on social media,\" as NPR's Kirk Siegler reported , \"but there are a growing number of confirmed investigations into alleged harassment and hate crimes.\" For example, a diverse Episcopal church in Silver Spring, Md., found racist graffiti scrawled in several spots prior to Sunday's services, member station WAMU reports . The messages read, \"Trump Nation, Whites only.\" On one side an invitation to pray and love and on the other racist xenophobic hatred- Hillandale Church @wamu885news pic.twitter.com/9bspZDXcIS \u2014 Armando Trull (@trulldc) November 13, 2016 In Philadelphia, the Anti-Defamation League says swastikas combined with pro-Trump graffiti were discovered last Wednesday on an abandoned storefront. Many of these reports are coming from school and university campuses. At Minnesota's Maple Grove Senior High School, a bathroom stall was said to have been defaced with \"#whitesonly,\" \"#whiteamerica\" and \"Trump,\" among others. \"Students say they now worry about going to class,\" according to a local CBS affiliate . In a letter to parents , the school's principal said he was \"horrified\" and that it \"goes against everything for which our school stands.\" At San Diego State University, a student was walking in the stairwell of a parking structure when two men confronted her and robbed her, according to the police report , which says the men \"made comments about President-Elect Trump and the Muslim community.\" Many school districts around the country are proactively providing support and counseling to students, while trying to open up a dialogue in classrooms. \"We must ensure that our students feel safe by providing safe and respectful learning communities,\" Boston Public School Superintendent Tommy Chang said in a letter to parents the day after the election, as The Washington Post reported . In another letter sent the same day , Denver Public Schools Superintendent Tom Boasberg told parents, \"We encourage students, families and educators to talk, to create safe spaces where hopes, fears and differences can be raised \u2014 spaces where we can challenge each other to reach common ground on issues that divide us.\" A third-grade teacher in Philadelphia is responding by leading her students in anti-racist, empowering affirmations, as NPR's Eyder Peralta reports . \"I can do anything I put my mind to,\" the students say in unison in a video that has been viewed 3.2 million times. Teacher Jasmyn Wright posted the video on Facebook and says that ultimately, it's up to students \"to face adversity and defeat it.\" Larry Ferlazzo of Sacramento, Calif., asked his students, which include many immigrants, to write letters to Trump himself expressing their fears about the election. Several of the notes were published by the Post . \"During the election, some of the things you said made us feel really bad for myself and my family and others. It really made me cry,\" says one student from Afghanistan. \"My family and I hope you will be nice and don't be racist and love us back.\" ",

I don't think he is ideological,\" Obama said in his first press conference since Trump's stunning election victory. \"I think ultimately, he is pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.\" \"Some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people,\" Obama added. Related: Obama to Trump: Think 'Long and Hard' On Endangering Dreamers The president said he told Trump during their White House meeting last week that \"gestures matters\" when preparing his new administration and stressed the importance of reaching out to groups that opposed him during the tumultuous election. \"I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contest and so divided, gestures matter,\" Obama said. \"And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he has actually taken office.\" A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 The president declined to comment on Steve Bannon's appointment as Trump's \"chief strategist and senior counselor,\" saying the Republican should be given space to allow his administration to take shape. Bannon has been linked to the \"alt-right\" movement that has ties to white nationalism. \"I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge, over the course of the next couple of years, whether they like what they see,\" Obama said. The presser took place before the president headed to Greece, Germany and Peru in what will be his final foreign trip in office and a chance to reassure nervous leaders abroad. Trump, Obama said, said he is committed to maintaining the country's major international alliances \u2014 including NATO, which Trump railed against during the campaign. But the president's message was also aimed at Americans worried what a Trump presidency could mean for them. \"The federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It's an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes, even in our first two years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy,\" Obama said. Play ",

Abdullahi Mohamed Yusuf is the first of nine men being sentenced in Minneapolis this week in the plot. The 20-year-old pleaded guilty more than a year ago of conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, and testified against some of the others. What is it about life in Minnesota that makes death in Syria so appealing to young Somali-Americans? \"Average Mohamed\" explains U.S. District Judge Michael Davis sentenced Yusuf to the 21 months he\u2019s already served in jail, plus 20 years of supervised release. Davis said it didn\u2019t make sense to send Yusuf to prison because the government would miss a chance to help him. Yusuf promised the judge he wouldn\u2019t let him down. Prosecutors had asked for 42 months, but U.S. Attorney Andy Luger praised Yusuf for his cooperation and said he accepted the sentence. CBS News\u2019 Jamie Yuccas reports some of the conditions for Yusuf\u2019s release include the requirements that he get a GED or high school diploma, submit to periodic drug tests, go through mental health counseling, give up his passport, and not use the internet without probation officer permission. The men on trial in the case are to be sentenced in groups of three Monday through Wednesday. Prosecutors are seeking just a few years for defendants who cooperated with them and as many as 40 years for those who didn\u2019t. Abdirizak Warsame was the second man in the conspiracy to be sentenced, and got a tougher sentence than the first -- 2\u00bd years in prison. \u00a0 Abdullahi Mohamed Yusuf CBS Minnesota Warsame told District Judge Michael Davis that he was manipulated. Davis told Warsame he didn\u2019t buy his claims that he was no longer radical, and felt his cooperation with authorities was a matter of convenience. Warsame had sought 18 months, while prosecutors asked for 4\u00bd years. Zacharia Abdurahman was sentenced to 10 years for conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS. He received a longer sentence for not cooperating with prosecutors, reports CBS News\u2019 Heba Kanso. When Judge Davis asked Abdurahman why he didn\u2019t cooperate, Abdurahman said: \u201cAs a man I made decision not to do that to my former friends.\u201d.\u00a0 Court sketch from Monday\u2019s sentencing hearing Ken Avidor Davis has sought evaluations on the men to determine how likely they were to pursue terroristic activities in the future. Minnesota has the nation\u2019s largest population of Somali immigrants and has\u00a0 struggled in recent years to stop recruiting of its young men by terror groups aboard. The FBI has said about a dozen people have left Minnesota to join militant groups in Syria in recent years. Additionally, ISIS took responsibility for an apparent terror attack at a Minnesota mall in September, which was committed by a Somali American. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Privacy Policy At a news conference before leaving on a weeklong trip to Greece, Germany and Peru, Mr. Obama appeared to be doing his best to give Mr. Trump space as he begins forming his administration. He also continued his efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to preserve his legacy, pointedly reminding him that repealing the Affordable Care Act could be politically unpopular and that ripping up global agreements like the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris climate accord would be difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to let him make his decisions,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see.\u201d He refused to say whether he still considered Mr. Trump unfit to sit in the Oval Office and have access to the nuclear codes, and equated Mr. Trump\u2019s shortcomings with his own troubles organizing paperwork on his desk. The closest Mr. Obama came to criticizing Mr. Trump was when he said the president-elect would have to temper his impulse to make explosive comments and shade the truth once he was sworn in. A list of possibilities for key posts in the new administration. \u201cThere are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people.\u201d Congressional Republicans remained largely silent about the appointment of Mr. Bannon, choosing instead to praise Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement that Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, would be the new White House chief of staff. In remarks to reporters, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican majority leader in the House, said he would \u201cnot prejudge\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s choice. But critics of Mr. Bannon continued to raise questions about his background and his tenure as the chairman of Breitbart News. A 2011 radio interview surfaced in which Mr. Bannon praised Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin by saying they were not \u201ca bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThat drives the left insane,\u201d he added, \u201cand that\u2019s why they hate these women.\u201d The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the selection of Mr. Bannon \u201csends the disturbing message that anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and white nationalist ideology will be welcome in the White House.\u201d That view was echoed by the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks hate groups and said Mr. Trump \u201cshould rescind this hire.\u201d \u201cIn his victory speech, Trump said he intended to be president for \u2018all Americans,\u2019\u201d the center said. \u201cBannon should go.\u201d Republicans who had long opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy also took to Twitter on Sunday night and Monday morning to warn that his choice to rely on the advice of Mr. Bannon was an indication of the way he would govern. \u201cThe racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office,\u201d said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who ran the presidential campaign of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and previously advised Senator John McCain of Arizona. \u201cBe very vigilant, America.\u201d The racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office. Be very vigilant America. \u2014         John Weaver (@JWGOP) Nov. 13, 2016 But people close to Mr. Bannon came to his defense. Joel B.

They are \u201cvery afraid and worried,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli said on Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this will mean.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Their confusion, and the divided response to the family\u2019s presence here, mirrors the experience of many other refugee families and Muslim Americans. In the past week, even as advocates report a steep rise in attacks and acts of intimidation against blacks, Muslims and immigrants \u2014 and on women wearing hijabs \u2014 many of those episodes have been followed by public acts of support and solidarity. At Baylor University in Waco, Tex., hundreds of students and faculty members walked to class with Natasha Nkhama, a black student, after a friend posted a video of her describing an episode in which she was called a racial slur and forced off a sidewalk by someone who said, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make America great again.\u201d In Georgia, Mairah Teli, a Muslim teacher at Dacula High School, posted a photograph of an anonymous note she received on Friday that said she should \u201ctie\u201d her head scarf around her neck and \u201chang yourself with it.\u201d A day later, she wrote in another Facebook post : \u201cI am overwhelmed and deeply touched by all of the outcry and support that I have received in the past 24 hours. I can\u2019t even begin to articulate how touched I am to be receiving messages from all over the country with your support.\u201d Acts of hate and intimidation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, occurred across the country during the campaign, and have increased significantly since Mr. Trump was declared the president-elect. But the back and forth between acceptance and rejection can be particularly confusing for new arrivals like the Lalqaraghulis. Photo Letters and gifts given to the Lalqaraghuli family from strangers who reached out in support. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Their new home of Dundalk is an inner-ring suburb of Baltimore, one of the many working-class communities where the nation\u2019s battles over identity have become most intense. It was once a lively hub of workers filing into plants for Bethlehem Steel, General Motors and other manufacturing giants. Now it is dominated by strip malls. Ra\u2019ad Lalqaraghuli said he was initially eager to call it home. \u201cWhen I arrived in America, I was so happy,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli, 43, said. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream country for my children.\u201d He\u2019d had experiences with Americans before. A graduate of Mosul University, in 2004 he began working as a group engineer for American contractors and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to help rebuild his country after the American invasion. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A promotion to project manager in 2009 led to his overseeing the construction of water treatment plants and several schools in Baghdad and two cities south of the capital, Nasiriya and Basra. But his work for the Americans also brought him unwanted attention from terrorist groups. He spent one winter sleeping outside in the forest, to keep himself hidden, while his wife and children stayed with her family. Militants from the Islamic State abducted two of his younger brothers and one older brother instead. \u201cThey said, \u2018In exchange for you, we\u2019ll give them back.\u2019\u201d He and his father didn\u2019t believe them, and the three brothers were killed. His work on behalf of the United States government made him and his family eligible for humanitarian protection under special immigrant visas. Lawyers in New York supported his application, and he received approval quickly. Then, last year, a militia bombed the family home. \u201cI lost everything,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli said. At the Baghdad airport, heading to the United States, he still worried that he was being followed. All he had was his plane ticket, his passport, $100, and his wife and four children. Betsy Fisher, the deputy policy director of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project , which resettled the family, said she was dismayed to learn of its newfound anxiety, especially after the many attempts on Mr. Lalqaraghuli\u2019s life for several years by different groups in Iraq. \u201cThe people who enter this country as refugees are fleeing from terrorism,\u201d she said. \u201cThey cannot live in a place with violence.\u201d Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

    "text": "Donald Trump and his family spoke with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl in their first TV interview since the election. Stahl asked Mr. Tr... Among the protesters was 16-year-old Brian Rodriguez, who said he is U.S.-born to parents from Mexico and Guatemala and was offended by Trump\u2019s criticism of Latinos. \u201cIt hurt me inside knowing somebody from outside our race is talking bad about us,\u201d said Rodriguez, who carried a sign that read, \u201cBrown and Proud.\u201d Rodriguez said his school\u2019s principal opened the gates and told students they could participate. Nancy Meza, a community organizer who announced the walkout, said she helped students organize it after they reached out to her. \u201cIt was really out of frustration of students wanting to voice their opinions,\u201d Meza said. \u201cAnd wanting to feel protected.\u201d ___ DENVER About 200 middle- and high-school students left two Denver charter schools to march to the state Capitol, where they chanted and held up signs saying, \u201cMillennial voice matters\u201d and \u201cMake peace not war.\u201d Police and school officials escorted the students, who attend Denver\u2019s Strive Prep Excel High School and Byers Middle School, along city streets to the Capitol building to ensure their safety. They called out \u201cSi, se puede\u201d -- Spanish for \u201cYes, we can\u201d -- and \u201cThe people united will never be divided\u201d as they waved their signs. Noelie Quintero, 17, who attends Strive Prep, said they were representing Latinos, Muslims, women and others marginalized by Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere -- we\u2019re going to continue to stand strong,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re only 16- and 17-year-olds and we can\u2019t vote, our voice matters. What we believe matters, and we\u2019re not going to stop.\u201d ___ PORTLAND, OREGON In a city that has seen some of the largest and most destructive protests, a few hundred high school students from at least four campuses walked out of class to gather in the rain in front of City Hall. Portland Public Schools officials said students from Beaumont, Irvington, MLC, Tabor, Sunnyside, Hosford, Cleveland, Wilson, Benson and Franklin were among the participants in the protest and march,\u00a0 CBS affiliate KOIN reported .\u00a0 College students from Reed College joined the group, who held signs saying \u201cStudents for change\u201d and \u201cLove trumps hate.\u201d The protesters marched across the Hawthorne Bridge, some of them climbing up it, while officers stopped traffic. It comes after protesters smashed windows at Portland businesses and caused other vandalism recently. Daily demonstrations since Thursday have led to $1 million in damage and more than 100 arrests. Portland Mayor Charlie Hales says violent protests aren\u2019t a productive way to create change and believes they are being used in his city as cover for \u201coutrageous, bad, criminal behavior.\u201d A protest organizer says activists are reaching out to their counterparts in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and other major cities in an effort to keep Trump from prevailing on many of his issues. \u201cTrump is going to be president, so we need to prepare for that,\u201d Greg McKelvey of the group Portland\u2019s Resistance said Monday. McKelvey said they want to ensure local governments fight racial disparities in policing and help address global warming. ___ SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND Hundreds of high school students left campus and took to the streets to declare their opposition to Trump, while hundreds more gathered for a rally at a school football stadium.

Emily Kask for NPR hide caption toggle caption Emily Kask for NPR The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it needs more information before it can decide whether to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built along its planned route. In a joint statement by the U.S. Army and Department of the Interior, the Corps announced it had finished a review of the route, and concluded that more study was needed before it could grant the pipeline company the easement it needs to cross under a section of the Missouri River. Protesters, Police Still Clashing Over Disputed North Dakota Pipeline The pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners is building the pipeline to bring crude oil from central North Dakota, near the Bakken oil fields, down to Illinois. The current route crosses the river close to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation north of Cannon Ball, N.D. Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy wrote in a letter to the company and to tribal leaders that, \"additional discussion with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and analysis are warranted,\" reported The Associated Press, and that the discussion would include possible changes to the river crossing which could reduce the risk of an oil spill. Protesters have been occupying land in the area since the summer. Members of the tribe have said they are concerned that the pipeline could contaminate their drinking water if it leaks. The tribe previously filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order to stop construction of the pipeline, on the grounds that the Army Corps did not adequately consult with them about the route. In court documents , allies of the tribe alleged the pipeline route goes through sacred sites, and argued the tribe had not been able to survey the area for cultural artifacts and graves before the route was approved. Article continues after sponsorship In September, a federal judge decided not to grant the restraining order, as we reported , but three federal agencies responded to the ruling by saying they would not allow the pipeline to cross the Missouri until until a review was completed. That review, completed today, led the Army Corps to ask for more input from the tribe. In Fight Over N.D. Pipeline, Tribe Leader Calls For Peace And Prayers As the legal wrangling has gone on, many demonstrators have clashed with police. Earlier this month police used pepper spray and what they called nonlethal ammunition to keep people off private land, and in October more than 100 people were arrested, as NPR's Jeff Brady has reported . Some 412 people have been arrested in connection with the protests, according to the United Nations . The U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has expressed \"deep concerns\" about the route, saying \"numerous individuals have confirmed that there has been little consultation by the federal government related to the DAPL project.\" Environmental and indigenous-rights groups supporting the protesters were planning to attract attention to the issue with demonstrations outside Army Corps of Engineers offices, along with banks and other locations in multiple cities on Tuesday, according to email press releases from the groups.

Hear the verdict being read aloud in court. Justin Ross Harris with son Cooper. (Photo: VPC, USA TODAY) BRUNSWICK, Ga. \u2014\u00a0A father on Monday was found guilty of murder in the\u00a0death of his toddler son left inside a hot car more than two years ago. Justin Ross Harris, 35, had been indicted on eight counts in connection with the June 18, 2014, heat-stroke death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. After more than a month of testimony and four days of deliberations, a\u00a0Glynn County jury found Harris guilty on all charges. Three of the counts\u00a0\u2014 malice murder and two charges of\u00a0felony murder\u00a0\u2014 carry mandatory life sentences.\u00a0With the malice murder charge, prosecutors accused Harris of intentionally killed his son to escape the responsibilities of family life; the felony murder charges required no proof of intent to kill. Prosecutors argued Harris must have known Cooper sweltered in his sport-utility vehicle for about seven hours. He drove less than 2 minutes to work after strapping the child into his car seat when they finished breakfast at a Chick-fil-A restaurant about a half mile from Harris\u2019 office where he was a Web developer for Home Depot. Jury gets murder case of Ga. dad who left son in hot car Parking lot surveillance video showed Harris went to his car after lunch and tossed in some light bulbs he had purchased\u00a0though he never got inside. Prosecutors\u00a0accused Harris of deliberately leaving Cooper in the back seat of his SUV and said Harris told others that he wanted to live a child-free life. They gathered\u00a0videos, photographs, cellphone records, emails, texts, and other data to support their case. Harris, who was married at the time, also was having sexual relationships \u2014 both online banter and in-person affairs \u2014 with numerous women, including a prostitute and a teenager. They maintained that contributed to his desire to live a child-free life. Prosecutor: Georgia dad let son die in hot SUV to \u2018escape,' sext with women Harris and his defense team contended that Cooper's death was a tragic accident. The case was moved from Marietta to Brunswick, more than 300 miles southeast, because of pretrial publicity. Friends and family members testified that Harris was a devoted and loving father, and the jury watched video clips of Harris trying to teach Cooper to say \u201cbanana\u201d and letting the boy strum his guitar. The joyous moments had some jurors laughing aloud. Harris\u2019 ex-wife, Leanna Taylor, also came to his defense. She divorced him in March and bitterly told the jury that Harris \u201cdestroyed my life.\u201d Georgia judge agrees to move trial in hot-car death But she testified he was a loving father who, regardless of how unhappy he may have been in their marriage, would not have harmed their son on purpose. Also testifying in Harris\u2019 defense was Gene Brewer, an Arizona State University psychology professor who specializes in memory and attention. He said it would have been possible for Harris to forget about Cooper in a matter of seconds. Harris was also found guilty of sending sexual text messages to a teenage girl and asked for nude photos of her pubic area. The girl testified Harris knew she was in high school the months they swapped sexual banter when she was 16 and 17, and Harris several times sent her photos of his penis. He was asking for a photo of her breasts the day Cooper died. In 2012, Harris moved to Georgia from Tuscaloosa, Ala. He had lived in suburban Atlanta, which is also where Cooper died.

    "text": "Privacy Policy A week after their respective political operations wrapped up tens of millions of dollars in ads vilifying the other guy, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan will be in the same room to resume discussions on Illinois' economic future. The Tuesday morning Capitol huddle will take place after days of political posturing on both sides. Coming out of last week's election and looking toward his own re-election in 2018, Rauner called for a meeting with the four legislative leaders, and his surrogates quickly put out news releases in support of the request. Not that numerous closed-door gatherings have produced much during the long budget impasse beyond a stopgap funding agreement that expires at year's end. But asking for a meeting allowed Rauner to look like he's attempting to get something done as state's chief executive. Madigan, meanwhile, didn't respond until Sunday evening, and his spokesman didn't offer much of an excuse for declining beyond a generic scheduling conflict. That prompted Democratic Senate President John Cullerton to pull out, observing that it wouldn't be a very productive meeting without everyone in the fold. And so Rauner went ahead and met privately Monday with Republican legislative leaders, with Democrats ' refusal to participate playing into the governor's argument that they're not bargaining in good faith. By afternoon, however, Madigan moved to correct the optics. The speaker said he'd be able to huddle Tuesday, with his office noting that it was Madigan who decided what time the meeting would occur. So far, the post-election atmosphere is a lot like it was before voters weighed in last week, awarding a net gain of four House seats and two Senate seats to Republicans. Rauner and his deep-pocketed allies covered much of the cost for the GOP campaigns, while Madigan's Democrats were backed by money from labor unions and trial lawyers. After all that money was spent, the sides may now be more entrenched, beholden to the political agendas of those who helped them keep their jobs. Meanwhile, the state's historic budget stalemate has been going on nearly 18 months, sending debt soaring and threatening everything from universities to meal plans for the elderly. The two sides agreed to a stopgap spending plan in June, which had the dual benefit of letting lawmakers hit the campaign trail while keeping programs afloat through the end of the year. But that's set to expire in six weeks, and there's little indication either side is prepared to back off of the positions that's driven the divide. Rauner still is pushing for economic reforms as part of a larger deal, saying budget cuts and a tax increase alone won't put the state on a solid long-term financial footing. While Rauner's wish list has changed over time, the governor frequently has referenced limiting payouts for workers hurt on the job and curbing collective bargaining rights. Following Tuesday's election, Madigan reiterated that Democrats \"will continue to protect the middle class.\" \"Illinois residents want strong schools, funding for domestic violence shelters and veterans' homes, and a strong middle class with good wages,\" Madigan said last week. \"I hope Republicans will finally join us to protect these priorities and help deliver the services families are counting on.\" Republicans on Monday countered that it's time for Democrats to put forth their own plan, saying there have been several attempts to come to an agreement through working groups only to be stymied by leadership. They rejected the notion that Madigan may be less willing to cut a deal after he was the subject of repeated campaign attacks. \"He's got a job to do on behalf of the people of Illinois,\" said Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno , of Lemont. \"That's insane to think that because he lost seats, he shouldn't have to participate. That's an absolute dereliction of duty.\" The back-and-forth comes as lawmakers return to Springfield this week to deal with legislation the governor rejected or attempted to re-write through vetoes. House GOP leader Jim Durkin , of Western Springs, said that work should be put off until a budget agreement is reached, though the Senate planned to take up at least one major veto on Tuesday of a measure aimed at making voter registration automatic in Illinois. The legislation received strong bipartisan support, passing 86-30 in the House and 50-7 in the Senate. Democrats view Tuesday's planned override as a test of Rauner's strength and whether he will be able to make the veto stick despite previous support from Republicans. ",

Justin Harris with his son, Cooper CBS Atlanta A jury of six men and six women began weighing evidence last Tuesday morning, after the month-long trial of Justin Ross Harris, 35. Prosecutors say Harris intentionally left his 22-month-old son, Cooper, to die in his SUV in the parking lot of his suburban Atlanta workplace on June 18, 2014. Defense attorneys say Harris loved his son and the death was a tragic accident. Harris faced a total of eight counts including malice murder, two counts of felony murder -- which does not require proof of intent to kill -- cruelty to children in the first degree and cruelty to children in the second degree. Harris also faced charges in relation to his alleged \u201csexting\u201d with a teen, including criminal attempt to commit felony sexual exploitation of a child, and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor. He was found guilty of all counts. Harris did not show emotion as the verdict was read. A judge told him he had 30 days to file an appeal. When she asked Harris if he understood that, he replied, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He reportedly faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus 42 years. It\u2019s not clear when he will be sentenced. Jurors heard from a total of 70 witnesses, 52 of whom testified for the prosecution, reported CBS affiliate WGCL. Harris\u2019 defense attorney argued last week that his client was \u201cclueless\u201d and forgetful. \u00a0But a prosecutor called Harris a murderer with a \u201cmalignant heart,\u201d who killed his child to escape his family commitments as he sank deeper into a double life of sexual flirting and affairs with women he met online. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of an adult hating his child,\u201d prosecutor Chuck Boring told jurors during closing arguments. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he loved himself and his other obsessions more than that little boy.\u201d Leanna Taylor testifies during a murder trial for her ex-husband Justin Ross Harris Monday, Oct. 31, 2016, in Brunswick, Ga.\u00a0 John Bazemore, AP Harris left his son strapped into his car seat in the back of his SUV on June 18, 2014. The boy was dead when his father pulled him from the vehicle more than seven hours later. He told police he took Cooper to breakfast that morning and then drove straight to work, forgetting to take the child to day care. Defense attorney Maddox Kilgore told jurors that police rushed to judgment in concluding a crime had been committed and then used evidence of Harris\u2019 affairs outside his marriage \u201cto essentially bury him in a mountain of his own sexual sins.\u201d He insisted the child\u2019s death was unrelated. \u201cIf it\u2019s an accident, it\u2019s not a crime,\u201d Kilgore said. \u201cHe is responsible. Only him. Nobody else. And he has acknowledged that from day one. But responsible is not the same thing as criminal.\u201d Harris became emotional several times during the trial, including when a medical examiner detailed the boy\u2019s \u201cagonizing\u201d last hours. The boy\u2019s mother and Harris\u2019 ex-wife, Leanna Taylor, took the stand in his defense. Taylor described the man as a loving, involved father, but later said he \u201cruined my life.\u201d The trial took place in the coastal Georgia town of Brunswick because of pre-trial publicity in the Atlanta area. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone for the first time on Monday, agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries, according to a statement from the Kremlin. The two agreed \u201con the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations,\u201d said the statement, and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts \u201cto normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues.\u201d The issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism. Mr. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Mr. Trump last Wednesday, sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor, but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously. Mr. Putin repeated the congratulations over the phone. The Russian president said he hoped that Moscow could build a \u201ccollaborative dialogue\u201d with Washington on the bases of \u201cequality, mutual respect and noninterference in the other\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d the release said. The two men also discussed Syria in the context of \u201cthe need to work together in the struggle against the No. 1 common enemy \u2014 international terrorism and extremism,\u201d the statement said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Although Mr. Putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race, the state-run news media, which answers to him, clearly pulled for Mr. Trump. Among other issues, Mr. Putin blames Hillary Clinton , then secretary of state, for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in 2012. After Mrs. Clinton lost, the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the \u201cblonde woman.\u201d During the campaign, senior United States security officials accused Russia of hacking the computers at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the Clinton campaign. Mr. Putin denied any state role in the hacking. The Russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the American election result, with members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature, breaking into applause at the announcement. The United Russia party, loyal to Mr. Putin, dominates the Duma. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election, particularly after Mr. Trump suggested that Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine, should belong to Russia and that the United States should ally itself with Russia and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad to fight the Islamic State. Mr. Trump also suggested the United States might dilute its support for NATO, which Russia considers a main threat. Much of the brief statement from the Kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that Mr. Putin had made about his goals for relations with Washington, including \u201ca return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation.\u201d Mr. Putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security. Some analysts, however, have suggested that Mr. Trump is unpredictable and the traditional Republican penchant for painting Russia as a dire threat could still emerge. The Putin administration is hoping that the West will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in Ukraine. Advertisement On the phone call, which the Kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent, the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future. Earlier, Mr. Trump described the note on his victory that he received from Mr. Putin as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d For its part, Russia has continued its glowing tributes to Mr. Trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the Russian media as the swamp of American politics. The main weekly news program on state television every Sunday night tends to focus mainly on the United States, with Dmitry Kiselyov, the anchor, suggesting this week that Europe follow the American lead in replacing its leaders. Under President Trump, Mr. Kiselyov said, the American government would finally drop what the Russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy. \u201cRussia has a lot of trust in Trump,\u201d he said.

USA TODAY NETWORK Gwen Ifill will join Judy Woodruff as co-anchor of 'PBS NewsHour' beginning in September. (Photo: PBS) Gwen Ifill, one of the nation's most prominent journalists, has died after several months of cancer treatment, PBS confirmed Monday. Ifill, 61, was moderator and managing editor of Washington Week,\u00a0a weekly political discussion show. Ifill was also managing editor of PBS NewsHour,\u00a0an hour-long evening newscast she co-anchored with Judy Woodruff. In 2009, she also wrote a book about President Obama, The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. \"It is with extreme sadness that we share the news that Gwen Ifill passed away earlier today surrounded by family and friends,\" according to a statement from Paula Kerger, PBS' CEO. \"Gwen was one of America\u2019s leading lights in journalism and a fundamental reason public media is considered a trusted window on the world by audiences across the nation.\" Ifill, a native of New York City, was a trailblazer in many ways.\u00a0Prior to joining PBS in 1999, Ifill was one of the first African-American journalists to\u00a0hold prominent positions in both broadcasting and print journalism. She was\u00a0chief congressional and political correspondent for NBC News, White House correspondent for The New York Times\u00a0and a political reporter at\u00a0The Washington Post.\u00a0She also worked at the Baltimore Evening Sun and the Boston Herald American.

In 2004, she moderated the debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, and the 2008 debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. In a news conference Monday, President Obama noted the groundbreaking achievements in Ifill's career and said she \"did her country a great service.\" \"She not only informed today\u2019s citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow\u2019s journalists,\" he said. \"She was especially a powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity and her intellect, and for whom she blazed a trail as one half of the first all-female anchor team\u00a0on network news.\" PBS' Kerger said Ifill\u00a0pursued journalistic excellence in her uniquely calm and graceful style. \"Her contributions to thoughtful reporting and civic discourse simply cannot be overstated,\" Kerger said. \"She often said that her job was to bring light rather than heat to issues of importance to our society.\u00a0Gwen did this with grace and a steadfast commitment to excellence. Our sorrow at her passing is a part of our profound gratitude for all that she did for our system and our nation. It was an honor to know Gwen and to work with her. All of us at PBS express our sincere condolences to Gwen\u2019s friends and family.\" Ifill's work was honored by many, including the Radio and Television News Directors Association, Harvard\u2019s Joan Shorenstein Center, Ebony magazine and Boston\u2019s Ford Hall Forum. She received more than 20 honorary doctorates and served on the boards of the News Literacy Project and\u00a0the Committee to Protect Journalists, PBS said. \u201cGwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change,\" Sara Just, executive producer of PBS NewsHour\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0\"She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist\u2019s journalist and set an example for all around her.\" \"So many people in the audience felt that they knew and adored her. She had a tremendous combination of warmth and authority. She was stopped on the street routinely by people who just wanted to give her a hug and considered her a friend after years of seeing her on TV,\" Just said. ",

According to paperwork obtained by ABC News, U.S. Magistrate Judge William E. Duffin has ordered the \"Making a Murderer\" subject to be freed, with a number of restrictions placed on him in the meantime. The conditions by which Dassey must abide include being available for any home visit deemed necessary by the United States Probation Office, providing a phone number where he may be reached and a home address, and staying within the Eastern District of Wisconsin. He is also ordered to have no contact with his uncle and co-defendant, Steven Avery. However, after the motion was filed, a statement was posted to the Wisconsin Department of Justice website , stating that Attorney General Brad Schimel \"intends to file an emergency motion in the Seventh Circuit seeking a stay of this release order.\" 'Making a Murderer': Is Steven Avery Guilty? A Deeper Look Into Netflix Series Dassey, 26, was accused as a teenager, along with Avery, of murdering Teresa Halbach in 2005. Both were convicted in 2007, and Dassey was sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturned in August after a judge said in court documents obtained by ABC News that investigators' four-hour interrogation was littered with leading statements and \"false promises.\" The court documents also noted that Dassey was only 16 at the time of his confession with a \"below average intellectual ability,\" and lacked having \"the benefit of an adult present to look out for his interests.\" The decision to overturn Dassey's conviction was later appealed and court proceedings are ongoing. Lauren Nirider, Dassey\u2019s attorney, told ABC News: \u201cWe\u2019re over the moon -- Brendan and his mother have spent 10 Thanksgivings apart and the prospect of spending the next one together \u2026 it\u2019s incredible we\u2019re just so grateful.\u201d She added: \u201cWe hope to have Brendan home by Thanksgiving if not sooner.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Immigration issue provides Emanuel with chance to stand up to Trump Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Luis Gomez, right, speaks Nov. 14, 2016, at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago about politicians' responsibility to assist all immigrants. Luis Gomez, right, speaks Nov. 14, 2016, at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago about politicians' responsibility to assist all immigrants. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday promised to protect immigrants from deportation, even as president-elect Donald Trump has pledged to remove as many as 3 million immigrants who have criminal records and are living in the country illegally. For more than three decades, Chicago has been a sanctuary city, where local laws prohibit government workers and police officers from asking about residents' immigration status. The mayor said that tradition would continue. \"To all those who are, after Tuesday's election, very nervous and filled with anxiety as we've spoken to, you are safe in Chicago, you are secure in Chicago and you are supported in Chicago,\" Emanuel said. \"Chicago will always be a sanctuary city.\" That vow is running headlong into Trump, who campaigned on blocking federal funding to sanctuary cities, ramping up deportations, increasing prison sentences for those who re-enter and building a wall along the Mexican border. But the rise of Trump and the nation's rapidly changing political landscape provides a mayor who's been trying to rebuild his image with a political opportunity in a city full of immigrants and diverse neighborhoods. Emanuel, after all, is the guy who famously offered up the credo \"never let a serious crisis go to waste\" as he prepared to push President-elect Barack Obama 's Great Recession economic agenda in 2008. In this case, Trump's inflammatory rhetoric toward Mexicans and his immigration policies give Emanuel a political rallying point among Latinos after the mayor's popularity dropped sharply following the Laquan McDonald police shooting controversy. Immigrants' rights advocates speak at a news conference to discuss expanding mental health services for those fearful that Donald\u00a0Trump will deport them or their families when he is sworn in as president. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Many Latinos, however, still look at Emanuel with a wary eye on immigration, given his relatively late religion on the issue. In the Obama White House , Emanuel advised against pursuing immigration reform in that first year, having once called it the \"third rail of politics.\" In the Clinton White House, Emanuel suggested hard-line immigration policies to achieve \"record deportations of criminal aliens.\" Twenty years later, Trump has talked about the same target Emanuel backed for Clinton \u2014 deporting immigrants with criminal records who are in the U.S. illegally. \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,\" Trump told \"60 Minutes\" in an interview that aired Sunday night. \"But we're getting them out of our country. They're here illegally.\" Like many other Americans on Tuesday night, Berto Aguayo stayed up late watching the presidential election results on TV with his family. As the early returns favoring Donald Trump began to trickle in, his mother started to cry. By 8 p.m. she started calling friends and family in Mexico who reassured... Like many other Americans on Tuesday night, Berto Aguayo stayed up late watching the presidential election results on TV with his family. As the early returns favoring Donald Trump began to trickle in, his mother started to cry. By 8 p.m. she started calling friends and family in Mexico who reassured... (Grace Wong and Tony Briscoe) For his part, Emanuel has not spoken to any of these specific policy proposals from Trump \u2014 and the mayor has not said he'd protect immigrants with criminal records who are here illegally. Instead, Emanuel has struck a more general tone of sympathizing with immigrants who remain fearful of a Trump presidency. \"Now, administrations may change, but our values and principals as it relates to inclusion does not,\" Emanuel said at a Monday event with immigrants' rights advocates to discuss expanding mental health services for those worried Trump will deport them or their families. \"People from all faiths, all backgrounds and all parts of the world have beaten their path to the city of Chicago because Chicago offers them and \u2014 more importantly, as the son and the grandson of an immigrant \u2014 their children and grandchildren a chance at the American dream.\" Trump proposals In his \"Contract with the American Voter\" prior to his election, Trump said he would take three actions on immigration during his first day in office: Cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities, start deporting more than 2 million \"criminal illegal immigrants\" and suspend immigration from \"terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.\" During his first 100 days in office, Trump has said he will introduce legislation to build a wall on the country's southern border with Mexico, enact a minimum two-year mandatory federal prison sentence for those who re-enter the country after being deported and increase penalties for overstaying a visa. It's unclear how many of those priorities Trump will push hard for, and how many turn out to be little more than campaign rhetoric or ideas he decides not to pursue while spending his post-victory political capital elsewhere. Cutting off all federal funding to sanctuary cities would require action by a Republican-controlled Congress and, if passed, could cost Chicago significantly. This year, the city is receiving a little more than $1 billion in federal grant funding for myriad programs, including early childhood education, transportation, policing, health initiatives, public assistance programs and disaster management. Next year, the city is counting on more than $1.3 billion from the federal government. The Justice Department released a report in May saying the city could stand to lose nearly $29 million in annual justice grants if found to be in violation of federal laws on detaining people to be turned over to immigration agents for possible deportation. Democratic U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley , of Chicago, said he worries about Trump's threat to turn off that federal spigot, but said he thinks the new president ultimately will soft-pedal that while seeking congressional backing for other initiatives. \"In the final analysis, though, I think if the president wants to do what he talks about, for example with a big infrastructure package, he's going to need support across the aisle,\" Quigley said on WLS-AM 890's \"Connected to Chicago\" show that aired Sunday. \"And if he says none for Chicago, he's not going to get any support from anybody in Chicago, frankly in the Chicagoland area.\" Emanuel has said he's not worried about a Trump administration penalizing Chicago for its political resistance to the Republican's policies, but the mayor's immigration remarks will put him at odds with a new White House where he already will find his clout immeasurably diminished after eight years of nearly unfettered access to the Obama administration. Emanuel has supported Obama's immigration polices, including the president's 2014 executive order. That policy, which the Supreme Court blocked in June with a 4-4 tie, would have allowed as many as 5 million immigrants here without legal permission to apply for a program that would protect them from deportation and offer them work permits. The mayor also has pledged to stand up for so-called \"Dreamers,\" those who benefited from Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that offered legal protection to about 742,000 people who were brought to the U.S. as children and stayed here illegally. Trump said during the campaign he would rescind that executive order that created DACA. On Monday, DACA beneficiary Luis Gomez, who came to Chicago from Mexico as an 11-year-old and is now studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology, said he worries about his ability to continue his studies and get a job if Trump follows through on that threat. And in an illustration of the difficulties anti-Trump forces face in building a unified front in the wake of Democrat Hillary Clinton's failed presidential bid, Gomez scolded Emanuel and U.S. Rep. Gutierrez, D-Chicago. \"Rep. Gutierrez, if unity is to be achieved, you need to stop categorizing and separating the undocumented community between deportables and Dreamers. I demand that you stand behind all immigrants, not just immigrants without a criminal record,\" Gomez said as Emanuel and Gutierrez stood directly behind him. \"Mayor Emanuel, the welcoming city ordinance only protects immigrants without criminal records. I demand you extend protection in the city ordinance to those who belong to my community with a record.\" Emanuel has not promised to protect immigrants with criminal records who are living in the U.S. without legal permission. And Gutierrez said such people should be deported. Years ago, Gutierrez blamed Emanuel for Obama not taking up immigration reform early in his first term. During Emanuel's first run for mayor, Gutierrez recorded automated phone calls against him and appeared in Spanish-language TV ads to proclaim, \"When Rahm Emanuel could have used his power to help us, he turned his back to us and our most vulnerable families.\" Since then, Gutierrez has buried the hatchet with Emanuel, as the mayor has shared the congressman's position on immigration issues. Emanuel also has enjoyed widespread support from the City Council's Latino aldermen. Sanctuary policies Emanuel's public statements reaffirming Chicago's sanctuary city status come as the mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and other major cities also have done so since Trump's election. The morning after Trump's victory, Emanuel took the rare step of giving a speech at the start of the City Council meeting. The mayor argued the multicultural slate of politicians who won in Illinois on Nov. 8 shows the strength of the immigrant ideals he said give the area its vitality. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Emanuel said he understands how Trump's win has heightened the anxiety of immigrants who are living in the country without permission and pledged to fight forcefully for immigrants' rights in light of the anti-immigrant rhetoric Trump used throughout his campaign. On Sunday, Emanuel issued a statement urging immigrants concerned about their rights to call the city's 311 center to get information about legal resources and other programs at their disposal. Chicago's status as a sanctuary city stretches to 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington issued an executive order prohibiting city agencies from inquiring about immigration status when providing services. That included police not asking crime victims or witnesses about their immigration status. Emanuel went a step further in 2012, sponsoring a City Council-approved ordinance that said Chicago police could turn over information to federal immigration agents on immigrants only if they are wanted on a criminal warrant or have been convicted of a serious crime. This year, the City Council approved an Emanuel-endorsed ordinance to provide municipal ID cards to immigrants who are in the country without permission. The Chicago law prohibits police from providing U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement officials access to people who are in the Police Department's custody, unless officers are \"acting pursuant to a legitimate law enforcement purpose that is unrelated to the enforcement of a civil immigration law.\" In practice, that means police aren't supposed to turn over immigrants living in the U.S. without permission unless they are wanted on a criminal warrant or have serious criminal convictions. Chicago's law also prohibits officers from allowing ICE agents to use their facilities for interviews or investigation. And it bars on-duty officers from responding to ICE inquiries or talking to ICE officials about a person's custody status or release date. ",

    "text": "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2015 He\u2019s been talking about the topic for well over a year, at least. Plan 1: Capping repayments by income On Oct. 13, Trump mentioned\u00a0his student loan plans in a speech to college students.\u00a0Under his plan, tuition repayment would be capped at 12.5%. In other words, say you have $200,000 in student loans and earn $2,000 in monthly income. You wouldn\u2019t have to worry about payments skyrocketing upwards of $500 under Trump\u2019s plan. You\u2019ll pay at most 12.5% of your income, which in this case would be\u00a0$250 a month. Note, though, that this plan raises some questions. An income-based repayment plan already exists, called the\u00a0 Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) Repayment Plan . Under REPAYE,\u00a0everyone with direct loans\u00a0\u2014 issued from\u00a0the U.S. Department of Education via\u00a0the federal government\u00a0\u2014 is eligible to cap payments at 10% of discretionary income . So, would Trump\u2019s\u00a012.5% plan apply solely towards other loans, like private loans , or would those with direct loans\u00a0actually have to pay\u00a0more for student\u00a0debt? It\u2019s not clear. Plan 2: Student loan forgiveness Trump\u00a0also talked in his October speech about forgiving\u00a0student loans\u00a0after 15 years of payments. So, if you\u00a0find yourself $30,000 in the hole after 15 years of paying off your student loans, you wouldn\u2019t pay another cent. With all the money trump has, he better pay for my college tuition \u2014 kyle corpuz (@_itskakakyle) November 9, 2016 Currently under the REPAYE plan, all direct loans are forgiven after 20 years. Like with income-driven repayments, though, it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s 15-year plan will impact only direct loans or\u00a0will also\u00a0establish a forgiveness period for private loans. It\u2019s also unclear how this would impact current provisions forgiving student debt earlier than 15 years. Plus, according to Federal Student Aid, teachers can have up to $17,500 of loans repaid by working in low-income schools for five consecutive years. Qualifying\u00a0nonprofit, government and other public service workers can have their debt forgiven after\u00a010 years of monthly payments as well. Would these provisions remain intact, or would all workers now be on the 15-year timeline? Plan 3: Cutting college costs Trump also wants colleges to reduce\u00a0their costs. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing the job of cost-cutting because they don\u2019t have the incentive to cost cut,\u201d he said in\u00a0his October speech in Columbus, Ohio. His education page says \u00a0he wants to utilize tax breaks and tax dollars to incentivize colleges reducing\u00a0costs. It\u2019s unclear how these tax cuts will work. Will they threaten to tax college endowments, as Trump\u00a0references in his\u00a0Columbus speech,\u00a0and additionally, how would schools receive tax dollars? i hope trump will give every college student a small loan of $1 mil so we can pay off our student debt that his government will mock us for \u2014 olivia (@queers4l) November 9, 2016 What have Trump\u2019s officials said about the topic? In May, Trump\u2019s campaign national co-chair and policy director Sam Clovis told \u00a0Inside Higher Ed\u00a0that all colleges should have \u201cskin in the game,\u201d\u00a0making them share the risk of student loans. This\u00a0means that Clovis wants colleges to be more involved in the student loan process. Specifically, he discusses how major and post-graduation earnings should impact whether students should get student loans. If trump decides I'm illegal and deports me, will my student debt also get deported or does that stay here? It\u2019s interesting that Clovis discusses this, but it\u2019s not a topic Trump highlighted in his Columbus speech. And this seems to contradict Trump\u2019s goal of providing everyone a college tuition. Do his ideas align with the Republican party? They stray pretty far away from fiscal conservative ideology. The Republican Party\u2019s 2016 platform\u00a0says\u00a0 little \u00a0about student debt \u2014 mostly that the federal government shouldn\u2019t be involved in student loans. The platform does say college cost increases should require heavy consideration, similar to Trump\u2019s stance that colleges should decrease costs. But the official party stance doesn\u2019t include anything about capping student loan payments or student loan forgiveness. Trump just laid a college tuition plan that actually makes sense. This man really cucked the Republican Party. \u2014 Oxygen Thief\u262d (@SpookyDaScary) November 12, 2016 \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about Trump\u2019s proposal is it flies in the face of the fiscal conservatism that\u2019s supposed to define the Republican Party,\u201d writes \u00a0the Washington Post. \u201c[T]he party\u2019s nominee wants to lower the period of repayment, which is sure to cost the government quite a bit of money.\u201d How do Trump\u2019s policies compare to Clinton\u2019s? Similar in some ways, though Clinton advocated for more changes than Trump. Clinton\u2019s website says she wanted income-based repayments capped at 10%, lower than Trump\u2019s 12.5% cap. But she also wanted student debt forgiven after 20 years, which is longer than Trump\u2019s 15 years. Both candidates also wanted to cut college costs, though Clinton\u2019s policies go further .\u00a0She\u00a0wanted free community college and to \u201censure that students do not need to take out loans for tuition\u201d at 4-year public colleges, while also reducing living expenses and tuition at private non-profit colleges. Her plan also included students being able to refinance loans so students currently repaying\u00a0higher-interest private loans could attain lower interest. It\u2019s unclear whether Trump supports\u00a0policies subsidizing college costs or refinancing loans. The takeaway It\u2019s hard to know exactly what Trump\u2019s exact plans are for student debt because they\u2019re not\u00a0detailed on his website. He discussed them in some detail in just one speech, and what he said isn\u2019t identical to what his staff has said and isn\u2019t aligned with the Republican party. It seems that the only thing that will tell us for sure is time. If Trump makes college tuition free he has an A in my book. Also mandatory puppies Note: USA TODAY College reached out to Donald Trump\u2019s team for comment but has not yet received a response.

Be the first to know about new Players stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! Russian President Vladimir Putin (Pool photo by Sergei Karpukhin via AP) \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a telephone conversation Monday that relations between their countries were \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement. The statement said the two leaders discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about \u201ca settlement for the crisis in Syria\u201d and agreed their aides would begin working toward a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump\u2019s office said in a statement that Putin had called to \u201coffer his congratulations\u201d and that the two had discussed \u201ca range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues and the historical U.S.-Russia relationship that dates back over 200 years.\u201d Although Trump\u2019s statement did not mention Syria or other specific issues, it said that he told Putin \u201cthat he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the People of Russia.\u201d [ A less-belligerent Russia might emerge with Trump\u2019s victory. At least for a while. ] The\u00a0call came as Trump faced\u00a0a growing backlash against his decision to name campaign chairman and former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist at the White House, a choice critics say will empower white nationalists. Since his victory last week, Trump has received congratulatory calls from a number of foreign leaders. Putin had initially sent Trump a telegraph last week expressing his desire for a dialogue based on \u201cmutual respect and genuine consideration for each other\u2019s positions.\u201d During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader, and said that the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria. He indicated that closer relations with Russia would keep the Kremlin from establishing tighter ties with China. Trump appeared to absolve Russia from responsibility for intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, and questioned the relevance of NATO, which has charged Moscow with engaging in provocative air and sea actions on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank. Giving Putin a free pass on those issues is directly counter to the Russia policy of the Obama administration, which has, among other things, called for an international war crimes investigation of Russia\u2019s actions in Syria. It could also undermine current European negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine, and support for U.S. and European Union sanctions. Russia is interested not only in getting the sanctions removed, but also in getting global recognition of equal status as a player in the Middle East and elsewhere. [ Obama says new president-elect is committed to NATO ] Equally controversial was Trump\u2019s selection on Sunday of Bannon. A chorus of advocacy groups, commentators and congressional Democrats has denounced Bannon as a proponent of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views as Trump has begun his first full week as president-elect. Trump named Bannon his chief strategist and senior counselor while also appointing Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to be his chief of staff. \u201cPresident-elect Trump\u2019s choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that white supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump\u2019s White House,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), said in a statement Sunday night.\u00a0\u201cIt is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of White Supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide. Bannon was \u2018the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill,\u2019 according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\u201d [ Donald Trump plans to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants ] The statement echoed sentiments from leaders of the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, other Capitol Hill Democrats and some Republican Trump critics such as Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who tweeted, \u201cIs there precedent for such a disreputable & unstable extremist in [White House] senior ranks before Bannon?\u201d A spokesman for Trump accused critics and the media of trying to \u201cdivide people\u201d following the election when they raise questions about Bannon\u2019s views and history. Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump presidential transition, said Monday morning that Bannon has done a \u201cfantastic job\u201d since joining Trump\u2019s inner circle. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen the president-elect since the election, he\u2019s taken a very measured tone,\u201d Miller said in an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, who worked closely with Bannon as Trump\u2019s campaign manager, also defended him. \u201cHe\u2019s been the general of this campaign,\u201d Conway told reporters as she arrived Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with the president-elect. Citing Bannon\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a former naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive, she called him a \u201cbrilliant tactician.\u201d Asked whether Bannon needed to explain his connections to the alt-right movement, Conway said: \u201cI\u2019m personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not \u2014 56 million-plus Americans or so saw something else. . . . You should really focus on the will of the people, which was to elect Donald Trump the president.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) sought to calm the fears many Americans still hold about Trump\u2019s election, which has been greeted by widespread protests. \u201cThere is a lot of hysteria and hyperbole,\u201d Ryan said during an interview Monday with his hometown radio station, 1380 Big AM. \u201cI would tell people to just relax \u2014 things are going to be fine. Trump\u2019s naming of Bannon and Priebus set up what could be a battle within the White House between the populist, outsider forces that propelled his winning campaign and the party establishment that dominates Washington. [ From October: Trump just laid out a pretty radical student debt plan ] During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) In appointing Priebus, 44, Trump has brought into his White House a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the party, and he signaled a willingness to work within the establishment he assailed on the campaign trail. But Trump sent an opposing signal by tapping Bannon, 62, who has openly attacked congressional leadership, taking particular aim at Ryan \u00ad \u2014 who recommended Priebus for his new job. \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d Reince Priebus will be the next chief of staff of the White House. Here's what you need to know about the man with the top job in Trump's administration. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Bannon\u2019s senior White House role has been welcomed by prominent figures on the alt-right. Richard Spencer, president of the white-nationalist National Policy Institute, wrote on Twitter that \u201cstrategist\u201d is the \u201cbest possible position\u201d for Bannon in Trump\u2019s White House. \u201cBannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds,\u201d he wrote Sunday night. \u201cHe\u2019ll be freed up to chart Trump\u2019s macro trajectory,\u201d Spencer wrote, adding, \u201cThe question is: Which way is the arrow pointing? It\u2019s pointing towards the #AltRight!\u201d Groups representing Jews, African Americans and Muslims have vocally opposed Bannon\u2019s appointment. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said via Twitter on Sunday night that the ADL opposes Bannon\u2019s appointment to a senior White House role because \u201che & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values.\u201d Endorsing Greenblatt\u2019s message, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks tweeted overnight: \u201cRacism has been routinized; anti-Semitism normalized; xenophobia deexceptionalized; & misogyny mainstreamed.\u201d The Bannon announcement came as Trump highlighted some of his first priorities in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d vowing after he is inaugurated to \u201cimmediately\u201d deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally and to simultaneously repeal and replace President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. He also repeated his remark that he knows more about the Islamic State than U.S. generals do, saying, \u201cI probably do, because look at the job they\u2019ve done.\u201d Trump\u2019s top two advisers could help him achieve different objectives. Priebus could help Trump notch early legislative victories in a Republican-led Congress and ingratiate himself with the insiders he claims to loathe but who dominate his transition team. A longtime lawyer and Wisconsin political operative, Priebus will work to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a \u201cstar.\u201d Bannon will be the other voice on Trump\u2019s shoulder: He helped shape Trump\u2019s message on the campaign trail and relishes combativeness. The former Navy officer and investment banker has said the campaign was the American version of worldwide populist movements such as the British vote to sever ties with the European Union. [ Trump\u2019s win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave ] Bannon\u2019s appointment drew sharp criticism from political operatives on both sides of the aisle who see Bannon as being too close to the alt-right and white nationalism. Breitbart has published stories with headlines stating that women faced with harassment online should \u201clog off\u201d and that taking birth control makes women \u201cunattractive and crazy.\u201d The site called Kristol a \u201crenegade Jew\u201d in 2015. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, blasted the choice of Bannon and cited Breitbart headlines that included a call to hoist the Confederate flag weeks after shootings at a black Charleston, S.C., church and another that said that political correctness \u201cprotects Muslim rape culture.\u201d Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence against his former wife more than 20 years ago; the charges included trying to prevent a victim or witness of crime from reporting, inflicting injury and battery. Bannon was never convicted, and the case was dismissed. His former wife also accused him of making anti-Semitic remarks, according to a court statement obtained by the New York Daily News. Priebus said negative claims against Bannon do not reflect the man he knows. \u201cHe was a force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw all the time,\u201d Priebus told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of these things that people are crying out about,\u201d\u00a0he told \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich blasted the idea Sunday that Trump\u2019s campaign catered to the alt-right, calling it \u201cgarbage.\u201d In a statement, Bannon said he and Priebus had a \u201cvery successful partnership\u201d on the campaign trail. \u201cWe will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda,\u201d Bannon said. Priebus gave a preview of some of the administration\u2019s policy priorities: \u201cI am very grateful to the president-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism. He will be a great president for all Americans.\u201d [ It\u2019s not just the Cabinet: Trump\u2019s transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees ] The personnel announcement comes as the contours of the Trump administration are starting to take shape and as he and his team pivot from campaign rhetoric to the nuts and bolts of governing. Trump and his advisers continue to paint a mixed picture of what the administration will look like, and they have been giving answers often at odds with Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, which included pledges to fully repeal the ACA and get Mexico to pay for a wall along the southern border, and crowd chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. On undocumented immigrants, Trump said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that his administration will \u201cget the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We are getting them out of our country, or we are going to incarcerate. But we\u2019re getting them out of our country; they\u2019re here illegally.\u201d The remarks are another sign of retreat from Trump\u2019s vows throughout much of the presidential campaign to remove all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. By focusing on criminals only, Trump would be mirroring current Obama administration priorities, and experts say his numbers are highly inflated. Trump also built his campaign around a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said Sunday he would accept the plan of some congressional Republicans to build a fence in specific places \u2014 something he told MSNBC in February would be acceptable for part of the border because of natural barriers. Trump again said Sunday that he will probably keep in place parts of the Obama health-care law, including provisions that allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until the person turns 26 and prevent insurers from refusing coverage for preexisting conditions. He said his administration would work to repeal and replace the law simultaneously; he said in a different interview Friday that the law might simply be amended. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be great health care for much less money. So it\u2019ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Lesley Stahl on Sunday. Trump has said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and in Vice President-elect Mike Pence he will be bringing one of the nation\u2019s most antiabortion politicians into the White House. When asked by Stahl whether he plans to appoint a justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said whomever he names will be \u201cvery pro-life\u201d and that \u201cif it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.\u201d Trump also said he is \u201cfine\u201d with same-sex marriage being legal. The president-elect, who did not release his tax returns during the campaign, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d he will make them public \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d Trump said he believes that some of the protesters involved in demonstrations that have taken place in major cities since Trump\u2019s victory are \u201cprofessional protesters\u201d and that people shouldn\u2019t be scared of his administration. [ A complicated past lies behind Portland\u2019s violent protests ] \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don\u2019t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time.\u201d When asked of reports of racial slurs, harassment and personal threats against African Americans, gay people, Latinos and Muslims and others by some of his supporters, Trump said he didn\u2019t hear it but that he \u201chates\u201d to hear that. \u201cI am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it \u2014 if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: \u2018Stop it,\u2019 \u201d he said. Trump\u2019s personnel announcements are emblematic of the conflicting signals the new administration has sent since Tuesday\u2019s upset victory, in which Trump won the electoral college by sweeping a number of Rust Belt states even as he lost the popular vote. Trump vowed to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington, but numerous lobbyists and big-pocketed donors are appearing in the power structure he is erecting. Trump defended himself on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d saying that these people \u201cknow the system right now\u201d but that it is going to be phased out. The president-elect appears to have resumed full use of his Twitter account, which was restricted leading up to Election Day. He took aim at the New York Times, suggesting that a letter sent to subscribers amounted to the paper \u201capologizing for their BAD coverage of me.\u201d The letter did not apologize for bad coverage. Trump suggested on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he might not tweet as much when he occupies the Oval Office \u2014 or just not in the way the world has gotten used to. \u201cI\u2019m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I\u2019m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It\u2019s a modern form of communication,\u201d he said. Andrew Roth in Moscow contributed to this story. 1 of 98 ",

Gwen Ifill, a veteran journalist for PBS, died of cancer Nov. 14, the network said. Gwen Ifill, co-anchor of PBS' \"NewsHour\" with Judy Woodruff and a veteran journalist who moderated two vice presidential debates, died Monday of cancer, the network said. She was 61. A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill switched to television in the 1990s and covered politics and Congress for NBC News . She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of \"Washington Week\" and also worked for the nightly \"NewsHour\" program. She and Woodruff were named co-anchors in 2013. She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008 and authored the book, \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.\" The president on Monday praised Ifill for informing today's citizens while also inspiring a young generation of journalists. \"I always appreciated Gwen's reporting, even when I was on the receiving end of one of her tough\" interviews, Obama said. Ifill took a leave from \"NewsHour\" for a month this spring for health reasons, keeping details of her illness private. Her health failing, she left \"NewsHour\" again shortly before an election night that she and Woodruff would have covered together. \"Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change,\" said Sara Just, PBS \"NewsHour\" executive producer. \"She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her.\" Longtime journalist Gwen Ifill died Monday after a battle with cancer. She was 61. Ifill spent part of the early portion of her career with The Evening Sun. NBC News' Pete Williams, a former colleague, struggled to keep his composure Monday when announcing Ifill's death on MSNBC. \"She had so many awards in her office you could barely see out the window,\" Williams said. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said he was a member of the Maryland state legislature when Ifill worked for the Baltimore Evening Sun. \"She always demonstrated thoughtful intelligence, determination to uncover the facts, and an innate talent for knowing what truly interested the public,\" Cummings said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., called Ifill \"a legend.\" \"Her dignity and grace, intellect and insight set the standard in American media and public life,\" Pelosi said. Shortly before moderating the debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin in 2008, Ifill brushed aside concerns that she might not be fair because she was writing a book about Obama. \"I've got a pretty long track record covering politics and news, so I'm not particularly worried that one-day blog chatter is going to destroy my reputation,\" she told The Associated Press then. Ifill, who was black, also questioned why people would assume her book would be favorable toward Obama. \"Do you think they made the same assumptions about Lou Cannon (who is white) when he wrote his book about Reagan?\" she said. In a 2007 opinion piece published in The New York Times, Ifill condemned radio host Don Imus' \"nappy-headed hos\" reference to Rutgers University female basketball players. \"To his credit, Mr. Imus told the Rev. Al Sharpton yesterday he realizes that, this time, he went way too far,\" Ifill wrote. \"Yes, he did. Every time a young black girl shyly approaches me for an autograph or writes or calls or stops me on the street to ask how she can become a journalist, I feel an enormous responsibility,\" she said. \"It's more than simply being a role model. I know I have to be a voice for them as well.\" Associated Press ",

By Renae Merle November 14 at 4:58 PM Follow @renaemerle SEC Chairman Mary Jo White appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill, June 14, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) NEW YORK \u2014\u00a0Mary Jo White, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced Monday that she will step down two\u00a0years before the end of her term, clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to reshape the way Wall Street is regulated. The SEC, which polices Wall Street and the financial markets, has been a key part of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to rein in big banks following the 2008 financial crisis and prevent future taxpayer bailouts of the industry. The agency has pushed for more oversight of hedge funds and other asset managers and has established rules that make it more difficult for big banks to make risky bets on the markets. White, a former federal prosecutor, is known for a no-nonsense style and beefed up the agency\u2019s enforcement efforts over the last three years, pushing for more companies to admit guilt and taking more cases to trial. But progressive Democrats were often critical of her efforts, complaining they did not go far enough. White was widely expected to step down no matter who won the election to allow the next president to appoint their own chair. Trump has already indicated he would usher in a period of deregulation, including dismantling 2010\u2019s financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Act. He appointed Paul Atkins, an industry veteran, who has called Dodd-Frank a \u201ccalamit y,\u201d\u00a0to lead the agency\u2019s transition. Atkins \u201cis a guy in general who wants to let companies do their thing and not get in the way very much,\u201d Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst with the research firm Capital Alpha Partners, said of Atkins. \u201cYou would see a lighter touch on enforcement and a lighter hand on corporate governance issue broadly.\u201d Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years during the President George W. Bush administration. He could not immediately be reached for comment. In addition to replacing White, Trump will be able to fill two openings on the five-member commission. Trump could also choose to ignore the more than 20-year-old tradition of allowing the opposing political party to pick its\u00a0own representative on the commission, one industry official said, further bolstering his influence over the agency. Also, Thomas Curry, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another important Wall Street regulator, has less than six months on his term. Together, the openings should\u00a0give the Trump administration wide latitude to change the way Wall Street is regulated. \u00a0\u201cIt is a game-changer at the SEC. The commission is going to have a very different agenda over the next four years than it would have,\u201d said Edward Mills,\u00a0a policy analyst at investment bank FBR Capital Markets. \u201cIn the long-term, it is going to be a big tilt towards free markets.\u201d White took office with high expectations. The SEC had long suffered under the popular notion that\u00a0it was a slow, toothless tiger. White appeared to be someone who might change that reputation. Prior to her appointment, she had been a federal prosecutor who took on\u00a0the terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Mafia boss John Gotti. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to mess with Mary Jo,\u201d\u00a0President Obama proclaimed while announcing her nomination in 2013. In June 2016, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and SEC chair Mary Jo White faced off during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. (C-SPAN) White moved quickly to set a new\u00a0tone at the agency. Soon after taking office, she announced that the SEC would begin\u00a0requiring more companies to\u00a0 admit guilt \u00a0as part of their settlements with the agency. It was a break from the SEC\u2019s nearly 100-year history of extracting monetary penalties from companies, which typically would neither admit nor deny the charges lodged against them. \u00a0\u201cThe SEC had more leverage than it realized,\u201d White said in a recent interview. Not requiring admissions of guilt could \u201cundermine, at least, the perception of the strength of a settlement, the strength of its deterrence. In certain cases that public accountability, I think, is very important.\u201d Critics would later complain that many large banks were still able to settle SEC cases without admitting guilt and that the agency\u2019s toughest actions were reserved for smaller banks. The SEC also poured resources into improving its technical capabilities, hiring experts who could help it better track stock trading and catch fraud.\u00a0The SEC\u2019s technical capabilities have \u201creally been transformed over the last three years,\u201d White said. There have been several cases, including some involving insider trading, that would have been impossible without these advancements, she said. Examinations of trading patterns that used to take months can now be done in hours, she said. But in the years since, the SEC has also been overwhelmed\u00a0by the task of implementing dozens of rules called for under the 2010 Dodd-Frank\u00a0financial reform law and the 2012 JOBS Act, which aims to make it easier for small businesses to raise money.\u00a0The 4,000-person\u00a0agency has tussled repeatedly with Congress and complained that as Wall Street became more complex it needed a bigger budget to keep up. White ultimately became a target of progressive groups that questioned her resolve to crack down on Wall Street. In addition to serving as a\u00a0prosecutor, White also spent years defending big banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, as a white-collar lawyer, they noted. And while White trumpeted that she had secured settlements with nearly 90 high-level executives for financial-crisis related misdeeds, critics noted that officials at some of the country\u2019s largest banks had emerged largely unscathed. Last year,\u00a0CREDO Action, a liberal advocacy group, sent a\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDump (Mary Jo) Truck\u201d \u00a0around D.C. to mark the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Courtesy: CREDO Action Another group put up billboards in the D.C. Metro system depicting White as a superhero missing in action and asking \u201cWhere is Mary Jo White?\u201d White\u2019s unpopularity among some progressive Democrats was particularly pronounced when she\u00a0found herself the target of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). In January, Warren issued a report arguing that U.S. companies get away with crimes that regular people don\u2019t because of weak enforcement. The SEC \u201cis particularly feeble, often failing to use the full range of its enforcement toolbox,\u201d the report said. Then in\u00a0June, Warren and White faced off during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\u00a0\u201cA year ago I called your leadership at the SEC extremely disappointing,\u201d Warren said. \u201cToday I am more disappointed than ever.\u201d White quipped: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in your disappointment.\u201d But White\u2019s supporters, including many industry officials, say the criticism has been unwarranted. \u201cAs SEC chairs go, Mary Jo has been one of the very best,\u201d said Harvey Pitt, who was SEC chairman under President George W. Bush. \u201cNo one in that position will go uncriticized. But, in my view, the criticism has been completely unwarranted.\u201d White plans to formally depart when Obama leaves office. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Obama: Trump committed to NATO alliance; Dems should reflect on election loss Published               November 14, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Calling the office of the presidency \u201cbigger than any one person,\u201d President Obama on Monday said the influence America has on a global scale will not be erased by the outcome of one election and added that Donald Trump told him the U.S. would reaffirm its commitment to the NATO alliance. Domestically, Obama said last week\u2019s major losses for the Democratic Party across the country were a political blow but encouraged his party \u201cnot to waiver on our core beliefs and principles.\u201d \u201cWhen your team loses, everybody gets deflated,\u201d Obama said. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s important for me not to be bigfooting that conversation.\u201d Monday marked the first time Obama has taken questions from the press since Trump\u2019s election win last week. The president was also questioned on the status of his legacy laws, including ObamaCare, under a Trump administration, as well as the ongoing protests in cities across the country following the election. Just days ago, the two men were attacking one another on policy issues. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump ran his campaign on promises to gut most of Obama\u2019s signature policies. The president spent the majority of the 2016 presidential election season calling out his now-successor, saying he was \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d for the job. Since then, Obama has said his main goal going forward would be to facilitate a smooth transition of power. \u00a0 Following the press conference, the president will head out on his last major trip abroad where he\u2019ll likely face similar questions from his foreign counterparts. And though Obama has urged unity and said the U.S. must root for Trump\u2019s success, the president\u2019s trip to Greece, Germany and Peru forces him to confront global concerns about the future of America\u2019s leadership. \"The mood of Greek people for this political change is 'wait and see,'\" said Nikos Pappas, a minister of state with close ties to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in an interview. He said there was surprise in Greece, as elsewhere, about Trump's victory, but added: \"Everybody would be expecting the U.S. government is going to continue to be on our side.\" Obama's trip, planned when it seemed certain Hillary Clinton would win, had been designed to reassure the world that the U.S. had regained its footing after a toxic campaign that unnerved foreign capitals, noted Heather Conley, a Europe scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Now the president has the unenviable task of telling his counterparts and explaining what Europeans are now coining 'the Trump effect,'\" Conley said. For months, Obama lent credence to those concerns as he urged Americans to reject Trump. Standing alongside Singapore's prime minister in August, Obama said Trump was \"woefully unprepared\" because he lacked \"basic knowledge\" about critical issues in Europe, Asia and the Mideast. And during a visit to Japan, Obama said world leaders were rightfully \"rattled\" by Trump. Now, Obama must reassure the U.S. and other countries that somehow, it will all be OK. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

School officials say the walkout was organized by the students and that no teachers were involved. WUSA Students from numerous Los Angeles area high schools come together in Mariachi Plaza before continuing their march to City Hall to protest the upset election of Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 14, 2016. (Photo: David McNew, Getty Images) High school students\u00a0led the charge Monday as protests against President-elect Donald Trump rolled into a\u00a0sixth day. Hundreds of teens, many not even old enough to vote, exited\u00a0classrooms on both coasts,\u00a0carting\u00a0signs and chanting slogans against a man they say poses a threat\u00a0to their future. The students are part of a protest movement that has seen tens\u00a0of thousands\u00a0taking to the streets in U.S. cities large and small after Tuesday's election. Monday's protests happened in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Silver Spring, Md., among others. While most protesters acknowledge they can't change the fact that\u00a0Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the electoral vote count, they say they want to make a statement that the Republican's\u00a0barbed\u00a0campaign comments\u00a0against women, Muslims,\u00a0immigrants and beyond aren't\u00a0acceptable and Trump's policies have not earned a national mandate. Clinton still leads Trump 48% to 47% in the popular vote. In Los Angeles, students converged Monday on Mariachi Plaza, a gathering spot for the city's iconic musicians,\u00a0and marched to City Hall. The walkout was part of a planned demonstration in the Los Angeles Area School District, KTLA reported. \u201cAlthough it has been nearly a week since the presidential election, many students remain concerned about the outcome and want their voices to be heard,\u201d Superintendent Michelle King said in a statement released by the district\u00a0Monday morning, KTLA said.\u00a0\u201cThese are important conversations that need to take place. We want our students to know they are not alone.\u201d Trump protesters' resounding message: No national mandate The students carried signs with message such as \"Be Kind Not Racist,\" \"We Reject the President Elect\" and \"Bridges Not Walls.\" Many of the youths\u00a0were Latino, and some\u00a0lifted aloft Mexican and American flags\u00a0as they trekked\u00a0down the street. Some\u00a0protest signs were in Spanish. A few students\u00a0had a rejoinder\u00a0for those charging that the younger generation, many loyal to Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, bears responsibility for Trump's stunning upset.\u00a0 \"Don't Blame Millennials or the 3rd Party Vote; Blame the DNC,\" one sign read. United Teachers Los Angeles union applauded the walkout, saying the union\u00a0\"stands proudly\" with the students, KLTA reported. \"We believe students should join their communities in expressing themselves through peaceful protests,\" the union said in a statement.

About 500 students, some\u00a0chanting \"we reject\u00a0the president-elect,\"\u00a0blocked traffic on a\u00a0busy downtown boulevard on their journey\u00a0to Veteran's Plaza. School officials said no teachers were involved in organizing the protest. \u201cWe want the children\u00a0to realize what their political power is and how to utilize their voices,\u201d said pastor Jeffrey Thames, who joined the protest at one point.\u00a0Other passersby offered\u00a0words of encouragement. In Portland, Ore., hundreds of students from at least three schools also staged a walkout and march to City Hall. The protesters caused some disruptions for shoppers and merchants when they headed to a shopping mall. While most of the anti-Trump protests have been peaceful, Portland has had a turbulent\u00a0week with nightly demonstrations that have turned violent and led to at least 100 arrests. On Saturday, protesters blocked\u00a0streets and tossed\u00a0bottles and other projectiles at police officers. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Donald Trump has promised to turn his company over to his three grown children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (from left), Ivanka and Eric \u2014 to run once he's sworn in. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Federal law says anyone who works for the executive branch of the government has to avoid conflicts of interest. The Treasury secretary cannot own stock in a big bank, for instance. And Richard Painter, who served as ethics adviser under President George W. Bush, says different administrations have typically been scrupulous about following the law. \"Whenever anyone was even considering a position that would be appointed by the president, I would discuss with that person the need to sell off assets that create conflicts of interest,\" Painter says. But ironically the law that bars conflicts of interest for, say, a deputy assistant cabinet secretary, doesn't apply to the president or vice president. That means President-elect Donald Trump can continue to operate his vast network of businesses while serving as president. Trump has said he won't do that. He says he'll let his three grown children run his companies instead. Donald Trump's Businesses Pose New Conflict Of Interest Questions The ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, is calling for congressional hearings into Trump's business interests. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and U.S. attorney, suggested on CNN on Sunday that Trump needs to keep the businesses operating to be fair to his children. \"Remember, they can't work in the government because of the government rule about nepotism so you'd be putting them out of work,\" Giuliani said. But Giuliani, who is a top adviser to the president-elect, also said later that Trump should consider some kind of arrangement to remove himself completely from running his companies. Article continues after sponsorship There are enormous risks to a Trump presidency, legal risks and other political risks, if he keeps these business interests while he serves as president. Richard Painter, ethics adviser under President George W. Bush Among government ethics experts the idea of a sitting president's family running businesses for him raises all kinds of red flags. \"If we heard a similar situation described of a country in maybe Africa or another part of the world about the role that the family was going to play while their father was in the presidency, we'd often refer to that as kind of one of the features of a banana republic,\" says Meredith McGehee, with the nonpartisan group Issue One. The Trump family does considerable business with overseas banks and governments. McGehee asks what happens when one of Trump's children goes out to negotiate a deal. \"What's the message to the people they're dealing with? Is it: You better deal with me or there's going to be retribution? Or, I really want to deal with you because I think there's really some reward for my business?\" she says. 4 Questions About Donald Trump's Potential Conflicts Of Interest If He's Elected And Painter, the former Bush ethics adviser, says Trump risks running afoul of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars U.S. government employees from getting paid by foreign countries or the companies they own. Painter says at worst that could lead to a constitutional crisis between Congress and the president. \"There are enormous risks to a Trump presidency, legal risks and other political risks, if he keeps these business interests while he serves as president,\" Painter says. At best, Trump's business ties are likely to pop up repeatedly as a source of suspicion and scrutiny, McGehee says. \"The more of these kinds of ethical distractions that arise, I think the worse it is for President-elect Trump to actually come in and do the job he says he wants to do,\" she says. And, she says, that could impede the country's ability to move forward after the long, contentious presidential campaign. ",

She was 61. \"Gwen was one of America\u2019s leading lights in journalism and a fundamental reason public media is considered a trusted window on the world by audiences across the nation,\" PBS President Paula Kerger said in a statement. \"She often said that her job was to bring light rather than heat to issues of importance to our society. Gwen did this with grace and a steadfast commitment to excellence.\" Ifill, who co-hosted \"PBS NewsHour\" and moderated \"Washington Week,\" joined PBS in 1999 after stints at The New York Times, Washington Post and NBC. She was also a noted debate moderator, having presided over the 2004 and 2008 vice-presidential debates. Jim Young/Reuters Debate moderator Gwen Ifill greets Republican vice presidential nominee Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Joe Biden at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 2, 2008. Since the news of her death broke, condolences -- from politicians, celebrities, and fellow journalists -- have poured in. It is with heavy hearts that we share that our dear friend and beloved colleague Gwen Ifill has passed away. https://t.co/9iVlSm1JmZ \u2014 PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) November 14, 2016 I am saddened to learn about the passing of Gwen Ifill\u2014an incredibly talented and respected journalist. \u2014 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) November 14, 2016 Gwen Ifill had her heart in journalism & she was at the very top.

Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator's table or at the anchor's deck, she not only informed today's citizens but she also inspired tomorrow's journalists,\" he said. \"She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity and her intellect and for whom she blazed a trail.\" \"Gwen did her country a great service,\" he added. Keenly aware of her role as a women of color in media, Ifill once told The New York Times , \"When I was a little girl watching programs like this -- because that\u2019s the kind of nerdy family we were -- I would look up and not see anyone who looked like me in any way. No women. No people of color. \"I\u2019m very keen about the fact that a little girl now, watching the news, when they see me and Judy sitting side by side, it will occur to them that that\u2019s perfectly normal -- that it won\u2019t seem like any big breakthrough at all,\" she added. 0 Shares ",

She was 61. \u201cIt is with extremely heavy hearts that we must share that our dear friend and beloved colleague Gwen Ifill passed away this afternoon following several months of cancer treatment,\u201d a statement from \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d read. \u201cShe was surrounded by loving family and many friends whom we ask that you keep in your thoughts and prayers.\u201d Paula Krager, PBS\u2019s president and CEO, celebrated Ifill\u2019s career in her own statement. \u201cGwen was one of America\u2019s leading lights in journalism and a fundamental reason public media is considered a trusted window on the world by audiences across the nation,\u201d Krager said. \u201cHer contributions to thoughtful reporting and civic discourse simply cannot be overstated.  She often said that her job was to bring light rather than heat to issues of importance to our society. Gwen did this with grace and a steadfast commitment to excellence.\u201d Gary Glasberg, \u201cNCIS\u201d showrunner, is dead at 50 Sara Just, executive producer for \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d alerted staff to the news in an email Monday.\u00a0 \u201cGwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change. She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist\u2019s journalist and set an example for all around her,\u201d Just wrote in her message. \u201cSo many people in the audience felt that they knew and adored her. She had a tremendous combination of warmth and authority. She was stopped on the street routinely by people who just wanted to give her a hug and considered her a friend after years of seeing her on TV. We will forever miss her terribly.\u201d CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d anchor John Dickerson wrote a tribute to his friend and colleague, which can be read in full here. \u00a0 \u201cGwen\u2019s smile. It was so strong it greeted you before you met her. You could read by the light of her smile. And if you could make her laugh that was a prize. The sound of pure joy,\u201d Dickerson said. \u00a0\u201cWe were lucky, those of us who knew Gwen because we spent time in her company, but also because we have her example.\u201d\u00a0 New York native Ifill graduated from Simmons College in 1977 and went on to hold positions at The Washington Post, The New York Times and NBC before joining PBS\u2019s \u201cWashington Week in Review\u201d in 1999. Perhaps best known nationally for her work as a debate moderator, Ifill moderated the 2004 and 2008 vice-presidential debates that pitted Dick Cheney against John Edwards and Joe Biden against Sarah Palin. Ifill also moderated a Democratic primary debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Reactions to Ifill\u2019s passing and tributes to her work began hitting social media Monday afternoon.\u00a0 We mourn the loss of an outstanding and beloved journalist and friend. Gwen Ifill will be deeply missed. \u2014 John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) November 14, 2016 Howlingly sad. Dear sweet Gwen is gone.

(Photo: Julie Jacobson, AP) International Criminal Court prosecutors said Monday that a preliminary probe indicates that members of the U.S. armed forces and the CIA may have committed war crimes by torturing detainees in Afghanistan. Prosecutors would have to clear several hurdles before formally bringing the case before the court in The Hague, Netherlands. The prosecutors\u00a0said they have not decided yet whether to launch a full-scale investigation\u00a0but will decide soon, the Associated Press reported. Even if an investigation is launched, it would be difficult to bring charges. The court does not normally interview witnesses or gather forensic evidence, Foreign Policy magazine reported recently. The prosecution office said in its\u00a0report issued late Monday that U.S. armed forces personnel \u201cappear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture\u201d in Afghanistan, mainly in 2003-2004. The report also said that CIA operatives may have tortured at least 27 detainees in Afghanistan and elsewhere, mainly in the same time period. The United States is not a member of the court, but its citizens could face prosecution if they commit crimes in a country that is a member, such as Afghanistan, according to the AP. The U.S.-led invasion into Afghanistan toppled the Taliban from power after the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and\u00a0the Pentagon. The Taliban had harbored al-Qaeda militants in the years leading up to the attacks. 2243 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fTBpep ",

Los Angeles police officers wearing riot gear prepare to engage with a group of people outside City Hall protesting President-elect Donald Trump. (Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times) James Queally Contact Reporter The union that represents Los Angeles\u2019 rank-and-file officers complained Monday that the city\u2019s police department did not adequately prepare to handle thousands of protesters who swarmed downtown Los Angeles after Donald Trump \u2019s election day victory, and union officials also\u00a0blasted Mayor Eric Garcetti \u2019s support of the demonstrators. Speaking at the Los Angeles Police Protective League\u2019s downtown headquarters, union president\u00a0Craig Lally called for the city controller\u00a0to conduct an audit of the LAPD \u2019s staffing levels last week and repeatedly bashed a comment Garcetti\u00a0made at a news conference last week that protesters should try not to \u201cbreak too many laws\u201d\u00a0while demonstrating. \u201cWhen officers are being physically assaulted, when property is being vandalized, those are words of encouragement to those who intend on breaking the law,\u201d Lally said. A spokeswoman for Garcetti noted that the mayor clearly denounced any lawbreaking by protesters when he was addressing reporters last week. The quote was a snippet of comments Garcetti made over the span of more than 10 minutes in which he repeatedly urged demonstrators not to enter freeways or damage property. In a statement, the LAPD said most of last week\u2019s protests were spontaneous, but that the department redirected resources downtown as fast as it could for crowd control. \u201cThe LAPD made every effort to redeploy the resources necessary to protect the areas affected by the demonstrations and quickly adapt to the changing circumstances,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe department's quick action to redeploy resources coupled with proactive engagement with the protesters avoided substantial property damage and injuries.\u201d For five nights last week, throngs of protesters marched across downtown Los Angeles and into the Westlake area to denounce Trump\u2019s election. His\u00a0campaign rhetoric, which many have criticized as racist and misogynistic, has fueled massive demonstrations in New York City, Chicago, Portland, Ore., Miami and other cities. Protests in Los Angeles have been largely peaceful, and nearly 8,000 people marched from MacArthur Park to downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. But Los Angeles police did arrest hundreds of people during earlier protests that raged from Wednesday night into early Saturday morning, and the majority of those arrests were for vandalism or failure to obey a lawful order. LAPD 's order to disperse on what marked the fourth night of unrest following the presidential election. One by one, police led the protesters out of Grand Park, securing their... About 150 anti-Donald Trump protesters were arrested in downtown Los Angeles early Saturday morning after refusing the LAPD 's order to disperse on what marked the fourth night of unrest following the presidential election. One by one, police led the protesters out of Grand Park, securing their... (Alene Tchekmedyian and James Queally) One incident Thursday night was of particular concern to union officials. An officer attempting to stop a protester from tagging a wall near the LAPD\u2019s downtown headquarters was pummeled and lost his gun during a clash with several people who had broken off from a larger cluster of demonstrators, union officials said. Two people were arrested, and the officer was not seriously injured, but his gun remains missing, police officials told The Times. A protest the night after Trump\u2019s victory spilled onto the 101 Freeway, snarling traffic for several hours as officers tried to chase a resilient group of nearly 300 people off the  entrance and exit ramps near Union Station. Twenty-eight people were arrested that night, either for entering the freeway or refusing to disperse after the LAPD and officers with the California Highway Patrol \u00a0managed to chase demonstrators back onto the Alameda Street overpass. Graffiti crews have also posed a significant problem for police, hiding among the demonstrators and spray-painting vulgar insults toward Trump or simpler tags on the sides of buildings and news vans, and even on the doors of some LAPD cruisers. Lally said the LAPD\u2019s command staff had \u201cno plan\u201d to deal with the protests last week, and harshly criticized the department for failing to call in additional officers\u00a0or order a large-scale mobilization to deal with the massive crowds. Robb Harris, a director with the union, said other commands \u2014\u00a0including Rampart, West Los Angeles and Pacific divisions \u2014 \u00a0were left woefully understaffed as police had to scramble to deal with the protests. Harris also said Garcetti\u2019s comments in support of demonstrators were an insult to officers who responded to the protests. \u201cThat statement is not a statement from a leader,\u201d he said of the mayor\u2019s comments. As the union officials spoke out, hundreds of high school students kicked off another round of protests late Monday morning, walking out of classes downtown and massing at City Hall. Groups of California Highway Patrol cars could be seen near freeway entrances and in parking lots around the area, which officials described as a preventive measure. Chief William Siegl, head of the CHP\u2019s Southern Division, said his officers have stopped protesters\u00a0from entering the 101 and 110 freeways on multiple occasions in the past week\u00a0and are hoping to prevent both another freeway shutdown and a situation in which\u00a0they are forced to make mass arrests.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re trying to balance our obligations and responsibilities with the safety of protesters and the public, and resorting to force is not always the best method of mitigating the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would rather try and establish dialogue with the leaders of the groups, and ask them, discuss with them, ways in which we could mitigate the problem.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides , California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses , UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years , and L.A.

Morton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP WATCH Georgia Dad Found Guilty in Son's Hot-Car Death 0 Shares Email A jury today reached guilty verdicts in the murder trial of a Georgia man accused of leaving his 22-month-old son in his hot car. Justin Ross Harris , who worked as a web developer for Home Depot, was accused of murdering his son, Cooper, on a hot summer day two years ago after the boy spent about seven hours in a car seat in Harris' locked SUV in the Atlanta area. Harris, who pleaded not guilty, was found guilty on all eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, all of which are punishable by up to life in prison. Cooper died after being left for hours in the back of Harris' SUV on June 18, 2014. Harris has said that he forgot to drop his son off at day care that morning and then drove to his job without realizing Cooper was still in his car seat. Prosecutors argued that Harris killed his son intentionally to escape the responsibilities of his family life, while the defense argued that the death was an unintended tragedy. Leanna Taylor, Harris' ex-wife, testified that he \"wanted to enjoy every second he could\" with Cooper and was an involved father. She told jurors that Harris \"wanted to be the one to push him on swings\" at the playground. Harris' sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 5, according to ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB-TV. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Juliet Eilperin and Greg Jaffe November 14 at 4:38 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @GregJaffe President Obama held his first news conference since voters sharply rejected his candidate and his party at the polls last week, reassuring people at home and abroad that Donald Trump was committed to governing in a more pragmatic fashion than his harsh campaign style would suggest. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be the next president and regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office,\u201d said Obama, who met with Trump for the first time last week. \u201cThis office has a way of waking you up.\u201d Obama faced reporters crammed into the James S. Brady Briefing Room on Monday before leaving Washington for a week-long foreign trip to Greece, Germany and Peru, where he will meet with more than a dozen foreign leaders with their own set of worries about where the United States is headed under its next president. At moments the president offered advice to his successor that sometimes sounded like a warning. He urged Trump to respect \u201cthose norms that are vital to a functioning democracy,\u201d such as \u201ccivility and tolerance and a commitment to reason and facts and analysis.\u201d For months Obama had accused candidate Trump of breaching those norms during a bitter and contentious campaign. After last week\u2019s shocking election results, Obama struck a more sanguine note. \u201cI think he\u2019s sincere in wanting to be a successful president and moving this country forward,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any president ever comes in saying to himself, \u2018I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country.\u2019\u00a0\u201d President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's \"healthy\" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. \"When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,\" Obama said. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The president sought to reassure U.S. allies, noting that in his conversation with Trump last week, the New York businessman \u201cexpressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,\u201d including the one with NATO. As he visits with world leaders, Obama vowed to let them know \u201cthat there is no weakening of resolve\u201d when it comes to America meeting its commitments and defending its allies. Throughout the hour-long news conference, Obama sought to calm and reassure a jittery and divided country, choosing his words carefully and emphasizing unity over division. On many issues the president conceded that he and Trump continue to have competing visions on where to take the country and that his worries about Trump\u2019s fitness for office and temperament haven\u2019t disappeared. \u201cOf course I have got concerns,\u201d Obama said. He sought solace in the notion that change in Washington usually takes time. \u201cThe federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It\u2019s an ocean liner,\u201d Obama said. And he expressed hope that on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Trump would modify his position. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is ideological. I think, ultimately, he is pragmatic,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.\u201d President Obama said that his administration \"stands ready\" to assist President-elect Donald Trump and his staff as they transition to the White House in January. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The president declined to comment on Trump\u2019s highest-profile and most controversial appointment so far \u2014 senior counselor and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, former chief executive of the conservative website Breitbart News. Bannon is closely associated with the alt-right movement, which white nationalists have embraced. \u201cWithout copping out, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we are going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,\u201d Obama said. The president declined to answer a question on whether he still saw Trump as unfit to serve in the Oval Office \u2014 a criticism he had leveled more than once during the campaign \u2014 and instead emphasized that he had counseled the president-elect to reach out to some constituencies that had not supported his bid. \u201cIt is important to send some signals of unity\u201d to minorities, women and other groups \u201cthat were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,\u201d Obama said. In a sign of how Obama has been working doggedly to influence Trump to preserve some of his administration\u2019s landmark achievements, the president spoke of the need to improve the Affordable Care Act rather than jettison it. He made a passionate case for not forcing children of undocumented immigrants to leave the country. \u201cI will urge the president-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what, for all practical purposes, are American kids,\u201d he said. Going before the media soon after a major election is a rite of passage for the president. In Obama\u2019s case, only one of these exchanges has been celebratory. While he could embrace his 2012 reelection victory, both the 2010 and 2014 midterms and now the election of his successor have amounted to serious setbacks. Six years ago, Obama called the Democrats\u2019 congressional losses a \u201cshellacking\u201d; in 2014, he declined to characterize the results, saying instead to the American people, \u201cI hear you.\u201d Obama spent much less time talking about what contributed to Democrats\u2019 latest losses, which were punctuated by disappointing turnout among some minority groups and a poor showing in rural areas and some key suburbs. But he acknowledged that Democrats need to engage in \u201csome reflection\u201d about the way they campaign and connect with the American people. \u201cI believe that we have better ideas, but I also believe that good ideas don\u2019t matter if people don\u2019t hear them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere.\u201d Much of the president\u2019s hour-long news conference was dominated by questions of his view of Trump\u2019s character, temperament and fitness for office. Obama offered careful praise for Trump\u2019s ability to galvanize his constituency. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive,\u201d the president said. He observed that Trump was \u201cimpervious to events that might have sunk another candidate. That\u2019s powerful stuff.\u201d But Obama cautioned that Trump would not be able to govern as he campaigned: \u201cThere are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ordered Brendan Dassey's release contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. The judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling. Dassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he had not spoken yet with Dassey, but he hoped to have him out of prison in time to spend Thanksgiving with his family.

Dassey was 16 when Halbach died. He's now 27. Duffin ruled in August that investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" He cited one investigator's comment early in the interview that \"you don't have to worry about things,\" plus repeated comments like \"it's OK\" and that they already knew what happened. Related: Netflix's 'Making a Murderer' Gets Second Season to Examine Steven Avery Conviction Schimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made. Halbach was killed on Halloween 2005, after she visited the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan. Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe him as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking. Avery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal. Their cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men. The Associated Press ",

When we at\u00a0Slate\u00a0heard that\u00a0 Gwen Ifill had died , we reached out to our friend and hers, John Dickerson, for his reaction. The following is what he typed back to us from a cab. Gwen\u2019s smile. It was so strong it greeted you before you met her. You could read by the light of her smile. And if you could make her laugh that was a prize. The sound of pure joy. Gwen was bright and bursting and full of spirit and soul. Always. The last\u00a0Washington Week\u00a0we did together before the Republican convention, she was tired from treatment and still recovering, but her smile was still radiating. She was still hungry to figure out what the story was, questioning all of us before we went onstage with her usual urgency and her delight in pointing at something phony and calling it out. Gwen Ifill talks with John Dickerson on \u201cFace The Nation\u201d Close Face The Nation When I was first asked to be on\u00a0Washington Week, I never prepared more for an appearance. I wanted to be worthy of her show where she held up reporting and gave you a chance to talk and where she felt so keenly the duty she had to all the people watching. If you were on Gwen\u2019s show, you became a collector of compliments. People would stop me all across the country to say great things about her. A guy once interrupted me at the gym when I was doing the bench press to tell me how much he loved Gwen. I sat in for Gwen sometimes. That meant I sat in her office to prepare for\u00a0Washington Week. The room was clotted with awards of course, but more important were the pictures of Gwen with friends, co-workers\u2014all of us who delighted in being in the warmth of her smile. We were lucky, those of us who knew Gwen because we spent time in her company, but also because we have her example. So as a tribute to Gwen I will work harder at the job we both love and I\u2019ll try harder to fumble toward what she did with such ease, which is spread love and joy and delight. And I will put on\u00a0Hamilton, which she loved so much. Gwen did not throw away her shot. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Monday that he did not intend to change the LAPD's approach to immigration enforcement, despite pledges by President-elect Donald Trump to toughen federal immigration laws and increase deportations. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Kate Mather Contact Reporter Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Monday that he has no plans to change the LAPD \u2019s stance on immigration enforcement, despite President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pledge to toughen federal immigration laws and deport millions of people upon taking office. For decades, the LAPD has distanced itself from federal immigration policies.\u00a0The LAPD prohibits officers from initiating contact with someone solely to determine whether they are in the country legally, mandated by a special order signed by then-chief Daryl Gates in 1979. During Beck\u2019s tenure as chief, the department stopped\u00a0turning over people arrested for low-level crimes to federal agents for deportation and moved away from honoring federal requests to detain inmates who might be deportable past their jail terms. On Monday, Beck said he planned to maintain the long-standing separation. \u201cI don\u2019t intend on doing anything different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody\u2019s immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts. That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.\u201d Fear among immigrants and their families has rippled across the country in the days following Trump\u2019s election to the presidency. Trump made illegal immigration a central issue of his campaign, vowing to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, deport people who are in the country illegally\u00a0and unwind immigration relief\u00a0created under President Obama. In Los Angeles, officials have tried to alleviate some of those concerns by signaling their support for the city\u2019s immigrant residents. At a meeting Friday at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city would question Trump\u2019s decisions on immigration. \u201cIf the first day, as president, we see something that is hostile to our people, hostile to our city, bad for our economy, bad for our security, we will speak up, speak out, act up\u00a0and act out,\u201d Garcetti said. The mayor also said that the LAPD would continue to enforce Special Order 40, the Gates-signed directive that bars officers from contacting someone solely to determine their immigration status. \u201cOur law enforcement officers and LAPD don\u2019t go around asking people for their papers, nor should they,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not the role of local law enforcement.\u201d Beck said his command staff has also been meeting with community leaders to hear their concerns about immigration enforcement. \u201cThis is the same LAPD you had Monday, a week ago. We have not changed because of the election on Tuesday. We have the same principles. We have the same values,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not going to change the way that the Los Angeles Police Department enforces the law.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides , California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses , UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years , and L.A.

    "text": "By William Booth and Ruth Eglash November 14 at 3:41 PM Follow @boothwilliam Follow @reglash JERUSALEM \u2014 Right-wing leaders in the Israeli government have seized on the election of Donald Trump to push forward assertive new legislation that would legalize Jewish settlements in the West Bank built on privately owned Palestinian land. Believing that the time to act is now, as the U.S. president-elect begins to shape his foreign policy, top Israeli ministers voted unanimously Sunday in favor of a bill that would allow Israeli settlements and outposts that were built on property owned by Palestinians to avoid court-ordered demolitions. On Monday, Israeli politicians dug in for a fight over the legislation, which would retroactively offer legal protection to thousands of homes built both in long-established settlements and in newer wildcat outposts that were constructed on private Palestinian land. Palestinian landowners would be given money or alternative land parcels in exchange for their seized property. Israel considers most of its settlements legal but has acknowledged that some are either built without approval by the military or were erected on private Palestinian lands. The move by Israeli leaders is one of the first concrete responses to the Trump election on the international stage. Trump and his advisers have signaled that the incoming administration will be more supportive of Israel than was President Obama, whose State Department has sharply criticized settlements as \u201can obstacle to peace,\u201d even as the White House awarded Israel an unprecedented $38\u00a0billion in military aid over the coming decade and has staunchly defended Israel in political forums. [ Top Trump adviser says Israeli settlements are not an obstacle to peace ] Naftali Bennett, Israel\u2019s education minister and the leader of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, said the Trump victory means that \u201c the era of the Palestinian state is over ,\u201d a direct challenge to the official government position of backing a two-state solution. Bennett and his allies view the full legalization of the settlements built on Palestinian land as only a first step. Bennett wants Israel to formally annex the 60 percent of the West Bank where the Jewish-only settlements are located, thereby ending any prospect for a viable Palestinian state. Speaking to foreign correspondents Monday, Bennett said the Trump election and shifting politics in Europe \u201cprovide Israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything.\u201d As for the idea that Israel should wait and see where Trump is going, Bennett said it is important for Israel to declare what it wants. The draft legislation was opposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the move \u201cchildish and irresponsible.\u201d Even so, senior members and top ministers of Netanyahu\u2019s fellow Likud party approved a bill that their leader considers ill-timed and needlessly provocative. Netanyahu finds himself in a tight spot. If the draft legislation is eventually passed by the parliament \u2014 not a sure bet \u2014 the Israeli leader fears a wave of condemnation by Europe and the United Nations, where pro-Palestinian voices can insist that the settlers are \u201cstealing\u201d Arab-owned land with government approval. Netanyahu is also wary of what Obama may do in his last months in office. The outgoing president, many Israelis fear, could formally outline what the Americans consider a fair resolution to the long-running conflict, including the parameters for a future Palestinian state. Obama could do this in a speech or by allowing a resolution to pass in the United Nations. Daniel Friedmann, a former Israeli justice minister, said, \u201cNetanyahu really wanted to avoid this.\u201d He said the Israeli prime minister \u201ccould stop it if he really wanted to, but he is not in an easy position, because he does not want the settlers to think that he is the one who threw it out.\u201d Netanyahu could still stall or derail the legislation, but the clock is ticking. The first of three readings of the bill is scheduled for Wednesday. The State Department condemned the proposed law, saying it further endangers the prospects for peace. \u201cThis legislation would be a dramatic advancement of the settlement enterprise, which is already gravely endangering the prospects for a two-state solution,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said on Monday. \u201cThis only makes clear the choice Israel faces between building more settlements and preserving the possibility of peace.\u201d Trudeau added that the State Department hopes the proposal does not become law but declined to say whether the administration plans any response if it is enacted. [ State Dept. criticizes Israeli settlement expansion, demolitions ] The move to press ahead with the \u201clegalization bill\u201d was spurred by the Israeli Supreme Court, which ordered that a Jewish settlement called Amona be evacuated and demolished because a portion of it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. On Monday, the high court rejected a government appeal for a delay and gave the Israeli military until Dec.\u00a025 to clear the settlement. Demolition orders against other settlements built on private Palestinian land are also looming. Today about 400,000 Jewish settlers are living on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on territory that Palestinians want for a future state. Most of the world considers the settlements illegal under international law. The United States calls the communities \u201cillegitimate.\u201d Israel disputes that. In the past year, the Obama White House and the State Department have condemned settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem with sharply escalating rhetoric, openly questioning whether Netanyahu is truly committed to a two-state solution. Shai Ben Yosef, a leader of the Ofra settlement, which also is partly built on private Palestinian land, told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that \u201cTrump\u2019s election removes that excuse of, \u2018Oy vey, what are they going to do to us?\u2019\u00a0\u201d He added: \u201cThe person about to move into the White House is a man whose motivation to pressure Israel is much smaller. We can reach agreements with him about legalizing the settlements.\u201d Yosef said Netanyahu has often cited Washington as the reason for his insistence that settlements grow slowly, out of fear of upsetting the Americans. With Trump\u2019s election, he said, \u201cour government needs to drop all those old excuses.\u201d [ Some Israelis see $38 billion U.S. military aid offer as a failure ] As usual, the Palestinians were on the sidelines as their fates were being debated in the Israeli parliament and courts. The Palestinian government condemned the move to legalize settlements built on private Palestinian land as \u201ctheft.\u201d Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, vowed that the Palestinians would go to the U.N. Security Council to seek to block the legislation\u2019s implementation. He called the move \u201ca dangerous escalation in the region.\u201d The move is not universally embraced in Israel, either. Isaac Herzog, leader of the opposition in parliament, said the proposed bill is a \u201cserious stain on Israel\u2019s law books, because it authorizes theft and robbery. There is no precedent, nothing like it, in which the Israeli government authorized a law that allows taking land from private people.\u201d Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit warned that legislation contradicts international law and said he wouldn\u2019t be able to defend the bill in front of the high court. \u201cI think that it is too early and premature for politicians to make statements and I think it is not wise,\u201d Israel\u2019s former national security adviser Yaakov Amidror said of the Israelis who think they know what Trump\u2019s intentions are toward Israel and the Palestinians.

Earthquakes are rippling through Oklahoma with an intensity so persistent they are almost considered normal. Already 46 quakes large and small, have struck the region since the start of the month. But now the swarms are becoming harder to ignore. Damage at The Cushing Citizen newspaper building in downtown Cushing, Oklahoma, after an earthquake on Nov. 6. Cushing Citizen A 5.0-magnitude earthquake struck 25 miles west of the town of Cushing on Nov. 6, damaging buildings and crippling aging infrastructure. It was the second large-scale earthquake to hit Oklahoma in as many months. Even more crushing: scientists believe the causes are largely man-made. The rise in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has been a boom for Oklahoma's economy in extracting previously untapped sources of oil and gas. However, scientists say the process of disposing its byproduct has been a bust for the environment, triggering underground tremors at unprecedented rates. For a state where roughly one-quarter of jobs are tied to the energy industry, stakeholders are in the midst of a difficult reckoning over what must be done to keep the ground from shaking. \"The oil and gas industry basically owns the state,\" said Oklahoma state Rep. Cory Williams (D-Stillwater). \"Policymakers don't want to do anything that appears to harm the jobs created by the oil and gas sector and so they don't want to do anything that even appears to be a regulation.\" Hydraulic fracking itself is not directly responsible for the earthquakes, scientists have found. Instead the problem lies in the massive volumes of wastewater unearthed in the process of unlocking the oil and gas. Operators typically dump the salty wastewater, injecting high volumes of fluid into disposal wells dug thousands of feet below the earth's surface. But the pressure from the wastewater is wreaking havoc on Oklahoma's faultlines. The Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS) bluntly concluded last year it was \"very likely\" that the majority of earthquakes that rippled through the central and northern regions of the state were caused by this process of injecting wastewater into disposal wells. As a result, the frequency of earthquakes in Oklahoma has increased at remarkable rates over a short period of time. OGS, the state's energy research agency, recorded 109 earthquakes in 2013. Within two years that number would jump 907. \"The rate of magnitude 3+ earthquakes has increased from 1.5 per year prior to 2008, to the current average rate of 2.5 per day, a rate that is approximately 600 times the historical background,\" the Oklahoma Geological Survey found in its April 2015 report . While no deaths have been reported, the injections are a bit like waking a sleeping giant. Just last month a quake matched an all-time record in the state by reaching a magnitude of 5.6. It was caused by an underground fault line that scientists didn't even know existed prior to the tremors. Oklahoma policy makers were initially slow to link the disposal wells to the increase in tremors. Few said directly that the energy sector was contributing to the problem, according to Oklahoma state Rep. Jason Murphey (R-Guthrie). \"Up until very recently there was a great reluctance to take that conversation seriously,\" Murphy added. \"But the dialogue has changed. Now almost everyone knows and understands the correlation between earthquakes and wastewater injection.\" Related: Strong Oklahoma Earthquake Felt From Nebraska to Texas Stakeholders are now scrambling to try and prevent the next earthquake before it happens. Republican Gov. Mary Fallin convened a council of stakeholders, including state regulators, academics and energy industry representatives, to hash out a plan of action. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) ordered the shutdown of 58 disposal wells in the hotbed of seismic activity. Still many policymakers are careful to not implicate the energy industry directly, making pains to distinguish between the drilling process and the storing of its byproduct. The oil and gas industry creates a vital economic bloodline through Oklahoma. Roughly one-quarter of jobs in the state are tied to the energy sector. Symbolically it is a giant in the state, embodied by the 75-foot-tall golden statue of an oil driller in Tulsa that serves as a state monument. Crude oil storage tanks are seen from the air at the Cushing oil hub in Oklahoma. Nick Oxford / Reuters file A.J. Ferate, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, says more research needs to be done before policymakers move forward on preventative measures limiting the number of earthquakes. \"This is not something we can solve overnight, in part because we still need to understand it,\" he said. Opponents to fracking, meanwhile, are charting novel routes in order to force the state's hand on limiting wastewater injections. The Sierra Club in Oklahoma has filed a federal lawsuit claiming that oil companies in the region were violating waste-management laws in ways that endangered both residents and the environment. Richard Webster, an attorney with the Washington-based non-profit Public Justice and lead attorney on the case, said last week's earthquake in Cushing eerily mirrored warnings outlined in their complaint in predicting that larger swarms are bound to cause lasting destruction. \"It could cause problems with infrastructure, cause serious contamination as well as dangerous to people,\" Webster said. \"So far we've been fairly lucky. We've had some damage, but we haven't had a lot of damage.\" Amanda Sakuma ",

    "text": "Obama Says Trump Told Him He Would Support NATO, After Threats to Abandon It By JUSTIN FISHEL Nov 14, 2016, 7:20 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Obama: Trump Committed to Maintaining US Role in NATO 0 Shares Email President Obama said today that President-elect Donald Trump told him personally that he would maintain a strong \"commitment\" to NATO -- after the real estate mogul threatened to abandon the alliance during the campaign. Obama made the remarks at a press briefing at the White House just before departing on his last trip overseas as president, an opportunity he'll take to signal \"solidarity with our closest allies,\" he said. \"In my conversation with the president-elect he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships, and so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance,\" Obama said. Donald Trump Tells Vladimir Putin He\u2019s Looking 'Forward to Having a Strong and Enduring Relationship With Russia' \"I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage during this trip is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe,\" the president added. \"They are good for the United States and they are vital for the world.\" During his presidential campaign Donald Trump described NATO as \"obsolete,\" while also suggesting he may not honor the organization's most sacred covenant of mutual defense (an attack on one is an attack on all) in the face of outside aggression. \u201cIf they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes,\" Trump told The New York Times in July when asked if he would defend the Baltic states from an attack by Russia. Trump has said NATO needs to spend more on its own defense and has complained that not every member is in compliance with their obligation to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on national defense. Days after the election, NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg , penned an op-ed in The Guardian warning that \"this is no time to question the value of the partnership between Europe and the United States.\" Stoltenberg also issued a stark reminder, seemingly aimed at Trump, that NATO's mutual defense clause has been invoked only once: when NATO allies deployed in support of the United States after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Florida Homicide Rate Increased After Passage of 'Stand Your Ground' Law, Study Finds By Gillian Mohney Nov 14, 2016, 6:15 PM ET 0 Shares Star Shadi Bushra/Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images Monique Messer holds her sign, which she says sums up her feelings about Florida 'Stand Your Ground' laws, during a 'Justice for Trayvon' rally at the Wilkie D. Ferguson Federal Courthouse in Miami, Florida, July 20, 2013. 0 Shares Email The rate of homicides, especially homicides by firearms, sharply increased in Florida in the years after the \"stand your ground\" law was passed, according to a new study published today by the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. Passed in 2005, the so-called \"stand your ground\" law in Florida allows residents to use force , including deadly force, if they \"reasonably believe\" they are at risk of bodily harm. The law also created a \"no duty to retreat\" provision if they felt at risk. To see if they could find any measurable effects in the homicide rate after the law's passage, researchers from the University of Oxford looked at Florida homicide data at various points in time from 1999 to 2014. They then compared increases or decreases in those rates with four control states (New York, Virginia, New Jersey and Ohio) where a \"stand your ground\"-type law does not exist. By examining data from a database run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , researchers found that in the years after the law was passed in Florida, homicides increased approximately 24 percent -- from an average of 82 homicides per month between 1999 to October 2005 to 99 homicides per month between October 2005 to 2014. Additionally, they found the rate of homicide by firearms went up approximately 32 percent -- from a mean of 49 homicides per month to 69 during those same periods. Researchers found no similar increases in the four control states that did not have a \"stand your ground\"-type law. They also examined suicide data but did not find any comparable increase in either Florida suicide rates or, more specifically, suicide by firearm rates after the law's passage. The authors acknowledged that it's possible there may be multiple factors that led to an increase in the Florida homicide rate. \"Circumstances unique to Florida may have contributed to our findings, including those that we could not identify,\" the authors wrote in the study. There are 23 states that have implemented some form of a \"stand your ground\" law, according to the researchers. Canada Approves Prescription Heroin to Combat Opioid Crisis Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University, has studied the effects of gun-related policies and said the study published today was \"important.\" \"These 'stand your ground' laws have proliferated and for the people who favor them, the point is that it's going to make people safer,\" Swanson told ABC News today. \"You can stand your ground if you perceive your life is being threatened [but] what we're seeing here empirically is exactly the opposite.\" While the researchers found an increase in homicide rates after the law's passage, they did not find enough evidence to definitively find the law caused the increase in the homicide rate. While the study had limitations, Swanson said the research of the four control states makes the study stronger. \"They look at comparable trends in states that didn't pass the law and don't see the effect,\" Swanson noted. Swanson said these kinds of studies must continue in order for policy makers to make clear and informed decisions about legislation. \"This is always the question of balancing risk and rights,\" Swanson said. The National Rifle Association , which backed Florida's \"stand your ground\" law, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the study. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Racist Post About Michelle Obama Causes Backlash By john raassociated press CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u0097 Nov 14, 2016, 6:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Vice Presidential Nominees Debate Law Enforcement and Race Relations in the US 0 Shares Email The director of a West Virginia development group and a mayor are under scrutiny after a racist post about first lady Michelle Obama caused a backlash and prompted calls on social media for both women to be fired. Clay County Development Corp. director Pamela Ramsey Taylor made the post following Donald Trump's election as president, saying: \"It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House . I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\" Clay Mayor Beverly Whaling responded: \"Just made my day Pam.\" The post, first reported by WSAZ-TV, was shared hundreds of times on social media before it was deleted. The Facebook pages of Taylor and Whaling couldn't be found Monday. A call to the Clay County Development Corp. went unanswered and Whaling didn't immediately return a telephone message. An online petition seeks to remove Whaling and Taylor. The nonprofit development group provides services to elderly and low-income residents in Clay County. It is funded through state and federal grants and local fees. It is not affiliated with the town of Clay, which is about 50 miles east of Charleston. Owens Brown, director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's West Virginia chapter, is among those calling for the removal of both women. \"I feel so it's unfortunate that people still have these racist undertones,\" Brown said. \"Unfortunately, this is a reality that we are dealing with in America today. There's no place for these types of attitudes in our state.\" African-Americans make up about 4 percent of West Virginia's 1.8 million residents, according to the U.S. Census. About 77 percent of Clay County residents supported Trump in the Nov. 8 election. In 2012, President Barack Obama received 31 percent of the county vote when Republican Mitt Romney easily carried the state. The town council has a previously scheduled meeting Tuesday. Last week in Kentucky, Republican Dan Johnson defeated incumbent Democrat Linda Belcher in Bullitt County despite a series of Facebook posts that depicted Barack Obama and his wife as monkeys. Republican officials, including likely new House Speaker Jeff Hoover, had called on Johnson to drop out of the race. But Hoover declared last week that Johnson would be \"welcome in our caucus.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "info <p>People walk towards he grave stones of some of the victims of the 2010 plane crash in Russia that killed Poland\u2019s President Lech Kaczynski and 95 other prominent Poles, at the Powazki Cemetery, in Warsaw, Poland, Saturday Nov. 12, 2016.&nbsp;</p> Close Czarek Sokolowski, AP WARSAW, Poland -- The bodies of former Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife have been removed from their tomb in Krakow, the first of more than 80 exhumations planned on prominent Poles killed in a plane crash in Russia in 2010 . The exhumations that began late Monday are part of a new investigation into the crash ordered by Poland\u2019s conservative ruling party, Law and Justice, which is led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president\u2019s twin brother. Post-mortems will be carried out to determine the cause of the deaths and of the crash, identify all the remains and check for explosives, since some of Kaczynski\u2019s followers believe that a planned blast downed the aircraft, killing all 96 aboard. Kaczynski has cast doubt on earlier investigations -- carried out by both Poland and Russia - which concluded that the crash was an accident caused primarily by pilot error on approach to landing in dense fog. Kaczynski has for years encouraged a conspiracy theory suggesting Russia carried out an assassination with the support, or at least the consent, of the Polish prime minister at the time -- Donald Tusk, now the president of the European Council. Kaczynski wants to take Tusk, his nemesis, to court and is seeking evidence against him. \u201cThere will not be a free Poland, a truly free Poland, without the truth, without a proper honoring of those who died, without a closure of this case which has cast such a long shadow on our national and social life,\u201d Kaczynski said last Thursday. According to the PAP news agency, the bodies of Kaczynski and his wife, Maria Kaczynska, were removed from their alabaster tomb at the Wawel Cathedral in Krakow, the resting place of many of Poland\u2019s kings and writers. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the presidential couple\u2019s daughter, Marta Kaczynska, and experts were seen arriving at the site to attend the exhumation. Priests were to say prayers during the procedure. The media had no access to the site. This Sunday April 11, 2010 file photo shows the wreckage of the Polish presidential plane which crashed early Saturday in Smolensk, western Russia.\u00a0 Close AP Shortly before 1 a.m. Tuesday, hearses were seen leaving the Wawel Cathedral area, PAP said. The remains were to be taken to a forensics laboratory at Krakow\u2019s renowned Jagiellonian University for a series of tests, including computer tomography and DNA tests. Scientists will also look for the presence of explosives to check the belief held by many Kaczynski supporters that the plane, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154 operated by the Polish air force, disintegrated in mid-air in an intended explosion. Prosecutors say they plan to exhume and perform similar post-mortems on a total of 83 bodies through the end of 2017. Four bodies were cremated, while nine other bodies were already exhumed in 2011 and 2012 after families protested major errors in autopsy reports carried out by the Russians right after the crash. It turned out six victims had been buried in the wrong graves. The Russians have said the mistakes occurred due to the fragmented state of the bodies, but to many Poles they are proof of wrongdoing by the Russians, suspicions fueled by Moscow\u2019s refusal so far to return the plane\u2019s wreckage and the flight recorders to the Poles. Law and Justice, which assumed power a year ago, says Tusk\u2019s team neglected to have each of the bodies examined, out of disregard for the late president, a political rival, and out of concern that the findings could anger Russian President Vladimir Putin - something Tusk and members of his Civic Platform party deny. In this Sunday July 13, 2008 file photo, Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his wife Maria attend a formal dinner after a Mediterranean Summit meeting at the Petit Palais in Paris.\u00a0 Close THIBAULT CAMUS, AP The exhumations are proving controversial, with most Poles dismissive of the conspiracy theories, and some relatives aghast at the thought of their loved ones being exhumed. \u201cWe stand alone and helpless in the face of this ruthless and cruel act,\u201d the relatives of 17 victims wrote in an open letter. \u201cThe forceful exhumations constitute a violation of a taboo existing in our culture that calls for the respect of the bodies of the dead,\u201d said Malgorzata Rybicka, the widow of Arkadiusz Rybicki, a lawmaker with Civic Platform, in an interview with the Tygodnik Powszechny Catholic magazine. \u201cIt also shows the lighthearted approach to the feelings of the families.\u201d However, Malgorzata Wasserman, daughter of Zbigniew Wasserman, a lawmaker who perished, called the exhumations \u201ca procedural must\u201d given that Poland carried out no autopsies as the stunned nation watched the dozens of coffins, draped in white-and-red national flags, arrive from Russia in 2010. The Russian autopsy report on her father described him as having the healthy liver of a young man when in fact the 60-year-old had only part of his liver left after an operation. The tragedy occurred April 10, 2010, when the presidential delegation was traveling to honor 22,000 Polish officers who were murdered by the Soviet secret police at the start of World War II in the Katyn forest and elsewhere. The delegation included government members, lawmakers, military commanders and the relatives of officers slain in the wartime massacre. The symbolism of the mission only added to the national grief and the suspicions. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Mr. Bannon has told people in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle that the new administration will have a short window of time to push its agenda through and should focus first on the priorities that are expected to be the most contentious. Ever hungry for political combat, Mr. Bannon is expected to be an unrelenting advocate for many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most aggressive plans on immigration. That involves stopping the immigration of Syrian refugees, deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records and devoting more resources to securing the border. Mr. Bannon, who grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Norfolk, Va., earned degrees from Georgetown and Harvard. He often compares Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise to that of Andrew Jackson, the military general and populist hero who took on the political and social elite of his day as the seventh president of the United States. While Mr. Trump became the leader of the movement of disaffected Americans who feel lost and disenfranchised in a nation undergoing rapid cultural and demographic change, Mr. Bannon has been a student of global populist trends, carefully tracking the rise of the far-right National Front in France under Marine Le Pen and the remarkable victory of the U.K. Independence Party in Britain\u2019s vote this year to leave the European Union. \u201cSteve saw \u2014 and was a thought leader and a visionary about \u2014 the issues and the movement that Trump eventually caught on to and espoused,\u201d said Larry Solov, the chief executive of Breitbart. \u201cHe\u2019s like a field general,\u201d Mr. Solov added, \u201cand very much sees the fight for the soul of this country as a war.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Bannon will take his White House job already at odds with the House speaker, Paul D.

Redfin real estate agent Alex Haried, right, shows a Greektown apartment to Ryan Phelan, left, on Aug. 30, 2016. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Gail MarksJarvis Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Renters and condominium owners in downtown Chicago are starting to get some relief from the painful financial pressures inflicted by the 2008 housing bust. Tortured by sharply escalating rents amid a building boom of new luxury units, renters are finally seeing rates climb slower and even drop a little in new buildings. People trying to sell condominiums are selling into a market that's recovered 26 percent from the lows of the housing crash and now generates prices above 2008 peaks. That's based on the averages reported Monday in a third-quarter report by Appraisal Research Counselors. The Chicago real estate research firm is forecasting that as a building boom of new luxury apartment high-rises continues through 2017, the large quantity of available units will start making it difficult for both new and existing buildings to charge higher rents. (Gail MarksJarvis) So far the flurry of construction has had minimal impact on rents despite a tremendous number of new units: 3,830 in 2016 and expectations for another 4,500 in 2017 and 4,200 in 2018. Before the crash, between 2005 and 2009 only 1,171 rental units were being built a year in downtown. The surge since then has left more units available than at any time since 2009 and the number occupied by renters has dipped to 92.2 percent. As occupancy decreases, there is pressure on rents to come down, but the impact has been minimal recently. Among the top tier of rentals \u2014 known as class A \u2014 average rents per square foot dropped from $3.05 in the second quarter to $2.98 in the third quarter. For apartments that are older \u2014 known as class B \u2014 average rents fell from $2.64 in the second quarter to $2.59. While prices have dipped from the previous quarter, the price for class A apartments recently was up 3.1 percent from a year ago. Prices for older class B buildings were up 4.4 percent. That compares with suburban apartment buildings, with rents up 3.8 percent from a year ago to $1.38 per square foot. The median one-bedroom suburban apartment rented for $1,142 a month; two bedrooms were $1,344, according to Appraisal Research Counselors. (Sarah Gantz) Meanwhile, the fact that most new building has involved rentals and almost no condos is providing a better selling market for people with condos. Before the recession, 3,149 new condos were being added to the market a year. Now only 722 units are available. And since developers continue to be reluctant to build new condos, the limited supply of condos for sale is allowing condo owners to capture rising prices The average price per square foot is up 26 percent over the lows of the housing crash, and during the first half of this year prices were 2.9 percent above the peak levels hit in 2008. In a survey of 65 downtown condominium buildings during the first half of this year, analysts found the average price per square foot was $426, compared with only $338 in early 2012 and $421 early last year. Yet people selling their units may still be disappointed if they imagine a huge surge in prices. The report notes that there was great variation between buildings and areas of downtown. In Streeterville, prices were still 4 percent below their 2008 prices, while River North and Gold Coast were up 5 percent and the West Loop up 13 percent. Feeling nostalgic for the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls boom years of the '90s? In a strange and likely unparalleled coincidence, seven North Shore mansions once or currently owned by major figures from the Bulls' juggernaut teams of the 1990s are for sale right now.

In a strange and likely unparalleled coincidence, seven North Shore mansions once or currently owned by major figures from the Bulls' juggernaut teams of the 1990s are for sale right now. The listings range from... (Bob Goldsborough) During the last year, the average price in the West Loop climbed 13 percent, while the Gold Coast rose 11 percent. But the averages can be misleading. The report notes that the numbers in the West Loop have been lifted by the vast number of new developments and transactions within them. In the Gold Coast, a major factor in the average climb was renovation at Water Tower Place, the report said. Overall, sales volume took a big jump in 2012 and prices have risen consistently but gradually, as there has been very little construction of new condominiums. Those being built are primarily considered \"ultra luxury,\" with units averaging more than 2,000 square feet. Ninety percent are priced at over $1 million. Condo developers have aimed at the luxury end of the market as the price of construction has risen and banks have been cautious about lending. Still, Appraisal Research Counselors notes that there is a risk of overbuilding in the luxury condo market. gmarksjarvis@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "By Aimee Picchi MoneyWatch November 14, 2016, 2:17 PM How would deporting undocumented workers affect the U.S. economy? Email Unauthorized immigrants may be wondering what their future holds, given President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s vow to deport millions as soon as he takes office. But Americans should also be asking what mass deportations will mean for the country\u2019s economic outlook. \u00a0 Removing the country\u2019s estimated 8 million unauthorized workers likely won\u2019t be positive for the U.S. economy, according to new research from economists Ryan Edwards and Francesc Ortega at Queens College CUNY. Undocumented workers contribute about 3 percent of private-sector gross domestic product, or about $5 trillion over a decade, according to their paper, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\u00a0 In his first major interview since being elected the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump spoke with 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl. Stahl... The U.S. likely wouldn\u2019t feel the impact evenly, however, with certain industries and states having a greater reliance undocumented workers. California would be the hardest-hit state, since removing unauthorized workers would lead to a 4 percent drop in private-sector output in the short term, or about $83 billion. Texas and New York would experience the second- and third-largest economic drops, witnessing 10-year declines of $51 billion and $33 billion in output, respectively, the authors calculate. \u201cThe economic contribution to U.S. GDP of the current unauthorized workers is substantial,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cUnauthorized workers may be responsible for 8 to 9 percent of the value-added in agriculture, construction, and leisure and hospitality.\u201d While that seems dire, the research comes with a major caveat: It assumes that workers from other segments of the economy wouldn\u2019t take the jobs left vacant by the deported immigrants. It\u2019s likely that some Americans and legal immigrants would take on those roles, shifting between industries and jobs to secure new opportunities, although it\u2019s unclear how much appeal those vacant jobs would hold for legal and native-born workers. And what about his pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants? President-elect Donald Trump talks with Lesley Stahl about some of his c... Trump\u2019s position on immigration has been formed by the view that undocumented workers are taking wages and jobs away from native-born and legal workers. But policy experts note that his focus on immigration comes at a time when the share of undocumented workers is declining. While the American labor force, comprised of people born in the U.S. or who immigrated legally, has expanded by 2.2 percent since 2009, the number of illegal immigrants has declined from 8.1 million to 8 million over the same time.\u00a0 It\u2019s also unclear whether unauthorized workers are taking jobs away from Americans. Even within the occupations with the largest shares of undocumented workers -- such as farm laborers, roofers and maintenance workers -- the majority of jobs are filled by native-born workers and legal immigrants.\u00a0 In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Trump said he would immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants, whom he said are \u201ccriminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers.\u201d As for the remaining undocumented workers, Trump said he would figure that out after the border is \u201csecure.\u201d\u00a0 Lesley Stahl discusses her interview with President-elect Trump, telling Overtime that he pulled back on some campaign positions--and changed his... Trump has largely focused on America\u2019s southern border with Mexico, even though Pew notes that undocumented workers are increasingly arriving from three other regions: Asia, Africa and Central America.\u00a0 The costs to taxpayers for deporting millions of undocumented workers would mount quickly. On top of hiring thousands of new immigration agents, the country would need to house and feed millions of undocumented workers until buses, chartered aircraft and other transportation could be secured.\u00a0 The final tally? It would cost at least $400 billion in new federal spending to handle the exodus, according to research published earlier this year from the American Action Forum. The free-market think tank also measured the economic hit from losing those roughly 11 million workers: a reduction of $1.6 trillion in America\u2019s GDP.\u00a0 On the other hand, legalizing the country\u2019s undocumented workers would strengthen the U.S. economy, the Queens College economists found.\u00a0 They noted, \u201cLegalization would increase the productivity of undocumented workers, triggering further investment by employers. Legalization would increase the economic contribution of the unauthorized population by about 20%, to 3.6% of private-sector GDP.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

By David Weigel November 14 at 9:02 PM Follow daveweigel President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s new chief strategist and senior counselor, Stephen K. Bannon, has been called a racist, an anti-Semite and a white nationalist. And that\u2019s just since Sunday, when Trump announced that he would be giving Bannon, the former head of the far-right website Breitbart News, a central White House role. It\u2019s true that Bannon has attracted legions of followers who describe themselves as white supremacists. It\u2019s less clear whether Bannon\u2019s own actions and words prove that he is one, too. Bannon describes himself as a leader of the \u201calt-right,\u201d a loose term describing a far-right ideology that includes opposition to immigration and \u201cglobalism.\u201d Bannon declined to comment on the record, but there is little evidence that the nationalism question \u2014 occasionally litigated in the campaign \u2014 slowed his path to a job that requires no Senate confirmation. Shortly after joining Trump\u2019s campaign in August, Bannon said in a revealing interview with Mother Jones that, possibly, there were \u201csome people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right.\u201d That, he said, could no more define \u201calt-right\u201d than the presence of extremists on the left could identify their movement. The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Paul Farhi discuss the appointments by President-elect Donald Trump of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus as chief of staff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) But by and large, the alt-right is not racist, he said. \u201cIf you look at the identity movements over there in Europe, I think a lot of [them] are really \u2018Polish identity\u2019 or \u2018German identity,\u2019 not racial identity,\u201d said Bannon. \u201cIt\u2019s more identity toward a nation-state or their people as a nation.\u201d Under the site\u2019s founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, accusations of racism were dismissed as \u201ccultural Marxism.\u201d Yet some of the highest praise for Bannon\u2019s appointment came from white nationalists and white supremacists. According to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors far-right and far-left activity on the Internet, a trove of comments celebrating the news have posted on Stormfront, a website for the \u201cWhite Nationalist Community,\u201d including this one from a reader called \u201cPheonix1993:\u201d \u201cStephen Bannon: racist, anti-homo, anti-immigrant, anti-jewish, anti-establishment. Declared war on (((Paul Ryan))) Sounds perfect. The man who will have Trump\u2019s ear more than anyone else. Being anti-jewish is not illegal.\u201d Additionally, the white nationalist writer Richard Spencer posted this late Sunday on Twitter: \u201cBannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds. Bannon is not a \u2018chief of staff,\u2019 which requires a \u2018golden retriever\u2019 personality. He\u2019ll be freed up to chart Trump\u2019s macro trajectory.\u201d [ Trump, Putin agree in phone call to improve \u2018unsatisfactory\u2019 relations ] Under Bannon\u2019s leadership, Breitbart became an anti-\u201cglobalist\u201d news site clearly aligned with the European far right. It attracts self-described white supremacists with such headlines as \u201cBill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew.\u201d It offers a steady stream of opinion essays, such as one by Milo Yiannopoulos in March describing anti-Semitic caricatures as the \u201clong hair and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u201d of 2016. Direct evidence of racist or anti-Semitic statements by Bannon is harder to find. According to a 2007 court statement, Bannon\u2019s ex-wife accused him of not wanting their twin daughters attending a California private school because its student body included too many Jews. The scrutiny will only intensify. Bannon left Breitbart in August to become chief executive of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Until then, he had never been part of any political campaign. Little of what he did made sense to political reporters looking for the normal tokens of a winning effort \u2014 not the Mississippi rally with Brexit leader Nigel Farage, not the surprise news conference with Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers. \u201cTrump has gone from 2012 GOP style loss to a 2008 GOP style loss,\u201d wrote Republican pollster Matthew Dowd on Oct. 10. \u201cThe rhetoric that Bannon is feeding Trump makes it increasingly likely that Trump will lose in a landslide,\u201d wrote the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza on Oct. 16. A few weeks, an FBI letter and tens of thousands of WikiLeaked emails later, Bannon is poised to be Trump\u2019s chief strategist and senior counselor. Democrats have laced into him, but Republicans, taking the lead of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have not mentioned Bannon at all, not even to point out that many Breitbart staffers are Jewish. And there is talk of more Breitbart reporters joining Bannon at the White House, in roles that do not require Senate confirmation. Since 2012, when Bannon became Breitbart\u2019s chief executive, the site has defied doubts about what it could be without its charismatic founder and survived several tumultuous scraps with former staffers. The latest, just nine months ago, was telling of how Breitbart and Bannon viewed the media. After a Trump victory speech, Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart, was shoved out of the way by Trump\u2019s then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Within a week, she was gone; within a few months, Breitbart was running pieces about her being unable to defend her story. From the outside, the moves looked chaotic. But chat logs published by BuzzFeed found Breitbart staffers agreeing that the scuffle looked bad but that going to \u201cwar\u201d over it would reflect poorly on a greater cause. That cause was the Trump campaign. Bannon had joked a year before he was hired that he was effectively Trump\u2019s campaign manager because the Republican front-runner was a \u201cnationalist.\u201d He identified Breitbart as a home for the \u201calt-right\u201d for the same reason. In Europe, the far right has dealt with the same sort of media coverage as Bannon. Accusations of racism were constant; internal power struggles were seen as proof of the whole project falling apart. But Breitbart, which launched a London branch in early 2014, had seen this before. The site\u2019s editor, Raheem Kassam, became chief of staff to Brexit leader Farage as his United Kingdom Independence Party surged. [ Trump\u2019s win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave ] The Brexit vote this summer was seen, at Breitbart, as nationalism\u2019s great validation. In an analysis by Allum Bokhari and Yiannopoulos, two of the site\u2019s U.K. writers, the failure of the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign in Britain \u2014 one that united most of both of the country\u2019s major parties and most of its experts \u2014 proved that the masses wanted a revolt against \u201cglobalism.\u201d Warnings about what the wrong vote would do to markets, or that it would make people think of voters as racists, meant less than nothing to the anti-globalism working class. \u201cThey think about political sovereignty, independence and national pride,\u201d Bokhari and Yiannopoulos wrote. \u201cElites sneer at these concerns as the foolish, provincial preoccupations of \u2018low-information voters,\u2019 yet they are deeply embedded in human nature, particularly in the search for belonging.\u201d In America, too, Breitbart was the place for news on the revolt against the \u201cglobalists.\u201d European far-right politicians like Geert Wilders and the Le Pens earned regular write-ups. A typical headline: \u201cMarion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen: Either We Kill Islamism or It Kills Us.\u201d Their politics were seen as necessary because of the litany of migrant crimes screaming across Breitbart, such as this headline: \u201cPreviously-Deported Illegal Alien Caught on Camera Destroying Trump Signs While \u2018at Work.\u2019 \u201d Coverage like that turned Breitbart into a powerhouse; according to the New York Times, it earned more Facebook impressions on election night than Fox News or CNN. More importantly, Bannon helped shape a Trump message that won the condemnation of the Anti-Defamation League \u2014 and helped him in swing states. Trump\u2019s closing ad, a two-minute edit of a speech he had given attacking the \u201cglobal financial powers,\u201d struck the ADL as hitting \u201canti-Semitic themes.\u201d In the wider media, it was seen as stirring and populist. \u201cI played the clip for like five different people and I said, \u2018Is that anti-Semitic?\u2019\u201d said MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough last week. \u201cNo. There are dog whistles, but . . . play that ad to 100 Americans in middle America, 99 of them will go, \u2018That\u2019s cool.\u2019 \u201d Further on the political fringe, Bannon and Breitbart were credited with honing Trump\u2019s message against globalism, and unleashing his say-anything approach to talking about terrorism and immigrant crime. Alex Jones, a Texas-based online host who has attacked \u201cglobalists\u201d and called the 9/11 attacks an inside job, told viewers this week that Trump had thanked him for his coverage. On Jones\u2019s online show, after the election, sometime-Trump adviser Roger Stone suggested that Bannon become Trump\u2019s chief of staff to keep the momentum of the campaign going. \u201cI think he has the big picture viewpoint that Trump needs,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe knows exactly who the bad guys are. He knows exactly who those who won this victory are.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "7 Reasons Donald Trump Won The Presidential Election Throughout the campaign, especially during the primaries in the first half of 2016, there were questions about the relationship between the Republican Party and the Trump campaign. But once Trump formally secured the nomination, the RNC and its chairman, Reince Priebus, were all in. Certainly Trump's outsider status, his ability to reach disaffected voters, and his blunt, proudly politically incorrect speeches and Twitter presence were the driving force behind his victory, but the RNC wants to make sure the world is aware of just how much it did to help Trump and other GOP candidates out at the ballot box. \"We worked closely and well with the Trump campaign,\" RNC Political Director Chris Carr said at a post-election press briefing in Washington. \"We were always on the same page.\" Wherever Trump went, the RNC had a major presence, working the audience, getting people registered and signing up volunteers. Carr said the extent of that in-person outreach at rallies was unprecedented for the party. Carr also said that the party studied how President Obama's two campaigns for the White House used and analyzed data, identified potential voters and put together decentralized teams of volunteers in every single state in the nation. Instead of having most of the action in any given county based at so-called Victory Offices (local campaign offices), it took a page from Obama for America and put the focus in individual neighborhoods called \"turfs\" \u2014 each with 8,000 to 10,000 targeted voters. There, a field organizer (a paid campaign staffer) would train neighborhood team leaders. Article continues after sponsorship One other thing borrowed from the Obama campaign \u2014 the establishment of the Republican Leadership Initiative, which was a program to set up campaign fellowships to train future GOP leaders and operatives. And where the Romney for President campaign of 2012 endured major Election Eay glitches in the computer program designed to drive the final turnout push, this year the RNC says its digital operations worked smoothly, identifying potential voters early in the year and tracking them closely over the course of the campaign. Here are some numbers the GOP is extremely proud of: 24 million door knocks: more than 9 million of them in the final four days, compared with just 11.4 million total for all of 2012. 26 million phone calls: another huge increase from four years earlier. $200,000 to $300,000: spent every day on advertising and fundraising on Facebook for 150 days straight. The RNC says it paid off. And perhaps the single most telling number included in the presentation is that 220 counties nationwide that went for President Obama flipped and supported Donald Trump this year. ",

News-Sentinel 7:11 p.m. EST November 14, 2016 Bob Corker (Photo: File / AP) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0A prominent biology professor in Tennessee says Sen. Bob Corker suggested Sunday he should leave the state after he accused the senator of refusing to condemn President-elect Donald Trump's lewd\u00a0behavior toward women . David Haskell, a professor at the\u00a0University of the South in Sewanee, said he had a run-in with the senator Sunday afternoon while hiking with three friends on Stringer\u2019s Ridge near Chattanooga, Tenn. The party ran into the senator hiking alone on the same trail. Haskell said he recognized Corker, a Chattanooga Republican, immediately and confronted him\u00a0over Trump's lewd behavior toward women. Trump adviser Steve Bannon becomes 'the story' \u201cI told him how deeply ashamed I was to be in a state where our senator does not denounce Trump for boasting of sexual assault,\u201d Haskell recalled Monday. \u201cCorker has been silent on this. I said I thought his silence was shameful and that I was very angry and disappointed to be represented by a senator who would not stand up to vile and odious speech.\u201d The back-and-forth exchange lasted about 10 minutes, said Haskell, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2013 for his book The Forest Unseen: A Year\u2019s Watch in Nature. Corker\u2019s office confirmed that the confrontation\u00a0took place, but offered a different version of events. Corker spokeswoman Micah Johnson said that Haskell aggressively approached the senator in \"a profanity-laced tirade while pointing a finger in his face.\" Johnson said the senator \"calmly suggested\" that the professor \"did not have to live in Tennessee if he did not wish to do so.\" Haskell\u00a0wrote about the confrontation on his blog. \u201cI asked him again, \"Will you condemn Trump\u2019s boasting of sexual assault, will you denounce him of that?'\u201d Haskell said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe was silent. He did not respond to that. Instead, he said to me, \u2018What have you ever done to contribute to this state?\u2019 He said it\u2019s people like me who don\u2019t accept the result of the election that are dividing the country.\u201d But, \u201cI never said I didn\u2019t accept the results of the election,\u201d Haskell said. \u201cI do accept the results of the democratic process. I don\u2019t have to like them.\u201d Obama: Americans should 'reconcile themselves' to Trump presidency Johnson said that if the university's leadership witnessed the exchange, they would be disappointed in Haskell's behavior. \u201cWhile hiking alone yesterday afternoon on Stringer\u2019s Ridge, Senator Corker was aggressively approached by Professor Haskell, who was hiking with three other individuals,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cProfessor Haskell began shouting at Senator Corker in a profanity-laced tirade while pointing a finger in his face and told the senator that he was embarrassed to live in a state where the citizens voted to overwhelmingly elect Donald Trump. \u201cSenator Corker calmly suggested to the professor that he did not have to live in Tennessee if he did not wish to do so. Senator Corker believes that if the leadership of Sewanee witnessed the exchange, they would be sorely disappointed in the behavior of someone tasked with leading students.\u201d Haskell denied that he approached Corker aggressively or used profanity and said he never\u00a0claimed he was ashamed to live in Tennessee \u2014 only that he was ashamed that the senator did not stand up to Trump. \u201cI expected better of Senator Corker. In the past, he hasn\u2019t been a demagogue. He has been a reasonable person. Not anymore.\u201d David Haskell, professor, Sewanee: The University of the South The three members of Haskell\u2019s party \u2014\u00a0Katherine Lehman, a former music professor at the University of the South; Cesar Leal, an assistant professor of music at the university; and Troy Johnson, a social worker in Chattanooga \u2014\u00a0backed up\u00a0Haskell\u2019s version of events and said they were offended by\u00a0Corker\u2019s response. \u201cIt was so elitist, as if it was a powerful person talking down to someone who disagreed with him politically and he could say whatever he wanted,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cHe just had a smirk on his face.\u201d Haskell said he was shaken up and had trouble sleeping Sunday night after his run-in with the senator. \u201cI expected better of Senator\u00a0Corker,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, he hasn\u2019t been a demagogue. He has been a reasonable person. Not anymore. He will not say a word against Trump. And I think that\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d Corker has, in fact, criticized Trump\u2019s comments about women. After a 2005 videotape emerged of Trump making lewd remarks about women, Corker released a statement calling Trump\u2019s comments \u201cobviously very inappropriate and offensive\u201d and said Trump\u2019s apology \u201cwas absolutely necessary.\u201d Corker, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been advising Trump on foreign policy and is reportedly one of the candidates Trump is considering for secretary of State. Earlier this year, Corker met with Trump and his family at Trump Tower in New York City and accompanied him on the campaign trail after his name was floated as a possible contender to become Trump\u2019s vice president. Corker eventually took himself out of the running, saying he felt other people were better suited for that role.

    "text": "Dakota pipeline protesters win temporary victory with promise for more review William Yardley The Obama administration said Monday it will continue to withhold a final permit for completion of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, calling for further review of concerns that the project will damage sacred tribal sites and water supplies. The 1,170-mile pipeline would transport as much as 500,000 barrels of crude oil daily from the Bakken region of North Dakota to an existing pipeline in Illinois. It has become the subject of national controversy because it would cross a key waterway just a half-mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The tribe, whose historical lands include the construction area as well as lands flooded when the Missouri River was dammed decades ago, has organized months of protests that have made the pipeline a rallying issue for Native Americans across the country. More than 400 demonstrators have been arrested near the construction site at Lake Oahe since this summer. On Monday, law enforcement in North Dakota allowed only limited entrance to the state Capitol in Bismarck after protesters marched on the capitol grounds. \u201cThe Army has determined that additional discussion and analysis are warranted in light of the history of the Great Sioux Nation\u2019s dispossession of lands, the importance of Lake Oahe to the Tribe, our government-to-government relationship, and the statute governing easements through government property,\u201d said a statement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that reviews projects involving water crossings. (Sandy Tolan) The Corps said it was inviting the tribe \u201cto engage in discussion regarding potential conditions on an easement for the pipeline crossing that would reduce the risk of a spill or rupture, hasten detection and response to any possible spill, or otherwise enhance the protection of Lake Oahe and the Tribe\u2019s water supplies.\u201d Corps officials said they would also invite discussion of the risk of a spill \u201cin light of such conditions,\u201d and whether an easement should be granted for the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe at the proposed location. The announcement comes two months after the Obama administration announced it would withhold the permit, an easement to cross the lake, citing concerns by the tribe. And it comes just two weeks after President Obama expressed his own reservations. \u201cMy view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans, and I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline,\u201d the president said in an interview with NowThis news this month. It was not immediately clear how long the review would take but the Corps said it \u201cwill work with the Tribe on a timeline that allows for robust discussion and analysis to be completed expeditiously.\u201d Supporters of the pipeline quickly attacked the decision, linking it to the election of Donald Trump, who has expressed support for expanding fossil fuel development. \u201cToday's decision is yet another attempt at death by delay and is a stunning rebuke of the Army Corps of Engineers, the federal civil service, four state governments, and the rule of law,\u201d said Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the MAIN Coalition, an industry and labor group. \u201cThis extrajudicial, political decision is exactly why hard-working Americans across the country rejected a third Obama term. \u201cBy its own review and admission, the Army Corps of Engineers did everything right.\u00a0 Americans expect their government to play by the rules \u2014 and this is just another example of the Obama administration using its perceived authority to drive a political agenda.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides , California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses , UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years , and L.A.
