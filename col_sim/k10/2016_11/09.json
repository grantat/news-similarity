Speculation started Monday night when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a New Hampshire crowd that he has Tom Brady\u2019s vote . CBS Boston confirmed that Brady voted by absentee ballot Monday morning in Brookline. Brady posed for pictures with workers at the town hall, but the Patriots quarterback did not say publicly who he voted for this election. Trump said Brady had told him in a phone conversation: \u201cDonald, I support you, you\u2019re my friend and I voted for you.\u201d\u00a0 Questioned have swirled about the normally apolitical superstar quarterback ever since he referred to Trump as \u201ca good friend of mine\u201d on a radio show during the GOP nominee\u2019s rise in the polls. Brady has repeatedly gone out of his way to avoid further public pronouncements on the controversial businessman . However, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Brady\u2019s wife, appears to have denied Trump\u2019s claim -- or part of it, anyway. On a photo B\u00fcndchen shared on Instagram, a follower wrote \u201cGisele I heard you and Tom were backing Trump. Is that true??\u201d B\u00fcndchen replied to the commenter saying, \u201cNO!\u201d In an Instagram comment, Gisele B\u00fcndchen told a fan she and Tom Brady do not \u201cback\u201d Donald Trump. Close CBS Boston graphic \u00a0 It\u2019s not clear from B\u00fcndchen\u2019s response whether she was speaking for Brady, too, or just her own vote (if she has one -- the supermodel was born in Brazil.). In recent months Trump has touted Brady among his \u201cgreat friends\u201d while the quarterback had a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat in his locker. During the Monday rally in New Hampshire, Trump also read a letter he said was written by Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, a fact later confirmed by CBS Boston. \u201cHopefully tomorrow\u2019s election results will give the opportunity to make America great again,\u201d Trump said Belichick wrote. Bill Belichick did indeed write Donald Trump a letter. The letter Trump read from Belichick is accurate. Those were Bill's words. #WBZ \u2014 STEVE BURTON (@STEVEBURTONWBZ) November 8, 2016 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Earlier in the day Tuesday, CNBC learned that the state board ordered Durham County to switch from electronic poll books \u2014 which are used to verify voter registrations \u2014 to paper versions because of unspecified technical problems. At the time, the state said there had been no disruptions in voting. The glitches prompted Durham County officials to request an extension of 90 minutes in eight precincts in order to compensate for delays. North Carolina is a crucial state for both presidential candidates and could also play a pivotal role in which party controls the Senate. In a statement, Hillary for America Campaign Manager Robby Mook urged voting hours in Durham County to be extended. \"The Durham County Board of Elections \u2014 made up of two Republicans and one Democrat \u2014 has agreed that voting hours must be extended due to technical problems that occurred earlier today,\" said Mook. \"We are urging the North Carolina Board of Elections to heed this bipartisan call and approve this urgent measure so that every voter can have their voice heard. Especially in light of the fact that Durham County had limited early voting sites, we have to ensure that voters have equal access to the ballot box.\" Nov 8 2016, 7:10 pm ET ",

    "text": "advertisement Trump and his wife Melania fill out their ballots at a polling station in a school on Nov. 8 in New York. MANDEL NGAN / AFP - Getty Images Republican nominee Donald Trump continued to question the integrity of American elections throughout the day Tuesday, repeatedly claiming without evidence that the polling places and electoral system is \"rigged.\" \"We have to keep the system honest. We have a very, very, we have a very, very serious situation with the whole process, and I've been talking about the rigged system for a long time,\" Trump said on Fox News on Tuesday afternoon, adding moments later: \"It's largely a rigged system. And you see it at the polling booths, too.\" You don't, actually: Voter fraud in person is extremely limited. One Loyola researcher tracked a billion ballots and found 31 credible cases of voter fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found it more likely for an individual to be struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud. Long lines, broken machines, and problems with voter rolls are typical on a day when millions cast their ballots. Nearly everyone agrees the voter rolls are riddled with inaccuracies and out-of-date voter information, but what is missing from Trump's argument is any evidence that those problems are being used to falsify or defraud election results and ballots.

    "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Pinterest Share on Twitter Email Because almost everybody seems to love potatoes, it's worth mastering more than a few ways to make them. Mashed potatoes turn into potato cakes and shepherd's pies; scalloped potatoes can be an everyday side or a luxurious main; baked potatoes can be dinner, or hash browns. Read on for even more ideas and techniques. Before You Start When you're shopping, it's good to know which potato varieties are best suited to which cooking methods. Here's a breakdown. High-starch, like Idaho and other russets, are good for baking whole, mashing, roasting, salad and frying. Medium-starch, like Yukon Gold, Yellow Finn, Katahdin and Kennebec, are good for mashing, roasting, salad and boiling. Low-starch, a k a waxy potatoes, like Red Bliss, Norland, White Rose, most fingerlings and new potatoes, are good for roasting, boiling, salad. For an all-purpose potato to keep on hand, buy russets or Yukon Golds and keep them in a cool, dark place. Mashing Mashed potatoes are still the simplest and most satisfying potato dish for many meals. Whether you like them whipped and creamy, dense or fluffy, they are easy to pull off on a weeknight but special enough for a holiday. And when plain mash seems too \u2026 plain, expand on them with endless variations on herbs, aromatics and cheeses. Karsten Moran for The New York Times Basic Method Our favorite method for making mashed potatoes is in the video above. Here's how you do it: Put a large pot of water on to boil, adding a tablespoon of salt for each gallon of water. While the water heats, peel the largest potatoes you have (two per person is a good rule of thumb) and roughly cut into large chunks, about the size of a jumbo egg. Boil until tender all the way through (start testing after 10 minutes). Meanwhile, heat any flavorings (buttermilk, milk, cream, butter, stock) you plan to add. When potatoes are tender, scoop out and set aside a cup of cooking water. Drain potatoes and return them to the pot. Place over low heat and shake until most of the steam has dissipated. Add some of your flavorings, mash, and taste. Add salt. Repeat until mashed and seasoned to your liking. Adjust the texture with cooking water. Serve immediately or cover tightly and set aside for up to 30 minutes. Karsten Moran for The New York Times Tips Choose large potatoes to minimize peeling. It\u2019s better to overcook the potatoes than undercook them; be sure to cook them so they are thoroughly tender. Try adding garlic cloves and bay leaves or other aromatics to the cooking water; it adds another layer of flavor to the potatoes. Shake the drained potatoes in the pot over low heat, to get rid of excess water and add fluffiness. The traditional squiggle masher is not as efficient as those with a flat face and a grid pattern. A ricer makes the fluffiest mashed potatoes. Do not use a blender or food processor. Make sure everything you plan to add to the potatoes \u2014 milk, cream, butter, stock, cooking water \u2014 is very hot before you begin mashing. Quickly mashed potatoes are the fluffiest. The longer you work them, the denser and creamier the mash will become. Mashed potatoes will stay hot in a ceramic or glass serving bowl for at least 30 minutes. To keep them hot longer, place bowl inside a pan of simmering water on the stove and cover it tightly. You can also reheat cold mashed potatoes in this way; stir occasionally to redistribute the heat. Add another root vegetable to the mash. Some classic combinations: \u2154 mashed celery root to \u2153 mashed potato; \u00bd mashed turnips or parsnips to \u00bd mashed potato; \u00bd mashed cauliflower to \u00bd mashed potato. ",

Mitt Romney by a margin of 332-206 electoral votes. Television networks began to call the election for Obama shortly after 11 pm, when a combined 74 electoral votes came in for the president upon the closure of polls in California, Oregon and Washington, and 18 votes from Ohio -- which had been too-close-to-call since closing earlier in the night -- put the Democrat over the top. Despite the apparent results, Romney waited almost three more hours to call Obama to concede, leaving the candidates to give their concession and victory speeches early Wednesday morning. Romney, expecting victory, reportedly did not draft a concession speech in advance, eschewing the norm of preparing two speeches. Both candidates urged the political parties to work together in the aftermath of the election. \u201cThe nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing,\u201d said Romney. \u201cOur leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.\u201d Added Obama, \u201cI believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America.\u201d by Adam Kelsey 11/8/2016 9:06:00 AM Election Day is here!

The nine-person jury returned unanimous verdicts against Rurik Jutting, 31, after a two-week trial in the High Court. The slayings in 2014 and disclosures as the case developed highlighted Hong Kong\u2019s significant inequality as well as the decadent lifestyles of some members of the former British colony\u2019s expatriate elite. The southern Chinese city hasn\u2019t seen such a high-profile case involving a foreign resident since \u00a0the \u201cMilkshake Murder\u201d case in 2003 , in which American expatriate housewife\u00a0 Nancy Kissel was convicted of bludgeoning her high-flying banker husband to death \u00a0after giving him a strawberry milkshake laced with a sedative. Kissel is serving a life sentence for killing Robert Kissel, who also worked at Merrill Lynch, which was later bought by Bank of America. Jutting bowed his head briefly as the verdicts were read out to a packed courtroom but otherwise showed little reaction. He was given an automatic mandatory life sentence. While he has the right to an appeal, his defense lawyer indicated ahead of the verdict that Jutting would request a transfer to a British prison to serve out his sentence there. In a statement his lawyer asked to be read into the court record, Jutting said he was sorry and accepted the verdicts as \u201cjust and appropriate punishment.\u201d He also said he was haunted by his actions and the pain he\u2019d caused to the women\u2019s loved ones. Jutting, a Cambridge University graduate who worked for Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, was convicted of killing 23-year-old Sumarti Ningsih and then killing 26-year-old Seneng Mujiasih days later. The two originally came to Hong Kong as foreign maids but ended up as sex workers. As statements from their families were read out by the prosecutor, Jutting stared at the floor. Jurors were shown graphic smartphone video clips taken by Jutting of his apparent torture of Sumarti, which the judge deemed too graphic for the public to view. He slit her throat and then nearly decapitated her when she didn\u2019t die immediately, according to facts agreed upon by both the prosecution and defense. He then stuffed her body inside a suitcase that he left on the balcony of his upscale apartment near Hong Kong\u2019s famous Wan Chai red-light district. Jutting had planned to torture Mujiasih with about $900 worth of tools and sex toys he had bought hours before. But he killed her when she spotted a gag in his apartment and wouldn\u2019t stop screaming, according to the two sides. After the verdict, Judge Michael Stuart-Moore called the case \u201cone of the most horrifying murder cases to come to the courts in Hong Kong.\u201d \u201cThere are insufficient superlatives to describe the cruelty\u201d that Jutting inflicted on Ningsih and planned for Mujiasih, he said, adding that the defendant had not shown \u201cone shred of remorse\u201d and rejected his apology. He called Jutting an \u201carchetypal sexual predator\u201d and cited testimony from an expert psychiatric witness who said Jutting would be prone to committing sexual violence again. The judge said his sentencing remarks were aimed at notifying authorities in Britain, who must hold their own sentencing hearing if his transfer is granted, of the \u201cimmense danger\u201d Jutting poses if he is allowed out of prison. info Ahmad Kaliman (R) and Suratmi (L), the parents of Sumarti Ningsih, an Indonesian woman who was murdered in Hong Kong, wait for news of the trail of murder suspect, British banker Rurik Jutting, in their village in Cilacap, Central Java, Indonesia, on \u00a0November 8, 2016. Close REUTERS/Idhad Zakaria Ningsih\u2019s brother, Suyit Khaliman, said the family welcomed the verdict and was grateful that Jutting was given the maximum penalty under Hong Kong law. \u201cJustice finally has been upheld after two years,\u201d Khaliman said. \u201cThe sentence is still incomparable to the pain that is felt by us who lost Ningsih in such a terrible way.\u201d Khaliman said the family, from Central Java province, has suffered financially and emotionally since the death of Ningsih, who has a son, now aged 7. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Uncredited/AP hide caption toggle caption Uncredited/AP A judge has delayed jury selection in the trial of Dylann Roof, the white man charged in the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners during Bible study at a Charleston, S.C. church last year. The judge has ordered another competency exam for Roof. Uncredited/AP Dylann Roof, the man who allegedly killed nine African-American parishioners in Charleston, S.C., last year, has been ordered to undergo another competency evaluation by a federal judge hearing his case. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Gergel issued the order , writing that he expects a report based on that evaluation to be delivered to him on Nov. 14. He will hold a hearing two days later and rule on Roof's competency on or before Nov. 18. Jury selection has been suspended until Nov. 21. \"The Court is mindful that this delay in jury selection may be disappointing to some, but it is the Court's duty to conduct a fair trial and follow procedures which protect the legal rights of the Defendant,\" wrote Gergel. \"Under the present circumstances, the Court finds this brief delay in jury selection to serve the ends of justice.\" Roof faces 33 counts of hate crimes and other charges related to the killings at a Bible study meeting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015. He allegedly attacked after sitting in the gathering for almost an hour. Authorities say he left three people unharmed so that they could report on what happened.

Footage from this scene aired on CNN. Time The Internet is losing its mind over a photo of Donald Trump appearing to sneak a peek at his wife while she cast her vote on Tuesday morning. Trump and his wife voted\u00a0at a school in Manhattan. In a\u00a0photo taken while the couple voted,\u00a0Trump appears\u00a0to glance\u00a0over at Melania, drawing speculation from the Internet that the Republican nominee doesn\u2019t trust his wife to vote for him.

She and DCCC Chair Ben Ray Lujan didn\u2019t sound optimistic about picking up a large number of House seats, much less retaking the House. She said they don\u2019t intend to lose a single incumbent seat. -- CBS News\u2019 Walt Cronkite.\u00a0 12:07 p.m. ET Paul Ryan is confident he\u2019ll remain speaker of the House next year.\u00a0 Once Congress returns to Washington next week, House Republicans are slated to hold internal leadership elections -- but Speaker Paul Ryan seems confident his spot as the top House member is secure. Ryan told a group of reporters Monday in Wisconsin that he is \u201cnot worried\u201d about any change in his position. \u201cI feel very good where I am,\u201d Ryan said outside of a local Republican party office, according to Politico. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve gotten such a great outpouring of support from members. They know I took the job as a sense of duty, that duty is not done, and I plan on continuing doing that duty.\u201d Election Day 2016: America votes On a Democratic conference call Monday reported by Politico, Democratic leaders blamed FBI Director James Comey for hurting their chances to take back the House.\u00a0 \u201cWe would be in a better place [without the letter] and in the manner he did it,\u201d Pelosi reportedly said on the call. \u201cIt was out of line, but it helped us in one respect: it brought in small donors. The fact is we had a momentum going with Hillary\u2019s campaign.\u201d She noted that in the closing days of the election that Republicans were \u201ccoming home anyway, but a couple of points nationwide has an impact on our races.\u201d Politico reported that House Democratic aides estimated that Democrats could, as a result of Comey\u2019s letter, lose up to 12 seats they\u2019d hoped to pick up. -- CBS News\u2019 Reena Flores ",

As Election Day begins, some are asking what would happen if Trump loses and declines to concede. The answer is: Nothing. There is no legal or constitutional requirement that a losing candidate publicly concede, experts told NBC News. A refusal to concede in the face of a clear loss would certainly be unusual \u2014 and probably controversial \u2014 but it would not impact the formal results in any way. \"The act of conceding is not a legal act,\" political scientist Rick Hasen said. \"It doesn't have any legal effect as to whether or not someone is declared a winner,\" added Hasen, who runs the Election Law Blog . Related: Could a Contested Election Lead to a Recession? \"There is no legal requirement for the loser to concede,\" says Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. The entire \"concept of a concession speech as we know it,\" Perry added, \"didn't exist at the founding\" of the nation. The tradition of concession speeches only became prominent recently as TV addresses became common, which historian John Vile recounts in his book on the practice, \"Presidential Winners and Losers: Words of Victory and Concession.\" Play ",

It's the first big contract between Iran and a consortium led by a Western energy firm since sanctions were loosened in January. ATTA KENARE/AFP/Getty Images A preliminary deal between Iran and France's Total SA to develop an offshore Persian Gulf gas field represents the first investment by a Western energy company since international sanctions were relaxed earlier this year. The $6 billion deal between Total and Iran's state-owned Petropars, includes the participation of China National Petroleum Corporation in a consortium to develop what's known as the South Pars field estimated to contain 14,000 billion cubic meters of gas, or about 8 percent of the known global reserves. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal is still in draft stage with the final agreement expected in the next six months. It adds: \"The agreement with the French oil giant could be a harbinger for the return of more Western companies to Iran's vast energy industry and represents a step forward for the Islamic Republic's goals of ramping up production of oil and gas over the next several years.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

Fahrenthold November 8 at 8:30 PM Follow @mateagold Follow @Fahrenthold As the polls closed Tuesday, anxious Americans awaited an indication of who would prevail at the end of a historically bitter presidential contest -- whether Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would hold on to her narrow pre-election lead or Republican Donald Trump would secure a stunning upset. By 8 p.m. Eastern time, voting had ended in more than two dozen states that together represent 272 electoral votes. Clinton was quickly projected to win the District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and Vermont, giving her 44 electoral votes, according to the Associated Press. Trump locked down Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia, racking up 60 electoral votes. Voting also ended in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- pivotal states that were too close to immediately call. View Graphic Clinton is hoping to outperform President Obama in Virginia\u2019s northern suburbs outside Washington, D.C., where a growing immigrant population has helped Democrats expand their hold. Obama won Virginia by 6.3 percent in 2008 and 3.9 percent in 2012 -- the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to prevail twice in the state. [ Live updates on the presidential race and other contests ] Both candidates have fiercely contested North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes, considered one of the pivotal states that Trump needs for victory. In 2008, Barack Obama narrowly edged out GOP nominee John McCain in North Carolina, but Mitt Romney wrested it back for the Republicans in the 2012 race. Trump has also been banking on winning Ohio and its 18 electoral votes. The bellwether state has backing the losing presidential candidate only once since 1944. The GOP nominee appealed directly to the sense of economic grievance in the Buckeye State, which has been buffeted by a declining manufacturing industry. During the day on Tuesday, there were reports of long lines at some polling places, and scattered reports of intimidation by people outside. The loudest complaints came from Trump\u2019s campaign. In Nevada, it filed a lawsuit arguing that polls were improperly kept open late during early voting in Clark County, home of Las Vegas. The county said it was following the law, by allowing those who were in line at the time polls closed to continue and vote. A judge in the case seemed skeptical of the Trump campaign\u2019s claims, and denied its request to preserve evidence in the case. How the electoral college works View Graphic How the electoral college works In a possibly worrisome sign for the GOP, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd about 6:15 p.m. that Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t have the full support of the Republican infrastructure.\u201d Trump was monitoring the returns early Tuesday evening from his apartment in Trump Tower, according to former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. The GOP nominee, he said in an interview, was \u201cwatching everything even though I\u2019m telling him not to.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s calm. We\u2019re all cautiously optimistic,\u201d Giuliani said when asked to describe the mood within Trump\u2019s home. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be very, very close. We know there is a populism across the country that\u2019s powerful and he has been lifted by it.\u201d Earlier Tuesday, Trump himself tweeted out what he said was a CNN headline: \u201cUtah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.\u201d CNN reporters quickly replied that Trump\u2019s message contained a key typo: the problems in Utah had been reported across a county, not the entire United States. Washington County \u2014 in the southwest corner of the state \u2014 had experienced some problems with voting machines on Tuesday morning. They used paper ballots in the meantime, and had the problem with the machines fixed by noon. [ Voters encounter machine breakdowns, describe intimidation at the polls ] As of early evening on the East Coast, preliminary exit polls reflected one of the dominant themes of the campaign: the deep unpopularity of both candidates. Majorities of voters in early exit polling said they have an unfavorable view of Trump and Clinton, with Trump\u2019s negatives somewhat higher. Indeed, at the end of a bitter, sharply personal campaign, some voters were eschewing both contenders. That included former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush, who did not cast a ballot for either major-party presidential nominee this year. \u201cThey didn\u2019t vote for Hillary; they didn\u2019t vote for Trump,\u201d spokesman Freddy Ford wrote in an email to The Texas Tribune. Preliminary exit polls indicated that turnout shares among Republicans, Democrats and independents would be comparable to 2012. Democrats had a narrow advantage at the polls in the past two Obama elections, edging Republicans by roughly six percentage points. [ These races will determine whether Republicans hold their Senate majority ] Leaders of both parties braced for election results that will be shaped by the nation\u2019s changing demographics as well as an unconventional presidential race. Democrats expressed confidence that increased voting by Hispanics as well as strong participation by African Americans, Asian Americans and young voters would provide Hillary Clinton with the margin of victory in several states. Republicans, however, said Donald Trump\u2019s appeal among working class whites would allow him to wrest the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt away from her. Early voting totals are up in seven of 10 key swing states, most of all in Florida, where it rose 36 percent over 2012. Much of that rise was driven by Latinos in counties such as Miami-Dade and Broward, which helps account for why Democrats have an 88,000-vote edge in the state\u2019s early voting count. In North Carolina, early voting increased 17 percent compared to four years ago, with an 86 percent increase among Hispanics and a 74 percent increase among Asian-Americans. Republican National Committee officials said in a phone call with reporters Tuesday that they were not concerned that high levels of Latino turnout in Florida boded badly for their candidates, saying the party had made large gains in voter registration in the state. They noted that in Ohio, counties such as Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton that supported President Obama in 2012 saw a drop in early voting, while counties such as Warren, Miami and Greene that backed Mitt Romney saw an increase. \u201cWe feel very confident about winning today,\u201d said Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser. But Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who heads the think tank NDN, said Republicans and many political pundits have failed to grasp \u201chow much the U.S. population is changing.\u201d He noted the number of eligible Hispanic voters has increased from 18 million to 27 million since 2008, and the number of millennial voters has risen from 35 million to 70 million during that period. Since those two voting blocs currently favor Democrats, Rosenberg said, the change poses \u201can existential threat\u201d to Republicans \u201cif they do not start to create a solution to these demographic trend lines.\u201d Longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie said in an interview he was not worried about these population shifts because the GOP could prevail if it appealed to African Americans and Hispanics on issues such as school choice, opposition to abortion and criminal justice reform. \u201cThe Republican establishment has not been focused on issues that appeal to the minorities,\u201d Viguerie said, adding the party would shift right after the election. \u201cBasically, the establishment Republicans have self-destructed. They have written themselves out of leadership going forward.\u201d In a sign of how Democrats are courting African Americans, for example, Michelle Obama taped 15 separate radio shows Tuesday, most of which primarily reach black audiences. Two of the ones she did \u2014 the \u201cWillie Moore Jr. Show\u201d and \u201cThe Tom Joyner Show\u201d--were ones that the president called into last week. On Tuesday, Obama taped six radio interviews from the White House, talking to hosts whose listeners live in Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. He also walked through the White House colonnade and pointed at the cameras held by members of the White House press corps. \u201cGo vote,\u201d he instructed their viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d As Americans cast their votes Tuesday, the nation\u2019s demographic schisms were visible. In Manassas, Va., where there is both a sizable immigrant population and support for Trump, James Bowers, 72, said working-class Americans like himself have seen their personal liberties erode with a Democrat in the White House. \u201cThese eight years are the worst eight years I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a dictatorship, and if Hillary wins, she\u2019ll continue that dictatorship.\u201d But 43-year-old Yesenia Luna, the daughter of an immigrant from El Salvador, said she voted for Clinton because \u201cwe have to be the difference for all the other Latinos in this country.\u201d Some voters said they hoped that the election could change a dynamic that has frustrated Americans from both parties. Steve Glanz, 42, was registered Republican and had supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania\u2019s April primary. But once inside his south Philadelphia polling place, he voted for Clinton and for the Democrats\u2019 Senate challenger, Katie McGinty. \u201cI voted basically straight Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get some Supreme Court justices confirmed at some point. Having the Senate belong to the same party as the president would help that. If they keep letting the justices die off, once it\u2019s under five members, they can\u2019t even render decisions.\u201d But many Republicans still expect their party to continue to probe Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and possible conflicts of interest raised by her role at the Clinton Foundation, which could complicate her relationship with Congress if she wins the White House. Lori Schwabenbauer, 54, voted in Chester County, Pa., then drove into Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday. She is a Republican, and Trump and Sen. Pat Toomey received her vote, but she was expecting a Clinton win. Asked whether she would want Republicans to continue probing Clinton\u2019s scandals if she won, Schwabenbauer gave a qualified yes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s above the law,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want her to be jailed just because I don\u2019t like her.\u201d And Trump, who was joined by his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka as he voted a few blocks from Trump Tower, refused to say for certain Tuesday whether he would concede the race if TV networks and others call it for Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d said Trump, who was booed by some voters as he entered Manhattan\u2019s P.S. 59. He added the early returns were \u201cvery good.\u201d But on Tuesday afternoon Trump called into the Fox News Channel for the second time of the day, and complained about the nation\u2019s political and media establishment. \u201cIt\u2019s largely a rigged system,\u201d he said. RNC officials noted that they had increased get-out-the-vote operation nationwide, having deployed 5,250 paid organizers and 2,350 trained fellows around the country. That represents a massive increase over the 876 staffers that the party and then-nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign jointly had in 2012. Clinton campaign spokeswoman Lily Adams, meanwhile, emailed reporters to say that \u201cmore than 10,000 volunteers were on the doors for our first 8AM shift in battleground states with thousands more on the phones.\u201d By early afternoon Tuesday, voters across the country were making their choices, with long lines in many polling stations. In North Hollywood, Calif., some voters brought beach chairs to stake out a place in line before dawn. At one polling station in Detroit, people waited up to 90 minutes to reach the ballot booth. At Stonewall Middle School in Manassas, nearly 170 people were lined up when voting began at 6 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m a determined voter,\u201d said 37-year-old Michael Barnes, an account executive for Freddie Mac who showed up at 5 a.m. and backed a straight Democratic ticket. \u201cI\u2019m feeling relieved that I\u2019ve at least done my part.\u201d [ Clinton holds edge in swing state Virginia ] For Laurie Jarman, an office manager in Fairfax County, it was antipathy for Clinton that drove her vote. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I trust him, either, but I feel that Hillary will be worse,\u201d said Jarman, 46, who arrived at Stonewall Middle School about half-an-hour after Barnes. After voting in Richmond, Clinton\u2019s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said that if he and Clinton were \u201cfortunate enough to win this evening,\u201d they would work to heal the deep rifts in the country that this year\u2019s race had exposed. \u201cIn the tone of the things that we say, in the team that we put together, and the policies that we promote, we have to show that we want to govern for all, not just those who voted for us,\u201d he said. Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, cast their ballots at Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary in Chappaqua, N.Y., at 8 a.m. Just four hours earlier, they had arrived from an early-morning rally in North Carolina. Clinton, who spent much of the rest of the day at home before heading to a Manhattan hotel to await returns, was greeted by chants of \u201cMadam President!\u201d as she walked outside. \u201cIt is the most humbling feeling because I know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country,\u201d she told reporters, when asked what it felt like to cast her ballot. Asked by a reporter if she thought about her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born in the year before women gained the right to vote and who died in 2011, Clinton responded with a smile: \u201cOh, I did.\u201d [ The evolving election map ] As the possibility of Clinton\u2019s victory drew near Tuesday, voters flocked to the Rochester, N.Y., grave site of suffragist Susan B. Anthony, who died in 1906 without getting the right to cast a vote. Mount Hope Cemetery officials extended its hours until 9 p.m. as people waited in long lines to paste \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers on her headstone, many of them emotional. Anne Gearan in White Plains, N.Y.; Sean Sullivan in New York; Scott Clement, Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin and Brian Murphy in Washington; David Weigel in Philadelphia; Laura Vozzella in Richmond; Antonio Olivo in Manassas, Va.; and Kelsey Snell in Janesville, Wis., contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

For the latest exit poll data from the ABC News Analysis Desk, be sure to bookmark and refresh this page. If you're using the ABC News mobile app, star this page so you can get back to it easily. You can also check out Exit Poll Results and Analysis from Key Battleground States This is preliminary data and can change \u2014 sometimes materially \u2014 as the evening progresses. Be sure to check back for the latest. We've received the first batch of exit poll data and are updating with analysis as we receive it. The Candidates' Attributes Much of the campaign focused on Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s personal qualities. Both reached record levels of unpopularity for presidential candidates, with sharp divisions on their fitness for office on items such as qualifications, temperament and honesty. In preliminary national exit poll results 54 percent of voters see Clinton unfavorably, and 61 percent say the same of Trump. Comparable numbers in 2012 were 46 for Barack Obama and 50 for Mitt Romney . Substantial numbers say both Clinton and Trump are not honest and trustworthy \u2014 59 percent in Clinton\u2019s case and 65 percent in Trump\u2019s. It\u2019s unprecedented even to ask this question in an exit poll. Clinton does better, Trump less well, on qualifications and temperament. Fifty-three percent of voters say she\u2019s qualified for office, and 56 percent say she has the right personality and temperament for the job. Those decline to 37 percent and 34 percent for Trump, respectively, in these preliminary exit poll results. The exit poll also asks which of four other candidate qualities are most important. In preliminary results, 38 percent say it\u2019s someone who can bring about needed change versus 22 percent who say it\u2019s experience and 22 percent who cite good judgment. Only 15 percent say it\u2019s \u201csomeone who cares about people like me.\u201d Among Clinton supporters, experience and judgment are most important, while among Trump supporters, it\u2019s nearly all about change. Fear Factor Trump incites greater fear than Clinton, especially among women: 43 percent of women say they\u2019d feel scared if Trump were elected, compared with 31 percent of men. Nearly twice as many women as men say they\u2019d feel excited by a Clinton win, 22 vs. 12 percent, respectively. And, 72 percent of Clinton supporters feel scared by a Trump presidency, 59 percent of Trump supporters are scared by a Clinton presidency. Right Track / Wrong Track When it comes to views on whether the country is headed in the right direction, just 31 percent of Clinton voters say the country is \"seriously off on the wrong track.\" Compare that to Trump voters -- a whopping 93 percent of whom say the country is on the wrong track. Shelby Lum/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP Voters line up in voting booths to cast their ballots at Robious Elementary School in Chesterfield, Virginia, Nov. 8, 2016. Trump's Treatment of Women and Clinton's Emails Trump\u2019s treatment of women and Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state have been highly controversial issues. In preliminary exit poll results, 51 percent of voters say Trump\u2019s treatment of women bothers them a lot, while fewer, 45 percent, say the same about the situation regarding Clinton\u2019s emails. (Note: Interviews representing as much as 40 percent of the national exit poll were conducted in advance of the FBI\u2019s announcement Sunday that it\u2019s renewed review found nothing to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.) Anxiety and Dislike Given their unpopularity, Clinton and Trump alike are seeing lukewarm support \u2014 including many voters who chiefly oppose their opponent rather than supporting them. This is especially so in Trump\u2019s case, and far different from what we saw in 2012, when 70 percent of Obama\u2019s voters strongly supported him, as did 60 percent of Romney\u2019s, compared with only 10 percent who voted against their candidate\u2019s opponent. Many voters express concern about a Clinton or Trump presidency, and excitement is subdued. Seventeen percent are excited about the prospect of a Clinton presidency, while 29 percent are downright scared about it. On the flip side, just 13 percent are excited about a possible Trump presidency in preliminary exit poll results; 37 percent, scared of it. The divisions are profound. Among Clinton supporters, 72 percent are scared of Trump in office; among Trump voters, 60 percent are scared of what Clinton would do. Previous positive and negative anticipation peaked in 2008, when 37 percent of voters were excited about an Obama presidency and 33 percent were scared about McCain. When Voters Made Their Decisions When did voters make their decision? Despite the frantic finish and a series of major events near the end of the race, 75 percent of voters say they decided on their vote more than a month ago. Still, 24 percent of voters say they made their choice in the last month. They\u2019ll both be important groups to watch as the night goes on. State of the Country Whatever their divisions, many voters share a sense of frustration with the political situation. Sixty-one percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results say the country\u2019s on the wrong track. That\u2019s similar to its level in 2012 when Barack Obama won re-election and down from 75 percent in 2008 at the peak of the economic crisis, but well above its level from 1996 to 2004. Sixty-nine percent are dissatisfied with the way the government is working, including 23 percent who are angry about it \u2014 a sentiment especially prevalent among Trump voters. And 49 percent say the government\u2019s doing too many things best left to individuals and business, similar to most previous elections. Clinton and Trump voters are vastly different on these measures, with Clinton\u2019s much more positive and Trump\u2019s much more negative. For example, 92 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters feel the country\u2019s on the wrong track and 88 percent are dissatisfied with the how the government\u2019s working, or angry about it. On the Economy The state of the economy relates to these sentiments. Eight years on from the Great Recession, 62 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results still rate the economy negatively \u2014 \u201cnot good\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d Still, that\u2019s well down from 76 percent in 2012 and a vast 93 percent in 2008. Thirty percent say their family\u2019s financial situation has improved in the last four years, but about as many, 27 percent, say it has gotten worse. (The rest say it\u2019s about the same.) It\u2019s the first time \u201cbetter\u201d has outnumbered \u201cworse\u201d on this question since 2004 and the lowest \u201cgetting worse\u201d result since 2000. Expectations, though still not great, are better than they\u2019ve been: In preliminary results, 37 percent of voters think the next generation will be worse off, but 33 percent think it will be better off, again the least negative differential since 2000. Again pessimism is far higher among Trump supporters. Amber Arnold/Wisconsin State Journal/AP Photo Voters cast their ballots at the Wil-Mar Neighborhood Center on the Near East Side of Madison, Wis., Nov. 8, 2016. Integrity of the Vote Just 28 percent of Trump voters say they\u2019re very confident their votes will be counted accurately versus 68 percent of Clinton voters. There was no partisan gap on this question when it was asked in the 2008 exit poll, and the division this year is bigger even than the one between Kerry and Bush voters in 2004, after the contentious 2000 election. On the Issues Preliminary exit poll results indicate that the economy/jobs is the top issue for voters (52 percent), followed by terrorism (18 percent), foreign policy (13 percent) and immigration (12 percent). There\u2019s a big difference, though by candidate support, with Clinton\u2019s supporters relatively more focused on the economy and foreign policy, Trump\u2019s on terrorism and immigration. Voters split roughly evenly on whom they trust more to handle the economy (46 percent say Clinton versus 48 percent who pick Trump), while Clinton has a clear advantage on foreign policy (53 percent versus 42 percent) and a slimmer one on serving as commander in chief (49 percent of versus 46 percent). Immigration Many more voters say undocumented immigrants should be given a path to citizenship or be deported (71 percent versus 25 percent). And more oppose rather than support one of Trump\u2019s signature policies, building a wall along Mexican border (54 percent versus 40 percent) in preliminary exit poll results. Not surprisingly, Clinton and Trump voters differ widely on these immigration policy issues. Also, 9 percent of voters were not born in the United States \u2014 a group to watch in later results. The Obama Factor Fifty-four percent of voters approve of the job Obama is doing as president, 34 percent strongly so in preliminary exit poll results. That may help Clinton, but it\u2019s no guarantee: In 2000, a robust 57 percent approved of Bill Clinton\u2019s job performance when Al Gore tried unsuccessfully to follow him. Slightly more voters think the next president should continue Obama\u2019s policies (29 percent) or change to more liberal ones (18 percent). Forty-six percent say the next president\u2019s policies should be more conservative that Obama\u2019s. Turnout Turnout among key groups is critical. ABC News/Washington Post pre-election polls indicated that, apart from partisanship and ideology, Clinton\u2019s success is dependent on turnout among women, college-educated whites (especially college-educated white women), nonwhites and young voters. Trump needs turnout from men, whites overall, non-college-educated whites (especially non-college-educated white men) and evangelical white Christians. Turnout and vote margins among these groups will be worth watching tonight. Early turnout across partisan lines looks quite similar to 2012, 37 percent Democrats, 32 percent Republicans. On race, whites could be slightly down \u2014 70 percent in preliminary exit poll results, 30 percent nonwhite, including 12 percent black and 11 percent Hispanic. Women outnumber men in 2016 early results, as they have since 1984. If the gender gap that was evident in pre-election polling holds tonight, it\u2019ll be an advantage for Clinton. Early exit poll results show a record level of turnout among college-educated voters, 50 percent versus 50 percent non-college-educated voters. Again, these are early results, but it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on and would be another Clinton advantage if it holds. College-educated white women outnumber non-college-educated white women (20 percent versus 17 percent), which would be a first in exit polls. College-educated white women are by far Clinton\u2019s strongest group among whites. There\u2019s no indication in early results of increased turnout among non-college whites, Trump\u2019s core group. White evangelical Christians make up 27 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results, similar to 2012, and a very strong group for Trump in pre-election polling.

Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Downtown resident James Evans, 59, cast his ballot at the polling place inside the Midnight Mission on skid row. Downtown resident James Evans, 59, cast his ballot at the polling place inside the Midnight Mission on skid row. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Gale Holland Contact Reporter Prodded\u00a0by a registration campaign, phone banking\u00a0and\u00a0a ballot measure to fund homeless housing, skid\u00a0row voters hobbled out of their tents and welfare hotels in force Tuesday, lining up at times to cast ballots at\u00a0four polling stations in the 50-block district.\u00a0 \u201cPride most of all,\u201d said skid row activist Wendell Blassingame, explaining what he described as an unusually large voter\u00a0turnout in the impoverished neighborhood. Some voters such as Phillip Evans, 60, who lives in the street and said he sleeps mainly on buses, were casting their first-ever ballots. \u201cI got talked into it,\u201d he explained as he shuffled\u00a0into a\u00a0polling station at Los Angeles Mission, leaning heavily on his pushcart for balance. \u201cAll I know is I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d\u00a0 Measure HHH,\u00a0a $1.2-billion bond measure to build housing for the city of L.A.\u2019s 28,000 homeless people, was a big\u00a0draw,\u00a0Blassingame said, and would address what he described as a worsening problem. Gesturing at a cardboard\u00a0encampment\u00a0across from the Los Angeles Mission, he said, \u201cLook at that. They don\u2019t even have blankets; they\u2019re using boxes to stay warm.\u201d \u201cI need help, and my brother here needs help,\u201d said James Evans\u00a0as he and friend David Chavarria sat\u00a0outside the Midnight Mission in wheelchairs, resting after Evans voted. Evans, 59, a former Manual Arts High School and Long Beach State athlete, said he was paying for his sports career, recovering from a hip replacement. Chavarria, 52, said he has cirrhosis of the liver, which recently landed him in Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center in a coma. Chavarria, whose stomach was scarred by old stitches from a gaping\u00a0wound repair, had spent a sleepless night in the cold and kept nodding off during the conversation. \u201cWe have to get all these people off the streets,\u201d\u00a0said Kennedy Maxwell, 58, a formerly homeless man who now works as a City of Commerce landscaper and\u00a0voted yes on HHH. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic.\u201d Skid row is home to more than 10,000 people in various stages of sobriety and employment, united only by their poverty. Perhaps counterintuitively, several skid row residents said they turned out to vote the homeless housing initiative down. Tina Larrimore, 51, said she believes\u00a0homeless people aren\u2019t using the resources that are already available. \u201cThey\u2019ve been here forever,\u201d she said of the homeless population. Tyrone Taylor, a skid row activist known to many as \u201cDa Mayor,\u201d said he didn\u2019t vote on the\u00a0measure because he didn\u2019t understand it. \u201cI\u2019m 67 years old and I\u2019m just now learning how to vote,\u201d said Taylor, a laid-off Pittsburgh steelworker who spent 20 years homeless before his grown daughter found him in the streets of skid row. \u201cNow I\u2019m glad to be part\u00a0of society and make my voice heard.\u201d Lebertis Nickolson, 48, agreed it will be tough to get someone who spent 20 or 30 years in the streets\u00a0to take on the responsibility of an apartment, even a heavily subsidized one with supportive services, as the city measure is\u00a0designed to build. But everybody needs to be \u201cgiven an opportunity to do right,\u201d Nickolson said, adding that he had benefited from one of the neighborhood\u2019s many recovery programs.\u00a0 Blassingame, who dispenses social service and job referrals daily from a card table in skid row\u2019s San Julian Park, said\u00a0other cities and states continue to bus their homeless people to skid row. One recent arrival was so mentally debilitated he couldn\u2019t say which state he came from, Blassingame said. \u00a0 The handful of skid row voters informally polled were unanimous on\u00a0their\u00a0one-word choice for president: Hillary. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Hillary will be understanding of people that\u2019s minorities,\u201d Evans said.\u00a0 Larrimore, who works as a caretaker but can\u2019t afford to move off skid row,\u00a0said she had high hopes Hillary Clinton would help single working women like her.\u00a0 There was no love for Donald Trump among the voters.\u00a0 \u201cDown here we know unstable, and Trump is one of us,\u201d Blassingame said. \u201cHe\u2019s not stable at all.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss A security headache with both candidates in New York , Mexico fears the prospect of a Trump victory , FBI director James Comey could be in hot water \u00a0no matter who wins, and what's motivating Californians \u00a0to vote.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss A security headache with both candidates in New York , Mexico fears the prospect of a Trump victory , FBI director James Comey could be in hot water \u00a0no matter who wins, and what's motivating Californians \u00a0to vote.\u00a0 Caption In the race to 270, Clinton is projected to win with 352 electoral votes.

Scott's wounds \"seemed to be in the back and side and didn't seem to be correct,\" Almon Brown testified during the murder trial of Michael Slager. Brown, who was an investigator for the State Law Enforcement Division at the time, testified that when he arrived at the scene of the April 2015 shooting, he was briefed that it happened during a confrontation between Scott and Slager, a former North Charleston patrolman.

Scott was shot as he fled a traffic stop after being pulled over for having a broken taillight on his car. A video made by a bystander showing Slager shooting Scott in the back stunned the nation. Brown was called as the prosecution presented witnesses for a fourth day in the trial. Photos he took at the crime scene, including a photo of Scott's body, were introduced and shown to the jury. Former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager sits at the defense table during testimony in Slager's murder trial, Tuesday Nov. 8, 2016, in Charleston, South Carolina. Grace Beahm/Pool / Getty Images Related: Walter Scott's Mom Collapses During Cop's Murder Trial Brown was one of three crime-scene investigators who testified Tuesday. Also testifying was former North Charleston Police Department investigator Scott Wyant, who said he didn't do a complete investigation at the scene because state investigators handle shootings involving police officers. Wyant served more than 20 years with the department. He said on cross-examination that he was told by his superiors in the department not to do a trace-evidence investigation on Slager looking for such things as gunpowder residue. Wyant said he had expressed his concern that doing so would be a conflict of interest. Defense attorney Andy Savage has long questioned the adequacy of law enforcement's investigation and at one point last year filed a motion asking the court to look into what he contended was the state's destruction of evidence.

Stickers given to early voters in San Francisco. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Think you\u2019re voting to make the world a better place? That may be so, but researchers have also found a less noble driver of voter participation. Shame, or specifically the fear of it. Studies have shown that up to half of nonvoters lie when asked if they cast a ballot. In a new academic paper , behavioral economists from U.C. Berkeley, the University of Chicago and Harvard sought to measure the amount of shame that nonvoters experience. To figure it out, they went to a Chicago suburb after a 2010 congressional election and surveyed both voters and nonvoters. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Using financial incentives and election turnout data, they were able to measure how painful it was for people who did not vote to acknowledge it. \u201cThe results document substantial shame from admitting to not voting, though little evidence of pride from conversely claiming to vote,\u201d according to the study. For campaigns, that suggests it may be fruitful to drop hints to potential supporters, for example, that Grandma may be inquiring later about their vote. Stefano DellaVigna , a professor of economics at U.C. Berkeley and one of the study\u2019s authors, said the reasons people vote are myriad, not least among them a desire to be counted. But concerns over social standing play a crucial part. If deployed to your side\u2019s advantage, Professor DellaVigna said, \u201cthat might flip it in close elections.\u201d California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

In some places lines will form that will take a very long time. What happens if you're on line and the polls close? Patrick Jones (@Patrick_E_Jones) has the answer. Buzz60 The lines to vote may be long and the polls may close soon, but people on Twitter are encouraging voters\u00a0to #StayInLine. The hashtag #StayInLine began trending nationwide on Twitter, as people encouraged those experiencing long wait times to stay strong even if the polls are about to close. \u2014 Pet Wisdom for Life (@SDWisdom) November 9, 2016 But can people vote if the polls are closed? \u00a0Voters that are in line when the polls close will still be\u00a0able to cast their votes, Edward B. Foley, Director of the Election Law at Ohio State University's Mortiz College of Law, said in a Medium post.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s one of the most basic principles of electoral democracy: if you go to the polls when they are open, and you are a registered and qualified voter, then as long as you wait in line, you are entitled to cast your ballot even if the line is so long that you must wait until after the scheduled time for the polls to close,\"\u00a0Foley said. If you are in line BEFORE the polls close, you will be able to vote. Be sure to #StayInLine ! #ElectionDay #ImWithHer pic.twitter.com/EhJg25uPfm \u2014 Girls Really Rule.

He noted that long lines are nothing compared to what others endured for the right to vote. Precincts in Georgia close at 7pm. Remember, as long as you are in line by 7pm, you are guaranteed your right to vote. #StayInLine \u2014 John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) November 8, 2016 During another period, people waited in immovable lines, faced billy clubs and cattle prods, just to register to vote. #StayInLine \u2014 John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) November 8, 2016 If anyone tries to keep you from voting or tells you to leave, you can call 1-866-OUR-VOTE\u00a0or file a complaint with the United States Department of Justice here.\u00a0 Posted!

Latinos make up 39% of the population in California\u00a0and\u00a0are the largest\u00a0ethnic group in the state. At the polls, however, they are typically underrepresented compared with other minority groups. A study by UC Davis' California Civic Engagement Project\u00a0 found \u00a0that about 20% of voters in the state\u2019s primary election this year were Latino. That was\u00a0the highest proportion of Latino voters in a California primary\u00a0in the last decade.

Hillary Clinton will watch the election results from a suite at the Peninsula hotel in Manhattan, where she arrived earlier this evening. She is joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea and son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky. While at the hotel, the Democratic presidential nominee will also spend time going over her speech for the evening. There are two versions -- one if she wins, another if she loses. Later in the night, Clinton will head to her election night party at the Javits Center, also in Manhattan. It is there, under the convention center's actual glass ceiling, that she hopes to break \"the highest, hardest glass ceiling.\" Meanwhile, her rival, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , will watch the returns from Trump Tower a block away from the Peninsula hotel before he heads to the nearby Hilton in midtown for his election night party. How Donald Trump Is Spending Election Night Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine , will watch the results come in at the Intercontinental hotel before joining Clinton at the Javits Center. He is joined by his wife Anne, his daughter, his parents and a brother. The election night party concludes a long day for both nominees. Clinton cast her vote at around 8:00 a.m. in her home of Chappaqua, New York, while Kaine arrived at his polling place in Richmond, Virginia, shortly before 6:00 a.m. ABC News' Josh Haskell, Jessica Hopper, and Liz Kreutz contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

CBS News projects Donald Trump wins in Indiana and Kentucky, and Hillary Clinton wins in Vermont. Georgia edges Trump and South Carolina leans toward Trump. 6:40 p.m. ET\u00a0No one ever said democracy was cheap. Americans who are running for federal elective offices\u00a0 spent more than ever \u00a0-- about $6.8 billion -- in that pursuit, including the nastiest presidential election in recent memory, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. That\u2019s more than what consumers spend on cereal ($6 billion), pet grooming ($5.4 billion) and legal marijuana ($5.4 billion). The nonprofit\u00a0 Center for Responsive Politics \u00a0estimates spending on the Clinton-Trump contest at more than $2.65 billion, actually down a bit from $2.76 billion in 2012 when Democratic incumbent Barack Obama defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney. \u00a0 --CBS News\u2019 Jonathan Berr 6:21 p.m. ET\u00a0Ohio Governor and former presidential candidate John Kasich is wasting no time after Election Day -- he plans to deliver a speech on his vision for the future of the GOP just two days after voters cast their ballots, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported Tuesday.\u00a0 Kasich refused to back Trump\u2019s candidacy and did not attend the Republican convention, though it was held in Cleveland. The Enquirer reported that Kasich is likely to give the speech even if Trump wins.\u00a0 Kasich voted for John McCain , who was the GOP nominee in 2008. 6:06 p.m. ET Here are more findings from the national early exit polls and how voters feel about several top issues: Seventy-one percent of voters say that illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 25 percent say they should be deported. Almost 9 in 10 Clinton voters want illegal immigrants offered a chance to apply for legal status, while Trump voters are split with 49 percent supporting legal status and 45 percent saying they should be deported.\u00a0 There is more division over building a wall along the border with Mexico: \u00a054 percent of voters oppose the wall and 40 percent support it. Eighty-eight percent of Clinton voters oppose building a wall, while three quarters of Trump voters support it.\u00a0 Voters also have very different views on the effects of international trade on U.S. jobs: 41 percent of voters say that trade takes away jobs, 39 percent say that it creates more U.S. jobs, and 11 percent say that it has no effect. Clinton voters are more likely to believe that trade creates jobs while Trump voters say that it takes away U.S. jobs.\u00a0 --CBS News poll analyst Stanley Feldman 5:30 p.m. ET Some early state-level exit polling is coming in as well.\u00a0 In Georgia, Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia the majority of voters said the most important issue facing the country was the economy. \u00a0When voters were asked, finding a president who can bring needed change is the most important quality when deciding their vote for president. Here, for example, is a breakdown of voters\u2019 most important candidate qualities in Ohio: CBS News More Ohio voters, 46 percent, think trade with other countries takes away jobs. The majority of Florida voters (70 percent) believe that illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Over half (59 percent) say that immigrants in the U.S. do more to help the country than hurt the county. Almost half of New Hampshire (46 percent) and Pennsylvania (42 percent) voters are dissatisfied with the federal government. \u00a0 Two-thirds of Virginia voters say that the American economic system favors the wealthy. --CBS News poll analyst Melissa Herrmann 5:15 p.m. ET The first round of early exit polls are in. Here are a few highlights:\u00a0 Voters nationally said they were looking for a candidate who can bring needed change, followed by experience and judgment. Asked about the most important candidate quality they were looking for, 38 percent said change, 22 percent said someone who has the \u201cright experience,\u201d 22 percent \u00a0named \u201cgood judgment\u201d and 15 percent said they were looking for someone who \u201ccares about people.\u201d Most voters, 61 percent, say the country is on the wrong track (and 35 percent say it\u2019s headed in the right direction). The percentage of \u201cwrong track\u201d voters is up from 2012, when 52 percent said the country is on the wrong track, but is lower than 2008, when 75 percent said the country is on the wrong track. In addition, 69 percent say they are dissatisfied or angry about the way the federal government is working. The economy was by far the top issue among voters this fall. Asked to name their most important issue, 52 percent named the economy; 18 percent said terrorism, 13 percent said foreign policy and 12 percent said immigration. --CBS News\u2019 Emily Schultheis 5:02 p.m. ET\u00a0Continuing on his theme of predicting a \u201crigged\u201d election, Trump has tweeted alleging voting machine problems in Utah -- a state in which he\u2019s getting a strong challenge from independent candidate Evan McMullin. In the tweet, Trump cites a CNN report on voting irregularities in Utah, which appears to be from this blog : Just out according to @CNN : \"Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016 4:43 p.m.\u00a0ET\u00a0It\u2019s no secret that many major Republican Party figures have not endorsed Trump -- and this afternoon, two of them declined to vote for Trump when they went to the polls. A spokesman for former President George W. Bush said Tuesday that Bush did not vote for either Trump or Clinton. The spokesman, Freddy Ford, told CBS News that Bush and his wife Laura \u201cleft the top box blank and voted Republican downballot.\u201d The Bushes voted early, casting their ballots two weeks ago. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), one of Trump\u2019s former GOP primary opponents who has been critical of the Republican nominee in the months since, tweeted that he voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin: I voted @Evan_McMullin for President. I appreciate his views on a strong America and the need to rebuild our military. #3 \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 8, 2016 4:23 p.m. ET GOP nominee Donald Trump tweeted about his election night plans: I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016 2:53 p.m. ET\u00a0 In the Nevada complaint on early voting , Trump\u2019s campaign asks that the court isolate ballots that were cast at the time and location in question at four locations: Cardenas Market, Deer Springs Town Center, Silverado Ranch Plaza, and the Las Vegas Strip.\u00a0 But Trump lawyers also went beyond that, asking for the names of pollsters and data from machines.\u00a0 At the 2 p.m. emergency hearing, the judge seemed skeptical of the lawyers\u2019 request, saying it will likely run into serious privacy concerns. The judge seemed particularly bothered by the request to sequester ballots from a location \u2013 to match them up with specific people \u2013 and said that there is no way to do that. The judge eventually denied the Trump campaign\u2019s petition to isolate ballots that were allegedly cast after polls closed, suggesting the team pursue other administrative remedies first. --CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid ",

    "text": "CBSN Originals explores the rapidly changing landscape of legal marijuana, traveling to five states and Canada to interview key figures on all si... Three more states -- Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota -- were deciding whether to permit marijuana for medical purposes. Montana voted on whether to ease restrictions on an existing medical marijuana law.\u00a0 Florida voters approved a state constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana, which will broaden access to pot beyond the limited therapeutic uses approved by the legislature two years ago. North Dakota voters also approved legalizing medical marijuana.\u00a0 State-by-state polls showed most of the measures with a good chance of prevailing. But staunch opponents that included law enforcement groups and anti-drug crusaders urged the public to reject any changes. They complained that legalization would endanger children and open the door to creation of another huge industry that, like big tobacco, would be devoted to selling Americans an unhealthy drug. If \u201cyes\u201d votes prevail across the board, more than 23 percent of the U.S. population will live in states where recreational pot is legal. The jurisdictions where that\u2019s already the case -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and the District of Columbia -- have less than 6 percent of the population. Check back here for live updates on each state with recreational marijuana on the ballot:\u00a0 CALIFORNIA: APPROVED California voters approved a ballot measure Tuesday allowing recreational marijuana in the nation\u2019s most populous state, handing the legalization movement its biggest victory yet.\u00a0 Voters in nine states considered proposals to expand legal access to the drug, which is still forbidden by the federal government. California was the first state to approve medical marijuana two decades ago. It was among five states weighing whether to permit pot for adults for recreational purposes.\u00a0 California\u2019s vote means recreational cannabis will be legal along the entire West Coast, giving the legalization movement powerful momentum. That could spark similar efforts in other states and put pressure on federal authorities to ease longstanding rules that classify marijuana as a dangerously addictive drug with no medical benefits. MAINE: \u00a0Both Massachusetts and Maine previously voted to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana and to authorize medical marijuana programs. The initiatives in Massachusetts and Maine would regulate and tax marijuana in ways similar to alcohol. But there are differences in the way the two New England states would proceed under the respective measures. In Maine, recreational marijuana would be regulated by the existing state Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Maine would allow people 21 years of age or older to possess up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana and cultivate up to six pot plants in their homes. Massachusetts would allow an individual 21 or older to possess 1 ounce of pot outside their home and up to 10 ounces inside their homes, and to cultivate up to six plants for personal use. Maine\u2019s proposal calls for a flat 10 percent sales tax on retail marijuana. MASSACHUSETTS: APPROVED Voters have approved a ballot measure making Massachusetts the first state in the eastern U.S. to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. In Massachusetts, the licensing authority for recreational marijuana would be a new three-member Cannabis Control Commission, appointed by the state treasurer. The commission would be advised by a Cannabis Advisory Board with 15 members appointed by the governor. The Massachusetts proposal calls for a 3.75 percent surcharge on retail sales of marijuana, on top of the state\u2019s regular 6.25 percent sales tax. Local jurisdictions could also add up a 2 percent tax, creating a combined maximum tax of 12 percent on pot products. ARIZONA:\u00a0In Arizona, the issue of marijuana legalization has evoked uncertainty about how legalization might affect the flow of smuggled illegal drugs across the border with Mexico. NEVADA:\u00a0The law would allow possession and use by adults of up to an ounce of marijuana and impose a 15 percent excise tax on marijuana sales, with revenue earmarked for education. Businesses that have medical marijuana certification would be the first to be eligible for licenses.\u00a0 Proponents say legalizing pot could generate $20 million a year in tax money for Nevada schools. Opponents, including Republican U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, billionaire casino magnate and newspaper owner Sheldon Adelson and many of the state\u2019s top elected Republicans call legalization a threat to Nevada children. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY NETWORK The craziest presidential campaign in modern history is coming to an end (hopefully) tonight! Will it be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump ? Who will win the Senate ? We will have all the latest right here as the votes are counted. In the meantime, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening so far: Buckle up and grab some caffeine ... Both Trump and Clinton picked up expected wins in a slew of states that have not been competitive in the polls. But neither has notched a key battleground state victory yet. The race remains too close to call in Florida, North Carolina,\u00a0Pennsylvania and Virginia, among others. \u00a0 Republicans win two key Senate races, Dem pickup in Illinois In Florida, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio\u00a0bested Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy to win re-election, projections show.\u00a0In Indiana, GOP Rep. Todd Young topped former Democratic\u00a0senator Evan Bayh to fill the seat vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats. Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth ousted Republican Sen. Mark Kirk in Illinois. Duckworth is a two-term congresswoman and\u00a0a veteran who lost both legs in Iraq. Kirk suffered a massive stroke in 2012, and a recent Illinois poll found more than half of voters did not believe he had recovered enough to perform his Senate duties. Thank you for making me the next senator from Illinois. This victory would not have been possible without your support. \u2014 Tammy Duckworth (@TammyforIL) November 9, 2016 Several more key Senate races have yet to be called, including\u00a0in Nevada, Missouri, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. Congratulations on the great victory, @marcorubio ! Florida is critical to keeping the Senate. \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 9, 2016 Breaking: Paul Ryan re-elected Well, not really that breaking. The House speaker was overwhelmingly expected to beat Democratic challenger\u00a0Ryan Solen in Wisconsin's first congressional district. And he and other Republicans are expected to retain majority control of the House of Representatives , but that call hasn't been made yet. W. votes none of the above George W. Bush left the presidential portion of his ballot blank, Carly Mallenbaum reports : \"A spokesperson for the Bush family,\u00a0Freddy Ford, told USA TODAY that the 43rd president\u00a0and\u00a0former First Lady\u00a0Laura Bush\u00a0voted 'None of the Above'\u00a0for President, and went Republican for the rest of the ballot.\" More on that here . Twitter | @realdonaldtrump Donald J. Trump on Twitter Outside Trump Tower, meanwhile, police asked a mariachi band to move along , saying they were creating a \"huge disturbance.\" One dead, several injured after shooting near polling place USA TODAY's Melanie Eversley has the latest: \"A gunman shot several people Tuesday in the Azusa community of Los Angeles County, killing one, scattering would-be voters, and forcing a lock-down of two polling sites. \"Up to five people may have been injured.\" The shooter was cornered in a standoff, according to police. Situation has transitioned from active to barricade/containment... All those near scene shelter in place all others stay out of the area \u2014 Azusa Police (@AzusaPD) November 9, 2016 A (mostly) burned out electorate While we wait for all of the official polls to close , here\u2019s what we know from an early survey of voters: They just want it to be finished already. A Morning Consult/Politico poll of voters found them feeling this way: \u2022 85% Just want it to be over \u2022\u00a072% Anxious \u2022\u00a029% Proud \u2022\u00a025% Happy They also found that 36% said they wanted a strong leader, while 29% said they favored a candidate with a vision for the future. Only 16% want someone who cares about them or shares their values. Not too burned out to tweet Twitter reports that 25 million tweets were sent about the election between midnight and 6 p.m. Eastern. See how America Tweeted about voting on #ElectionDay ahead of the polls closing pic.twitter.com/DDo10N9uOR \u2014 Twitter Government (@gov) November 8, 2016 Let them eat... \u2014 Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) November 9, 2016 After someone sent the\u00a0cake to Trump tower earlier, the Internet went crazy . \u00a0 Meanwhile, at the polls \u2026 Things got a bit, well, heated, in some polling spots. There were plenty of reports of long lines and voting snafus, which are typical of such large elections, as Richard Wolf and Kevin McCoy report . There were some scattered reports of skirmishes: FIGHT:  700 blk S. Saginaw St.  St. Pauls.  Fighting at the polls.  DELAYED POST. #Flint Trump supporter sprays Mace on voter as argument escalates In New York, two women staged a topless protest inside a polling place, one with \u201chate out of my polls\u201d written across her chest and the other with \u201cTrump grab your balls\" written on hers. The women, Tiffany Jordan Robson, 28, of Seattle,\u00a0and Neda Topaloski, 30, of Montreal, received summonses for electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. Trump booed The real estate mogul was greeted by jeers and boos outside his polling place.

    "text": "Election Day 2016: Voter turnout heavy as Chicagoans cite urgency to vote Election Day around the Chicago area on November 8, 2016. Jodi S. Cohen and Dawn Rhodes Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Bosnian immigrant Enver Agic didn't just go to the polls once on Tuesday. He made 11 trips to his polling site \u2014 taking with him nearly three dozen of his Bosnian neighbors so he could translate the ballot for those needing help and ensure their voices were heard. For four hours Tuesday morning, he rang their doorbells and then walked with them to the polling site in West Rogers Park. Agic, 48, who was wearing a shirt with an American flag that said, \"Keep Calm and Wave On,\" said he had never done that before. But he felt compelled to help Hillary Clinton get elected \u2014 particularly because of Donald Trump 's anti-immigrant comments. \"This time is very important. It is tight between Hillary and Trump. This is special, very special,\" said Agic, who became a U.S. citizen in 2001 after leaving his war-torn country in 1994. He said he has two sons, ages 9 and 14. \"Who will make a better future for my kids?\" Like Agic, many voters around the region said they felt an urgency to participate. Business was brisk at many polling places, with lines in the early morning and the expectation of more in the closing hours of balloting. For some voters, the choice was simple. Others talked about agonizing over the decision in recent weeks. Binyomin Weisswasser said he had a hard time deciding who to vote for, but ultimately chose Trump. \"This was not an easy election for me,\" said Weisswasser, 39, an ultra-Orthodox Jew who voted at the Croatian Cultural Center on Devon Avenue. Election Day 2016 People vote at O'Keeffe Elementary School on Election Day Nov. 8, 2016, in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 People vote at O'Keeffe Elementary School on Election Day Nov. 8, 2016, in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 See more videos \"We have seen our country take a downturn in the eyes of the world. We need to go in a different direction,\" he said. \"Trump's not a politician, and he has shown it in good ways and bad ways. ... I like that he is not always politically correct and speaks his mind. It gives me the feeling you know what you see is what you get. You may not like it, but you know what it is.\" In addition to choosing between presidential contenders Clinton and Trump, voters face choices for Illinois' junior U.S. Senate seat as well as contests that will determine control over the state legislature. The election, perhaps the most bitter and divisive in history, could end with the country electing its first female president. Dozens of voters, the majority of them African-American, poured into O'Keeffe Elementary School in the South Shore neighborhood during the first hour polls were open. Marilyn Hall, 60, did not say which candidate she voted for but acknowledged the potential for a momentous occasion.

Wow,\" she said, smiling. \"I wish her all the luck.\" No matter who prevailed, Hall said she would rely on her Christian faith to help guide the next leader. \"Somebody will become president today whether we like it or not,\" Hall said. \"I just hope they do a good job for all of us, not just some of us.\" Voting got off to a somewhat difficult start at O'Keeffe as election officials struggled to direct the stream of voters for four different precincts. Voters piled into one line that snaked through the school hallway without being told that there were different stations inside the gym designed to assist voters in specific precincts. \"They have no idea what's going on,\" one man said to a fellow voter. \"Everyone here at this table is new, and they don't know what they're doing.\" Those who finished casting their ballots took it upon themselves to help other frustrated voters and prevent them from making the same mistakes. By around 7 a.m., operations had smoothed out and lines moved along more quickly. At Lombard Village Hall, about 100 people waited in line to vote at 8 a.m. An election judge apologized to the people waiting. \"It's sort of good, though. We have more people waiting than we sometimes have voting for an entire day,\" he told the crowd. The statewide elections will serve as a referendum on voters' allegiances to either GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner or Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan . Millions of dollars have been spent on contests that will decide whether Democrats can keep their state House and Senate supermajorities or whether Rauner and the Republicans will gain more influence in the legislature. The Democrats' current majorities in Springfield \u2014 71-47 in the House and 39-20 in the Senate \u2014 have not been enough to overrule Rauner during a 16-month budget battle. Senate Republicans have no mathematical chance to get a majority in the Senate but hope to cut into the Democrats' edge. Further up the ballot, the race for the U.S. Senate seat pits Republican Mark Kirk, who is seeking a second term, against Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth . The race is among a handful that will determine which party controls the Senate next year. Polls have shown Duckworth has a comfortable lead. Many voters Tuesday said they were looking forward to the end of the 2016 election cycle, the nastiest in decades. Clinton, who grew up in suburban Park Ridge, is expected to pick up Illinois' 20 Electoral College votes. Illinois has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since 2000. In the Little Village neighborhood, Jazmin Moreno, 25, said she wasn't awed by either of her presidential choices, saying she really got into Bernie Sanders ' campaign during the primaries. Given two undesirable boxes to tick, she reluctantly leaned one way. \"I'd just rather it be Hillary than Trump,\" said Moreno, of Little Village, voting at Farragut Career Academy midmorning. \"I just don't think he'd be a good leader.\" Moreno said she hoped that a Clinton administration could involve Sanders, even informally, and bring some of his policy ideas to fruition. \"Maybe both of them could guide each other,\" Moreno said. Many voters said they were glad that the presidential campaign is over. \"We were given two horrible candidates,\" said Joanne Kennedy, of La Grange, who voted at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in La Grange with her husband, Mark. Both cast ballots for Trump. \"People are just voting against something,\" Joanne Kennedy said. \"I think society as a whole is this way. They're not voting for someone. They're voting to keep someone out.\" \"Trump is an idiot and Hillary's a crook. I think it's the least of two evils,\" Mark Kennedy said. Chicago Board of Elections officials said roughly 832,000 city voters had submitted ballots as of about 2 p.m. The voter turnout was on pace to rival the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. About 47 percent of those ballots were from early or mail-in voters, Allen said, and about 52 percent were from voters who visited polling sites on Election Day. Early voting in Chicago and suburban Cook County exceeded records. In Chicago, 325,112 voters cast early ballots through Monday, breaking the record of 260,378 votes cast in the 2008 presidential election , when President Barack Obama won his first term. In suburban Cook County, 321,495 voters had cast early ballots through Sunday, an increase from the previous record of 228,695 in the 2012 presidential election. There are more than 8 million registered voters in Illinois. Under a new state law, voters can register for the first time \u2014 or update their registration status \u2014 on Election Day. Voters arrived at a Wrigleyville polling site at 6 a.m. to find a line already snaking down the block, resembling the crowds that gathered a week ago to watch the Cubs in the World Series. The young voters were at Yak-Zies, a popular bar within sight of Wrigley Field. One election official wore a Cubs jersey while another used a flashlight to see ballots in the dark bar. Many voters wore Cubs hats, shirts and jackets and were recalling the long lines outside the bars during baseball season. \"It's nice to see the same crowds showing up for voting,\" said Katie Deplaris, 24. She said it felt odd to vote in a bar, though she welcomed the proximity to her home. \"It's almost like they knew we will need a drink after this one,\" she said about the historically bitter election. \"I can't wait for it to be over.\" Shannan Carlson brought her 3-year-old daughter to vote at Yak-Zies before going to work. She was surprised to see the long lines at 6 a.m. \"I thought I would be in and out, not 100-plus people waiting this early, she said. \"I've lived here 15 years and have never seen it like this. It makes me happy.\" Chicago Tribune's Annemarie Mannion contributed. ",

    "text": "Read the story Clinton asked voters to keep the White House in her party's hands for a third straight term. She cast herself as heir to President Barack Obama's legacy and pledged to make good on his unfinished agenda, including passing immigration legislation, tightening restrictions on guns and tweaking his signature health care law. \"I know how much responsibility goes with this,\" Clinton said after voting Tuesday at her local polling station in Chappaqua, New York, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at her side. \"So many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country, and I will do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today.\" Trump, the New York real estate developer who lives in a gold-plated Manhattan penthouse, forged a striking connection with white, working-class Americans who feel left behind in the changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of many problems plaguing the nation and called for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Full coverage: 2016 election Open link \"I see so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn't happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership,\" he said by telephone on Fox News before casting his own ballot in Manhattan. \"And people are hurt so badly.\" Seven in 10 Americans who went to the polls Tuesday said immigrants now in the country illegally should be allowed to stay, while just a quarter said they should be deported. More than half oppose building a border wall, according to the exit polls, which were conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. The Republican Party's tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting \"none of the above\" when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford. Trump set both parties on edge when he refused to say in the third and final debate whether he would accept the election's results, citing with no evidence the possibility of a rigged outcome. His statement threatened to undermine a fundamental pillar of American democracy and raised the prospect that his fervent supporters would not view Clinton as a legitimate president if she won. Asked Tuesday in an interview with Fox News if he would accept the election results, Trump continued to demur, saying \"We're going to see how things play out.\" Most problems that did pop up at polling places Tuesday appeared to be routine \u2014 the kinds of snags that come every four years, including long lines, machines not working properly and issues with ballots or voter rolls. Even before Tuesday, almost 45 million people had cast ballots for president. Many expressed relief the end was in sight after an election season in which personal attacks often drowned out the issues. Clinton has denounced Trump for calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and promoting a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and for his long line of remarks about women that culminated in an audio in which he bragged about grabbing their genitals. Her campaign was hoping high turnout among Hispanics push her over the top in states like Florida and Nevada. \"I grew up in a Hispanic family, and the way that Donald Trump has referred to illegal immigrants \u2014 being from illegal immigrants, I took that to heart,\" said Angel Salazar, a 22-year-old sanitation associate from Oklahoma City. \"I don't like anything that he said. I don't like his views. So I voted for Hillary Clinton because she supports us.\" Trump called his opponent \"Crooked Hillary\" for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her complicated ties to the family's Clinton Foundation. In the final days, Clinton was buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's weekend declaration that he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. Comey announced the inquiry late last month, sapping Clinton's surging momentum and threatening Democrats in down-ballot races.\u00a0 Associated Press ",

Published               November 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump claimed several early projected victories Tuesday night, while Hillary Clinton notched her first projected win in Vermont, as polls began to close in the historic 2016 presidential election \u2013 though the candidates remained locked in tight contests in key battlegrounds. \u00a0 Fox News projects that the Republican presidential nominee will win South Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana, where running mate Mike Pence is governor. But while Clinton has a lead in North Carolina, it\u2019s too early to declare a winner in the key swing state. It\u2019s also too early to declare a winner in the bellwether state of Ohio. In Virginia, where Clinton\u2019s running mate Tim Kaine serves as the state\u2019s junior senator, she has a lead over Trump, though it is too early to project a winner. It is also too early to say who will win Georgia.\u00a0 The incoming returns follow a frenzied day of voting across America marked by long lines and last-minute appeals for support from both campaigns.\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 While the race has tightened in recent days, the Democratic nominee still seemed to enter Election Day with the edge on the electoral map in her quest to become the first woman elected U.S. president. But Trump voiced confidence Tuesday about his chances in key battlegrounds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win a lot of states,\u201d the Republican nominee told Fox News, as he aims for an upset victory to cap his improbable campaign which came from behind to vanquish 16 competitors in the rowdy Republican primaries. The general election race between Clinton and Trump has been no less grueling. The presidential debates were marked by outbursts, interruptions and name-calling, as the candidates dealt before, during and after with a slew of campaign twists that kept the race in flux all the way to Election Day. The most recent bombshell was FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement 11 days before the election that the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton\u2019s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but Trump already was using the brief probe to revive the email controversy in the final days. The WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account also has become a constant distraction for the Democrat\u2019s campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal ethical concerns about the Clinton family\u2019s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries. Meanwhile, Trump dealt with \u2013 and denied \u2013 numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault that came out in October, following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women. The candidates swept all that aside in the closing hours of the race, as Clinton cast herself as a unifying force after a divisive election and Trump cast his bid as the vehicle to bring jobs and security back to America. \u201cToday is our independence day, today the American working class is going to strike,\u201d Trump said in Grand Rapids, Mich., overnight. Clinton, in North Carolina, said, \u201cWe have to bridge the divides in this country.\u201d No matter who wins, the 45th president will take office to an anti-establishment mood in the electorate and deep voter dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. Concerns about health care, the economy, terrorism and illegal immigration dominated the race and are unlikely to be settled by Tuesday\u2019s vote. Voters are also deciding Tuesday whether Republicans should keep control of both the Senate and House of Representatives. That decision will have a big impact on the success of the next president\u2019s agenda. Meanwhile, hundreds of state and local races including hot-button ballot initiatives are being decided as well. Advertisement ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is challenging Republican Sen. Mark Kirk. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Democrats appeared on the verge of picking\u00a0up a Senate seat in Illinois and were leading in early returns in key races in New Hampshire, Missouri and Pennsylvania in their fight to wrest control of the Senate away from Republicans. But the GOP beat back Democrats to hold onto Indiana and they were slightly ahead in early returns in North Carolina. Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth had a wide lead over Republican Sen. Mark Kirk as the first precincts came in. Republican Rep. Todd Young also won in Indiana, where he was vying against former Sen. Evan Bayh for an open seat created by the retirement of GOP Sen. Dan Coats. The results of six more key Senate races will help determine whether the new president can push his or her agenda through Congress for the next two years. Democrats believed they could wrench the majority away from Republicans because the GOP has so many more seats\u00a0to defend this year.\u00a0There were 24 Republican-held seats on state ballots Tuesday and only 10 Democratic-held seats. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to win a majority, or four seats to split the Senate 50-50. In the event of an evenly divided Senate, the party that wins the White House would effectively win the Senate majority since the vice president acts as the tie-breaking vote. Of the 34 contested seats, 23 were considered either extremely safe or likely to remain in the hands of the same party after the election. Another two races, in Florida and Ohio, were called in favor of Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rob Portman shortly after the polls closed. Arizona leanedin favor of Republican Sen. John McCain. Many of the close races were virtual ties in the latest polls. The only seat that Democrats were\u00a0in danger of losing is the one currently held by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. The race between Republican Rep. Joe Heck and Democratic former attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto is considered a tossup. Besides Kirk, the Republican senators in greatest danger of losing were\u00a0Roy Blunt of Missouri, who faced\u00a0Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander; Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was also behind early to Gov. Maggie Hassan; Richard Burr of North Carolina, who was slightly ahead in early returns of former state representative Deborah Ross;\u00a0Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who faced\u00a0former state environmental chief Katie McGinty; and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who is in a rematch with former senator\u00a0Russ Feingold. The races in Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina\u00a0and Pennsylvania were also considered tossups, with the difference between opposing candidates at about 2 percentage points or less, according to an average of the latest polls compiled by RealClearPolitics. In Wisconsin, Feingold led Johnson by an average of slightly less than 3 percentage points, which is way down from Feingold's earlier lead of nearly 10 percentage points in late September. How to make sense of what's happening as polls close on election night There was at least one state, Louisiana, where the outcome of the Senate election may not be known for weeks. In Louisiana, there were 24 candidates vying to fill the open seat of retiring Republican Sen. David Vitter. Unless one of them received\u00a0at least 50% of the vote, which is unlikely, there will be a runoff between the top two vote-getters on Dec. 10. Republicans are expected to keep the seat. Posted!

By Aaron Blake November 8 at 7:03 PM Follow @aaronblake Donald Trump assured us at various points in his campaign that he was going to win or compete for oodles of blue states, up to and including California and New York . The bar on Election Day has been set considerably lower. Indeed, it seems the Trump campaign is preparing to put a good face on a well-fought defeat. As voters headed to the polls to decide the next president on Tuesday, the Trump campaign and its top surrogates have conspicuously sought to set expectations lower than their candidate himself has \u2014 and lower than outright victory. Heck, even Trump himself seems to be lowering\u00a0the bar. In a morning appearance on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said he would win in Iowa and also, he \"thinks,\" Ohio and New Hampshire. Beyond that, though, the usual Trump bluster about\u00a0winning everything was gone. He said he thought he would do well in states like Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin, but he didn't promise victory in the kinds of states that he needs to actually win the presidency. \"We're going to win a lot of states. I mean, who knows what happens ultimately,\" he said. Then he quickly checked himself: \"We're going to win.\" His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, also seemed to begin the process of offering excuses for his likely loss \u2014 pointing, as expected, to the lack of unity and support from the GOP establishment. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday that he had voted for independent Evan McMullin rather than Trump, and George W. Bush also reportedly abstained from voting for president . Conway told MSNBC that Trump \"didn\u2019t have the full support of the Republican infrastructure\" and that it would be \" really too bad \u201d if Trump lost because Bush and former\u00a0GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney didn't support him. (She followed that up with a tweet explaining she wasn't blaming the RNC, but rather other establishment Republicans.) Trump Campaign & RNC @Reince hand in glove. This is about GOP elected officials bragging they voted 3rd party or skipped top of the ticket https://t.co/qOoTXUHOFL \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 8, 2016 Earlier in the day on Fox News, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer seemed to suggest that success would be judged not by victory overall, but by winning states that President Obama won in 2008 and 2012 and doing better than John McCain and Mitt Romney. \"We are going to have more electoral votes tonight than we\u2019ve had in the last two cycles, and I think that\u2019s an important thing to note for all of the media, mainstream media narrative,\" Spicer said. \"We will do very, very well tonight. We will bring millions of people into this process, and I think we\u2019ll see a resounding victory in more and more states that Obama carried twice.\u201d And deputy Trump campaign manager David Bossie appeared on MSNBC and seemed to admit to the narrow path to victory that his candidate faces. He said the path requires winning North Carolina, Iowa, Florida and Ohio, but seemed to acknowledge the next state wasn't quite so obvious. \"And then we start looking at their map,\" Bossie said.

See all of our maps: State-by-state results and the California races and propositions An hour-by-hour guide to when polls close and what happens next. Exit pollsPresident Nov. 8, 2016, 3:10 p.m. Exit polling indicates Clinton has strong advantage among Hispanic voters, similar to Obama Michael A. Memoli (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Early exit poll data indicates that Hillary Clinton is trouncing Donald Trump among Hispanic voters, just slightly behind the advantage President Obama enjoyed over Mitt Romney in 2012. Those voters broke 65% for Clinton, compared with\u00a027% for Trump, according to exit polling. In 2012, Obama won 71% of the Hispanic vote,\u00a0to 27% for Romney. Throughout the race, Clinton's campaign has faced questions about how well she would perform among the so-called \"Obama coalition\" \u2014\u00a0primarily young voters, minorities and women. Of late, the campaign has responded by touting what they call the\u00a0\"Clinton coalition\" \u2014\u00a0one that may not see the same strength among African American voters but potentially offsets it with a stronger Hispanic vote, and the support of Republican-leaning women. The initial wave of voter interviews finds that Clinton is lagging slightly in both categories. Obama enjoyed 93% support among black voters, and Clinton is at 87%, exit polling suggests. But these totals are subject to change, and the\u00a0margin of error could mean she's holding her own. Latest updates ",

(Photo: Robert Deutsch) 15 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE No one wants a repeat of the Karl Rove scene this year. While appearing on Fox News as an analyst on the election night in 2012, the Republican politico threw a hissy fit shortly before midnight ET as the conservative news network projected President Obama winning his second term. \u201cThis is premature,\u201d he said, as Ohio was still being counted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful about calling things.\u201d In their own diplomatic ways, his colleagues at Fox\u2019s decision desk basically told him it was over for Mitt Romney. And the riveting scene of the internal strife now lives on forever on YouTube, with well over a million views. Caution again is the operative word for the networks and other major news organizations as the hours tick on toward the finality of one of the most contentious presidential races in history. Chastened by the 2000 fiasco -- when several news organizations projected early a Florida victory for Al Gore \u2013 the networks are emphasizing accuracy over speed. \u201cThe race to be the first was more of an issue before\u201d 2000, says Joe Lenski, co-founder and executive vice president of Edison Research, whose exit polling data is used by major news organizations. \u201cI think the priority now is to be correct. And frankly, there\u2019s not 100% trust of the media by a lot of people. We saw that in 2012 with Karl Rove.\u201d Still, impatient voters are addictively seeking the latest updates and projections, however premature. Any they'll get their fix in other places this year as social media, particularly Twitter, and other upstarts finagle their way into the crowded media landscape covering the elections. Posted!

By Mark Berman , William Wan and Sari Horwitz November 8 at 7:58 PM Follow @markberman Follow @thewanreport Follow @sarihorwitz Many people were excited to vote on Election Day, but not everyone chose to post a selfie with their \"I Voted\" sticker. Some people took to social media to post irregularities they spotted at the polls. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) As voters flooded polling places across the country on Election Day, some reported problems such as broken machines, long lines and voter intimidation in states ranging from Texas to Pennsylvania. While voting appeared to proceed without headaches in many locations, election observers said they expect a significant increase in the number of issues reported nationwide. In particular, voters in jurisdictions across the country encountered problems with malfunctioning voting machines, highlighting issues with the aging infrastructure expected to support tens of millions of voters turning out on Election Day. One major area experiencing technological problems was\u00a0Durham County, N.C., which has more than a quarter-million residents outside Raleigh. Officlas there had technical issues with electronic poll books used to check in voters. As a result, state authorities told Durham officials to use paper poll books, rather than electronic ones, eventually leading to some delays. (Durham was already using paper ballots.) Local officials asked the\u00a0North Carolina State Board of Elections to extend voting hours in some precincts, a request that was echoed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. On Tuesday evening, state officials agreed to extend voting in eight precincts , pushing back the closing of polls by as much as an hour in some Durham locations and by 30 minutes in Columbus County. A group had also filed a lawsuit Tuesday afternoon seeking to keep the Durham polls open until 9 p.m. Violence also erupted Tuesday near a polling location outside Los Angeles, although police there said it did not appear to be related to the election or voting. The first high-profile legal action of the day saw Donald Trump\u2019s campaign headed to court for a hearing in Nevada after\u00a0 filing a lawsuit \u00a0arguing that polls were improperly kept open late during early voting in Clark County. According to the lawsuit filed by the Republican nominee, this was done \u201cto help Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent. Trump\u2019s campaign asked for the voting machines and ballots involved \u201cbe set aside, sequestered and impounded\u201d to preserve the status quo \u201cin the event of post-election challenges.\u201d A spokesman for Clark County noted that early voting records already have to be preserved under state law and said that no polling precincts were improperly kept open.\u00a0At a hearing Tuesday morning, a skeptical judge questioned the Trump campaign\u2019s attorney and denied the request to preserve evidence in the case. This lawsuit follows a raft of recent legal wrangling in the days leading up to the election.\u00a0As the bitter presidential campaign rumbled toward its conclusion, officials across the country have been bracing for the possibility of confusion and chaos on Election Day , owing to a flurry of new voting restrictions and Trump\u2019s calls for his supporters to closely monitor polling places. What it looks like at the polls on Election Day View Photos Voters cast their ballots in the 2016 presidential election. Caption Voters cast their ballots in the 2016 presidential election. Nov. 8, 2016 People line up to vote in New York. Matt McClain/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Voters in Florida, a key battleground, reported multiple accounts of voters saying they have encountered aggressive, intimidating behavior,\u00a0according to a nonpartisan group monitoring election issues nationwide. \u201cIn Florida we continue to receive a substantial amount of complaints about voter intimidation,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019\u00a0Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is running an independent effort to field voter complaints and questions. Clarke said her group received reports from Miami-Dade County of \u201cyelling, people using megaphones aggressively.\u201d In Jacksonville, in the northeast corner of the state, Clarke said, \u201can unauthorized individual was found inside [a] polling place.\u201d This person was at St. Paul\u2019s Methodist Church, a polling precinct in what Clarke described as a part of Jacksonville with predominantly black residents. \u201cHe was asked to leave and refused,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough\u00a0our intervention and calls, that individual has been removed. Unauthorized individuals have no place in the polls.\u201d [ Live updates on Election Day 2016 ] During early voting, Clarke\u2019s group also received reports from Hollywood, Fla., about \u201caggressive individuals hovering around individuals as they approach the polling site,\u201d she said during a briefing with reporters. \u201cSome have turned away because they did not feel able to freely cast [a] ballot.\u201d Clarke said her group has received reports from about 80,000 voters since the beginning of early voting and expects that figure to reach 175,000 reports by the time the polls close. In 2012, the group received 90,000 calls total on Election Day. Voters wait at Grady High School in Atlanta. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) On Tuesday afternoon, Colorado officials reported what could have been one of the biggest disruptions of the day. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State\u2019s office said that voter registration system was down in parts of the state, which meant that clerks could not process mail ballots and also meant that in-person votes would be viewed as provisional. The issue was resolved shortly before 3:30 p.m. Denver time. During a telephone interview Tuesday on Fox News, Trump did not say whether he was expecting to argue with the outcome of the election, but he said he believed there were reports of voter fraud happening across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s happening at various places today, it\u2019s been reported,\u201d he said. \u201cThe machines, you put down a Republican and it registers as a Democrat, and they\u2019ve had a lot of complaints about that today.\u201d It was not immediately clear what accounts Trump was referring to when he mentioned \u201ca lot of complaints\u201d about the issue. A\u00a0 report out of\u00a0Clinton Township, an area near Pittsburgh, quoted some voters saying their tickets were switching from Trump to Clinton. According to that report, officials there said the machines were fixed and the problem resolved. There have been other issues with machines, including some cases of them showing incorrect votes , though it was unclear how widespread this was. [ Trump campaign files lawsuit in Nevada aimed at early voting ] Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said that they are seeing more problems with voting machines than they have seen in past election years. \u201cThere are more machine breakdowns and more malfunctions all over the place,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s really widespread.\u201d These breakdowns are not a surprise, Weiser said, because 42 states are using machines that are 10 or more years old. There have been issues with machines in South Carolina, New York, Missouri, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois and Indiana. \u201cThese machines are just degrading,\u201d Weiser said. The problem with voting machines has long been predicted by voting experts. In a report last year, the Brennan Center found that in 14 states, voting machines set to be used in the election will be 15 or more years old. The center said that the machines were \u201cperilously close to the end of most systems\u2019 expected lifespans,\u201d noting that nearly every state is using some machines that are no longer manufactured, making it hard to find replacement parts. \u201cOld voting equipment increases the risk of failures and crashes \u2013 which can lead to long lines and lost votes on Election Day,\u201d according to the 2015 report . Although voting machines in use across the country debuted around 2000, they were actually designed and engineered in the 1990s, the report said, and \u201ctoday\u2019s systems were not designed to last for decades.\u201d One specific problem highlighted by the report and mentioned Tuesday by Weiser was \u201cvote flipping,\u201d which is what Trump seemed to be referencing. This occurs when a voter presses a button on a touch screen for one person but the machine shows them voting for another candidate. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen more malfunctions and more vote flipping all over the place,\u201d Weiser said. But it was not clear how many machines were seeing vote flipping. Mark Thomas, director of elections in Utah, said that on Tuesday morning, local officials in\u00a0Washington County found that none of their voting machines were working. They wound up using paper ballots as a backup; the issue with fixing the machines was finished by noon, he said. Issues with machines caused lines earlier Tuesday at precincts in Virginia, Clarke\u2019s group said. Her group also heard similar complaints from Philadelphia, one of the cities specifically cited by Trump during speeches in which he claimed that voter fraud is \u201call too common\u201d and asked his supporters to closely monitor other voters. Donald Trump has called for his supporters to \"watch\" the polls in some cities. But claims of election rigging didn't begin with Trump's candidacy. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The office of Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams said it has assembled a task force including more than 70 prosecutors and dozens of detectives to tackle complaints of voter fraud, intimidation and electioneering. \u201cWe, as expected, had kind of a busy call volume in the morning,\u201d Cameron L. Kline, a spokesman for Williams, said Tuesday morning in a telephone interview. Kline said the task force was not seeing an unusual volume of calls or complaints. \u201cSo far the trend is historically rolling the right way.\u201d [ Election Day: An acrimonious race reaches its endpoint ] The Philadelphia Republican Party posted on Twitter that poll workers in the northern part of the city were handing out literature supporting Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, while inside a polling station. Advocates worry that voters are not clear on the current rules surrounding photo ID and early voting. The Post's Sari Horwitz visited North Carolina, where voting laws have recently changed, to find out more ahead of Election Day. (Monica Akhtar,Sari Horwitz/The Washington Post) There were also other problems\u00a0reported across the country. In complaints submitted to The Washington Post, voters described\u00a0confusion over identification requirements in Pennsylvania, Texas and D.C., among other issues. Volunteers with\u00a0Common Cause, a nonpartisan government reform group, fanned out to help at the polls on Tuesday, and they also saw problems with relocated polling places, broken machines and confusion from voters and poll workers alike over new voter ID laws. In Harris County, Texas, the county\u2019s website listed the incorrect polling places for a number of precincts, according to Common Cause. A lot of voters went to one site only to be told that the voting place had been changed. And in one precinct, voters were sent to a third site. \u201cVoters had to go to a lot of trouble to cast a ballot,\u201d said a Common Cause worker in Texas. Also in Texas, there were a \u201clarge number of calls\u201d about voting machines that were not up and working when the polling places were supposed to open. Ohio has mostly been dealing with routine problems, including a power outage. But in one county, Montgomery, there was confusion over the number of pages that were supposed to be on the ballot. Only one page was provided. The poll workers had to call all the voters to return and correct their ballots with the second page. Voters go to the polls in Milwaukee. (Darren Hauck/Getty Images) Clarke said the lawyers\u2019 committee was contacted about sites that did not open on time in Brooklyn and Boston, along with long lines and broken machines elsewhere. In Georgia, Clarke said, people complained of \u00a0\u201c11th-hour polling place changes with no notice issued to voters,\u201d creating uncertainty over where to go. [ In battleground states, confusion lingers over new voting laws ] Leading up to Election Day, there have been some heated confrontations between supporters of Clinton and Trump. The specter of possible violence has loomed over Election Day after a particularly vitriolic campaign, one in which issues of race, class, gender and ethnicity have taken center stage in caustic ways. In a poll last month, half of likely voters said they were worried about violence on Election Day.\u00a0Meanwhile, U.S. officials recently said they were investigating a possible threat from al-Qaeda to carry out pre-election terrorist attacks, although authorities described the threat as vague and said they were unclear whether it was credible. Law enforcement officials from Nevada to Georgia have pledged an increase in officers at some locations, with agencies vowing vigilance and saying they are prepared for possible issues. A police officer looks at people standing in line to vote in New York City. (Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images) The Las Vegas police said units would visit polling locations, though the department noted that early voting in Clark County came and went without any issues of violence at the polls.\u00a0In Chicago, another city named by Trump when he exhorted his supporters to monitor polling locations, police say it is normal procedure for them to have extra officers visiting these sites to ensure safety. Police in New York are preparing for \u201ca very unique set of challenges,\u201d because both Clinton and Trump plan to hold election-night events in Manhattan, said James O\u2019Neill, the police commissioner. But O\u2019Neill said police are prepared to secure more than 1,000 polling locations across the city, as well as the Clinton and Trump events just two miles apart later on Tuesday night. \u201cPlanning for security events like this is a big part of what we do,\u201d O\u2019Neill said during a briefing Monday. \u201cThis is nothing new to us.\u201d Katie Zezima contributed to this\u00a0report has been updated multiple times.\u00a0 Further reading: ",

Azusa is about 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Hunt said it was still not clear whether the shooting had anything to do with the voting process. The shooting happened in front of Memorial Park, which is also a polling station. The Azusa Police Department said the shooting began a little after 5 p.m. ET. Officers found \"multiple shooting victims\" and they \"came under fire.\" Article continues after sponsorship Police are now concentrating on a home in the area.

Tribune news services Contact Reporter His path to the White House narrow, Donald Trump was locked in tight races across a handful of key battleground states with polls beginning to close across the nation. No state looms larger for the Republican nominee than Florida, a state his advisers have repeatedly described as a must win. The stakes are also high in North Carolina and Ohio. Earlier in the day, Trump refused to say whether he would accept the election results, injecting new drama into the final day of a turbulent election season. The Republican presidential nominee also continued to raise doubts about the integrity of the election system, warning of possible voter fraud as his campaign sought an investigation into early voting hours in battleground Nevada. While familiar charges from an unorthodox candidate, the Election Day statements challenged bedrock principles of American democracy: fair and free elections and the clean transfer of power. They come as Trump eyes a challenging path to the 270 electoral needed for victory, although both sides paint the picture of a very close election that will likely come down to a handful of swing states. As the nation's first polls closed, Trump scored victories in reliably Republican Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and South Carolina. Clinton won deep-blue states Vermont, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Slamming Comey's recent letter from the FBI clearing Hillary Clinton, Pelosi said it damaged the chances for Democrats to win the House in Tuesday's election. (AP) \"We're going to see how things play out,\" Trump said on Fox News when asked if he would accept the election results. \"I want to see everything honest.\" He offered a similarly non-committal answer earlier in the day as he cast his vote in Manhattan. He noted he's \"always concerned\" about voter fraud when asked about the issue. The GOP nominee was joined by his wife, Melania, his daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his granddaughter Arabella while voting at a public school on Manhattan's East Side. He was booed loudly by onlookers gathered on the sidewalks outside of the school, which had been sealed off with police barricades. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in America. Such claims have become a regular part of Trump's warnings of a \"rigged election\" \u2014 a central argument from an outsider candidate who has repeatedly challenged the norms of presidential politics.

Republicans are expected to maintain their majority in the House of Representatives, but party leaders have also acknowledged that they\u2019re likely to lose at least a handful of seats that cut into their 29-seat majority, their largest since 1928. Inside the Battle for the US Senate That\u2019s something that concerns House Speaker Paul Ryan , who would begin the next congressional session leading a conference with a larger number of conservative hard-liners skeptical of compromise. \u201cWe need to have a healthy majority and a strong majority,\" the Wisconsin Republican recently told The Wall Street Journal 's editorial page. \"If we have a razor-thin majority, then every vote can be problematic. Every vote on everything can be difficult.\" But with a total of 192 seats likely to break their way on Election Night, Democrats would need a nearly clean sweep of competitive districts to reach the 218 seats needed to regain the majority of the chamber. Just 17 races are tossups, according to an ABC News analysis of the House races. (An additional 12 lean Republican, and three lean Democrat.) There are, however, some tight House races that will serve as a bellwether for which party is having the better night overall, and whether Republicans in left-leaning districts have been able to outperform their party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump . One of the most illustrative races will be in Virginia\u2019s 10th congressional district, which ABC rates a pure tossup, where GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock has been treading a thin line between courting Trump backers and cohorts in that district who have been trending away from Trump like well-educated and affluent women. Plus Comstock's opponent, real estate executive LuAnn Bennett, and outside groups have been flooding the airwaves with ads linking Comstock to Trump. On the other side of the country, GOP Rep. Darrell Issa , one of President Obama\u2019s loudest critics on Capitol Hill , has been playing up his bipartisan credentials in California\u2019s 49th district, which still leans Republican but could tip against Issa if Republicans stay home and independents turn to his opponent, former Marine Col. Doug Applegate. ABC News\u2019 Ben Siegel contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Manish Swarup/AP hide caption toggle caption India is doing away with old currency notes of 1,000 and 500 rupees. Manish Swarup/AP In a surprise move, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country is taking all existing 500 and 1,000 rupee notes out of circulation. He said in a televised speech that voiding the country's highest-denomination bills is aimed at cracking down on the black market and getting counterfeit cash out of the financial system. The black market boosts corruption and is used to fund terrorism, he said.

Modi told Indians they will have 50 days to deposit the old bills into bank or post office accounts, and the amount that people could withdraw would initially be limited. Within hours of the announcement, the notes were nearly useless for buying anything. Article continues after sponsorship Old notes can still be used for the next three days at a select few places such as government hospitals, railway/bus/airline ticket counters, and gas stations. Indians crowd a gas station, one of the few places still accepting the high denomination 1,000 and 500 currency notes, in New Delhi. Manish Swarup/AP hide caption toggle caption Manish Swarup/AP The effect was immediate: \"Chaos prevailed across major cities as people lined up outside cash dispensing machines following the announcement,\" Bloomberg reported . After all, \"most transactions in daily life are in cash and 45 percent of those are in notes in denominations of 500 rupees and over,\" according to the BBC. Five hundred rupees is worth about $7.55. The old notes will be replaced by new ones, and the reserve bank previewed the new design: RBI issues \u20b92000 note in new series pic.twitter.com/7Ob2j1t6Ab \u2014 ReserveBankOfIndia (@RBI) November 8, 2016 \"Secrecy was essential for this action,\" as Modi put it, and even bankers seemed genuinely surprised by the dramatic move. \"This is news for us also,\" one head of a state-run bank told Reuters. \"I'm not aware how much stock we have in our chest.\" There are plenty of unanswered questions about how this will work. The BBC spells out some of those outstanding issues: \"Much of the government's new initiative remains mired in confusion. It is not clear exactly what will be the effect on the money supply or whether it will take out a lot of cash in circulation. \"Likewise at this stage it seems too early to say how cash much will be locked out of the system and how successful forgers will be at catching up. No-one can say definitively whether the new notes will be harder to fake. \"It is also not clear how the banking authorities handled and planned for this huge logistical exercise which has caught so many people by surprise.\" ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Kelsey Snell November 8 at 7:23 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), seen her in a file photo, is facing questions about his future as Speaker of the House. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) JANESVILLE, WIS. \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan is something of a political legend here in his hometown. There was near universal agreement among voters here Tuesday that Ryan seems like a stand-up guy, most people just call him Paul, and they are proud to see him on the national stage. But some Republicans in his home state and across the country still feel uncomfortable that he never seemed to fully embrace GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump during the campaign. \u201cIt hurts the party that he doesn\u2019t support the Republican candidate,\u201d said Zach Molitor, 20, who cast a ballot for his hometown congressman at the Janesville public library and said he still keeps at home a framed note he received in 6th grade from Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed.\u201d After months of criticism over his soft support for Trump, Ryan spent the last several days trying to shake the idea he wasn\u2019t in the GOP nominee\u2019s corner while making the case to voters that supporting Republican candidates up and down the ballot is the best way to enact a conservative agenda for the country. That\u2019s the case he made Monday night at a rally 50 miles east of his hometown where an excited group of Republicans crowded into a strip mall warehouse, cheering the mentions of secure borders and attacking ISIS, while booing when speakers brought up Hillary Clinton and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But the loudest applause line came when Ryan held himself up as an example of GOP unity. \u201cI voted Trump, Pence, [Sen. Ron] Johnson, some guy named Ryan and every other Republican on the ticket,\u201d Ryan said to booming applause during an event that was part of his recent mad dash across Wisconsin in an attempt to shore up votes for the embattled Johnson. \u201cRepublicans, we need to come home. We need to unify and we need to go vote.\u201d [ Paul D. Ryan won\u2019t defend or campaign for Trump ahead of election ] Ryan\u2019s plea for unity was as meaningful\u00a0for the party in the waning days of the election as it is for his own political self-preservation. He\u00a0will return to Washington next week as the leader of a House GOP in crisis. Several members of the approximately 40-member House Freedom Caucus have openly discussed removing Ryan as speaker, in part, because they are upset about his early waffling over whether to support Trump and then his timid endorsement of the nominee until recent days. [ Paul D. Ryan just finished his first year as speaker. He may not see a second .] He likely has enough votes from members of his party to be chosen as the GOP nominee for speaker during leadership elections next week. But he will also have to survive a vote on the House floor in January where he will need 218 votes to keep his gavel. Republicans currently hold 240 seats in the House, but the GOP is widely expected to lose at least 10 seats on Tuesday. If the GOP majority slips to around 230 it would take less than one third of the Freedom Caucus Members to end his one-year run as leader of the House. Ryan\u2019s allies have pointed to all he\u2019s done to help the GOP maintain control of the House this election as evidence he is worthy of remaining speaker. In the past year, he has participated in 196 events in 31 states in support of vulnerable Republicans. He also transferred $40 million to the House Republican campaign arm and helped candidates raise $20 million by doing special guest appearances at campaign events. [ Inside Paul D. Ryan\u2019s bid to woo the House Freedom Caucus ] But despite his fundraising work and calling for solidarity on the trail in recent days, Ryan\u2019s less than enthusiastic embrace of Trump is still causing some heartburn for many Republicans. \u201cI\u2019m glad he came around,\u201d said Bob Young, a former mayor of Augusta, Ga. and a former regional director at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the George W. Bush administration who traveled to Wisconsin to help campaign for Republicans. \u201cI wish he would have come around a lot earlier but you\u2019ll take what you can get.\u201d As they left the Monday night rally, most voters expressed confidence the party would come together after the elections and said the discord was all par for the course in a difficult political year. Some borrowed a phrase Ryan himself likes to use when Republicans have differences: They said it was a family conversation. \u201cWe\u2019re family and we have internal bickering sometimes,\u201d said Joseph Galvan, who traveled to Wisconsin from Elgin, Ill. Young and others said that if Trump loses to Clinton they expect GOP leaders like Ryan to get to work putting the party back together. \u201cAt some point if we\u2019re going to be a player four years from now on a national stage,\u201d Young said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we have to come together as a party.\u201d powerpost ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Hillary Clinton is known as a pantsuit aficionado, but if Facebook is any indication, there are a lot of other women with pantsuits in their closets. There\u2019s a secret Facebook group \u2014 the group requires an invitation to join \u2014\u00a0with nearly 2.9 million members who are posting thousands of photos of themselves in pantsuits as a symbol that they voted for Clinton.\u00a0And on Tuesday, Clinton wrote a message to the group thanking them for their support. Unsurprisingly, she loves the name. Here\u2019s the post, as provided to USA TODAY by the Clinton campaign: \u201cDear Pantsuit Nation (have you ever heard a better name?!), On this historic day, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your support from the bottom of my heart. This election hasn't been easy: It's been long, hard-fought, and at times it made us question who we are as Americans. For some of you, it's been difficult to feel like you could wear your support on your sleeve \u2014 and that's why this community has been such a special place. Your stories and photos of family members and friends are wonderful to see, but what truly warms my heart is the thousands of comments of support and love you all send to each other. I'm honored and humbled to have all of you with me, but I'm even prouder to see this community represent the best of America: people of all backgrounds and beliefs who share a vision for a brighter future for our children, and who have each other's backs. That's who we really are, and tonight, we're going to prove it. Thank you all so much for your support, your hard work, and your votes. Tonight, I hope we'll finally break through that highest, hardest glass ceiling together, and use those pantsuits for the best occasion of all \u2014celebrating! -H\u201d Posted!

Back Story Photo Credit Sotheby's London \u201cIt is one of the most extraordinary works of art to come to the market in the last 10 to 15 years.\u201d That comment by Sotheby\u2019s chairman for Chinese art was reserved for an 18th-century musket made for the Qianlong emperor, who presided over what became China\u2019s last imperial dynasty. Advertisement The gun is set to be auctioned today in London at an estimated price of roughly $1.2 million to $1.8 million. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had an imperial firearm,\u201d the Sotheby\u2019s executive, Nicolas Chow, said. Handcrafted out of wood, with components made of gold, silver and copper, the gun is over five and a half feet long . An inscription reads, \u201cSupreme Number One.\u201d Sales of Chinese art accounted for nearly a third of the global art auction market last year, according to a recent analysis . Mr. Chow said that many treasures were taken from the palace after the dynasty ended. Their return is viewed as a matter of national pride . The emperor\u2019s fondness for the weapon can be seen in a poem attributed to him, but a jade seal he used during his abdication might be the emperor\u2019s most valuable possession. Last month, an anonymous buyer paid nearly $12 million for the item. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

    "text": "Privacy Policy How confident are you about your future income? One of the advantages of renting is that if your earning power suddenly changes, it is relatively easy to adjust your living situation accordingly. Lose your job and have to take a pay cut to find a new one? That isn\u2019t much fun, but it\u2019s less painful if it results in moving into a smaller apartment rather than having your house foreclosed upon and your credit wrecked. That\u2019s all a case for being conservative when thinking about your future earnings. If you earn a commission or bonus, how variable is it? Don\u2019t assume that one good year will be repeated forever. Do you work in an industry that is healthy and growing, or one in which layoffs are happening all the time? If you lost your job, how hard would it be to find a new one, and would you probably be paid more or less than you are now? Advertisement The more confident you are in your future earnings, the more comfortable you should be taking on that home mortgage. Can you force yourself to save? As my colleague Josh Barro has pointed out , one of the real, if underappreciated, benefits of buying a home is that it forces you to save. A typical mortgage pays itself off bit by bit over the 15 or 30 years you are making payments. With modest appreciation in the value of the home, at the inflation rate or a little bit above, people who buy a house in their 30s and stay there can end up with quite a valuable asset, debt free, in their 60s. But there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t also save while renting a home. You have the money that would otherwise have been your down payment as a starting point, and then you can easily transfer a few hundred dollars each month into a brokerage account and put the money into stocks, which historically have higher returns than residential real estate. But will you? One risk for people who elect to rent is that they could lack the discipline to save that way, and so could find themselves at retirement age owning neither a free-and-clear home nor a well-stuffed brokerage account. If you know you\u2019re tempted to spend every last dollar in your paycheck, buying could provide some extra advantage. Can you accept that the future is unknowable? A month after I closed on my condo, there was a global financial crisis. Property prices plummeted \u2014 if I had needed to sell in 2009, I would have lost a bundle. But the downturn also led to an era of ultralow interest rates that allowed me to refinance a couple of times to reduce my monthly payment. And while the national job market has been miserable, I never lost my job. Meanwhile, Washington, with its influx of federal dollars, rebounded faster than most of the country. My neighborhood in particular continued its long-term upswing and is more expensive than it was in 2008. I foresaw none of that. Most of the numbers in my complicated spreadsheet were all wrong, but it worked out anyway. I was lucky. The point is that the world is messy. In deciding whether to buy a home, we can never have perfect visibility into what the years ahead will bring. All would-be home buyers can do is make sure they are buying a place that they can afford \u2014 with a sensible price relative to the alternative of renting \u2014 and that they can see themselves living in for many years. Because you can\u2019t know the future, concentrate on the things you can know, about the finances of a potential purchase and your own personality, and leap accordingly.

Donald Trump joked that it was a \"tough decision.\" USA TODAY NETWORK Clinton supporters watch the results come in at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on election night. (Photo: Seth Harrison, USA TODAY Network) Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump was the projected winner in seven early states while Democrat Hillary Clinton claimed six and the District of Columbia as polls began closing Tuesday across the nation in the historic campaign to elect the nation's 45th president. Democrats also were hoping to gain\u00a0four Senate seats needed to gain a majority while\u00a0Republicans appeared well positioned to retain a solid majority in the House. Polling places across presidential battleground states of Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia also were closing as the arduous and bitterly fought campaign raced to a close.\u00a0Polling places in North Carolina, another swing state, were mostly closed although some precincts were being kept open due to computer glitches. The lead was on a see-saw and too close to call\u00a0in\u00a0Florida, perhaps the night's biggest prize, with about 90% of the votes tallied. Trump claimed early victories in Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Indiana.\u00a0Indiana is a historically red state and home to Trump's running mate, Gov. Mike Pence. \"Thank you Indiana for making our state first on the board to vote to Make America Great Again! @realDonaldTrump ,\" Pence tweeted . Clinton was quickly projected the winner in Rhode Island,\u00a0Maryland, Massachusetts, Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont and D.C. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, is from swing Virginia, which was not immediately called. Trump and Clinton mostly shunned public appearances as the day wore on, although Trump conducted radio interviews and their social media accounts were far from silent. \"Don't let up, keep getting out to vote - this election is FAR FROM OVER! We are doing well but there is much time left. GO FLORIDA!,\" tweeted Trump, who, aides say, handles his own Twitter account. Clinton's account chimed in with \"Our neighbors in battleground states need your help. Make calls to remind Hillary supporters to go vote.\" Voters faced long lines at many polling places but no major impediments, even as an estimated 90 million Americans filed through schools, churches, public libraries, civic centers and grocery stores to\u00a0cast ballots.\u00a0 Fears of voting problems \u00a0pushed voting rights advocates, conservative watchdogs and even international observers to monitor voting. How to make sense of what's happening as polls close on election night When Utah, a red state,\u00a0reported problems, Trump pounced, tweeting \"Just out according to @CNN : \"Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.\" Not so, CNN's Brian Stelter tweeted : \"No. Utah officials reported machine problems across one entire COUNTY, not the entire COUNTRY.\" In the Senate, early Republican victories in Florida and Indiana gave the party breathing room in its effort to retain a majority. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had said while running for president that he would not seek re-election. He changed his mind and provided his party with a boost. In Indiana, former senator and governor Evan Bayh was beatend by relative unkown GOP Rep. Todd Young. Voters in several states had complained of long waits and, on occasion, supply disruptions and technical glitches, from reliably blue Massachusetts to the battleground states of Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Michigan. In California, violence forced a lock-down of two polling places. Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan tweeted that voters in Azusa should seek alternate polling sites after a shooting affected two voting locations, including an elementary school.\u00a0A gunman shot several people, killing one, and scattered would-be voters, police said. Across the nation, surveys\u00a0of voters leaving their polling places revealed an electorate more diverse, more educated and more upset than four years ago. The surveys also showed that\u00a0black and Hispanic voters continued to grow as a percentage of the electorate, while the white vote slipped slightly. Is it Trump or Clinton? The surveys, from\u00a0National Election Pool Survey by Edison Research, also showed nearly a quarter of Americans described themselves as \u201cangry\u201d about the way government is functioning. Those people were at the core of Trump\u2019s support. In 2012, about a fifth of voters described their feelings toward the Obama administration as \u201canger.\u201d The controversy over Trump's comments about women notwithstanding, the \u201cgender gap\u201d appears to be comparable to what voters reported in both 2012 and 2008 \u2014\u00a0female voters were more likely to support Clinton and male voters were more likely to support Trump. And while men favored Trump, his numbers appeared to be little changed from Mitt Romney's in 2012. It was not immediately clear where turnout stood compared to four years ago.\u00a0In battleground Ohio,\u00a0the state's elections office said turnout appeared to be robust, with relatively few problems. Matthew McClellan, a spokesman for Secretary of State Jon Husted, said it was too soon to say if Tuesday's turnout would break records. Contributing: Stephen Reilly, Greg Toppo Posted!

Frank Pavone, in a still from a video in which he displayed an aborted fetus to encourage people to vote for Donald Trump.</p> Close \u200bFather Frank Pavone via Facebook A staunch anti-abortion Catholic priest in Texas says he was given an aborted fetus for proper burial, but he thought it was best to display the fetus on an altar first in order to make a political point about the 2016 election . In a Facebook Live post from Nov. 6, Father Frank Pavone said: \u201cI am showing him to you because in this election we have to decide if we will allow this child killing to continue in America or not. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic platform says yes, let the child killing continue (and you pay for it); Donald Trump and the Republican platform says no, the child should be protected.\u201d (You can view the post and video here , but be warned some viewers may find the content offensive.) Pavone is a priest in the Amarillo, Texas, Archdiocese, and is a well-known and long-time vocal opponent of abortion. His aggressive work on the topic has run him afoul of the diocese previously, reports CBS Amarillo affiliate KFDA . In 2014, Cardinal Timothy Dolan cut ties with the Pavone, despite Dolan\u2019s own outspoken advocacy against abortion, reports t he Washington Post . In a post on the New York Archdiocese website, Dolan\u2019s former home diocese, Ed Mechmann writes that Pavone is free to post such videos as an American citizen, but that it was wrong to do so. \u201cIt was absolutely appalling, and deserves to be repudiated by all of us who consider ourselves to be pro-life in the fullest meaning of that word,\u201d Mechmann wrote. Mechmann said Pavone was just exploiting the body of the dead baby to further his own ends, and not worshiping or loving it as a good Catholic should. He expressed special horror for placing the baby\u2019s body \u201con an altar, which has been sanctified for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.\u201d In response to the outrage online against the video, Pavone has replied to several angry Facebook users who saw his post.\u00a0 In defense against claims he was exploiting a dead baby, Pavone said: \u201cThe exploitation was the violent killing of the child, and deprivation,  by the government, of the protection of that child\u2019s life. THAT\u2019s the  exploitation. This body would have been in the garbage had we not given  this child a funeral and a cemetery crypt. Wake up.\u201d The Washington Post reports that a recent poll show Catholics divided in this election, with 48 percent of Catholics going for Hillary Clinton while 44 percent favored Trump. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Three others have become president without any experience in government \u2014 elected or appointed \u2014 but they served as generals in the armed forces beforehand. Here's a look at those presidents: Zachary Taylor, 1849-1850 Taylor became an officer in 1808 and rose to the rank of general in the United States Army, commanding forces in conflicts including the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War. He\u00a0became the Whig nominee and was elected president in 1848, but only served a year in office before dying in 1850. Ulysses S. Grant, 1869-1877 A West Point graduate, Grant led the Union\u00a0to victory over the Confederacy in the American Civil War. After incumbent Andrew Johnson\u00a0failed to win the Democratic nomination, Grant ran and won as the\u00a0Republican nominee in\u00a01868, presiding over the early years of Reconstruction.\u00a0He won a second term in 1872. Dwight Eisenhower, 1953-1961 Another West Point alum, Eisenhower served as\u00a0Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, overseeing D-Day. After the war, he served as\u00a0Governor of the American Zone of occupied Germany and became the first NATO Supreme Commander in 1951. Eisenhower ran and won the presidency as a Republican in 1952 with the famous \"I Like Ike\" slogan and won a second term in 1956. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Stevenson November 8 at 6:30 AM Follow PeterWStevenson Voting began at 6 a.m. in several East Coast states, and now it's time to play the waiting game. When will we know whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will be the next president? The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) There comes a point when all of the campaigning is over. There are no more rallies to be held, no more stump speeches to be delivered, no more hearts and minds to be won. The only thing left is the voting \u2014 and the counting. And it can be hard to wait. Trust us. We know. We'd like to know how this is all going to play out, too. To that end, we have a few solutions. In the video above, The Fix's Chris Cillizza goes through poll closing times across the country, and explains which particular closings might signal big election-night moments (hint: the 9 p.m. hour could be critical). The first polls in Indiana and Kentucky are scheduled to close at 6 p.m. Eastern, with the last polls in Alaska closing 7 hours later. The states listed in bold below were called as polls closed: 6 p.m. Parts of Indiana\u00a0and Kentucky are the first states on the list. Note: some polling locations in both states remain open until 7 p.m. Eastern time. 7 p.m. The rest of Kentucky and Indiana, part of Florida (polls in some parts of the state remain open until 8 p.m.), Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and a small part of\u00a0Alabama are next. 7:30 p.m. North Carolina, Ohio and\u00a0West Virginia all close at 7:30. 8 p.m. At 8 p.m., polls close in all or part of states including\u00a0Alabama (where some polling places close at 7 p.m.), Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois,\u00a0Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee,\u00a0Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,\u00a0Mississippi, Missouri\u00a0and New Jersey. In\u00a0Kansas, Michigan, parts of North Dakota and South Dakota and Texas, some polling places stay open until 9 p.m. 8:30 p.m. Arkansas 9 p.m. Polls fully close in states including Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 10 p.m. Polls close in states including Iowa, Montana, Nevada and Utah. 11 p.m. Polls close in states including California, Hawaii, Idaho (some polling places open until 10 p.m.), Oregon (some polling places open until 10 p.m.), and Washington\u00a0state. Polls in Alaska close at both 11 p.m. and midnight Eastern time. But if you just can't wait for the polls to close, we have a few tools to occupy you in the meantime. The Fix's Philip Bump created interactives that will come in super handy today. His electoral map simulator lets you map out how you think each state will break, letting you predict the ultimate winner: Another version of that tool plots out how the electoral map could\u00a0end up looking if every state votes according to the most recent polling averages. A third tool lets you pick your own electoral map, and plots your choices against the time each state's polls close, showing just how soon in the evening the election could theoretically be called \u2014 that is, if it all goes smoothly. 1 of 29 ",

At an emergency hearing Tuesday afternoon, Judge Gloria Sturman said the Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit raises privacy concerns for the poll workers whose identities the campaign was requesting, saying she feared they would be the subject of \u201charassment.\u201d Sturman also said Clark County officials are already required to preserve the records the Trump campaign was asking to preserve. Live updates on presidential election \u201cI am not going to issue any order,\u201d Sturman said. The Trump campaign filed suit against the Clark County registrar, accusing him of intentionally coordinating with Democratic activists \u201cin order to skew the vote unlawfully in favor of Democratic candidates.\u201d \u00a0 The suit alleges that the registrar instructed the head of the polling station to keep the location open two hours after its original closing time of 8 p.m., until 10 p.m. The head of the polling location allegedly told a poll watcher that he believed the station was being kept open to \u201chelp Hillary Clinton.\u201d Someone identified in the Trump filing as a \u201cpoll watcher\u201d estimated that 150-300 people entered the line after 8 p.m., when the polling station was supposed to close, and suggested the number could have been higher. Trump asked the court to intervene and make sure that the ballots and voting machines involved in the Nov. 4th voting events not be commingled with ballots and voting machines that were not involved in the alleged illegal voting.\u00a0 Clark County had a record-breaking number of early voters , exceeding 57,000 by 10 p.m. local time Friday, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. And the lawsuit points to a location that remained open beyond closing time -- at Cardenas Market. \u00a0The head of the polling location, according to the lawsuit, was \u201cinstructed by the Registrar to keep this polling location open until the market closed at 10 p.m.\u201d The Review Journal had noted that this location, which had been slated to close at 9 p.m., \u201cremained open long after that time to accommodate the many voters still waiting to cast their ballots.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the campaign didn\u2019t object if polls were kept open to accommodate voters who were already in line, but, she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true.\u201d On Saturday, Nevada GOP chairman Michael McDonald complained at a Trump rally that Clark County had \u201ckept a poll open \u2018til 10 o\u2019clock at night so a certain group could vote.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid contributed to this story. \u00a0 ",

The name change has already been approved by the company's board of directors. Shareholders get a vote on Dec. 13, according to a statement from the company. Smith & Wesson has been making guns since 1852. The move to rebrand comes as the company increasingly shifts its focus to what it calls \"the growing markets for shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiasts.\" The company made it a goal to diversify into the larger sports and outdoors market. The company announced the strategy early this year. Over the years, Smith & Wesson has bought sports gear makers, as well as hunting knife and flashlight companies. In a statement, CEO James Debney said the corporation owns \"18 respected consumer brands\" and \"we intend to aggressively grow organically and through strategic acquisitions, focusing on brands and products that best meet the needs and lifestyle of our target consumers.\" The company's strategy seems to be paying off. In the most recent quarter, its profits nearly doubled to $33 million. Article continues after sponsorship Handguns In America And The Rise Of The 'Concealed-Carry Lifestyle' In the complicated world of mergers and acquisitions, Smith & Wesson is the name that Saf-T-Hammer Corp. began using after it acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins PLC in 2001. The Wall Street Journal's Doug Cameron reports on the rebranding strategy. \"Smith & Wesson's push into the broader outdoor-sports market mirrors that of Vista Outdoor Inc., the largest commercial ammunition maker. Vista estimates that the U.S. outdoor-pursuits market is worth more than $60 billion a year in sales, excluding team sports, with fragmented segments, such as fishing, wildlife viewing and hiking equipment, each generating industry sales of more than $5 billion a year. \"Mr. Debney told investors in January that Smith & Wesson may create up to three new divisions for outdoor products alongside its existing gun and shooting accessories operations.\" Forbes reports the company's stock rose on Monday as investors anticipated a Hillary Clinton win, betting that would spur gun sales in the short term.

Police are responding to an active shooting in Azusa. (KTLA-TV Channel 5) Veronica Rocha , Richard Winton, Joseph Serna and Ruben Vives One person was killed and at least three others were wounded Tuesday after an assailant armed with a military-style rifle opened fire in a residential area of Azusa, forcing authorities to secure the neighborhood and shut down nearby polling places,\u00a0sending voters scrambling to find alternate locations. Authorities said police were dealing with at least one female suspect who was heavily armed.\u00a0But several witnesses interviewed by The Times said the shooter was a man. \u201cThis is an active situation,\u201d said Azusa Police Chief Steve Hunt, adding it\u2019s too early to determine whether the violence was in any way related to the election. \u201cIt\u2019s very early to tell what the motive is, but it appears to be concentrated on the residential side, not at the polling station,\u201d Hunt added. At least one of the victims was headed to the polling station to vote,\u00a0a law enforcement source told The Times. Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Ron Singleton said\u00a0two people were airlifted\u00a0to an area hospital. The third victim, a\u00a0man in his 70s, was dead at the scene, he said. The shooting began about 2 p.m. after\u00a0a report of gunfire\u00a0in the 300 block of North Orange Avenue,\u00a0Hunt said. Officers arrived to find multiple shooting victims and a suspect with a rifle, he said. The suspect was armed with an assault rifle with \u201ca rapid fire capability,\u201d Hunt said. Police don\u2019t know if the rifle is fully or semi-automatic. The shooter immediately fired at least 20 shots at police, said the source. Under a hail of gunfire, officers took cover and returned shots at the assailant, who retreated into a home in the 500 block of Fourth Street, said the source, who requested anonymity because the case was ongoing. No officers were injured in the shooting. \u201cAfter the initial exchange of gunfire, there were victims down at the scene,\u201d Hunt\u00a0said. \u201cWe had to extract them from the scene.\u201d Officers had the shooter\u00a0surrounded, and were evacuating the area, the source said. \u201cThis is a very volatile and critical situation,\u201d Azusa Police Officer Jerry\u00a0Willison said. Roberto Chavez, 67, and his wife were sitting outside on their porch when they saw a heavily armed man fire at least 10 rounds at a group of people.\u00a0 Police quickly responded, Chavez said. About 20 officers swarmed into the neighborhood in the 600 block of West Fourth Street, he said. The gunman, who wore a white shirt and black pants, ran into a home about three doors down from Chavez\u2019s house, he said. Chavez said he recognized the man as someone who frequently visits and hangs out at his neighbor\u2019s home. He didn\u2019t know the man\u2019s name. He said some of the victims appeared to be neighbors in the area. Police told him to remain indoors because the gunman had barricaded himself inside a home. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous situation,\u201d he said. Fabiola Moreno, 47,\u00a0had just finished making a sandwich for her 5-year-old granddaughter\u00a0and was walking to the living room where her granddaughter\u00a0was watching television when she heard three gunshots. \u201cI thought it was just fireworks,\u201d Moreno said, \u201cBut then I thought about it and it really sounded more like gunshots.\u201d Moreno walked outside of her home to look and saw a man dressed in a white T-shirt\u00a0with a black vest and black pants. He was armed and was walking away from the parking lot of Memorial Park. She said the man stopped to reload his weapon and noticed her. \u00a0 \u201cI just ran inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI secured the door, grabbed my granddaughter\u00a0and ran into the bathroom, and we locked ourselves there.\u201d She said from inside, she heard police sirens and more gunshots. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he shot at the police or they shot at him, but it was several gunshots,\u201d Moreno said.\u00a0 \u201cI was afraid a bullet would come through the walls of the house.\u201d Moreno spoke to The Times by phone while locked in the room. Police said there appears to be someone \u201cdown\u201d inside a house but did not provide further details. Azusa Unified School District issued a\u00a0lockdown for Slauson Middle and Mountain View Elementary schools about 2:15 p.m.,\u00a0officials said. A nearby daycare center and preschool was also locked down. Los Angeles County Registrar Dean Logan said the shooting affected two polling stations. He urged voters to avoid the area and \u201cif necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location.\u201d Los Angeles Times staff writer Matt Hamilton contributed to this report. ",

The two candidates campaigned intensely in Virginia, where it remained too early to determine a winner as polls closed across the commonwealth. And in Georgia, a Southern state where Democrats had expressed hope for a surprise victory, the race also appeared too close to call shortly after balloting ended. A race that has been dominated by ugly, personal attacks appears to have taken a toll on voters, and the country\u2019s mood appears darker and more pessimistic than it was four years ago, with about 60 percent of voters saying the country is seriously on the wrong track. Voters said they were eager for change in Washington, though they expressed dismay that issues had been overlooked in the brutal, long and nasty campaign. Here are some of the day\u2019s other highlights: \u2022 Does anyone trust the presidential hopefuls? Months of personal character attacks by both candidates appear to have left voters largely dissatisfied with their choices, according to early exit polls: Only about four in 10 voters viewed Mrs. Clinton as honest and trustworthy, while slightly fewer said that Mr. Trump was honest. \u2022 Whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is better? Mrs. Clinton\u2019s experience appears to pass the test with voters, about half of whom said the former senator and secretary of state was qualified to serve as president. Fewer than four in 10 said the same of Mr. Trump, who has embraced his status as a businessman and a Washington outsider.

More than four in 10 voters said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email controversies bothered them \u201ca lot,\u201d while a larger proportion \u2014 six in 10 \u2014 said they were bothered a lot by Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women. \u2022 So is this a record-breaking day for voter turnout? It is hard to say just yet. The Times\u2019s Steve Eder reports that voting was robust in the bellwether state of Florida; by 1 p.m., more than 900,000 voters had cast ballots in Miami-Dade County, surpassing the total turnout from four years ago. But in Lucas County, Ohio, data from the first part of the day suggested that voting tallies would be on par with 2008 and 2012, officials with the board of elections said. \u2022 The Hispanic population, a sleeping giant, is now awake. The Hispanic turnout will be far higher than it was in 2012. It has the best shot of deciding the election in Florida, where Hispanic voters represent a well-above-average share of the population. Trump campaign sues over Nevada voting. Video Nevada Judge Denies Trump Campaign\u2019s Suit A Nevada judge denied a request by Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign to preserve documents from early voting sites in Las Vegas, after the campaign alleged voting irregularities. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Judge Gloria Sturman asked Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer in one exchange. embed The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to have votes in Nevada impounded on the grounds that poll workers illegally extended early-voting hours to accommodate people who were waiting in long lines. Thousands of Hispanic voters lined up outside polling places to vote on Friday in Clark County, which is home to Las Vegas and has the state\u2019s largest Hispanic population. Record turnout has raised fears among Republicans that they could lose the battleground state, and Trump campaign officials have been complaining that the extension of hours in some locations is evidence that the election is rigged. The lawsuit alleges that the people were allowed to vote illegally because they cast ballots after the published closing times at polling places. The campaign also sent a letter to Nevada\u2019s secretary of state asking for an investigation into the allegations of \u201cegregious violations.\u201d Clinton and Trump vote.

Mr. Trump appeared to be in good spirits when he arrived at a Manhattan polling place on the Upper East Side just before 11 a.m. with his wife, Melania, to vote for himself . He was met with a mix of cheers and boos as he left his motorcade and waved to pedestrians. Inside Public School 59, Mr. Trump shook hands with other voters and offered high-fives to some children who came along with their parents. The vice-presidential candidates also voted in the morning.

Those signatures must be verified by 7 p.m. Tuesday or their ballots don't count, said Elizabeth Bartholomew, executive assistant at the Maricopa County Elections Department. Approximately 2,000 ballots received by elections officials had no signature, and voters who sent in those ballots are required to report to elections officials at their polling place or main County Election Office. Some 5,000 ballots had signatures but were in question, because they did not match those on record with their County Elections Department voter registration form. The 5,000 voters have been contacted by phone, e-mail and mail, Bartholomew said. Voters contacted by phone could verify their identity/verify their signature by giving their date of birth, address, or social security number, said Bartholomew. Voters who did not sign their ballot needed to resolve the issue by going to their polling place before the polls close at 7 p.m. or going to the County Election Department Office, also known MCTEC Office.

    "text": "Nov 8, 2016 5:56 PM EST No one ever said democracy was cheap. Americans who are running for federal elective offices spent more than ever -- about $6.8 billion -- in that pursuit, including the nastiest presidential election in recent memory, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. That\u2019s more than what consumers spend on cereal ($6 billion), pet grooming ($5.4 billion) and legal marijuana ($5.4 billion). The nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics estimates spending on the Clinton-Trump contest at more than $2.65 billion, actually down a bit from $2.76 billion in 2012 when Democratic incumbent Barack Obama defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney. \u00a0 Trump, a real estate tycoon, bought fewer ads than many experts predicted because he benefited from huge amounts of free press. Candidates seeking House and Senate and the independent groups supporting them are expected to shell out $4.26 billion this year versus $3.85 billion during the 2012 presidential election.\u00a0 Charles Koch on the millions spent on politics, and his influence on politics \u201cIt\u2019s only down slightly when you adjust for inflation,\u201d said Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics . \u201cThat, I believe, is because you had two active primaries. In 2012, we only had one.\u201d Clinton\u2019s primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, ran a surprisingly tough campaign and raised more than $228 million, mostly from small donors. Trump defeated more than a dozen GOP primary rivals, including early favorites such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The Supreme Court\u2019s controversial \u201cCitizens United\u201d decision upended the campaign finance system in 2010 by throwing out restrictions on political spending by independent groups. In the current race, so-called Super Pacs have raised nearly $600 million (including $189.4 million for Clinton and $59.3 million for Trump.)\u00a0 Sanders made overturning \u201cCitizens United\u201d a focal point of his campaign, and Clinton supports a constitutional amendment to scrap the decision. \u201cWe see more money going toward Super Pacs because they didn\u2019t exist before Citizens United,\u201d she said, adding that the groups are \u201cable to raise more and more and more than anybody imagined. That makes the overall cost of the election go up even more quickly.\u201d According to The Washington Post , 10 mega-donors have been especially generous donors to Super Pacs, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, former New York mayor and media tycoon Michael Bloomberg and billionaire George Soros. As more money floods into politics, voters\u2019 cynicism becomes more pronounced. According to Gallup , the majority of Americans have negative views of both presidential candidates. Only 31 percent thought the election process was working as well as it should, not to mention whether the costs are justified. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

Immigrant advocates in Las Vegas worked to get more U.S.-born Latinos to the polls on Election Day as early voter numbers suggest a surge in Hispanic voters. Lima voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russell Contreras / AP Donald Trump opened his White House bid by stoking fears of Mexicans flooding the border. But in the end, it may be a Latino voter surge that walls him out. In states crucial to Trump's win, Hispanics have had an outsized presence at the polls, waiting out long lines in Florida, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and other states. In the crucial battleground state of Florida, 565,000 Latinos had voted early, in person, a 100 percent increase over 2012, the Miami Herald reported . The total rises to 911,000 with absentee ballots.

The turnout appears to favor Clinton, with high turnout rates in Democratic counties. The best visual evidence of a potential Latino surge came last week when early voting hours had to be extended in Nevada because so many people, largely Latinos, were in line at Cardenas grocery store in Las Vegas. This led Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston, an expert in the state's politics, to warn the GOP in a tweet that it was time to panic and to give his own twist to Trump's opening salvo on Mexicans. \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, will stop me from being president.\" \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) November 5, 2016 Not to be overlooked is the fact that so many Latinos are voting early at all. \"Latinos are overwhelmingly 'day of' voters. They are a voting bloc that decides late and decisively and it's on Election Day when you see (these) voters start to show up,\" said Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist and principal at California based Grassroots Lab. But not this year. A Telemundo/NALEO tracking poll finds that half of Latino registered voters are expected to have cast their ballots before Election Day. That almost matches the total share of early and Election Day voting in 2008 as well as in 2012. The 'Trump Factor?' Exactly how the perennially underperforming Latino electorate was mobilized in 2016 and who did it best will be dissected for days after the election. But for now, everyone agrees on a key mobilizing factor: \"This has everything to do with Donald Trump,\" said Madrid. Members of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, cheer during a rally under a Donald Trump pinata in Las Vegas on Nov. 7, 2016. Russell Contreras / AP The GOP strategist noted that even California has seen increased Latino early voting, something which had continuously eluded the state. \"We've been making it easier to vote for 20 years and turnout had been going down.\" It's not just the number of Latinos going to the polls which has increased, but a greater share of the Hispanic electorate, according to Gary Segura, a Clinton pollster. This means that the increased voting is not just a result of the growing Latino population but of increased participation. Trump launched his campaign with a clear message on who was in his sights. \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best. They're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems,\" Trump said in his speech at Trump Tower in New York last June.

They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.\" Trump pledged to build a wall up and down the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it. Before his supporters started yelling \"Lock Her Up\" about Hillary Clinton, their chant of choice was \"Build The Wall.\" Trump touted throughout his campaign that Hispanics \"love me\" and that his argument was against illegal immigration. RELATED: Donald Trump: 'I Will Win the Latino Vote' But beyond Mexicans, most Latinos did not see it as criticism about immigration policy but criticism about them. \"It's the perception that he is anti-us,\" Edwin Mel\u00e9ndez, a Puerto Rican scholar, told NBC News. \"I think any other [Republican] candidate would have split the vote a different way.\" In this Feb. 22, 2016 photo, Donald Trump pinatas hang from the ceiling among more traditional ones at El Paisano in Santa Fe, N.M. Luis Sanchez Saturno / AP Latino groups and the Clinton campaign harnessed the visceral reaction to Trump's incendiary rhetoric and ran with it. Clinton's campaign worked Latino cultural touchstones to connect with voters, including women's tamale parties with Trump pi\u00f1atas, Spanglish campaign ads aimed at \"bilennials\" and campaign events with Dreamers, the young immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. In Miami, Clinton supporters handed out pastelitos, or Cuban pastries, to early voters and coaxed Cuban Americans, who historically have voted Republican, to go Democrat this year. RELATED: Parties Make Final Push for Central Florida's Puerto Rican Votes Latino entertainers like JLo and Marc Anthony, the Mexican group Man\u00e1 and traditional crooners like Vicente Fernandez exhorted the community to vote against someone who \"offended\" the community, as Fernandez sang in a traditional \"corrido.\" And remarks by Trump and his surrogates \u2014 taco trucks on every corner, #badhombres, #ThatMexicanThing, Again \u2014 provided additional fuel against the Republican nominee. RELATED: Latinos for Trump Founder: 'Defend Your Country' from Hispanics \"A cornerstone of Latino culture is to show respect and act with dignity, and so the incendiary and downright un-American things Donald Trump said of many U.S. citizens - not just Latinos - is one aspect of what's fueled the increase of the Latino electorate, whether they be seasoned, young, or new voters,\" said Lorena Chambers, a Democratic strategist who has been working with Priorities USA, a Clinton supporting PAC, on political ads to reach Latino voters. This year marked a shift in spending on Latino mobilization: Money moved from non-profit, non-partisan groups to organizations that could name candidates and where they stand on issues. The Center for Community Change Action were part of a $15 million effort to turn out registered Latino voters as well as immigrant voters in Colorado, Florida and Nevada. Kica Matos, the center's director of immigrant rights and social justice, said that Trump's rhetoric and policies spurred the group to launch a partisan campaign to endorse progressive candidates. In talking with prospective Latino voters, canvassers asked what issues were important to them and then told them which candidates stood with them. \"My gut tells me in many ways Trump crystallized the issues,\" Matos said.

By Philip Bump November 8 at 6:45 PM Follow @pbump A voter with a dog waits with others in line to enter a polling station to vote for the next US president in the general election, at a school gymnasium in New York, November 8, 2016. (ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook predicted that the 2016 election would see the largest number of voters in American history. That's a less bold prediction than it may seem; the population of the United States increases at a pretty steady clip, meaning that a four-year gap between elections results in a lot more newly eligible voters. But it's also the case that more turnout is generally seen to benefit Democrats, given that the factors that indicate a high-frequency voter -- age and income in particular -- correlate to more Republican voters. Get those less-frequent voters to the polls, and one would expect Democrats to benefit. While early voting was underway, we saw reports from several states that turnout numbers were exceeding 2012 levels. (2012 was the exception to the rule in the first paragraph; turnout was down from 2008.) Now, with voters casting ballots on Election Day itself, there are reports that vote totals in two critical states, Pennsylvania and Florida, have exceeded or will exceed past turnout numbers. PA official: Voter turnout today could exceed 80%. Would be highest total since Bill Clinton vs George HW Bush in 1992 (83%) \u2014 Ken Rice (@kenricekdka) November 8, 2016 Key counties of Miami Dade, Hillsborough, and Broward have also surpassed 2012 turnout. https://t.co/xUREx8iAQL \u2014 Lily Adams (@adamslily) November 8, 2016 With that in mind, we put together a little tool allowing you to track past turnout in the 12 closest states.

The first is that the pool of possible voters is the voting-eligible population, a larger group of people than simply those who are eligible to vote. In other words, this isn't an assessment of how many registered voters cast ballots, it's a measure of how many eligible citizens did. The number of ballots we use below is the number cast for the highest office on the ballot. In presidential election years, that's obviously the presidency. It's those columns that you'll want to keep an eye on as results come in. Those are the ballots cast in the election, and it's the number that turnout records will need to beat. Donald Trump's campaign will argue that spiking turnout is a sign they're doing well. After all, Trump's argued that he'll pull infrequent voters to the polls after being inspired by his candidacy. It's a reminder that big statewide turnout doesn't necessarily tell us who all those voters are voting for. politics ",
