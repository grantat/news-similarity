Radhia Achouri with the U.N. peacekeeping mission known as MINUSMA, said a Togolese peacekeeper was killed Sunday morning along with two civilians when the convoy was attacked in Gourma. Seven other peacekeepers were wounded, three of them seriously, Achouri said. The attack came several hours after other jihadists assaulted a Malian military camp in nearby Gourma-Rharous. While there were no casualties, residents say the militants were able to steal five army vehicles including an ambulance. Northern Mali was occupied in 2012 by al-Qaida-linked groups before being forced from power in a French-led military operation the following year. 0 Shares ",

Seth Wenig/AP Mary Keitany of Kenya won her third consecutive New York City Marathon on Sunday, finishing in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 26 seconds, and leaving her closest competitors in the dust. Keitany pulled away from the elite women's pack less than halfway into the race and ran most of the race alone, her No. 1 spot uncontested over more than a dozen miles. The men's race was more conventional, with a pack of elite runners sticking together for more than half of the 26.2 mile course before 20-year-old Eritrean runner Ghirmay Ghebreslassie pulled away. He crossed the finish line in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 51 seconds, becoming the youngest man ever to win .

Jason DeCrow/AP Lucas Rotich of Kenya finished second in the men's field. Abdi Abdirahman, an American, finished third. Ghebreslassie finished fourth at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro over the summer. But Keitany was cut from Kenya's Olympic team \u2014 despite being the second fastest female marathoner ever. According to the International Association of Athletics Federations, only Paula Radcliffe has ever run a faster time than Keitany's 2012 London marathon time of 2 hours 18 minutes 37 seconds. Article continues after sponsorship What Makes Kenya's Marathon Runners The World's Best? Sunday was Keitany's triumphant return, showing that she could not only win, but do so without the luxury of fellow elite runners to pace her throughout the race. Sally Kipyego of Kenya took second place in the women's race with a time more than three minutes slower than Keitany's. Molly Huddle of the United States was third. In the women's wheelchair race, the American Tatyana McFadden won her fourth New York City Marathon title in a row, and her fifth overall, according to the official race press release . McFadden has dominated wheelchair racing since 2004 , when she won her first Paralympic Games medal as a 15-year-old. In 2012, she described how she won the right to compete as a young athlete at Atholton High in Howard County, Md.

Elsa/Getty Images NPR's Joseph Shapiro reported: \"[McFadden] wanted to be part of the high school track team. But on the eve of the first track meet, the coach refused to give her a uniform. She wouldn't be allowed to compete. \"After her mother complained, Tatyana was allowed to race, but not side-by-side with her teammates. At her first meet, her teammates and other competitors in the 400-meter race ran first. Then the track meet stopped and Tatyana was allowed to race \u2014 going around the track in her wheelchair, racing against no one. 'That was the most humiliating, embarrassing thing I've ever done, ever,' she says. \"She didn't want to be the girl in the wheelchair; even then, she wanted to be seen as a top athlete. 'People look at you and in their minds [they] see, 'Oh, the girl with a disability in a wheelchair is running for a high school team. Congratulations.' And for me as an elite athlete, it's not what you want as an elite athlete.'\" On the men's side, Marcel Hug of Switzerland narrowly won the wheelchair event, edging out Kurt Fearnley by six hundredths of a second, according to race regulators. Marcel Hug of Switzerland, right, crosses the finish line first, just ahead of Kurt Fearnley of Australia, in the men's wheelchair division of the 2016 New York City Marathon on Sunday.

Grace Beahm/AP hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/AP Dylann Roof appears with lawyers Bill McGuire and Chief Public Defender Ashley Pennington at a court hearing in Charleston, S.C., on July 16, 2015. Grace Beahm/AP Jury selection begins Monday in the trial of 22-year-old Dylann Roof for the alleged murder of nine people at a historically black church in downtown Charleston, S.C. in 2015. The Charleston Post and Courier reported the 12 jurors will be chosen from a pool of more than 700 people, and the jury selection process \"is expected to take weeks.\" The U.S. Justice Department is seeking the death penalty for Roof, who faces 33 federal hate crime charges . Roof is pleading not guilty. As the Two-Way has reported : \"The federal hate-crime charges against Roof \"'center on both the victims' race and their identity as churchgoers who were attempting to follow their religious beliefs when Roof attacked.' At the time, [Attorney General Loretta Lynch] called hate crimes 'the original domestic terrorism.' \"Roof also faces federal weapons charges. \"The Justice Department says he selected the [ Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church ] and his victims to win notoriety and to try to ignite a race war.\" Roof appeared to have set up a website that included a \"manifesto-like diatribe against non-whites,\" as we have reported . Article continues after sponsorship The trial of Roof will take place across the street from another racially-charged trial set to resume Monday in Charleston. Former Charleston police officer Michael Slager is accused of murder for the 2015 shooting of Walter Scott , an unarmed black man, in North Charleston. The jury in that case heard opening arguments last week. Justice Department To Seek Death Penalty For S.C. Church Shooting Suspect Dylann Roof is accused of opening fire at a Wednesday-evening bible study group at the church on June 17, 2015. The church's reverend, Clementa Pinckney, was among the nine people who died. President Obama delivered a eulogy at a memorial service for Pinckney , who was also a South Carolina state senator. \"Blinded by hatred, the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding him,\" the president said in his eulogy . Relatives of Roof told the Post and Courier last week they are \"still in anguish and shock that a member of our family could have committed such a terrible, senseless crime\" and are \"still struggling to understand why Dylann caused so much grief and pain to so many good people.\" Roof faces separate murder charges brought by the state of South Carolina, which is also seeking the death penalty. The state trial is set to begin in January. FBI Says Background Check Error Let Charleston Shooting Suspect Buy Gun Both the federal and state charges include weapons offenses. The FBI said Roof should not have been allowed to purchase a handgun because he had previously \"admitted to possessing a controlled substance.\" As we have reported , FBI Director James Comey said an error in the background check system led to the purchase: \"Comey said flaws in paperwork and communication between a federal background check worker and state law enforcement allowed Dylann Roof to buy a handgun in South Carolina on April 16 \u2014 weeks before he allegedly attacked black churchgoers in a failed attempt to fuel a race war. \"'We are all sick that this has happened,' Comey told reporters Friday. 'We wish we could turn back the clock. ... What we can do is make sure we learn from it, get better.' \"Comey said he had ordered an internal review of FBI policies and procedures surrounding background checks for weapons purchases.\" Families of the victims in the shooting are suing the FBI for negligence for the agency's failure to prevent Roof from buying the weapon. In October, the FBI filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the FBI did not have the authority to prevent the sale. ",

In July, after a year-long investigation, the FBI concluded that charges against Clinton were not warranted, saying agents had not found any evidence that Clinton knowingly sent or received classified information on the server.

Todd Kohlhepp, 45, pointed out two more grave sites on his property and told investigators he killed four people in 2003, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. Kohlhepp was denied bond Sunday. At a news conference Sunday, Wright told reporters that a site found in a wooded area contained human remains that hadn't yet been identified. \"We are in the process of trying to get that person removed and get a positive identification,\" Wright said. \"We can't tell anything about the cause of death, the gender, how long, any of that stuff.\" Wright added that authorities hadn't yet found the possible additional site. The confirmed number of deaths linked to Kohlepp is five, Wright said. On Saturday, Wright and the county coroner identified a body found in a shallow grave Friday as that of Charlie Carver, the missing boyfriend of Kala Brown, the woman who was found chained alive. Brown, 30, was found Thursday when deputies investigating a tip about a sex crime heard banging from inside a metal container. Brown told investigators that she witnessed her captor shoot and kill Carver, her boyfriend who went missing with her in August, local prosecutor Barry Barnette said at a bond hearing Friday. The four people killed in the 2003 cold case were identified as Scott Ponder, Beverly Guy, Brian Lucas and Chris Sherbert, NBC station WYFF of Greenville reported . They were found shot to death at a Superbike Motorsports near Chesnee. \"He told us some stuff that nobody ought to know,\" Wright said. \"The solicitor and the investigators who have been working case said it was good. We've got four murder warrants signed on him.\" Kohlhepp had been charged with kidnapping. As of Saturday night, he was also charged with four counts of murder, according to jail records. Wright said Kohlhepp would soon be charged in Carver's death. Brian Lucas' father, Tom, told WYFF on Sunday that he was thankful that police made the discovery. \"It's just a miracle that something like this would snap together,\" he said. Another relative, Terry Guy, lost his wife, Guy, and stepson, Ponder, in the quadruple murder. He told WYFF that Kohlepp didn't appear remorseful during a court hearing. Still, Guy added that he wanted to \"actually pray with the gentleman, [to] look him in the eye and tell him, 'I forgive you.'\" Todd Christopher Kohlhepp South Carolina SAVIN Missing Pieces Network, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving families of the missing, abducted or murdered, said it has identified \"six or seven other women\" who have disappeared close to the area that Brown was found. So far, the group has identified two women to NBC News: Tracy Wright and Tammy Kingery who have gone missing \u2014 the former as recently as three weeks ago. Wright said Sunday that it \"very possible\" that the remains discovered Sunday were connected to other missing persons cases in the area. He added that authorities were searching other properties within the state and elsewhere connected to Kohlhepp. \"We're not limiting our investigation to South Carolina at all,\" he said. Court records obtained by WYFF reveal Kohlhepp has a history of abduction and violent behavior. Phil Helsel ",

News and the Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail 9 a.m. EST November 7, 2016 x Share The South Carolina realtor is charged in multiple murders as well as kidnapping a woman and chaining her up in a storage shed. His criminal past goes way beyond that. USA TODAY NETWORK Todd Kohlhepp, 45, of Moore, S.C., is escorted Nov. 4, 2016, into a Spartanburg County magistrate courtroom for a bond hearing. (Photo: Tim Kimzey, AP) WOODRUFF, S.C.\u00a0\u2014 A man charged with kidnapping a 30-year-old South Carolina woman and keeping her chained in a storage shed was charged with four counts of murder Sunday in connection with a quadruple homicide \u00a0that took place exactly 13 years ago. Todd Kohlhepp, 45, of Moore, S.C., now is\u00a0suspected in the deaths of as many as seven people, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said. Kohlhepp was charged Sunday in connection with the deaths of four people\u00a0at a motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., in 2003. Kohlhepp was denied bond and his next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 19. Kohlhepp is a real-estate agent who received his license 10 years ago from the South Carolina Real Estate Commission. He has been a registered sex offender since he was released from prison in 2001 after serving a 15-year kidnapping sentence for the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old neighbor in Tempe, Ariz., when he was 15. Kohlhepp moved to South Carolina after his prison term, got a pilot's license, earned a degree at the University of South Carolina Upstate and began pursuing a real-estate career, lying on his application about the details of his 1987 conviction. He owns a house in Moore, two\u00a0BMW automobiles that police have confiscated, a motorcycle and a 95-acre property\u00a0near Woodruff. Authorities have been scouring that property since Thursday when they discovered Kala Brown, 30, of Anderson, S.C., \"chained like a dog\" at the neck and ankles in a locked metal storage shed on the partially wooded site. Buried body ID'd as slain boyfriend of chained woman County coroner Rusty Clevenger identified the remains of her boyfriend of a few months, Charles Carver, 32, of Anderson, on Saturday, a day after a body was dug up\u00a0on the property.\u00a0Investigators took Kohlhepp to the scene Saturday\u00a0and said he\u00a0has confessed to both the murders of Carver and the four for whom he's been charged. Brown told investigators that she had watched Kohlhepp shoot her boyfriend. Family and friends reported the pair missing in early September after Carver's mother, Joanne Shiflet of Starr, S.C., said they went to Woodruff to talk to Kohlhepp about clearing some of the property for him. When Brown was found, she told investigators that as many as four people could be buried on Kohlhepp's property.\u00a0He bought the property, considered agricultural land, in May 2014 for more than $305,000; he bought his two-story house in Moore, less than 10 miles north, for $137,500 in January 2007. On Nov. 6, 2003, two years after Kohlhepp was released from prison,\u00a0Scott Ponder, 30; his 52-year-old mother and part-time employee, Beverly Guy; and employees Brian Lucas, 29, and Chris Sherbert, 26, were found brutally slain at Superbike Motorsports, Wright said. The case was the county's first quadruple homicide. x Share Todd Kohlhepp faces four counts of murder in the killings more than a decade ago at Superbike Motorsports in Chesnee, South Carolina. Investigators say Kohlhepp has confessed to killing four people at a motorcycle shop in 2003. (Nov. 6) AP Families of some of Kohlhepp\u2019s alleged victims comforted each other Sunday as he\u00a0stood before the Spartanburg County magistrate Jimmy Henson. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and acknowledging only the magistrate and law-enforcement officers, the short-haired, 5-foot-11, 300-pound man was told he could face the death penalty. Kohlhepp quietly answered \u201cyes sir\u201d or \u201cno sir\u201d to Henson's questions. Asked if he wanted to make a statement to victims\u2019 families, he said, \u201cNot at this time, sir. As teen in rape case, multiple murder suspect called 'devil on a chain' Terry Guy, the husband of Beverly Guy and stepfather of Scott Ponder,\u00a0was among victim family members who attended Sunday\u2019s bond hearing. \u201cWhen this first happened I got on my knees for 11 months and told God how much I hated him,\u201d Guy said. \u201cI lost 70 pounds, and I prayed every night, \u2018Please don\u2019t let me wake up in the morning.\u2019 I kept waking up, so I came to a conclusion that I knew it wasn\u2019t right for me to kill myself. \u201cMy emotions are running from joy to crying\u2026 to even feeling sorry for the family that has to come down here and watch their son today. The only thing I don\u2019t want anybody to misunderstand is the gentleman has to pay for it.\u201d Investigators accompany Todd Kohlhepp, 45, of Moore, S.C., in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit for a walk Nov. 5, 2016, on his 95-acre partially wooded property in Woodruff, S.C., where one body has been found. \u00a0(Photo: Heidi Heilbrunn, The Greenville (S.C.) News) Tom Lucas, the father of Brian Lucas, said he attended so he could see Kohlhepp\u2019s face. \u201cHe looked just like anybody else on the street, man,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYou think when you finally get there that there are these TV criminals and things like that, but this guy looks like everybody else. That scares me.\u201d Doris Henry, the sister of Beverly Guy, said she had no message for Kohlhepp just as he had no message for victims\u2019 families. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how anyone could take somebody else\u2019s life,\u201d she said.

Thousands attended the November 6, Sunday afternoon event at the Osceola Heritage Park Stadium. (Photo: TIM SHORTT/FLORIDA TODAY) 654 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 90 COMMENTEMAILMORE KISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014\u00a0With Election Day looming Tuesday, President Obama urged Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters in this critical battleground state to cast votes and \u201chelp finish what we started eight years ago.\u201d \u201cNow here\u2019s the thing though, Florida: All the progress we\u2019ve made goes out the window if we don\u2019t win this election. And we win this election if we win Florida,\u201d Obama said during a rally Sunday in Kissimmee. \u201cIf we win Florida, it\u2019s a wrap. We win Florida, it\u2019s over. So we\u2019ve got to work our hearts out this week \u2014\u00a0these next two days \u2014\u00a0as if our future depends on it,\u201d he said. FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email An estimated 11,000 people attended the afternoon event, braving occasional rainfall to pack the stands and infield area of Osceola County Stadium, the former spring training home of the Houston Astros. Obama spoke from a podium near the third-base line alongside a large U.S. flag. Rows of letters posted inside the ballpark displayed the pro-Clinton messages \u201cStronger Together\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m With Her,\u201d and he led the crowd in chants of \u201cHillary!\u201d and \u201cUSA!\u201d President Obama campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee. Thousands attended the November 6, Sunday afternoon event at the Osceola Heritage Park Stadium. \u00a0(Photo: TIM SHORTT/FLORIDA TODAY) During his roughly 30-minute speech, Obama cited his economic accomplishments in office; praised Clinton\u2019s work ethic by calling her \u201cthe Energizer bunny;\u201d and urged attendees to vote for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy. \u201cyou can\u2019t stick her with a Republican Congress that behaves the way they\u2019ve been behaving with me.\u201d Obama also denounced Republican candidate Donald Trump on multiple fronts, saying \u201cour democracy is on the ballot\u201d and Trump\u2019s character makes him uniquely unqualified to serve as commander-in-chief. With focus on Trump and black voters, Clinton makes closing argument \u201cIf somebody can\u2019t handle a Twitter account, they can\u2019t handle the nuclear codes. If somebody starts tweeting at 3 in the morning because SNL\u00a0made fun of him, then you can\u2019t handle the nuclear codes,\u201d Obama said, drawing laughs from the crowd. Before Obama\u2019s remarks, Motown legend Stevie Wonder performed a handful of hits from a musical stage set up just beyond the infield. A Puerto Rican festival and parade outside the ballpark at surrounding Osceola Heritage Park added to the diverse flavor of the event.

Islamic State fighters launch counterattacks in the thin strip of territory Iraqi special forces have recaptured in eastern Mosul, highlighting the challenges ahead as the battle moves into more densely populated neighborhoods where coalition air power must be used more selectively. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana) 0 Shares Email Iraq's special forces worked Sunday to clear neighborhoods on the eastern edge of Islamic State-held Mosul as bombings launched by the extremist group elsewhere in the country killed at least 20 people. The Mosul offensive has slowed in recent days as Iraqi forces have pushed into more densely populated areas, where they cannot rely as much on airstrikes and shelling because of the risk posed to civilians, who have been told to stay in their homes. \"There are a lot of civilians and we are trying to protect them,\" said Lt. Col. Muhanad al-Timimi. \"This is one of the hardest battles that we've faced till now.\" Some civilians are fleeing the combat zone, while IS militants are holding others back for use as human shields, making it harder for Iraqi commanders on the ground to get approval for requested U.S.-led coalition air strikes. Iraq's special forces are some of the country's best troops, but they still largely rely on air support to clear terrain. Iraqi forces first entered the eastern edge of the city on Tuesday. On Friday, forces began pushing into Mosul proper, but so far have advanced just over a kilometer (mile) into the city. On the southern front, Iraqi forces are still some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the city center. The fighting is centered on the town of Hamam al-Alil, where Associated Press journalists could hear gunfire and saw attack helicopters firing on IS positions. Kurdish peshmerga fighters launched mortar rounds and fired heavy artillery at the IS-held town of Bashiqa, about 8 miles (13 kilometers) northeast of Mosul. The town, which is believed to be largely empty except for IS militants, has been encircled by Kurdish forces. The extremists captured Mosul and surrounding areas in 2014, and have had plenty of time to dig trenches, block off roads and mine approaches to the city. \"Daesh dug trenches that they filled with water and they have a lot of suicide attackers and car bombs,\" said al-Timimi, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group. The extremists meanwhile struck far from the front lines with a series of bombings. The deadliest attack took place in the city of Samarra, 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of Baghdad, which is home to a major Shiite shrine. Provincial spokesman Ali al-Hamdani said the attacker set off a bomb-packed ambulance in a parking lot near Shiite pilgrims before detonating his explosives vest. The attack killed 11 people, including at least four Iranians, and wounded up to 100 other people. Another suicide attacker rammed an explosives-laden car into a busy checkpoint outside the city of Tikrit, killing at least nine people. Al-Hamdani said five female students, a woman and three policemen were killed in the attack, while 25 others were wounded. IS had also captured Tikrit during its lightning blitz across Iraq in the summer of 2014. Iraqi forces drove the militants from the city, around 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Baghdad, in April 2015. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, condemned the two attacks, which he said had killed 21 people, including 10 Iranian pilgrims, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting tolls, which are common in the chaotic aftermath of attacks. In an online statement, IS claimed all three bombings and said the ambulance bomb was set off by a second suicide attacker. The AP could not verify the authenticity of the statement, which was posted on a militant website commonly used by the extremists. In the capital, Baghdad, a series of smaller bombings killed at least 10 people and wounded 21 others, according to police and medical officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. No one immediately claimed the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of IS. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Sinan Salaheddin and Murtada Faraj in Baghdad, Cristiana Mesquita near Bashiqa, Iraq, Balint Szlanko near Hamam al-Alil, Iraq, and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

By Chris Cillizza November 6 at 5:58 PM Follow @thefix FBI Director James B. Comey told lawmakers on Nov. 6 that the bureau won't recommend charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing newly discovered emails. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Nine days ago, FBI Director James B. Comey shook the political world with a letter to Congress noting that emails \u201cpertinent\u201d to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server had been discovered on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Today, 48 hours before Election Day, Comey sent another letter to key leaders in Congress \u2014 this one making clear that no charges would be brought against Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cWe have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Comey wrote. Um, what? Comey had to know that he would set off a political whirlwind with his first letter. The FBI investigation of Clinton's emails \u2014 and the fact that she used a private server exclusively during her time as secretary of state \u2014 has been an anchor around her campaign's neck for the entirety of the presidential race. Clearing Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing \u2014 while simultaneously blasting her judgment \u2014 in July, Comey seemed to put a stop to the political impact of the email controversy. To then turn around so incredibly close to the election and publicly announce that an investigation that had lain dormant for months was now back on because of the emails found on Weiner's computer suggested that there was some there there. And, the fact that investigators working on a case involving Weiner had known about the Clinton-related emails for weeks and had briefed Comey on them before he went public seemed to bolster the case that the director had a strong suspicion that something beyond what had already been discovered was on Weiner's computer. After all, it would be the height of irresponsibility to inject the email controversy back into the campaign on the off chance that something on Weiner's computer might implicate Clinton. If Comey had no real indication that there was evidence of problems for Clinton \u2014 above and beyond the errors in judgment he had previously knocked her for \u2014 then why go public with anything? Comey defenders will insist that he was in a no-win situation. Acknowledge the investigation of the Clinton-related emails on Weiner's computer publicly, find nothing, get blamed. Keep the investigation private until after the election and be accused by Republicans of pulling punches to help get Clinton elected. Sure, sort of. If this had been 2014 or even 2015, it's easy to see how Comey could and should make the choice he did. But, it's impossible to say that he and the FBI operate entirely outside of the political world or that the same rules of the road apply when it comes to when and whether things should be made public. Referees in the National Basketball Association ref the first 44 minutes (or so) of a game differently than they ref the final four minutes. They understand that in the final four minutes, the bar for a foul is higher because the stakes are raised. Shooting two free throws in a two-point game in the first quarter is very different from doing the same thing with 35 seconds left in the game. Same goes for Comey. He needed to understand that to say something about Clinton's email investigation so close to the election meant that he had very real concerns about the possibility of a president-elect being indicted. To simply say \u2014 after a nine-day hurricane of news stories about Clinton's emails \u2014 that there was never anything to see here is a remarkable swing and miss on Comey's part. The Clinton campaign won't say much about Sunday's Comey announcement for fear of re-injecting the FBI and her emails into the conversation in these last few days of the campaign. But, if I were them \u2014 or lots of down-ballot Democrats \u2014 I would be livid. politics ",

The news comes more than one year after P\u00f6tsch was named chairman; last December, he acknowledged that the emissions cheating had stemmed from a \"chain of errors\" in the company rather than from the actions of a group of rogue engineers. P\u00f6tsch was Volkswagen's chief financial officer from 2003 to 2015 \u2014 a period that encapsulates the company's development of cheating devices that could fool U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines. The Environmental Protection Agency's list of affected model years runs from 2009 to 2015. Volkswagen announced the new development Sunday, saying that despite the Braunschweig public prosecutor's move, the company \"reaffirms its belief that the Volkswagen Board of Management duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law.\" NPR thanks our sponsors ",

Clinton gets support from 44 percent of likely voters, while Trump gets 40 percent, the poll shows. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson is at 6 percent, and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 2 percent. In a two-way contest without Johnson and Stein, Clinton's advantage over Trump expands to five points, 48 percent to 43 percent. Clinton's current lead over Trump is down from the 11-point edge she enjoyed in the four-way horserace in the previous NBC/WSJ poll in mid-October, 48 percent to 37 percent. That poll was conducted after 2005 video of Trump surfaced with him saying that \"you can do anything\" to women when you are a star like he is. \"Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.\" In the two-way contest last month, Clinton's lead was 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent. This newest poll - conducted Nov. 3-5 of more than 1,200 likely voters - comes after the letter FBI Director James Comey sent to Congress on Oct. 28 saying that the FBI had \"learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent\" to the investigation of Clinton. Clinton maintains double-digit lead with women Looking inside the numbers of the two-way horserace, Clinton is ahead of Trump among women (53 percent to 38 percent), African Americans (86 percent to 7 percent), Latinos (65 percent to 20 percent) and those ages 18-34 (55 percent to 32 percent). Trump, meanwhile, leads among men (47 percent to 42 percent), seniors (49 percent to 42 percent) and whites (53 percent to 38 percent). But there's a significant difference among whites: Those without college degrees are breaking for Trump by a 2-to-1 margin, 60 percent to 30 percent. Yet among whites with college degrees, Clinton is ahead by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent. Clinton leads among those who are early voters, 53 percent to 39 percent, while Trump is up among those who will wait to vote on Election Day, 48 percent to 41 percent. Majority feels comfortable with Clinton as president The NBC/WSJ poll also finds 52 percent of likely voters saying they would be comfortable and prepared to support Clinton as president if she wins on Tuesday night, versus 46 percent who say they wouldn't be comfortable. That's compared with just 43 percent of likely voters who say they would be comfortable with Trump as president. Fifty-four percent say they'd be uncomfortable. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Nov. 3-5 of 1,282 likely voters (including more than 600 reached by cell phone), and it has a margin of error of plus-minus 2.7 percentage points. The rest of the poll will be released at 5:00 pm ET. Mark Murray ",

USA TODAY, Collin Brennan FBI Director James Comey stepped into the 2016 spotlight again on Sunday with an announcement: The agency won't\u00a0recommend\u00a0charges against Hillary Clinton after all. Comey's statement\u00a0came nine days after\u00a0he announced a new review of the recently found emails that seemed\u00a0\"pertinent\" to the investigation. That news upended the race: Polls in the days following\u00a0 showed Donald Trump gaining ground , and critics blasted Comey for intruding into the campaign. It was all for naught, Comey said Sunday. The hot takes on Twitter were swift, and pretty much everyone was upset. This seems basically accurate: It's as if James Comey became convinced he left his straightener on, but instead of going home to check, he yelled, \"FIRE!\" on national TV. \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) November 6, 2016 Mike Huckabee, as always, was good for some folksy advice. Advice for Jim Comey: Get a dog; it's only friend you'll have in DC; GOP and Dems have both been outraged by his actions during election. \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 6, 2016 Cher, if you were wondering, was not happy about it. FBI DIRECTOR COMEY JUST SAID,HILLARY DID NOTHING WRONG\u203c\ufe0fHIS LACK OF JUDGMENT 4LAST TEN DAYS COULD HAVE COST HER THE PRESIDENCY,4 NOTHING\uf624 Matt \"Drudge Report\" Drudge was very excited for the drama. Comey's head-fake fake just made the hornets nest even crazier! 48 hours of madness upcoming!! \u2014 MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) November 6, 2016 Many agreed this did not make Comey look good: \"Comey\" is now the term for when you're so depressed you're convinced everybody hates you and you're doing everything wrong. \u2014 Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) November 6, 2016 Comey's had a distinguished career but this is the legacy equivalent of blowing a 3-1 lead in the finals. \u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) November 6, 2016 Comey has to be praying right now that Clinton wins \u2014 Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) November 6, 2016 Others reminded us there are still two days left in this election. Buckle up. Um, guys, Comey can write letters Monday and Tuesday, you know. \u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) November 6, 2016 OK.. Update....if you are Republican you can hate Comey again... if you are Democrat you can love him. Stay tuned if that changes before ED. ",

The Marine Corps Times reports the recruit had been assigned to the 2nd Recruit Training Battalion at the Marine Corps\u2019 East Coast training depot. Base officials said in a statement the recruit was found in his bed unconscious on Friday evening, and was pronounced dead sometime thereafter. The recruit\u2019s family has been notified, but the Marine Corps has not yet released official identification nor cause of death, reports The Island Packet . \u201cThe circumstances surrounding the recruit death is under investigation,\u201d base spokesman Capt. Greg Carroll told the publication. Naval Criminal Investigative Service spokesman Ed Buice told the Island Packet that so far there are no signs of foul play. In March, Raheel Siddiqui , a Muslim recruit, died after falling nearly 40 feet in a stairwell. The Marines claim he committed suicide amid a widespread culture of hazing and abuse in his battalion at Parris Island.\u00a0 Siddiqui\u2019s family disputed that finding, saying there\u2019s a lack of evidence that the 20-year-old Taylor, Michigan, resident killed himself. Regardless, the incident led to investigations into 20 officers and enlisted leaders at Parris Island, although the Marine Corps Times reports none of them have been charged, referred to court-martial or administratively disciplined.\u00a0 The same drill sergeant who assaulted Siddiqui was already under investigation for an earlier incident in which he allegedly ordered another Muslim recruit into an industrial clothes dryer. The recruit told investigators two drill sergeants accused him of being a terrorist and demanded to know if he was part of 9/11. When the recruit denied he was working for a terrorist organization, the drill sergeants closed the dryer and ran it for about 30 seconds. They repeated that at least two more times, burning the recruit on his neck and shoulders. The recruit testified he could smell alcohol on the drill sergeants\u2019 breath. The Marine Corps Times reports that in addition to the two deaths this year at Parris Island, another recruit who suffered severe injuries after falling two stories off the recruit processing center only four days after arriving at the training depot on Oct. 28 remains in critical condition. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

West Valley City police Officer Cody Brotherson was deploying tire spikes when he was hit, authorities said. He is the first officer to die in the line of duty since the department formed in 1980. \"A West Valley born and bred individual and our hearts are heavy with his loss,\" Police Chief Lee Russo said at a news conference just hours after the officer's death. According to Russo, it was not clear why the 25-year-old officer was outside his vehicle since spike strips had already been deployed before he was hit. \"He was certainly responding to the coordinated effort in stopping this vehicle,\" Russo said. However, the chief said it was not yet clear if the suspects deliberately hit Brotherson. Brotherson joined the department in December 2013. He is survived by a fiance, his parents and two brothers. Dozens of officers saluted as his body was loaded into a hearse, which was escorted by police cars to the state medical examiner's office. The incident began around 3:30 a.m. when an officer noticed a suspicious vehicle. Officers then witnessed three people in the car steal another vehicle from the parking lot of an apartment complex, police said. They tried to stop the vehicle but the suspects fled, leading to a pursuit. Less than a minute later, an officer called for medical help for Brotherson. He died at the scene. After hitting Brotherson, the vehicle went off the road and came to rest a short distance away. All three people in the stolen vehicle were taken into custody. They are still being questioned, police said. Their identities were not released. Another Salt Lake City-area police department will now lead the investigation. 0 Shares ",

Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department hide caption toggle caption Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Todd Kohlhepp, 45, was arrested for kidnapping Thursday; on Saturday, he confessed to a nearly 13-year-old quadruple homicide. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Days after the dramatic rescue of a woman that a local sheriff said had been \"chained like a dog\" and held prisoner in a metal storage container in Woodruff, S.C., officials say the man accused of that crime has also confessed to a quadruple killing from 2003. Todd Kohlhepp, 45, was arrested Thursday after sheriff's deputies found Kala Brown on his wooded property. He now faces kidnapping charges and four counts of murder, with other charges likely to follow. The body of Charles Carver, Brown's boyfriend, was also found on Kohlhepp's property; the couple had been missing since late August. On Saturday, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said Kohlhepp, a realtor who was a registered sex offender due to a kidnapping and sexual assault case when he was a teenager in Arizona, had confessed to shooting and killing four people in Chesnee, S.C. \u2014 a case that's been known locally as the Superbike murders and which could now be solved on Nov. 6, its thirteenth anniversary. The number of murders Kohlhepp is charged with could still grow. He visited his property with deputies Saturday, and Wright says Kohlhepp claims to have buried two other bodies there, local TV WYFF reports . Article continues after sponsorship On Sunday, Kohlhepp appeared in a court hearing that saw a judge deny a bond. The 2003 killings at a motorcycle shop had been featured on America's Most Wanted back in 2012 . Announcing news of the confession late Saturday, Wright said the case had repeatedly prompted him and his deputies to pray. Enlarge this image Since 2003, the killings of four people at a motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., had remained unsolved. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department hide caption toggle caption Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department Since 2003, the killings of four people at a motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., had remained unsolved. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department \"I can't even imagine what the victims' families have been going through,\" he said. When she was found on Kohlhepp's nearly 100-acre property, Brown told law enforcement agents that as many as four bodies could be buried there \u2014 prompting Wright to tell journalists Thursday , \"We're trying to make sure we don't have a serial killer on our hands.\" Wright added that in Kohlhepp, a serial killer \"very possibly could be what we have.\" As for how Brown was found, local TV news WSPA says that after she and Carver went missing in nearby Anderson County around Aug. 31, police had tracked her to the property where she was eventually found. From WSPA: \"Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said they were pinging Brown's phone two days after she was reported missing. He says it pinged on the property where Brown was found. The phone went dead after two days. \"Two weeks before they were able to get a search warrant for the property, the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office flew over the property and realized they needed to get on the ground. \"Anderson police say from early on they had no indication there was foul play, even with the cell phone pings.\" The recent discovery came after deputies executed a search warrant on Kohlhepp's property; they heard Brown banging on the container that was her prison, reports local TV News 13 . When the search warrant was finally executed, Kohlhepp was present at his property; he was arrested the same day. ",

    "text": "Feedback Mike Pence Stands By Chris Christie After Aides' Bridgegate Convictions Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence told Fox News' Chris Wallace this morning that Donald Trump's campaign will not be replacing Chris Christie as chairman of its transition team after two of Christie's aids were convicted in the Bridgegate trial this week. \"What I would tell you is Chris Christie continued to strongly state his position that he had no knowledge of those actions taken,\" the Indiana governor said. \"[He] was right to immediately fire those people for the actions that they'd taken.\" Pence said there were no plans to make any last minute personnel changes this close to Election Day, and that the transition team is focused on \"kicking into post-election\" gear if Trump wins. \"Our campaign is on offense and the Clinton campaign is on defense. Our secret is the American people,\" Pence said in response to Wallace's question on how they plan to win battleground states. However, Pence also touched on the heated topic of Trump possibly not accepting Tuesday's results unless he wins. \"The campaign's made it very clear \u2014 a clear outcome, obviously both sides will accept,\" Pence said. \"\"I think both campaigns have also been very clear that in the event of disputed results, they reserve all legal rights and remedies to protest.\" latest posts from DECISION 2016 Ali Vitali 7 hours ago Trump Heckler Goes 'Access Hollywood' on Him Donald Trump's closing strategy has been to stay on script and avoid distractions. A heckler Sunday night in Virginia tried to make his job difficult. A woman in the front row of Trump's latenight rally in Leesburg, Virginia, shouted at him, \"Grab 'em by the pussy,\" referring to lewd comments Trump made about women in a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" taping that surfaced in October. \"Do you respect women, Donald? Do you respect women? Just talk to me Donald,\" the woman shouted, prompting chants of \"Trump\" and \"lock her up,\" from the crowd of Trump supporters. \"We have a very obnoxious young lady here,\" Trump responded. The Republican candidate notably began his rally before the travelling press had arrived, taunting the journalists when they did finally make to the campaign event. Trump's rally capped a dizzying day of campaigning ahead of one final push Monday that's scheduled to include events in the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire. 15 hours ago Obama Says Trump Thinks It's OK 'Just to Lie' to His Supporters President Barack Obama on Sunday accused Donald Trump of lying with impunity when the Republican nominee said he'd \"screamed\" at a Trump supporter during a campaign stop in North Carolina last week. \"He thought that it was OK just to lie in front of all of his supporters on television,\" Obama said. \"Wasn't even trying to be sneaky about it. And that says something about how unacceptable behavior has become normal.\" Supporters of Democratic presidential Hillary Clinton interrupted Obama's speech Friday in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to boo and jeer at an elderly Trump supporter who began protesting during the rally. Obama paused and demanded that the audience respect the man's right to free speech, as well as their elders. But at a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, later that day, Trump told supporters that the president had \"screamed\" at the protester. Obama said Sunday told supporters in Kissimmee, Florida, that Trump's behavior showed he was unqualified to lead the country. The president also made a direct appeal to voters disenchanted with the election, insisting that their votes have power. \"When you vote, America is transformed,\" Obama said. \"When you vote, we cannot lose.\" 16 hours ago Bruce Springsteen Will Join POTUS, FLOTUS and Hillary Clinton in Monday's Final Rally Bruce Springsteen is set to join a powerful lineup of guests that includes President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and Jon Bon Jovi on Monday night in Hillary Clinton's final rally at Independence Mall in Philadelphia. Springsteen will perform alongside Bon Jovi and urge Pennsylvanians, one of the largest groups of Clinton supporters, to turn out for Clinton on Tuesday. Springsteen has been vocal about his endorsement of Clinton, but he told Rolling Stones in September that he wasn't sure whether he wanted to rally for her. Springsteen campaigned in a similar pattern for Obama in 2012, performing in Obama's final rally in Wisconsin, but he hasn't performed for other former Democratic candidates. Clinton is expected to make her closing argument Monday, asking voters to help her make history as the first female president to continue America's legacy. Obama and Clinton will also talk about Donald Trump's \"dangerous vision.\" Springsteen's appearance was announced as the Clinton campaign said it was \"glad\" for FBI Director James Comey's letter Sunday saying the bureau's review of newly discovered emails wouldn't change its conclusion that Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state didn't rise to criminality. Tells you a bit about how Clinton camp is feeling right now: in same breath as FBI response, @jmpalmieri announced @springsteen in PHL tmrw 17 hours ago Anti-Defamation League: Trump Ad Invokes Anti-Semitic Tropes The Anti-Defamation League accused Donald Trump's campaign Sunday of \"conjuring painful stereotypes and baseless conspiracy theories\" in its closing ad. In the ad, Trump says he will defend Americans against \"those who control the levers of power in Washington\" and pledges to fight the \"global power structure\" and its promotion of \"global special interests.\" Video of Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen and billionaire donor George Soros, all of whom are Jewish, plays alongside the audio. \"Whether intentional or not, the images and rhetoric in this ad touch on subjects that anti-Semites have used for ages,\" the Anti-Defamation League's tweet read. \"This needs to stop.\" From his personal Twitter account, the organization's chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, warned that rhetoric that has historically been used against Jews continues to spur anti-Semitism and called for keeping hate out of presidential politics. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, referred to the ad as \"something of a German shepherd whistle\" that appealed to Trump's \"alt-right base.\" \"I'm Jewish, so maybe I'm sensitive to it, but it clearly has sort of an 'Elders of Zion' kind of feel to it,\" Franken said on CNN, referring to \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" an early 20th-century forged anti-Semitic text purporting to outline Jewish plans to run the world. \"International banking crisis plot, or conspiracy, rather, and then a number of Jews,\" Franken said. \"So I think that it does speak to a certain part of his alt-right base \u2014 [Stephen] Bannon, who's head of Breitbart is his chairman. \"They traffic in that. Trump has tweeted a lot of that sort of thing, and I think it's an appeal to some of the worst elements in our country.\" This #Trump ad touches on images and rhetoric that anti-Semites have used for ages https://t.co/fKjHU3Bsy5 pic.twitter.com/itMxVUpS2R ",

Jon Elswick / AP The investigative team had \"been working around the clock to process and review\" emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop \u2014 using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state. In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said, \"The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.\" The news comes after the FBI announced it would review a new batch of emails that appeared to be \"pertinent\" to the investigation that was suspended in July, which had looked into Clinton's use of a private server. Multiple federal sources told NBC News that the emails were found as a part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl.

On Twitter, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump surrogate, started the campaign's pivot back to the \"rigged system\" claims they shared earlier in the election season. \u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 6, 2016 A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on Weiner's laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton's server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn't change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server.

Carlos Barria / Reuters There were unseen emails, the official said, but they were unrelated to government business. The new letter indicates that the FBI's review is completed. Neither Comey nor the FBI are expected to release any other statements. FBI Dir just informed us \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton\" \u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) November 6, 2016 Democrats and Republicans had starkly different reactions, although both sides indicated that, beyond Clinton's vindication, the FBI still had much to resolve. \"In the days that come, we will have many questions about the FBI's handling of this investigation,\" said John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. \"In the meantime, however, I welcome this news confirming again that no charges are warranted in this matter.\" Republicans quickly countered. \"Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server \u2014 including to transmit classified information \u2014 was extremely careless and a dereliction of duty,\" said Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \"There are also several open questions about the FBI's examination of these facts.\" Play ",

    "text": "Email Russian nationalists were behind an alleged coup attempt in Montenegro that included plans to assassinate the pro-Western prime minister because of his government's bid to join NATO, the Balkan country's chief special prosecutor said Sunday. Milivoje Katnic said the investigation leads to the conclusion that \"nationalists from Russia\" organized a criminal group that planned to break into the Montenegro Parliament on election day , kill Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and bring a pro-Russian coalition to power. Some 20 Serbian and Montenegrin citizens, including a former commander of Serbia's special police forces, were arrested in Montenegro during the Oct. 16 vote. Fourteen of them remain in custody, including some who have fought for pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine. Russian officials have denied any involvement. But they have openly supported the \"patriotic\" parties that are against Montenegro's membership bid in the Western military alliance. \"We don't have any evidence that the state of Russia is involved in any sense ... but we have evidence that two nationalists from Russia were organizers,\" Katnic told reporters. Serbian authorities reportedly deported an unspecified number of Russian operatives who were monitoring Djukanovic's movements from Serbian territory. \"Special prosecution of Serbia had those persons under its supervision ... and prevented them from realizing their plan,\" Katnic said. \"Those persons are not on the territory of Serbia any more. I don't know where they are now, in Russia or somewhere else.\" He said the coup plot was for 500 people to enter Montenegro on election night to \"cause violence ... and hire professional sharpshooters to kill the prime minister.\" \"The plan was to stop Montenegro on its Euro-Atlantic path, especially to prevent it from entering NATO,\" Katnic said. Montenegro has been invited to join NATO despite strong opposition from its traditional Slavic ally Russia. With Montenegro joining, Russia would lose strategic access to the Adriatic Sea and Serbia would remain its only ally in the region. NATO's Deputy Secretary-General Rose Gottemoeller, who visited Montenegro last week, said she expects the country to become a member next spring after all 28 NATO member states ratify the agreement in their respective parliaments. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Dusan Stojanovic contributed from Belgrade, Serbia. 0 Shares ",

Later in the program, joined by \u201cSNL\u201d alumnus and longtime Cubs fan Bill Murray, they returned in matching straw hats and Cubs sweaters to (sort of) sing the fan anthem \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d in the guise of having won a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d version of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d \u201cThis is the best thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Fowler said flatly to little studio audience response. If both bits seemed awkwardly tacked on, it\u2019s understandable \u201cSNL\u201d would run a \u201cW\u201d flag up the pole in a bid to catch a bit of the national buzz the Cubs have generated with their first World Series championship in 108 years. After all, the decisive Game 7 on Wednesday averaged 40 million viewers on Fox, 5.6 million more people than this year\u2019s Academy Awards. The \u201cGo Cubs, Go\u201d bit, at least, was innocuous. As for the exotic dancer sketch, well, for fans keeping score at home, what might have been a wild pitch should probably go down as an error. The premise: A grandmother (played by Aidy Bryant who\u2019s remarrying is treated to a surprise bachelorette party. The shock of the unexpected celebration kills her instantly, but this goes unnoticed by both the guests and a pair of dancers (one played by guest host Benedict Cumberbatch). The dancers rubbed up against dead grandma, sprayed her with whipped cream to be licked off her. Then they announced that, as a special reward, actual Cubs players would perform. Fowler asked who wanted a \u201cgranny slam.\u201d Ross said not to worry because\u00a0 \u201cGrampa Ross\" would \"take real good care.\u201d Rizzo said something about \u201ca triple-header.\u201d Then they (sort of) danced. Even within the pantheon of sports stars on \u201cSNL,\u201d it wasn\u2019t quite was more Derek Jeter in drag than Peyton Manning nailing a hapless kid with a bullet pass. No one will confuse any of it with Nancy Kerrigan skating with Chris Farley, O.J. Simpson as a Conehead, Joe Montana as an extremely sincere roommate or Michael Jordan plagued by self doubts and telling himself: \u201cI'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!\" The Cubs are going to get more practice in the days to come. Just to start, on Monday night, Rizzo, Fowler and Ben Zobrist reportedly are scheduled to visit Jimmy Fallon on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show,\" while Kris Bryant is penciled in for ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d But even if it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019re going to quit their day jobs. philrosenthal@chicagotribune.com ",

(Fox2Now) A St. Louis man took his own life after he killed his two young sons in a local park, according to reports Sunday. Fox2Now reports Christopher Cadenbach, 43, killed himself in Cliff Cave County Park Saturday night after a shootout with cops. The station reported that police had issued an Amber Alert an hour earlier saying Cadenbach had abducted his sons Owen, 4, and Ethan, 5, in their mother\u2019s Ford Focus. Cadenbach\u2019s mother reported the abduction to police. St. Louis County Deputy Police Chief Ken Cox said the woman became alarmed when Cadenbach told him that he wasn\u2019t going to be taken alive and talked of \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d Cox said Cadenbach had a warrant out for his arrest on a domestic violence charge. Police in Franklin County issued the warrant earlier Saturday. Fox2Now reported that a park ranger saw the Ford around 8 p.m. Saturday and called police, the station reported. \u201cThe [police] helicopter was up, spotted the car and saw somebody moving toward the car,\u201d Cox said. \u201cOfficers responded down there and as soon as they go down there shots rang out, apparently shooting his children.\u201d Cox said Cadenbach then shot at the officers who fired back and then killed himself. Cadenbach had gone to his mother\u2019s house Saturday afternoon. She was watching the children. Cox said Cadenbach took his mother and the boys to a park for a few hours. He said Cadenbach\u2019s estranged wife had an order of protection. It wasn\u2019t clear if the order included the children. ",

Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn A. Murray said at a news conference after the attack Saturday afternoon that police are seeking a 26-year-old man in the case. She said he already was wanted on charges of sexual assault and aggravated assault for an unrelated incident on Oct. 9. He has not been charged in Saturday's stabbings. An 8-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy and a 23-year-old woman were killed. Three others, a boy and a girl, both 13, and a 29-year-old woman, were in stable condition at a hospital. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka called the attack \"one of the most tragic and savage\" he's seen. The mayor pleaded for anyone with information to come forward, NJ.com reported. \"We have to get him immediately before he hurts someone else,\" he said. \"As long as he's on the street, nobody is safe.\" The mayor said, \"This is probably one of the most tragic and savage situations that I've seen in a very, very long time here.\" Essex County's major crimes task force and Newark police are investigating the attack. Police have offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Nov 6 2016, 3:52 am ET 'SNL' Breaks Character to Offer Moment of Levity in 2016 Campaign by Jillian Sederholm and Adam Howard Share advertisement In its final live episode before Election Day, \"Saturday Night Live\" took the opportunity to get in a few extra jabs at each candidate's expense before taking a surprising turn to break the fourth wall \u2014 and stopping just short of making a political endorsement. Saturday's show kicked off with a cold open similar to what we've seen all season with Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton facing off in split-screen, this time poking fun at the investigation over Clinton's emails. \"I never use emails,\" Trump boasts. \"I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It's called Twitter.\" \"Everyone can see your tweets,\" a reporter tells him. \"Really? And I'm still in this thing?\" Trump asks dumbfounded. \"America you must really hate this lady.\" Then something unexpected happened. \"When I'm elected, I will assign a special prosecutor,\" Trump begins to rant, but trails off. \"I'm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,\" Baldwin says, breaking character and addressing McKinnon directly. \"I just feel gross all the time about this. Don't you all feel gross?\" Baldwin asks the studio audience. McKinnon also breaks character to agree, and the two clasp hands to run off stage and out of the building. Baldwin and McKinnon take a dizzying run through Times Square, embracing strangers, sharing food and handing out balloons in a surreal moment of levity. NBC/SNL When they return to the stage, they share a more serious message. \"None of this would have mattered if you don't vote,\" Baldwin says, still out of character. \"We can't tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,\" McKinnon says. The actors embrace to call out their final \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night!\" together as presidential candidates before a winner is declared. The character-breaking montage was a departure from how the iconic sketch show has traditionally behaved in the final performance before an election, although 2016 has been no traditional campaign season.

President Obama speaks at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee, Fla. on Sunday. (John Raoux / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli Campaigning for Hillary Clinton at a Florida baseball stadium, President\u00a0Obama lamented Sunday that the nature of this year\u2019s presidential race has become so negative that even \"Saturday Night Live\" this week couldn't keep parodying it.\u00a0 What bothered him most, the president said, was the way \"stuff that\u2019s not normal, people have been treating like it\u2019s normal.\" He referred to how just days ago he encouraged people at one of his rallies\u00a0to show respect for a Donald Trump supporter who came\u00a0to protest the event. But Trump claimed just hours later that Obama had yelled at the man. \"Didn't just make it up, but said the exact opposite of what had happened, with impunity,\" he said. \"There was tape. There was a video.... He thought it was OK just to lie in front of all his supporters. \"That says something about how unacceptable behavior has become normal,\" Obama added. \u201cAnd that's why he is uniquely unqualified to hold this job. The good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure that he doesn't get the job!\" Obama also mocked Trump after a report that his own campaign apparently had taken away his access to Twitter, where Trump has been known to send insulting\u00a0missives. \"If somebody can\u2019t handle a Twitter account, they can\u2019t handle the nuclear codes,\" Obama said. It was a typically chesty speech from the outgoing commander in chief as he not only stumps aggressively for Hillary Clinton to succeed him, but settles some scores with the Republicans who have tried to stifle his every move for eight years. In his reelection campaign four years ago, Obama would talk somewhat optimistically \u2014 in retrospect, perhaps naively \u2014\u00a0about his view that Republicans who had opposed him\u00a0in his first term would be more cooperative should he win a second. Knowing he would not be on the ballot again, there was less political incentive to deny him policy victories, and perhaps political incentive to try to find common ground, he thought. \u201cThe fever will break,\u201d he would say back then. \u201cC'mon, man,\u201d has become his head-shaking\u00a0credo now.\u00a0 Obama on Sunday again attacked Republicans who support Trump even though they hold private\u00a0\u2014 and some even public \u2014 reservations about him.\u00a0He also warned that electing a Republican Congress would lead to a continuation of the obstruction he's faced. \"They're suggesting they might impeach Hillary. They don\u2019t know what for yet. But they\u2019re thinking about it,\" Obama said.\u00a0 Gridlock, he continued, is not \"some mysterious fog that descends on Washington,\" or something equally the fault of Democrats and Republicans. \"You want some more endless gridlock, vote for Republicans. You want an America that can do better \u2026 then you need to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot,\" he said. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)\u00a0has emerged as one of\u00a0Obama\u2019s favorite targets, an example of a\u00a0Republican whose devotion to defeating Democrats sometimes supersedes his personal and policy convictions.\u00a0 Rubio supports Trump now, Obama said, even though he called Trump a con artist while running against him for the GOP nomination.\u00a0 \"He tweeted, 'Friends don\u2019t let friends vote for con artists,'\" Obama said.\u00a0\"Guess who just voted for Trump a few days ago? Marco Rubio.\u201d Rubio's opponent, Rep. Patrick Murphy , appeared before Obama on Sunday. \"If you want a senator who will say anything, do anything, be anybody just to get elected, then that\u2019s your guy,\" Obama said of Rubio. \"If you want a senator who will show up and work for you and tell you the truth, then vote for Patrick Murphy and give Hillary some help.\" Obama made just one stop Sunday here in Central Florida, a key swing area in the always-important battleground state. \"We win this election if we win Florida,\" Obama said. \"If we win Florida, it's a wrap.\" Monday he has three appearances scheduled,\u00a0in Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. He will join Clinton at the latter. Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty. Gen.

Miguel Montero reacts to his deep fly-out to right field in the fifth inning Oct. 28, 2016, in Game 3 of the World Series. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune About 23 years ago, former Braves general manager Eddie Robinson broke out in a big smile when he was asked to confirm that he once threatened to trade Dusty Baker to Cleveland following the 1974 season after the 25-year-old outfielder expressed his misery over playing in the South without many of his veteran friends who had been dealt. \"Did Dusty tell you that story?\" Robinson replied before a spring training game in Scottsdale, Ariz. \"Yes, I did tell him that.\" Baker caught a break one year after his request when he was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers , who went on to win three National League titles and the 1981 World Series during his eight seasons. The story illustrates that some are lucky to transform their fortunes, but a cautious situation awaits Joe Maddon and veteran catcher Miguel Montero , who wasn't fond of the way the Cubs ' manager handled him. Montero, 33, appearing Friday on ESPN 1000's Waddle and Silvy Show, expressed his disappointment\u00a0over his lack of playing time, an apparent miscommunication and Maddon's use of closer Aroldis Chapman. (Mark Gonzales) \"I think the toughest part for me is they never communicated with me,\" Montero said on the show. \"I'm a veteran guy. They talk about veteran leadership. I have 11 years in the game and two All-Star (appearances). \"I expected to be treated a little better. I was expected to get communication. Just let me know. Put me in the loop. That was the toughest part for me because I never understood what my role was going to be.\" Montero's emotions percolated during the course of the season, but this was his first public admission of his frustration. David Ross and Montero mentored Willson Contreras after the excitable rookie was promoted from Triple-A Iowa in mid-July. At that time, Montero, 33, was batting only .210 and was working on his throwing at Nationals Park a few days before Contreras was promoted. Thanks to a strong September and early October in which he batted .283 with three home runs, Montero provided the Cubs with a strong left-handed bat that was validated when he hit a grand slam off Joe Blanton of the Dodgers during Game 1 of the National League Championship Series and an RBI single in the 10th inning of Game 7 of the World Series. But playing time could come at a premium in 2017 with the ascent and reliance on Contreras, who took over the majority of the duties with the handling of Jake Arrieta in Games 2 and 6, and possibly the return of Kyle Schwarber behind the plate. Dexter Fowler 's brief speech Friday at Grant Park was a reminder of his success tied to the Cubs ' World Series title but a chilly message of what lurks ahead for a franchise trying to win multiple titles. \"You know what they say,\" Fowler, a free agent, said. \"You go, we go.\" \"So I'm going.\" After... Dexter Fowler 's brief speech Friday at Grant Park was a reminder of his success tied to the Cubs ' World Series title but a chilly message of what lurks ahead for a franchise trying to win multiple titles. \"You know what they say,\" Fowler, a free agent, said. \"You go, we go.\" \"So I'm going.\" After... (Mark Gonzales) With his history of lower back issues, a trade seems very unlikely unless the Cubs are willing to assume a large portion of Montero's $14 million salary in 2017. With John Lackey closer to retirement and Jake Arrieta one year away from free agency, 2017 provides a realistic shot for the Cubs to be \"all-in\" toward another Series title. At the end of the World Series, Maddon was effusive in his praise of Montero. Maddon has been used to massaging spats with the likes of Jon Lester and Jason Hammel over their displeasure with being pulled from starts sooner rather than later. Montero is well-liked by many of his pitchers, and he could be perceived as a future manager or coach if it wasn't for his disdain\u00a0of the \"organizational advocacy\" he witnessed manager Bob Melvin endure during their time with the Arizona Diamondbacks . As soon as the hoopla over the World Series title wears off (if that's possible), a face-to-face chat between Maddon and Montero (perhaps at Cubs Convention) would go a long way toward clarifying\u00a0any misconceptions.

News Journal 7:10 p.m. EST November 6, 2016 A person was hurt at Punkin Chunkin Sunday afternoon after an air cannon went off, sending with it pieces of material from the cannon. (Photo: Brittany Horn/The News Journal) WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014\u00a0A man and woman were injured Sunday after an explosion at Punkin\u00a0Chunkin Sunday, according to Delaware State Police, who previously reported a person had died. The two were\u00a0hurt when an air cannon went off, sending\u00a0with\u00a0it large pieces of material from the cannon. As people were running away from the cannon, a large piece of the cannon hit a person in the head. The\u00a039-year-old woman was injured by the apparatus as it fired, according to Master Cpl. Jeffrey Hale, Delaware State Police spokesman. She was treated at the scene before she was taken to Nanticoke Memorial Hospital, he said. After 2-year break, World Championship Punkin Chunkin returns to Delaware She was then stabilized and flown to the Christiana Hospital emergency room, where she remains in critical condition, according to Hale. Kerry Collias, who had just gotten to Punkin Chunkin when the incident occurred, saw the air cannon malfunction and the aftermath up close. Shortly after the incident, as organizers were asking people to clear out, they announced over the loudspeaker that they had taken a woman to Nanticoke Hospital and asked attendees to pray for her, Collias said. Paramedics tend to an injured person after a piece of metal flew off of an air cannon, striking them in the head, at the World Championship Punkin Chunkin in Bridgeville on Sunday afternoon. \u00a0(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) A 56-year-old man was also injured in the explosion. He received treatment for non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to an area hospital, Hale said. One of those injured was struck in the head and went down motionless at the Bridgeville event. Paramedics, state\u00a0troopers\u00a0and fire personnel were called\u00a0into\u00a0the roped-off scene, closed to\u00a0team members and the media. The injury occurred in an area open only to team members, staff members and media \u2014\u00a0the public was stationed behind a fence farther away. A state police helicopter landed in the fields at the Punkin Chunkin event after the injuries to aid paramedics and multiple ambulances at the scene. Paramedics take an injured person to an ambulance after a piece of metal flew off of an air cannon, striking them in the head, at the World Championship Punkin Chunkin in Bridgeville on Sunday afternoon. \u00a0(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) Detectives continued to gather information at the event grounds. Sunday's incident wasn't the first one to leave\u00a0a dark mark on the event. A lawsuit filed in 2013 by a former Punkin Chunkin volunteer effectively grounded the event the past two years. The lawsuit was filed by Daniel Fair, a former Punkin Chunkin \"spotter,\" or volunteer who rides around the grounds helping determine the distance pumpkins traveled from their machines. Fair's complaint alleged Wheatley Farms Inc., the owner of the property, and Punkin Chunkin Association were liable for a spinal injury he suffered\u00a0when the ATV he was riding flipped. The lawsuit was dismissed in June 2015. \"The parties mutually agreed to resolve the matter,\" Stephen A. Hampton, the attorney representing Fair, told\u00a0The News Journal in 2015.

USA TODAY, Collin Brennan Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images) 27497 CONNECT TWEET 36 LINKEDIN 1282 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0In a stunning last-minute announcement, FBI director James Comey said Sunday the agency is still not recommending charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after reviewing newly discovered emails. In a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State. \"The FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\" Comey said in the letter.\u00a0\"During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,\" Comey wrote. \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\" Comey had rocked the presidential race with his announcement Oct. 28 that the FBI had uncovered a new trove of emails that might be relevant to the investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server. The emails were discovered on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The announcement, as voters prepare to head to the polls Tuesday,\u00a0added more drama to an already turbulent campaign season. Trump closes campaign as he began it: Running against the establishment Clinton was en route to Cleveland on Sunday when Comey issued his letter. Aboard her plane, aides were seen sharing the letter on their wireless devices. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri came to the back of the plane where the press sits to discuss the letter. \u201cWe are glad to see that he has found \u2014 and we were confident that he would \u2014 that he has confirmed the conclusion he reached in July; and we\u2019re glad that this matter is resolved,\u201d she told reporters. The campaign appeared to signify it would not gloat over the announcement; Palmieri declined to answer questions as she customarily does. In a speech later Sunday at the Cleveland Public Auditorium, Clinton made no mention of the FBI announcement or \u2013 notably \u2013 Trump. Her remarks were far more positive than the stump speech she\u2019s been delivering in recent days. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of frustration, even anger, in this election season,\u201d said Clinton, but anger is not a plan. Clinton\u2019s commanding 11-point lead after the final debate with Republican Donald Trump in Las Vegas has narrowed to four to five points nationally in the aftermath of Comey's\u00a0late October announcement. She\u2019s seen Trump close in on her in states like New Hampshire and Michigan, where she\u2019d once enjoyed a comfortable lead. Though there is no way to tell how much of that is related to the announcement \u2014\u00a0versus a natural tightening of the race \u2014\u00a0the campaign has privately worried that the surprise announcement would badly damage their attempts to court Republicans disillusioned with Trump. Trump criticized the FBI during a Sunday night appearance in Sterling Heights, Mich., saying it was impossible for the FBI to review the new emails \u2014which totaled some 650,000 \u2014 \u00a0in \"eight days.\" \"You can\u2019t do it, folks,\" he said. \"She's guilty. The FBI knows it,\" Trump added.\u00a0\"It's unbelievable what she gets away with.\" Comey\u2019s brief written notice to Congress on Sunday was issued after consultation with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a federal law enforcement official said Sunday. The official who is not authorized to comment publicly said both sides agreed on the conclusion, which was reached earlier Sunday. The official said the investigative team that conducted the initial inquiry into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information as secretary of State worked night and day to review hundreds of thousands of communications as part of the new review. The official said many of the communications involved in the new review were duplicates of emails analyzed during the initial inquiry. In a brief written statement Sunday, the Justice Department said it had \u201cdedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously.\u201d Since notifying congressional leaders of the new review Oct. 28, Comey had been the target of withering criticism for departing from long-standing Justice Department policy against\u00a0taking politically charged actions in close proximity to an\u00a0election. Among the sharpest rebukes came from former Attorney General Eric Holder who was among nearly 100 former Justice officials who expressed their objections in a letter circulated last week. Comey\u2019s original decision to notify federal lawmakers of the new review went against Lynch's\u00a0advice. The FBI\u2019s action also exposed deep rifts within the bureau as agents not only pursued questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails but also about a now-stalled preliminary inquiry involving the Clinton Foundation. Supporters awaiting Clinton's campaign appearance Sunday in Cleveland greeted the news with a mix of relief and concern. \u201cHe just threw it out there without any examination,\u201d Bonnie Weinstein, a 49-year-old interior decorator visiting from New Mexico, said of Comey's late\u00a0October announcement. \u201cI was very concerned because, when you have accusations like that, you have to be really sure,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s been definitely an effect\u201d on Clinton\u2019s support. \u201cI hope now that the news is not too late,\" Weinstein said.

The stop was Trump\u2019s fifth since Sunday afternoon, several of them in Democratic strongholds he is trying to wrest away from Hillary Clinton in hopes of creating a path to victory on Tuesday. After starting his day in Iowa, where polls show him ahead, Trump stumped in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all states that have gone for Democrats for more than a quarter century. Until recently, polls had showed Clinton with a comfortable lead in Virginia as well. Clinton, meanwhile, campaigned in Pennsylvania, where she maintains a lead, and in Ohio and New Hampshire, two battleground states that could go either way. Clinton has maintained a narrow lead nationally and has several more plausible scenarios than Trump for winning in the Electoral College. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. The candidates\u2019 frenzied pace Sunday came as news broke that, after an expedited review of newly discovered Clinton emails, FBI Director James B. Comey had affirmed his decision that she should not face charges related to her use of a personal server as secretary of state. During Trump\u2019s Michigan rally \u2014 a state a Republican presidential candidate last carried in 1988 \u2014 he said Clinton was \u201cbeing protected by a rigged system, it\u2019s a totally rigged system.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton is guilty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. Now it\u2019s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8th.\u201d [ Clinton leads by five points nationally as Trump personality concerns persist, Post-ABC Tracking Poll finds ] Comey\u2019s announcement on Oct. 28 that the FBI was scrutinizing newly discovered email reinvigorated Trump\u2019s campaign in the closing stretch of the race, and polls in multiple battleground states have tightened since then. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri reacted to the FBI news on the campaign\u2019s flight to a Cleveland rally, telling reporters: \u201cWe are glad to see that ... [Comey] has confirmed the conclusions he reached in July, and we are glad that this matter is resolved.\u201d Clinton is using the closing days of the race to try to both shore up support in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where she has been leading and to tip the balance in other swing states. How the electoral college works Clinton appeared Sunday night in New Hampshire, where the race has tightened considerably. \u201cThis election is a moment of reckoning,\u201d Clinton told her crowd in Manchester. \u201cIt a choice between division and unity. ... What\u2019s really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren.\u201d Clinton was introduced at the rally by Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father of slain U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died while serving in the 2004 Iraq War. Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention and was later criticized by Trump, posed a pointed set of questions to Trump about whether his son, a Muslim, and other minorities would have a place in his America. \u201cWould anyone who isn\u2019t like you have a place in your America, Mr. Trump?\u201d Khan said. \u201cOn Tuesday, we\u2019re going to prove America belongs to all of us.\u201d Clinton said that Khan\u2019s family \u201cexemplify the values that make America great.\u201d Folk singer James Taylor performed at the rally ahead of Clinton\u2019s appearance. Clinton appeared earlier Sunday at a rally in Cleveland, where she was introduced by Cleveland Cavaliers basketball star LeBron James, part of an effort to spark enthusiasm in Ohio, a state where polls have showed Trump leading. \u201cI want an America where everyone has a place, where everyone is included,\u201d Clinton said there. \u201cAnd I know there is a lot of frustration, even anger, in this election season. I see it, I hear it, you know, I\u2019m a subject of it. I get it. But anger is not a plan. Anger is not going to get us new jobs.\u201d The more optimistic look toward the future was a script her campaign had hoped to use as a springboard past the exceptional rancor of the last several months of her contest with Trump, but it had been muted somewhat by the uncertainty surrounding the renewed FBI inquiry and the tightening polls. Sunday\u2019s event was Clinton\u2019s last scheduled visit to Ohio, where she trails despite heavy emphasis on turning out black voters in Cleveland. James was part of that effort, as were husband and wife singers Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, who performed a get-out-the-vote concert with Clinton on Friday night. In attempt to cobble together the 270 electoral votes needed to win, Trump has new targets in his sights in historically Democratic states including Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico. Once thought to be safe for Democrats, Michigan has become a last-minute battleground, with Clinton heading to Grand Rapids on Monday, the campaign announced this weekend. President Obama, who won Michigan twice, will campaign in Ann Arbor on Monday. And former president Bill Clinton made a stop in Lansing on Sunday after visiting churches in Flint. Clinton began her day Sunday by campaigning in Philadelphia after attending a get-out-the-vote concert in the city on Saturday night. And she will return to the state for two rallies on the eve of Election Day, a sign that the Keystone State is among the battlegrounds where her lead over Trump has dwindled in recent days. Her campaign announced that rock star Bruce Springsteen would join her at a Philadelphia rally that will also include President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. [ What to know about the 15 states that will decide the election ] Clinton also deployed a full slate of high-level surrogates around the country on Sunday, including Obama, who appeared in Kissimmee, Fla., and poked fun at Trump. \u201cApparently his campaign has taken his Twitter,\u201d Obama told the crowd at Osceola County Stadium. \u201cIn the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said we\u2019re just gonna take away your Twitter. Now, if somebody can\u2019t handle a Twitter account, they can\u2019t handle the nuclear codes.\u201d Trump started his five-state swing in Sioux City in eastern Iowa, close to the Nebraska border. Nebraska is one of two states that can split its electoral votes between candidates, and in 2008, one electoral vote from the Omaha area went to Obama. Trump\u2019s stop in Northern Virginia on Sunday night came as Republicans see new hope in a state where Clinton has long held a comfortable lead. He promised \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts for the middle class and to rebuild inner cities that he said in some cases are \u201cworse than war zones.\u201d And Trump decried NAFTA and other trade deals that he said are robbing the country of jobs. \u201cWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will stop the jobs from leaving Virginia, that I can tell you.\u201d At an earlier rally Sunday in Minneapolis, Trump told the crowd that Clinton was taking the Democratic leaning state of Minnesota for granted by not visiting it. Trump also warned about a local immigrant population: Somalis, most of them Muslims, who have left their war-ravaged country and settled in large numbers around Minneapolis. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have the right to talk about it. You don\u2019t even know who\u2019s coming in. You\u2019ll find out. You\u2019ll find out,\u201d Trump said. He mentioned a recent stabbing case, in which the suspect is a man whose parents brought him from Somalia when he was three months old. \u201cYou\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota.\u201d In Michigan, rock star Ted Nugent, a native of the state who in a 2012 Facebook post called for Clinton to be tried and hanged for treason, provided entertainment at the rally, declaring it was \u201cgood to see the real Michigan together.\u201d When Trump took the stage, he ticked off a series of trade deals that he said had devastated the state. He falsely claimed that Clinton is supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending deal supported by Obama. Clinton previously backed the deal while secretary of state but has since come out against it. [Is there a \u2018hidden\u2019 Hillary Clinton vote among women?] Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign continues to use its huge financial advantage over Trump to press its case to swing voters on the airwaves. The campaign on Sunday released two national ads appealing to moderate and Republican voters to reject Trump and embrace Clinton. Both ads feature straight-to-camera testimonials from Republican military veterans who say they cannot vote for their party\u2019s nominee, citing Trump\u2019s comments about women. Another two-minute ad was set to air Monday night, aimed at reaching about 20 million people, according to a campaign aide. Trump also released a closing campaign ad , a two-minute spot tying Clinton to the \u201cfailed and corrupt political establishment\u201d and \u201cglobal special interests.\u201d But the ad, which features images of piles of cash along with Jewish corporate and financial leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen, was sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for what it called anti-Semitic overtones. Gearan reported from Manchester, N.H., and Wagner reported from Washington. Greg Jaffe in Kissimmee, Fla.; Ed O\u2019Keefe, Abby Phillip, Katie Zezima, Robert Barnes, Sarah Parnass and Sean Sullivan in Washington; Steve Friess in Sterling Heights; and Laura Vozzella in Richmond contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "WATCH Hillary Clinton's Key Moments 0 Shares Email Much more is at stake on Election Day than the White House. State by state, district by district, neighborhood by neighborhood, candidates and campaigners are making their last pitch for Congress, state legislatures, governor's offices, ballot questions, judgeships, city councils and lots more. A nationwide look at important, interesting and occasionally odd matters that go before voters on Tuesday: ALABAMA Alabama voters must decide on 14 statewide constitutional amendments affecting everything from funding for state parks and the age of public officeholders to beer. Yes, beer. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board wants to require brewers to report the name, address, age and phone number from anyone who purchases beer at one of the state's craft breweries for off-premises consumption. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ALASKA Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski is up for re-election, and the race has drawn not one but three foes: Democrat Ray Metcalfe, independent Margaret Stock, and Joe Miller, who upset Murkowski in the 2010 GOP primary only to then lose the general election in a historic write-in campaign. This time Miller is running as a Libertarian. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ARIZONA Eight years after losing his bid for president, Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain is running for re-election. McCain has publicly struggled with whether to support GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who called McCain a loser and criticized him for being captured during the Vietnam War. Marijuana is on the ballot; voters could legalize the drug for recreational use by adults. Minimum wage could rise to $12 an hour by 2020 under a separate ballot measure. Metro Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America, is fighting for his job after a criminal indictment stemming from his immigration patrols. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ARKANSAS Arkansas could become the first Southern state to legalize medical marijuana, although a similar proposal lost by less than 30,000 votes a year ago, out of 1.3 million votes cast. Republicans are expected to hold all four of Arkansas' U.S. House seats. Democrats are fielding a candidate in only one district. \u2014\u2014\u2014 CALIFORNIA Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer's retirement creates a rare open seat, and for the first time in the modern era, no Republican will be on the ballot. Thanks to California's unusual primary system, in which the two top finishers from the June primary advance to the general election, voters will decide between two Democrats \u2014 state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The statewide ballot has a whopping 17 propositions, the most on a single ballot since March 2000. There's a measure to legalize recreational marijuana and one requiring porn actors to wear condoms. Voters will weigh in twice on the death penalty. One measure would repeal capital punishment while another seeks to speed up the process. \u2014\u2014\u2014 COLORADO Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is running for re-election against a tea party-aligned opponent, conservative Darryl Glenn, who has struggled to raise funds after national party leaders refused to endorse his candidacy. In a hotly contested House race, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman is facing a challenge from Democratic state Sen. Morgan Carroll in suburban Denver. The chief ballot questions would allow medical aid in dying and create a universal health care system within the state. \u2014\u2014\u2014 CONNECTICUT The five Democrats who make up the state's U.S. House delegation face re-election, including Rosa DeLauro, the longest serving member in the group who is seeking a 14th term. Dr. William Petit, whose wife and two daughters were murdered in a 2007 home invasion, is running as a Republican for the Legislature against state Rep. Betty Boukus, an 11-term Democrat who heads the powerful House bonding subcommittee. \u2014\u2014\u2014 DELAWARE Voters will elect a new congressional representative and a new governor, while Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule in the General Assembly by regaining control of the state Senate. Democratic U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. is making a second run for governor against Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini. Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester and Republican Hans Reigle are vying for the state's lone U.S. House seat. \u2014\u2014\u2014 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Voters in the nation's capital will decide whether they want their city to become the 51st state. The measure, backed by Mayor Muriel Bowser, should pass easily, but that's probably as far as it goes. Congress would need to approve any such change and Republicans are unlikely to go along with it. With registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans by 12-1 in the city, statehood would tip the balance in the U.S. Senate with two more Democrats. \u2014\u2014\u2014 FLORIDA Florida voters will decide whether Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio gets a second term. They'll also pick at least eight new U.S. House members after districts were redrawn to comply with the state constitution, and will cast ballots on legalizing medical marijuana. Rubio faces Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, while ex-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist hopes to revive his political career \u2014 now as a Democrat \u2014 in a race against Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly in a St. Petersburg-area district. \u2014\u2014\u2014 GEORGIA Democrat Jim Barksdale and Libertarian Allen Buckley are challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, who seeks a third term. Barksdale, who owns an Atlanta investment firm, gave $3.5 million toward his first political campaign, but has struggled to get momentum against the well-known Isakson. Georgia voters also will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing the state to take over low-performing schools. \u2014\u2014\u2014 HAWAII Voters in Honolulu must make two separate choices after U.S. Rep. Mark Takai died in office: Someone to fill his seat for the remaining two months of his term, and someone to represent the district for the next two years. Voter confusion could lead to two different people winning the same seat, to serve two different terms. In heavily Democratic Hawaii, the only state Senate seat held by a Republican, Sam Slom, could flip. That would make Hawaii the first state in the nation to have a one-party legislative body in since 1980. \u2014\u2014\u2014 IDAHO Republicans will dominate at the top of the ticket, leaving an open seat on Idaho's Supreme Court as the most competitive race. Twin Falls attorney Robyn Brody and Republican state Sen. Curt McKenzie are in a tight, nonpartisan race. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ILLINOIS Illinois is home to one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races in the country, with Republican incumbent Mark Kirk and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Kirk, a first-term senator, is considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans, and polls have indeed shown Duckworth with a comfortable lead. Wealthy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has spent record amounts on down-ballot races in hopes of tilting the Democrat-leaning Legislature toward the GOP so he can press his own policy agenda in second half of his term. \u2014\u2014\u2014 INDIANA With Republican Gov. Mike Pence on the national ticket as Trump's running mate, the governor's office is up for grabs. And this is another state with a U.S. Senate race that will be crucial to determining party control. A former governor and U.S. senator, Democrat Evan Bayh , wants to return to the Senate and faces Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Young. Democrats are hoping to gain enough seats in the General Assembly to break the current Republican stranglehold. \u2014\u2014\u2014 IOWA Republican Charles Grassley is seeking a seventh U.S. Senate term and trying to retain a seat his party has held since 1957. Democrats are optimistic that their candidate, Patty Judge, can break that winning streak, given her previous elections to statewide office as agriculture secretary and lieutenant governor. Two of Iowa's four U.S. House races are expected to be especially competitive. \u2014\u2014\u2014 KANSAS Democrats are seeking to cut into Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature and oust more allies of term-limited GOP Gov. Sam Brownback . Conservatives and abortion opponents are seeking to remove four Kansas Supreme Court justices in hopes of giving Brownback a chance to remake the court ahead of major abortion and school funding rulings. \u2014\u2014\u2014 KENTUCKY Voters will decide whether to send Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who made an early run for the presidency, back to Washington for a second term. His Democratic opponent is Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. Voters also will determine whether the only legislative chamber in the South still controlled by Democrats remains so. Republicans need to pick up four seats to win a majority in the Kentucky House for the first time since 1920. \u2014\u2014\u2014 LOUISIANA Two dozen \u2014 that's right, two dozen \u2014 candidates are vying for an open seat in the U.S. Senate after incumbent David Vitter decided not to seek re-election. One of them is white supremacist David Duke, who is not among the top-tier candidates in polling. Because no candidate is likely to get the 50-percent-plus-one majority needed to win outright, the top vote-getters will head to a Dec. 10 runoff that could end up determining which party gains control of the U.S. Senate for the next two years. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MAINE Mainers will decide whether to make marijuana legal for everyone over age 21. Maine is one of nine states considering ballot questions on pot legalization for recreational or medicinal use. Another initiative would require background checks before the sale or transfer of firearms between people who aren't licensed dealers. And one would boost the hourly minimum wage from $7.50 to $12 by 2020. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MARYLAND Voters will pick a replacement for the popular Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring after 30 years in the U.S. Senate. U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a seven-term Democrat, is running against Kathy Szeliga, minority whip in the state House of Delegates. She has sought to portray Van Hollen as an insider of dysfunctional Washington. Baltimore will choose a new mayor. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MASSACHUSETTS Massachusetts voters will also vote on marijuana legalization, as well as a proposed expansion of charter schools. There are a handful of congressional contests, with Democratic U.S. Reps. Richard Neal, Niki Tsongas, Joe Kennedy, Stephen Lynch and William Keating all facing challengers. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MICHIGAN It's the Democrats' last shot to disrupt the GOP's agenda or Republicans will lead the Legislature all eight years of GOP Gov. Rick Snyder's tenure. At least a dozen GOP-held House districts \u2014 half with incumbents, half open due to term limits \u2014 will determine which party secures the minimum 56 seats needed. Democrats have targeted two GOP-held U.S. House districts, while two spots on the Michigan Supreme Court represent the most significant statewide races. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MINNESOTA A trio of competitive congressional races takes top billing in Minnesota. Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan will try to fend off a rematch challenge from Republican Stewart Mills to hang on to a northeastern Minnesota district that has been a liberal stronghold for decades. The result has been one of the most expensive House elections in the country. Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen will be defending his suburban Minneapolis seat, while the two parties jostle over another suburban district that opened with a top Republican's retirement. All 201 state House and Senate seats are on the ballot in an election to determine legislative majorities. Voters will also decide whether to hand off legislators' power to set their own pay to an independent council. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MISSISSIPPI All four of Mississippi's U.S. House members \u2014 three Republicans and one Democrat \u2014 are up for re-election. All are likely to prevail. Four of the nine state Supreme Court seats will also be filled, as will four of 10 seats on the state Court of Appeals. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MISSOURI Missouri voters will decide whether to send U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt to a second term, or choose Democratic challenger Jason Kander instead. It's a race that will help decide party control of the Senate, and polls have indicated a toss-up for months. Meanwhile, Missouri's contentious campaign for governor has been the nation's most expensive. Republican newcomer Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, has campaigned largely on his military record, while Attorney General Chris Koster has endorsements from the Missouri Farm Bureau and National Rifle Association, which typically support Republicans. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MONTANA Popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is up for a second term in the conservative-leaning state against software entrepreneur Greg Gianforte, who spent more than $5.6 million of his own money on his campaign. Incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking to hold off a determined challenge from Democrat Denise Juneau to maintain a two-decade Republican lock on Montana's sole House seat. Pot is also on the ballot, with a measure that would loosen many of the restrictions imposed on the state's medical marijuana program with a 2011 state law that limited marijuana providers to three patients each. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEBRASKA Nebraska voters have the opportunity to reinstate the death penalty and reverse last year's decision by the Legislature. The citizen-led ballot measure has triggered a millions in campaign spending. In one of the country's most competitive congressional races, Republicans are looking to defeat first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, who promotes himself as a champion of bipartisanship. His opponent, Don Bacon, is a retired Air Force brigadier general who is running as a Washington outsider. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEVADA Nevada is home to one of the most expensive U.S. Senate races in the country, featuring lots of TV ads about the seat being vacated by Democratic leader Harry Reid. The race is between U.S. Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican, and Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general trying to become the first Latina U.S. senator. Recreational marijuana is also on the ballot, raising the possibility of pot shops springing up near Las Vegas Strip. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEW HAMPSHIRE New Hampshire is a presidential swing state, and home to a tight U.S. Senate contest between Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. It's one of a half-dozen races could help determine which party controls the Senate. Two members of the U.S. House, Republican Chris Sununu and Democrat Colin Van Ostern, are vying to replace Hassan as governor. \u2014\u2014 NEW JERSEY One of the nastiest U.S. House races in the country this year has pitted a Republican incumbent, Rep. Scott Garrett, against Democrat Josh Gottheimer. In a district that stretches from wealthy New York City suburbs to the state's rural northwestern corner, the two candidates have called each other liars and engaged in a war of words and accusations to rival the presidential candidates. New Jersey voters will also decide on a proposed expansion of casino gambling. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEW MEXICO There's little suspense at the top of the ticket, with all three U.S. House incumbents expected to be re-elected, so Republicans are focused on defending their narrow majority in the state House. The party took over in 2014, ending 60 years of Democratic control. The criminal conviction and resignation of former Secretary of State Dianna Duran in 2015, for embezzlement and money laundering related to her gambling addiction, has opened that office. The race is between Democrat Maggie Toulouse Oliver and Republican state lawmaker Nora Espinoza. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEW YORK Voters will decide whether the Republican Party maintains control of the state Senate or Democrats secure total control of state government. The outcome is likely to come down to a handful of competitive races on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NORTH CAROLINA As a focal point in battles over transgender rights and voter ID laws, North Carolina may be the state where social and ideological divisions are the most defining this election year. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is in a tight race against Democrat Roy Cooper, the state's attorney general. Former state Rep. Deborah Ross is presenting a strong challenge to incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr in one of the most closely watched Senate races. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NORTH DAKOTA As this state's energy- and agriculture-dependent economy falters, voters will choose a new governor to lead it through increasingly troubled financial times. But with Republican Doug Burgum a heavy favorite in this reliably red state, five ballot measures may be of most interest. Among the most-watched will be a measure that would make it legal to possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana for medical purposes. \u2014\u2014\u2014 OHIO Early on, former Gov. Ted Strickland looked like one the Democrats' best bet to flip a U.S. Senate seat in his party's favor. He's running again Republican incumbent Sen. Rob Portman. Then outside groups spent more than $50 million to beat Strickland, who also lost key union endorsements and was up against a formidable voter outreach and turnout effort by Portman. Now the seat looks pretty safe for the GOP. \u2014\u2014\u2014 OKLAHOMA Oklahoma voters will be watching a ballot issue that targets the state's chronically low teacher salaries and one that would enshrine the death penalty in the state constitution, even as executions remain on hold after mistakes in two recent lethal injections. \u2014\u2014\u2014 OREGON A Republican is threatening to win statewide office for the first time in many years, in a battle for secretary of state that is the hottest in Oregon. Democrat Brad Avakian is running ads saying his GOP rival is \"extreme like Trump.\" Republican Dennis Richardson has racked up endorsements from numerous newspapers and even from two prominent members of Avakian's own party. \u2014\u2014\u2014 PENNSYLVANIA Since 1948, no Democrat has won the White House without winning Pennsylvania. There's also a hot U.S. Senate race between Democratic challenger Katie McGinty and Republican incumbent Pat Toomey, who is among the most vulnerable Republicans as the GOP struggles to retain its majority. Spending on that campaign is on track to hit $140 million. \u2014\u2014\u2014 RHODE ISLAND Voters in Rhode Island, a state that has seen its share of political corruption, will decide whether to expand the authority of the state's ethics commission. They'll also be asked whether to allow a new casino. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SOUTH CAROLINA: The South's first black senator since Reconstruction, Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, is running for his first full term. He was appointed to the seat in 2013 following the resignation of Sen. Jim DeMint, then won election to the final two years of that term. Democrat Thomas Dixon, a community activist and pastor, is challenging him. Then there's Democrat Dimitri Cherny, whose platform includes colonizing the moon and Mars in case the Earth becomes uninhabitable. He's challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, the ex-governor whom voters sent back to Congress in 2013. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SOUTH DAKOTA The main suspense is likely to be the fate of 10 ballot questions on topics ranging from public campaign funding to payday loan interest rates. \u2014\u2014\u2014 TENNESSEE Democrats are hoping to chip away at vast Republican majorities in the state Legislature by focusing on urban areas, while the GOP is seeking to stamp out the last vestiges of Democratic support in rural parts of the state. \u2014\u2014\u2014 TEXAS Texas' only competitive congressional race looks to be the rematch between Republican U.S. Rep. Will Hurd and former Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego in a district that sprawls from San Antonio to suburban El Paso, including 800-plus miles of U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Hurd unseated Gallego in 2014. The entire Texas House also is up for election, along with 16 of the state Senate's 31 seats. Regardless of the outcomes, both chambers will remain Republican-controlled. \u2014\u2014\u2014 UTAH The independent campaign of Evan McMullin has made Utah suddenly relevant in presidential politics. If the former CIA operative, a Mormon, can win the state and claim its six electoral votes, it could upend Donald Trump's chances for the White House end five decades of reliably voting for the Republican nominee. \u2014\u2014 VERMONT This state, considered among the most liberal in the country, may well elect a Republican governor. That race pits Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, against former Transportation Secretary Sue Minter, a Democrat. \u2014\u2014\u2014 VIRGINIA Barbara Comstock, a first term GOP congresswoman, is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Trump's unpopularity in northern Virginia has loomed large in the race, with Bennett trying to tie Comstock to the presidential nominee. In the crowded race for mayor of Richmond, the front-runner is Joe Morrissey, a former state lawmaker who went to jail for having sex with his then-17-year-old receptionist, who is now his wife. \u2014\u2014\u2014 WEST VIRGINIA Republicans are hoping to ride on the coattails of an expected strong showing for Trump, who has promised to put coal miners back to work. In the governor's race, Democrat Jim Justice, a billionaire coal and agriculture magnate, faces Bill Cole, the state Senate president. In the state auditor's race, Democrat Mary Ann Claytor is vying to become the first African-American statewide officeholder in West Virginia history. \u2014\u2014\u2014 WASHINGTON Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking a second term. He faces Republican Bill Bryant, a former Seattle port commissioner who says Inslee has mismanaged the state's mental health system and failed to fund K-12 education as mandated by the state Supreme Court. Six initiatives are on the statewide ballot, including raising the minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by 2020 and imposing a carbon emission tax on certain fossil fuels. \u2014\u2014\u2014 WISCONSIN It's 2010 all over again in Wisconsin's U.S. Senate race. This time, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is the incumbent and former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold is the challenger. Johnson argues that having been fired once by voters, Feingold does not deserve to be sent back. But Feingold says Johnson has not led on the issues Wisconsin voters care about and should not be given a second term. \u2014\u2014\u2014 WYOMING Republican Liz Cheney is heavily favored to win Wyoming's only seat in the U.S. House, which was formerly held by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney . Her opponent, Democrat Ryan Greene, works for an oilfield services company. Wyoming voters also will decide whether to allow the state to invest potentially billions more in the stock market, changing a state law that limits investments. 0 Shares ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Robert Costa November 6 at 5:09 PM Follow @costareports In one of his last rallies in Pennsylvania, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a fervent pitch for voters in the swing state \"to dream big with your vote,\" on Nov. 6. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) ALIQUIPPA, Pa. \u2014 Drive through this sleepy town and you\u2019ll see rows of shuttered homes and the carcasses of buildings where molten metal once flowed. Stop by Babich\u2019s Family Restaurant and you\u2019ll find supporters of Donald Trump. Joshua Carr, 35, is one of them. He\u2019s the owner. Black T-shirt and a backward cap, raising a young family with his wife. Craving not just change but the kind of radical change that Trump offers. \u201cThe world is all screwed up. The big J and L\u201d \u2014 the former Jones & Laughlin steel complex along the Ohio River \u2014 \u201cis gone.\u201d So is most everything else around here, he said. The people. The jobs. \u201cPut in Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ll win again.\u201d Carr, a Democrat who voted for President Obama, was the first person encountered during a road trip late last week that began in western Pennsylvania and ended 350\u00a0miles to the east in a prosperous Philadelphia suburb \u2014 and he reflected both the promise and peril facing the Republican presidential nominee in this battleground state in the race\u2019s final sprint. Although Trump has electrified white working-class people across the spectrum who are eager for volatile transformation, those voters are far from the entirety of an increasingly diverse electorate where Trump-style change is as feared in the cities and suburbs as it is embraced in the countryside. Trump\u2019s chances Tuesday are likely to hinge on whether there are enough voters in states like Pennsylvania , which last sided with a Republican in 1988 and where Trump has poured energy, who are willing to abandon their usual voting patterns in favor of disruption. Joshua Carr, 35, the owner of Babich\u2019s Family Restaurant, eats breakfast in Aliquippa, Pa. (Bob Costa/The Washington Post) The journey through Pennsylvania revealed that while Trump signs dot countless lawns throughout the industrial region, they do so progressively less as you move east, as if Trump\u2019s support were a fading red swath on the map. Cities such as Pittsburgh and many suburbs are still strongholds for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has been ahead in polls all year and remains narrowly so in the final days of the election. For Trump \u2014 who rallied Sunday in Moon, Pa., near Pittsburgh and plans to be in Scranton on Monday \u2014 the hurdle remains wary voters, including moderates in his own party, who see his rowdy populism as an unwelcome upending of American life. Clinton\u2019s challenge is one of turnout. The demographics and organization favor her in vote-rich areas like Philadelphia, where she will appear Monday night with President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and former president Bill Clinton. But the appetite for change elsewhere does not. Phil Patton, 69, and Trish Mihalik, 52, at Babich\u2019s Family Restaurant in Aliquippa, Pa. (Bob Costa/The Washington Post) Sitting across Babich\u2019s is Phil Patton, 69. A Vietnam veteran, he graduated from the nearby high school with the brother of Mike Ditka, the legendary football coach who hails from here and is part of the town\u2019s mythology. \u201cAlways been the home of champions,\u201d Patton said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way we were all brought up.\u201d But Patton said Aliquippa has changed, and so has he. This year the longtime Democrat will vote for Trump: \u201cHe\u2019s a nut and he runs his mouth. He\u2019s not honest. But if not him, the country might as well fold up. It\u2019s over.\u201d Tucking into their breakfasts, John Rita and Bill Battisti were similarly bleak but do not back Trump. Both 76-year-old Democrats, they have seen men like Trump throughout their lives and \u201cwe see right through him,\u201d Rita said. On the right in jeans is John Rita, 76. On the left is Bill Battisti, 76. Babich\u2019s Family Restaurant in Aliquippa, Pa. (Bob Costa/The Washington Post) \u201cHe says he\u2019s going to bring the steel mills back. Doesn\u2019t he understand they\u2019re gone?\u201d Rita asked. \u201cThere\u2019s grass there now. What\u2019s he going to do? Throw some seeds down and the mills will grow?\u201d The men recalled that when they were in high school, they got recruited by manufacturing companies \u201cbefore we even graduated,\u201d Battisti said. \u201cThey wanted you that quickly.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never like that nowadays,\u201d Rita said. \u201cI keep getting calls for contracting jobs because the younger people don\u2019t get trained or they can\u2019t pass the piss test.\u201d Their waitress \u2014 Trish Mihalik, 52 \u2014 has three sons working with her husband down the road at Smiley\u2019s Tire. She said they\u2019re doing fine but it\u2019s not easy. Her family, which is Pentecostal Christian, is praying for Trump. \u201cLook around Aliquippa. It\u2019s dead,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ve put it all in God\u2019s hands.\u201d Left: George Crawford, 37, in the parking lot of the Giant Eagle grocery store in Pittsburgh\u2019s North Side. Top right: Katie Hicks, 60, in the parking lot of the Giant Eagle grocery store on Pittsburgh\u2019s North Side. Bottom right: Dwayne Ellis, 42, in the parking lot of the Giant Eagle grocery store on Pittsburgh\u2019s North Side. (Photos by Bob Costa/The Washington Post) Pittsburgh Twenty miles southeast and in the shadow of the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 gleaming baseball stadium is a Giant Eagle grocery store on the city\u2019s North Side. A light rain drizzles as a predominantly African American crowd makes its way through the parking lot. The only signs for blocks are baby-blue banners. \u201cThat\u2019s Clinton blue,\u201d Katie Hicks, 60, said. She said this city, along with Philadelphia, is Clinton\u2019s base and the reason Democrats should expect to carry Pennsylvania. \u201cBefore I retired, I had a good job at the Heinz factory \u2014 put the ketchup into packets. Started in \u201977, benefits and Blue Cross, you name it,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cThat was then. It was a good job. But hey, let\u2019s not call it the glory days.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the old Pittsburgh. All of that coal, the polluted air and rivers,\u201d she said, not to mention tense race relations. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m for Hillary.\u201d Smoking a cigarette near the shopping carts is George Crawford, 37, who lost his job recently as a busser at a restaurant downtown. He\u2019s living in a halfway house and said men like Trump \u201cdon\u2019t have any idea about my life.\u201d \u201cI was supposedly let go because someone didn\u2019t like the way I said something. Crazy. \u201cThe Trump wall isn\u2019t going to give me a job,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t make it better.\u201d Dwayne Ellis, 42, agreed. The handyman predicted a \u201ccivil war\u201d if Trump wins, caused by Trump cutting social spending levels and by anger over economic stagnation. \u201cImagine, he gets in after making all of these promises and doesn\u2019t keep them? There\u2019s your war,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary has her mind set right. She\u2019ll make things happen.\u201d From left, Angelo Donia, Todd Menser and Carl Kennell outside the Paint Chop, a custom-paint business, in Somerset, Pa. (Bob Costa/The Washington Post) Somerset There they are, the embodiment of Trump Country in Pennsylvania: Angelo Donia, Todd Menser and Carl Kennell. The three friends are mingling and cracking jokes outside the Paint Chop, a custom-paint shop on a leafy street in Somerset, off Exit\u00a0110 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Trump-Pence signs neatly line the curb. They\u2019re conservative Republicans who work with their hands. They\u2019re convinced that Clinton is corrupt. They insist that the national media cannot be trusted. And if a traditional Republican had been nominated, they said they may not have voted. \u201cIt ain\u2019t working with the people in there, that\u2019s for damn sure. The whole system is sick and it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d said Menser, a burly 65-year-old plumber with a thick white beard. \u201cThe working man is tired of taking a beating.\u201d Donia, 53, is furious about the Clintons\u2019 wealth: \u201cHow do you come out of these government jobs and make millions and millions of dollars for giving speeches? It\u2019s criminal. \u201cSo while they make their millions, the little guy here is getting choked,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t live on minimum wage unless you\u2019re getting assistance.\u201d Somerset has rebellious anti-tax roots that trace to its role in the Whiskey Rebellion. It\u2019s also near Shanksville, where Flight\u00a093 crashed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Menser was there that day: \u201cI was a fireman and worked out at the morgue. You don\u2019t forget that, the smell.

(Photos by Bob Costa/The Washington Post) Carlisle This bustling borough in central Pennsylvania generally tilts right. The local GOP congressman, Lou Barletta, is nationally known for his advocacy of hard-line immigration policies. Farms around here have Trump-Pence logos painted on barn doors. But there are pockets of blue in the exurbs of Harrisburg, the state capital. As you travel east in the state, people seem more open to government, which is a major employer, and happier about the way their lives are going. Sue Walker, 55, the owner of Jaymee Lee\u2019s Diner in the adjacent hamlet of Newville, counts herself as a proud Democrat. When the man who lives on the second floor above her restaurant put up homemade posters that read \u201cTrump dug his hole now we bury him\u201d and \u201cOur new president Hillary Clinton,\u201d Walker didn\u2019t ask him to take them down. \u201cOh, customers grumbled,\u201d she said as pots of steaming coffee whizzed by and the Diet Pepsi nozzle filled up glasses. \u201cI had a guy who lectured me for a freaking hour. He got teary eyed as he talked about Donald Trump and put him in the same sentence as Jesus. I mean, really?\u201d Walker said the pro-Clinton paraphernalia hasn\u2019t been a problem for business, either. \u201cDoes it look like we\u2019re hurting?\u201d she asked, gesturing to the packed restaurant. Walker said she and many women she knows find Trump \u201cdisgusting.\u201d \u201cEvery woman has known men like Donald Trump. It\u2019s nauseating and obnoxious and we\u2019ve had enough.\u201d \u201cBeing a woman, though, isn\u2019t why I\u2019m with her,\u201d Walker said pointedly. \u201cI\u2019m with her because she has the experience. She wouldn\u2019t start fighting with everyone.\u201d Pedestrians walk down the main street of Newtown, Pa. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Newtown If you\u2019re an upper-middle-class Republican who is uneasy about Trump, you can find refuge at the Starbucks on State Street, where lawyers and corporate professionals pick up iced lattes on their way to office parks. Matt Benchener, 30, is in gym clothes and hunched over his laptop. A soft-spoken Wharton graduate, he works for a financial services company. Benchener describes himself as fiscally conservative, a foreign-policy hawk and \u201cfairly socially progressive.\u201d These days, however, he\u2019s mostly pained. Same with his wife, with whom he has two children younger than 5. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have to go third party,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep thinking if [House Speaker] Paul Ryan had run this year, that would\u2019ve been very appealing.\u201d JoAnn Snow, 65, a Democrat and retired saleswoman, says she doesn\u2019t believe that the Republicans here are as anti-Trump as they say. \u201cI\u2019m worried all the time,\u201d Snow said as she waits for a friend. \u201cI see more and more Trump signs. I know Clinton supporters are subtler, but it bothers me. Not too long ago I was so confident. Now I\u2019m scared. If he wins, I will cry for days.\u201d Michael Roytman, 45, said Snow could be right. In private, most of the suburban Republicans this conservative knows fume about the way the federal government and their children\u2019s schools are managed. \u201cMediocrity is too often becoming acceptable\u201d said Roytman, a compliance specialist who immigrated from the then Soviet Union in 1991. Emily Edelson, 46, a staunch Democrat and office manager, said she understands aspects of those frothing frustrations but wonders if they\u2019re \u201ca little over the top.\u201d \u201cThe country is actually better off than it gets credit for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not this dire, awful place.\u201d \u201cRight?\u201d In Pennsylvania, the answer tends to depend on where you are. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "WATCH Pope Francis In A Minute 0 Shares Email Days before the U.S. presidential election, Pope Francis spoke publicly about the danger of citizens becoming 'walled-up' and tyrannized by people exploiting their fears. Some observers at different ends of the U.S. political spectrum took the pope's address as an indirect criticism of some of the policies of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has proposed to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The pontiff spoke at the Vatican on Saturday evening before the Third World Meeting of Popular Movements, a collection of grassroots groups representing the poor. Pope Francis warned against \"the terrorism of an economy focused only on making money,\" fostering fear so that \"the citizens who still have some rights are tempted by the false security of physical or social walls ... Walls that enclose some and exile others,\" according to Catholic News Service . \u201cNo tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears,\u201d the pope further said, according to a transcript provided by Vatican Radio. \u201cCitizens are walled-up, terrified on one side; on the other side, even more terrified, are the excluded and banished,\u201d Pope Francis said. His remarks drew both praise and criticism on Twitter.

Earlier this year, the pope directly criticized Trump's proposal to build a border wall. \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" the pontiff told journalists in February. \"This is not the Gospel.\" A Vatican spokesman said afterward that Pope Francis was not personally attacking Trump or telling anyone how to vote. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Robert Samuels November 6 at 12:30 PM Follow @newsbysamuels A group of mostly Latino Clinton supporters from unions supporting domestic workers and grassroots groups wave anti -rump signs to commuters in Miami. The mural in the background is titled \"When Pigs Fly.\u201d (Angel Valentin/For The Washington Post) MIAMI \u2014 Five undocumented domestic workers, all named Maria, fanned out across Little Havana delivering a desperate, last-minute plea to Hispanic voters: We can\u2019t vote, but you can. Vote early to ensure a President Trump does not deport us. In Hialeah, a traditional stronghold for Cuban American Republicans, backers of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton drove a colorful, Colombian-style chiva party bus with bongo drums and rumba dancers handing out Cuban pastries and \u201cHispanics for Hillary\u201d signs. And in ritzy Coral Gables, Maria Ballaster, a 60-year-old Cuban American who has always voted Republican reflected on why she had just split her ballot \u2014 sticking with her party\u2019s nominee for the U.S. Senate, Marco Rubio , while casting a vote for Clinton. \u201cI trust Rubio, but I don\u2019t trust Mr. Crazy,\u201d Ballaster said. Here in Florida and across the country, there are early indications that Hispanics have mobilized for this election like no other in U.S. history. Activist groups and Clinton allies, motivated largely by a deepening fear of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are deploying new voter outreach strategies and hoping to take advantage of growth in the Latino electorate. In Nevada , thousands of voters lined up outside an early-voting site at a Latino market Friday night, prompting voting hours to be extended at the end of what has been a record-breaking early-voting surge in the state. Turnout was so high in Clark County , home to Las Vegas, that Democrats enter Tuesday with an advantage similar to the one they held there four years ago when President Obama won Nevada by 7 points. Similarly heavy early-voting turnout among Hispanics in Colorado and Arizona has given Democrats hope in those battleground states, too. Early voting is not necessarily an indication of final results, given that those who have turned out so far are highly motivated and that the election will be decided by the millions more who cast ballots Tuesday. Some analysts say it is possible that Latino early voting will draw from Election Day turnout rates. Nonetheless, the increase has taken place even in states such as Texas , where Democrats have not focused on galvanizing voters. The spike appears to be the result of the rising number of Hispanic voters and the increasingly aggressive efforts to organize what has long been considered a potent voting bloc whose numbers have never lived up to their potential. Adding to the fervor is widespread anger at Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric about Hispanics and Mexico, suggesting that Clinton could outperform Obama\u2019s 71 percent share of the Hispanic vote from 2012. \u201cTrump has built a wall, indeed,\u201d said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster who specializes in Latino voters. \u201cAnd it is a new firewall for Democrats.\u201d Experts who closely track Hispanic voters caution that the turnout numbers so far seem to reflect anticipated growth rates expected to continue into the 2030s. \u201cThis year\u2019s historic turnout in some respects is not unusual,\u201d said Mark Lopez, Pew Research Center\u2019s director of Hispanic research. About 11.2\u00a0million Hispanics voted in 2012, representing just less than 50 percent of all eligible Latino voters. Since then, the number of eligible Hispanics has jumped by about 4\u00a0million voters, which is on par with the overall growth rates of the Hispanic population, according to Pew. In Colorado, the steady growth of the Latino vote has fueled a narrow edge for Democrats. Obama\u2019s campaign registered thousands of Hispanics there in 2008 and 2012, and many more have been registered by Clinton\u2019s campaign and that of her Democratic primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and groups such as the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. As the presidential race tightens, Democrats are going after voters in the Republican stronghold of Georgia. In Gwinnett County, a rising number of minorities could be changing the political landscape. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) In every part of the state, Democrats have found Latino voters who have not been active in recent elections or had voted for more moderate Republicans. Damian Alcazar, 46, was registered with the Republican Party and had backed the 2008 presidential bid of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). But by Friday night, when he stopped by a GOP get-out-the-vote rally in Aurora, he had already cast a ballot for Clinton. \u201cTrump\u2019s way too risky,\u201d he said. In Colorado Springs, the center of the state\u2019s largest Republican stronghold, Democrats were targeting and turning out Latinos. Over lunch at El Ranchito 2, a supermarket and restaurant, an entirely Latino clientele was divided between those who could not vote and those who had already voted for Clinton. \u201cThe Democrats sent me mail, but I didn\u2019t really need it,\u201d said Jaime Valdez, 70. \u201cI was going to vote for Hillary.\u201d Resident Valentina Perez, 73, gets a visit from Maria Bilbao, 50, and her son Thomas Kennedy, 25, in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood as they canvass for Clinton on Friday. (Angel Valentin/For The Washington Post) In Florida, early-voting data suggests that Hispanics are emerging as a larger force in the state\u2019s electorate \u2014 and that many Latinos are participating for the first time. The Hispanic share of overall early voters is sharply higher this year, up about 15\u00a0percent from about 10\u00a0percent at this stage four years ago, according to an analysis by University of Florida political scientist Daniel A. Smith. Another examination of the numbers, by Democratic strategist Steve Schale, found that more than half of the Hispanics who have voted so far have either never voted before or voted only once previously. The diversity of the state\u2019s Hispanic electorate has long presented a challenge for campaigns in both parties. Cuban Americans, particularly in Miami, have been Republican stalwarts, though younger generations have been trending toward the Democrats. People with roots in Central America and Mexico have favored the Democrats historically. In the past, Republicans have made some inroads with the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have settled largely around Orlando and have been a swing bloc. Overall, the polls in Florida are tight. The Trump campaign and its allies have been working to mobilize voters in the state\u2019s more rural and conservative areas. Trump and his backers have also predicted that many Hispanics will turn out for him Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the polls,\u201d said Nelson Diaz, the Miami-Dade County GOP chairman. \u201c There\u2019s been an incredible intensity for Trump and long lines in our Hispanic Republican precincts. There\u2019s a big misunderstanding of what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a silent majority and first-time voters that the polls aren\u2019t capturing and I think he\u2019s going to end up doing well here.\u201d On Saturday, the Democrats\u2019 efforts to court Cuban Americans was on display in Hialeah, the heart of the exile community. In addition to the chiva bus, Clinton allies parked a van blasting hip-hop and reggaeton music. They also handed out guava pastries from a tent. Waiting for them were a group of Trump supporters who started yelling, \u201cLock her up!\u201d The Democrats started shouting back, comparing the GOP presidential nominee to the reviled Cuban dictator: \u201cCastro, no! Trump tampoco!\u201d They also chanted another Spanish phrase that suggested Trump and Castro were funded by the Russians. Clinton supporters rally in Miami. (Angel Valentin/For The Washington Post) Across Miami-Dade County, Hispanics seemed to be heavily favoring Clinton. Marilyn Ralat-Albernas considered the stakes in the election so high for her Hispanic community that she took a month off work to volunteer for Clinton. Ralat-Albernas, a 62-year-old registered nurse of Puerto Rican descent, said she has spent days knocking on doors, canvassing neighborhoods, attesting to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and proclaiming the threat posed by Trump to millions of undocumented immigrants. \u201cWhen he insulted Mexicans, he was insulting all of us,\u201d said Ralat-Albernas, referring to Trump\u2019s description of Mexican immigrants as rapists. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand our culture. We need to come together and show him that our community is powerful.\u201d In Florida, a network of immigrant rights organizations, unions and leftist nonprofits aligned to bring out the vote for more than a year, according to Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition. In the past year, they knocked on 1\u00a0million doors of low- and mid-propensity voters throughout the state, nearly 60 percent of whom were Latino. In the trendy Miami Modern District, they handed out cups of Cuban coffee near a mural depicting Trump as a flying pig, to attract young Latinos to vote; they invested in ads on salsa radio stations on Pandora that encouraged listeners to vote early. They scoured areas with large Central American populations to interact with Honduran and Nicaraguan voters who are not typically targeted. The community seemed ready to engage, according to Monica Russo, executive vice president of the local Service Employees International Union. Those voters who answered the doors were already concerned with raising the federal minimum wage and immigration reform. By the time Trump captured the Republican Party\u2019s nomination, Russo said these voters were already inspired to make a difference. \u201cFolks don\u2019t seem afraid,\u201d Russo said. \u201cThey seemed determined.\u201d Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Lorella Praeli, the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of Hispanic outreach, said the campaign sought to recruit ambassadors inside communities \u2014 the owner of the local bodega or Spanish grocery and the matriarchs and abuelas who might have an affinity for electing the first female president. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming some of the most influential Latinas in the country as we build our path to la victoria para Hillary,\u201d read one advertisement. \u201cLatinos will shape the future of our pa\u00eds.\u201d When Praeli produced the ad, she said some asked why they would publish something in the informal Spanglish. \u201cThis is a part of our culture,\u201d Praeli said. \u201cIt shows that we understand how families speak with one another.\u201d One of the most persuasive strategies for Clinton allies has been to send undocumented workers to knock on the doors of potential Hispanic voters to explain the stakes of the election. On Friday, Maria Bilbao and her son, Tomas Kennedy, jumped into their old Mercedes with broken air conditioning to explain what a Trump presidency might mean for their family. She was one of the five undocumented Marias canvassing around Little Havana. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not voting,\u201d said one woman, Maria Figueroa, 56, upon opening her door to see Bilbao and Kennedy. \u201cThey are both liars.\u201d Kennedy explained that he agreed the candidates were not the best, but one candidate was better than the other. \u201cThis is my mother, and she is undocumented,\u201d Kennedy told her. Their family moved from Argentina in 2001, when its economy was collapsing. They were told the wait list to move legally lasted 17 years. Kennedy received a reprieve through the Obama administration\u2019s decision to shield from deportation many people who came to the country as young children. His mother is still at risk. \u201cIf Trump is elected, we don\u2019t know what he will do,\u201d Kennedy continued. \u201cHe\u2019s going to pull our family apart.\u201d \u201cHe is crazy,\u201d Bilbao added, circling one finger around her ear. Figueroa finally agreed she would vote. She wrote down the address for her polling place. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Figueroa said, \u201che cannot be a president.\u201d As the sun beat down that afternoon, the Marias stood on the side walk and traded stories of their interactions with voters. \u201cI told her I cannot vote, but this country needs you to vote,\u201d Maria Lima said, recalling another woman she persuaded. \u201cOur dreams of better life rest on you.\u201d She lifted her sunglasses to wipe the moisture from her face. It was a mixture of sweat and tears.

    "text": "Court Denies Injunction to End Philly Transit Strike Before Election Day By Michael Edison Hayden Nov 6, 2016, 4:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Philadelphia Transit Strike Comes to an End 0 Shares Email The largest city in the battleground state of Pennsylvania may have no mass transit running on Election Day . Philadelphia transit workers remain on strike, after a judge in state court on Friday evening declined the transit agency's request to issue an injunction to force an end to the work stoppage for Election Day. But the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA , will have another chance to press its case for the injunction when the hearing resumes Monday. Pennsylvania is a battleground state, and Philadelphia, the state's largest city, votes overwhelmingly Democratic. The transit agency has said that Philadelphia's elderly, disabled and ill are most at risk from the loss of subway, bus and trolley services during the strike. \"We are not going to lie down while they can't resolve this strike, and just watch our passengers suffer. Not going to do it,\" Gino Benedetti, a lawyer for SEPTA, told ABC News' affiliate 6-Action News. But Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the Transportation Workers Union Local 234 has told ABC News that the union does not expect the strike to affect voter turnout in the city. \"Our members are really solid; nothing is moving in this city,\" he said of the workers' unity and the strike's effect on bus, subway and trolley transportation. Jacqueline Larma/AP Photo Signs hang on a telephone pole as workers picket across from the Callowhill SEPTA Depot, Nov. 1, 2016, in Philadelphia. Horwitz told ABC News today that while talks have progressed between SEPTA and the union, no agreement has been reached. \"There's been movement on all issues, but there's no tentative agreement on anything,\" Horwitz said. Horwitz said the primary disagreements between the two sides focused on the scheduling of workers, who he said were frequently not given adequate time to eat, rest between shifts or take bathroom breaks. In addition to the issues over scheduling, the union is fighting on issues over pensions and health care. The strike began at midnight Oct. 31. Philly Transit Workers Downplay Fears Strike Could Hit Turnout in Dem Stronghold Jacqueline Larma/AP Photo Transport workers man a picket line near the 69th Street Terminal, Nov. 1, 2016 in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. Megan Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Republican Party , told ABC News last week that its staffers are monitoring the transportation strike but haven't taken any specific actions yet to accommodate voters who might be hindered by it. Jacqueline Larma/AP Photo A pedestrian passes a locked rail station in west Philadelphia, Nov. 1, 2016. \"We always have a really aggressive plan to make sure people get to the polls, and we always have contingency plans,\" she said, adding that she believed that enthusiasm for Donald Trump in the traditionally Democratic-leaning city appeared \"very strong.\" ABC News has reached out to the Pennsylvania Democratic Party but has not received a response. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf urged both sides to keep a dialogue open until an agreement can be reached. \"Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvania residents rely on SEPTA to travel each day to and from work and school, and the inability of TWU and SEPTA to reach an agreement is devastating for many of these individuals and their families,\" Wolf said in a statement last week. \"This will create extreme hardships for the city and for businesses.\" The most recent previous strike by the union, in November 2009, lasted six days before being resolved. Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Clinton in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and stressed the importance of the state to the Democrats retaining the White House. \u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, we win this election,\u201d Biden said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Kohlhepp appeared before Magistrate Judge Jimmy Henson on Sunday for the brief bond hearing on the four murder counts. The issue of bond could be taken up by a circuit court later. Wearing an orange jumpsuit, Kohlhepp declined to make a statement when offered the chance. After Kohlhepp left the courtroom, Henson addressed the victims\u2019 families, saying, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve gone through ... is beyond what a lot of people would understand.\u201d Kohlhepp\u2019s arrest has put to rest for local law enforcement and the families of the victims a mystery that has haunted them for more than a decade. \u201cWe got \u2018em today. We got \u2018em today. I\u2019m rejoicing that this community can know that four people who were brutally murdered, there\u2019s no wondering about it anymore,\u201d Sheriff Chuck Wright said late Saturday night. Prosecutors said more charges are expected. A Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s investigative report says Kohlhepp \u201cconfessed to investigators that he shot and killed\u201d the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop. \u201cKohlhepp gave details ... that only the killer would know,\u201d the report says. Authorities say Kohlhepp is a suspect in at least three other deaths. Sheriff Wright says Kohlhepp also showed law enforcement officers Saturday where he says he buried two other victims on his 95-acre property near Woodruff. Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, was at the site for less than an hour. The sheriff would not say earlier Sunday whether more bodies were found in the graves Kohlhepp led them to, but he did say they would be excavated, reported CBS Spartanburg affiliate WSPA-TV . Those alleged grave sites are in addition to the body found Friday at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver , the boyfriend of Kala Brown, who was found Thursday. Carver and the woman went missing around Aug. 31. Their last known cellphone signals led authorities to the property. Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds. An anthropologist is helping determine how long Carver was buried, Clevenger said. He declined to say how many times Carver had been shot. The sheriff said it\u2019s possible more bodies will be uncovered. The wife of one of the 2003 victims said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the shop several times. Melissa Ponder told The Associated Press she was resigned that her husband Scott\u2019s death would never be solved before getting a phone call Saturday evening from one of the case\u2019s original detectives. Detectives told family members of all four victims of the confession at the same time. \u201cHe knew too much about the crime scene,\u201d Ponder said of Kohlhepp\u2019s account to detectives. \u201cHe knew everything.\u201d The Superbike killings stunned the Chesnee community, with rumors like they were committed by a Mexican drug gang or were part of a love triangle crushing the families of the victims. Melissa Ponder is glad the rumors weren\u2019t true. \u201cIt isn\u2019t closure, but it is an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am thankful for that.\u201d Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. Fifteen years after he was released from prison for that crime, Spartanburg County deputies were brought to his property by the last known cellphone signals of two missing people. On Thursday, they found Brown chained in a container for two months. She told investigators that Kohlhepp shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her.\u00a0 His prison stint didn\u2019t stop Kohlhepp from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm. Wright said \u201cit\u2019s strange\u201d that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long. Scott Waldrop, who\u2019s lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \u201cprepper\u201d who liked his privacy, but \u201che didn\u2019t seem like a threat.\u201d Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \u201cI was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hate to know somebody who\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private but liked to brag about how much money he made day trading online. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "'Didn't want her to run': Podesta says top Clinton aide didn't support presidential candidacy Published               November 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills didn\u2019t want her boss to run for president \u2013 something campaign chairman John Podesta believed was because Mills approved Clinton\u2019s use of a secret email server, according to a message released Sunday by WikiLeaks. The exchange between Podesta and Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden on July 24, 2015, started when Tanden asked if Podesta knew \u201cwho told Hillary she could use a private email? Has that person been drawn and quartered?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think Cheryl?\u201d Podesta answered. In a later reply to Tanden, Podesta added the kicker: \u201cAt least we now know why Cheryl didn\u2019t want her to run.\u201d CLINTON AIDE CRIED FOUL ON OBAMA'S EMAIL DENIAL That conversation wasn\u2019t the first time Podesta and Tanden had speculated that Mills played a central role in the establishment of Clinton\u2019s private email system. Just hours after The New York Times broke the Clinton email story on March 2, Podesta and Tanden exchanged emails about the nascent controversy that would dog Clinton throughout her run to the Democratic presidential nomination.

See Predictions Map \u2192 \u201cThis is a Cheryl special,\u201d Tanden wrote in an email \u00a0that would later be hacked from Podesta\u2019s Gmail account and posted to WikiLeaks. \u201cKnow you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heal. Or kryptonite. She just can\u2019t say no to this s---. Why didn\u2019t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.\u201d Podesta replied \u201cUnbelievable\u201d before Tanden answered her earlier question: \u201cI guess I know the answer[.] they wanted to get away with it.\u201d Mills has been part of Team Clinton\u2019s orbit for decades, since serving as an associate counsel to President Bill Clinton starting in 1993. Mills also was chief of staff for Hillary Clinton during her tenure at the State Department. Additionally, Mills, who now runs her own company, has been a trusted adviser to Hillary Clinton, with emails showing Mills\u2019 influence extended from matters relating to The Clinton Foundation to numerous aspects of Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential run. The FBI interviewed Mills during its probe into Clinton\u2019s private email server, but Mills was granted partial immunity for her cooperation and wasn\u2019t charged with a crime. Advertisement ",

REUTERS/Rodi Said Email BEIRUT - U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian forces announced their plan Sunday to retake the the de facto capital for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) in Syria \u2013 Raqqa -- saying they hoped Turkey would not \u201cinterfere in internal Syrian affairs.\u201d The operation threatens to worsen the tensions between several nations either fighting with or backing soldiers in the five-year-old Syrian civil war . Abdirizak Warsame is facing 15 years in prison after leaving Minnesota to join ISIS and send other Americans to their deaths in Syria. Warsame, w... The announcement by the Syria Democratic Forces, a coalition of Kurdish, Arab and Christian forces, was made Sunday at a press conference in Ein Issa, north of Raqqa, attended by commanders and spokespeople for the group. An official who read out a statement said the operation to liberate Raqqa, dubbed the \u201cEuphrates Rage\u201d operation, had officially begun. The statement said that 30,000 fighters will take part in the operation. The announcement comes as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces had entered the eastern edges of the ISIS-held city of Mosul and were working to push deeper into the last ISIS urban bastion in Iraq. But the Kurdish officials said the two campaigns were not coordinated, but simply \u201cgood timing.\u201d The SDF is dominated by the main Syrian Kurdish fighting force known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG. The United States considers the group as the most effective force against the ISIS, but Turkey views them as a terror organization and claims it\u2019s linked to Turkey\u2019s outlawed Kurdish group. Turkish officials including President Recep Tayip Erdogan have said they will not accept a role for the Kurds in the liberation of Raqqa. Turkey\u2019s defense minister last week suggested that instead of the Kurds, Turkish-backed forces can present an \u201calternative.\u201d Turkish-backed forces recaptured the town of Dabiq in Syria recently. ISIS took control of the town, which had a prewar population of about 3,000 people, in August 2014. The group\u2019s propaganda had boasted of the fight for the northern Syrian town, citing Islamic lore that it would be the scene of a major battle between crusaders and army of the Muslim caliphate that would herald Doomsday. But Kurdish officials have rejected any role for Turkey, or the opposition forces it backs inside Syria, in the Raqqa campaign, and U.S. officials have also acknowledged that the YPG will be a major part of any Raqqa offensive.

Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images FBI Director James Comey testifies during a hearing before House Oversight and Government Reform Committee July 7, 2016 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images Updated at 7:46 p.m. ET Following up on his letter that set off a firestorm of speculation just two weeks before U.S. voters head to the polls to choose a new president, FBI Director James Comey says the investigative team that analyzed a new trove of emails that were either to or from Hillary Clinton has finished its work \u2014 and that the review doesn't change the findings he put forth in July, when he said no charges will be pursued against Clinton. \"Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\" Comey wrote Sunday, in an official communication with 16 chairmen and ranking members of relevant House and Senate committees. A Changing America Faces A Stark Choice This Election \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\" Comey wrote Sunday. Two sources familiar with the investigation tell NPR's Carrie Johnson the material the FBI recently discovered and reviewed largely contained copies of messages the agents had already seen or personal emails. In response to Comey's letter, Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri said the campaign had been confident that the FBI would reach this conclusion, adding, \"we're glad that this matter is resolved.\" The topic of Clinton's use of a private email server gained new immediacy on Oct. 28, when Comey sent a letter to leading members of several congressional committees, in which he said federal agents had obtained a search warrant, as NPR reported , \"to examine the thousands of emails found on a computer belonging to former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner that could be pertinent to the investigation\" into Clinton. Article continues after sponsorship Hillary Clinton's Path To Election Day: Plans, Luck And Self-Inflicted Wounds News of a potential new angle in the email investigation opened the way for Clinton's Republican rival Donald Trump to attack her \u2014 a crucial development that was seen as helping his candidacy rebound from the devastating release of a 2005 audio recording in which Trump bragged about groping women. In the wake of the FBI director's letter , the race tightened and Clinton was forced to play defense. At a rally Sunday evening in Sterling Heights, Mich., Trump directly responded to Comey's new letter to Congress. \"Right now, she's being protected by a rigged system,\" he told the crowd. \"You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days \u2014 you just can't do it, folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.\" Earlier in the day, his vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence, touched on the matter at a rally in Hickory, N.C. \"Mishandling classified information is a crime,\" Pence said. \"Hillary Clinton said that she never sent or received any classified information, and the director of the FBI told the Congress classified information was sent.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Sunday afternoon that despite the FBI's findings, the incident shows \"a pattern,\" saying of Clinton, \"She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules.\" Comey's new letter comes after two weeks in which the FBI has been criticized for inserting the nation's top law enforcement agency into the closing weeks of a tense political season; Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid even wondered whether Comey had violated the Hatch Act . The new letter also comes four months after the legal issues at stake had seemed to be resolved: It was on July 5 that Comey announced that while Clinton and her staff were \"extremely careless\" in handling classified data via a private email server that Clinton used while she was secretary of state, the FBI was recommending no charges be brought against her.

Chiu / For The Times Angelenos line up at the North Hollywood polling station Sunday to cast their ballots ahead of Tuesday's election. Angelenos line up at the North Hollywood polling station Sunday to cast their ballots ahead of Tuesday's election. (Ring H.W. Chiu / For The Times) Sarah Parvini Contact Reporter Thousands of Angelenos braved long lines and, in some cases, waited up to four hours to take advantage of early voting this weekend at half a dozen polling stations set up around Los Angeles\u00a0County.\u00a0 From West Covina to Culver City, voters woke up before sunrise for a chance to be the first in line to cast their ballots and beat the inevitable crowds ahead of Tuesday\u2019s general election.\u00a0 At the polling station in North Hollywood, the line began in front of the public library, where voters stood with beach chairs slung across their backs, headphones plugged in or with cups of coffee\u00a0in tow. The trail snaked behind the building,\u00a0around the park and down the sidewalk.\u00a0 Jason Wesley drove by the hordes of voters on Saturday and decided he would wait until Sunday to cast his ballot. He arrived about 6:45 a.m. Sunday to try and avoid the line. \u201cI thought if I came an hour early, I\u2019d be OK,\u201d said Wesley, 37, who voted early because he will be out of town on Tuesday.\u00a0 By 9:45 a.m., he was still waiting to vote. \"There\u2019s a lot of planning that has to happen to vote early,\" he said. \u201cI still have 200 people in front of me.\u201d A record 19.4 million Californians are registered to vote in advance of the general election, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. More than 78% of eligible state residents are registered, the highest percentage in two decades, and 1.2 million additional voters are registered for this presidential election compared with 2012, the office said. Early voting in Los Angeles County Thousands turn out for early voting in Los Angeles County this weekend. (Bryan Chan / Los Angeles Times) Thousands turn out for early voting in Los Angeles County this weekend. (Bryan Chan / Los Angeles Times) See more videos In Los Angeles, officials said they were\u00a0\u201cseeing good turnout\u201d at several of the county\u2019s polling stations.\u00a0 \u201cPeople are very enthusiastic about the election,\u201d said Brenda Duran, a spokeswoman for the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s\u00a0Office. \u201cThey are being very patient.\u201d A total of 7,756 ballots were cast last weekend at early voting stations, Duran said. Sunday afternoon, voters broke that record. More than 8,000 Angelenos voted on Saturday alone, Duran said,\u00a0most of them in North Hollywood and Torrance. More than 25,000 people have voted early in L.A. County so far, she said. Early voting stations across the county opened from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. over the weekend. The Norwalk office will also be open for early voting on Monday. Sandy Santacreu, who lives four blocks away from the\u00a0North Hollywood Regional Library, said she wanted to cast her vote early because she wanted to avoid traffic \u2014\u00a0and worrying about work \u2014 on election day. She took her place in line about 7 a.m., she said. The atmosphere was peaceful rather than stressful, Santacreu said, and voters were helpful when others needed to briefly step away for coffee or food.\u00a0 A couple feet away, voters sat under a large white tent and waited for their numbers to come up. As\u00a0poll workers read from a list, a man in a striped\u00a0shirt jumped up from his seat and yelled, \u201cYahtzee!\u201d to a roar of cheers. Those still waiting clapped each time workers called a number. Parents walking with strollers stopped by the tent\u00a0to watch. \u201c4205?\u201d one voter said after the number was announced. \u201cThat\u2019s how many hours we\u2019ve been standing here, right?\u201d\u00a0 Along the surrounding\u00a0streets, drivers slowed their cars to a crawl to snap photos of the line and honked their horns in support.\u00a0 Like many others,\u00a0David Harvey arrived at the North Hollywood polling station just after dawn to find 100 people already waiting in line.

It\u2019s an important election.\u201d The New York native said he was pleased to see the election, no matter how divisive, was \u201cturning people out and not turning people off.\u201d Zoe Bergeron walked out of the library and up to her mother, Jane, with a grin. It was her first time voting, and after taking a government class the 18-year-old found the experience invigorating.\u00a0 \u201cI was nervous. ... I thought it was going to be more complicated,\u201d she said, adding that voting was well worth the wait. \u201cSeeing the line around the block, that was awesome.\u201d If anything, the large crowd created a sense of camaraderie,\u00a0Jane Bergeron said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to see a long line. The only time I had to wait in line was voting for Obama in 2008,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cYou had that sense that voting mattered. I get that same sense now. It\u2019s an important election, and you feel that.\u201d Caption Iraqi civilians flee Mosul area, white flags flying As Iraqis flee the Mosul area, they and the Iraqi military fear Islamic State fighters may have put on civilian clothing and joined the flood.

He has done nearly 500 public events since January. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times PUEBLO, Colo. \u2014 After obliging a request for a selfie from a woman in the lobby, Bill Clinton left his hotel here on Friday and rode to his rally, where he made the case that Hillary Clinton cared more about restoring jobs to forgotten workers than Donald J. Trump did. Mr. Clinton said that his wife got things done, as evidenced by \u201ca lady in a hotel lobby right here.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018Who do you think we ought to elect?\u2019\u201d Mr. Clinton said, supposedly recounting his conversation with the woman. \u201cShe said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to ask me that. I\u2019m from Belfast. I remember what she did to help make the peace in Northern Ireland.\u2019\u201d It was Mr. Clinton, not his wife, who played a major role in brokering a peace accord. And the woman in the lobby, Lorraine Gordon, who immigrated from Belfast and is now an American citizen, never said those things. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary,\u201d said Ms. Gordon, 57, who added that she resented illegal immigrants because she went through a long and expensive naturalization process. Her husband, John, 62, an engineer, added that \u201cthere\u2019ll be more jobs\u201d with Mr. Trump in charge. Photo A crowd listened to Mr. Clinton speak in Fort Collins. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Since January, Mr. Clinton has done nearly 500 public events, a good deal of them designed to capture the affection white working-class voters had for him and then transfer it to Mrs. Clinton. But that happens to be the demographic that constitutes Mr. Trump\u2019s base. Indeed, the man who was arguably the greatest political mind of his era has become something of a peripheral player, even within his wife\u2019s campaign. He has spent much of his time seeking support on the Democratic margins among those white voters he refuses to believe have abandoned him \u2014 and his wife \u2014 for good. \u201cThey took a leave of absence from normal politics because, you know, they went a long time without a raise,\u201d Mr. Clinton explained in a brief, post-selfie interview with a reporter in the hotel lobby. \u201cSo that\u2019s cyclical.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign managers and pollsters, aided by sophisticated data models and experience in the elections of 2008 and 2012, have shifted their focus away from the \u201cBubba\u201d voters and to the winning Obama coalition of African-Americans, young progressives and Hispanics who are powering Mrs. Clinton. And while members of his campaign say they cannot imagine a more valuable political spouse to have, in interviews as well as hacked emails released by WikiLeaks , Mr. Clinton has sometimes come off as an old master struggling to get with the new program. According to two advisers to the Clintons, who declined to be identified because they were describing internal conversations, Mr. Clinton has at times doubted the trust-the-data approach of her campaign manager, Robby Mook, and has required mollifying assurances from senior staff members. Sometimes lower-rung staff members, or one of his numerous Democratic allies in the country, have gone to Mr. Clinton to complain about decisions being made by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top campaign officials, causing irritation all around. One of the Clinton advisers said Mr. Clinton feared that her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would commit voter fraud in the Iowa caucuses by busing college students into the state, and urged the campaign to divert valuable energy away from organizing and onto defense against dirty tricks. Mr. Clinton saw his wife\u2019s coming blowout loss in New Hampshire, where his unexpectedly strong showing in 1992 helped propel him to the nomination, as a crisis that desperately needed to be staved off, despite polling that showed Mrs. Clinton would quickly rebound as the race moved to more diverse states. \u201cHe still thinks that HRC/he should be spending more time in Iowa/NH \u2014 earlier in January,\u201d his chief of staff emailed Mr. Mook last December. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Clinton\u2019s travel schedule, while robust, has operated on a second tier, with Clinton surrogates such as President Obama and his wife, Michelle, Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts appearing in the most prime locations. At times, the campaign even seems to prefer him off the radar. Photo Mr. Clinton has become a peripheral player in his wife\u2019s campaign. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Before Mrs. Clinton\u2019s debate with Mr. Sanders in October 2015 in Nevada, Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top policy aide, responded to an email from Huma Abedin, her top personal aide, confirming that Mr. Clinton would be joining his wife on the plane to Las Vegas with the words, \u201cThis is not a positive development.\u201d Asked about Mr. Clinton\u2019s role and standing in the campaign, his aides said his trips to Massachusetts and Missouri, both of which Mrs. Clinton narrowly won in the primaries, were based on his feedback and that the campaign\u2019s data showed Mr. Clinton was decisive in delivering victory. And Mr. Mook said Mr. Clinton has been nothing but helpful. \u201cHe\u2019s been an integral part of this campaign throughout,\u201d said Mr. Mook in a statement. \u201cOnce or twice a day I\u2019m able to get his feedback and advice, and I could not be more grateful to have someone who is at once a mentor, a political junkie and a brilliant tactician for our campaign.\u201d First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

Donald Trump in San Diego Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune Anti-Trump protesters, left, and Trump supporters scuffle at the end of 5th Avenue after Donald Trump's rally Friday in San Diego. Anti-Trump protesters, left, and Trump supporters scuffle at the end of 5th Avenue after Donald Trump's rally Friday in San Diego. (Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Across the broad swath of America that will decide the next president, the mood is bleak. An uncivil war of rhetoric and resentments has scoured the country, unearthing\u00a0deep ruptures. The candidates are unpopular and disdained for their shortcomings. Voters are fed up, mad at each other and despairing that anything can stem the corrosive\u00a0animosity that will trail the winner to Washington. And what happens after Tuesday? Can Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump put a fractured nation back together? Pennsylvania and Ohio are\u00a0neighboring states where the two parties held their nominating conventions in July and have bombarded voters ever since, to a sour end. Along the roughly 380 miles from Pittsburgh to Cleveland to Cincinnati, dismayed voters abound.\u00a0Ask them\u00a0if either candidate can restore some tranquility to the country, and\u00a0they\u00a0answer\u00a0as one:\u00a0It\u2019s hard to see how.\u00a0 Taysha Jacko can\u2019t even pretend to smile when she ponders the presidential contest at a Halloween festival in Alliance, a railroad-built town in northeast Ohio. She is 22 and, she said\u00a0with a curt shake of her head, she does not plan to vote. She is sick of it all. Neither of this year\u2019s options is\u00a0as appealing\u00a0as Barack Obama or Bill Clinton , the only politicians she has ever liked. If she did vote, she allowed, it would not be for Trump\u00a0because he\u2019s said nothing in this long campaign about children, and at least Hillary Clinton has done that. Hillary Clinton , sharply boosting her popularity and\u00a0giving her a commanding lead in the nation\u2019s most populous\u00a0state, according to\u00a0a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll . In late May, just... Months after a fractious primary season, California Democratic\u00a0and independent\u00a0voters have come home to Hillary Clinton , sharply boosting her popularity and\u00a0giving her a commanding lead in the nation\u2019s most populous\u00a0state, according to\u00a0a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll . In late May, just... (Melanie Mason) \u201cIt\u2019s a lost cause,\u201d said\u00a0Jacko. Almost nothing she can think of would bind the nation\u2019s wounds, except maybe for the candidates to notice people like her,\u00a0living lives far removed\u00a0from the bluster of the presidential campaign. \u201cI just want to hear from somebody, mainly, about the people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what the people want.\u201d What is that? \u201cHonesty. Sincerity,\u201d she said. She is not optimistic she\u2019ll get it. Halfway across\u00a0the state at a pumpkin patch in rural Ostrander, Crystal Shock\u2019s similar words posed a somber counterpoint to the squeals of children on nearby rides. She and her family have been through the wringer \u2014 lost jobs, uncertain housing, enough persistent economic worry that tickets for her four kids, at $12 each, verged\u00a0on unaffordable. So how does the next president glue together the shards\u00a0of a divided America? Crystal looked downcast. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle to make it every month,\u201d she said. \u201cCome down to our level. Know what it\u2019s like to struggle.\u201d The presidential campaign eight years ago is forever\u00a0wrapped in the soaring and optimistic Obama slogan:\u00a0\u201cChange we can believe in.\u201d This one\u2019s imagery is the detritus of FBI investigations, a candidate\u2019s vulgarities, accusations of dishonesty,\u00a0racial dog whistles, misogynist insults. Any campaign belongs to its times, and this one fits squarely into a worldwide dislocation of the masses from the elites \u2014 those of governments, businesses, religions, media. In Great Britain, those sentiments led to the vote to leave the European Union .\u00a0Here, it has helped to fuel Trump\u2019s rise and limit\u00a0Clinton\u2019s success.\u00a0 In an October tracking poll by SurveyMonkey, 50% of Americans said that the country was more divided now than ever before\u00a0and that the splits would persist \u201cfar into the future.\u201d Another 30% agreed that America was more divided than ever, but said the nation could knit itself together in the near future. That left fewer than 1 in 5 people to assert that the country hadn\u2019t actually sunk to its most divided state. A cycle of distrust has bred\u00a0pessimism, no matter the improving unemployment rate or other favorable statistics.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEven when the news is good, people don\u2019t trust it,\u201d said Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford law professor and political scientist who has studied the national mood. The randomness of threatening events \u2014 whether economic collapse or terrorism \u2014 \u00a0also \u201cmakes people jittery,\u201d he said. That sense of pessimism and dislocation is particularly strong among America\u2019s shrinking white majority.\u00a0 \u201cWhites are feeling like the earth is moving beneath their feet. Whether it\u2019s an African American president or immigrants, they feel the meaning of America is changing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s heaped onto the other insecurities.\u201d Christi Parsons and Chris Megerian President Obama extolled the virtues of Hillary Clinton and warned of the dangers of Donald Trump , and then he boiled it down to a personal appeal: \u201cI need you to go out and just nag the heck out of folks who aren\u2019t voting,\u201d Obama said Friday. \u201cI need you to tell them that Barack is personally... President Obama extolled the virtues of Hillary Clinton and warned of the dangers of Donald Trump , and then he boiled it down to a personal appeal: \u201cI need you to go out and just nag the heck out of folks who aren\u2019t voting,\u201d Obama said Friday. \u201cI need you to tell them that Barack is personally... (Christi Parsons and Chris Megerian) All of that can be found\u00a0in the campaign. Dave Gedrock was loading campaign signs into his car in Medina, Ohio, a historical town southwest of Cleveland. The attorney blamed\u00a0Trump\u2019s rise on Republicans such as former House Speaker John A. Boehner, who he thinks \u201cgave Obama everything he wanted\u201d \u2014 a characterization Democrats would dispute. \u201cAmerica\u2019s frustrated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a protest. They don\u2019t trust the current politicians, they don\u2019t trust the insiders, and I think that\u2019s why a lot of what Trump says doesn\u2019t come back to bite him.\u201d\u00a0 Trump, he said, would unite the country as president by making government smaller and reversing policies that are \u201cmaking it hard for people to make a living.\u201d Still, Gedrock exemplified\u00a0another way divisions have deepened this year: Both sides exist in their own bubbles, listening to their own set of truths, repeated by partisans on social media. He blamed\u00a0Obama for \u201capologizing to the Japanese for what happened in World War II, when they started the war.\u201d He said\u00a0Hillary Clinton supports sharia law, which discriminates against women. Neither is true. Asked where he\u2019d heard about Clinton\u2019s views on sharia, Gedrock said, \u201cI know I\u2019ve seen it on Facebook.\u201d Gedrock\u2019s opposite is\u00a0Sayisha Wall, standing on the bank of the Ohio River in Cincinnati with her daughter Arayanah, excitedly awaiting the start of a Clinton rally. Wall, a contractor for the IRS , said\u00a0she doesn\u2019t know anyone who is voting for Trump. \u201cThank God,\u201d she added. But while\u00a0Wall\u2019s political persuasion could not be more different than Gedrock\u2019s, her\u00a0yearnings sound a lot like his.\u00a0 \u201cThe majority of people are not billionaires, they\u2019re just trying to live and have a good quality of life and raise their kids,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not even the American dream of having a big house and a fancy car. It\u2019s just being able to pay our bills and be happy. To have a decent life.\u201d Wall, who is African American, said\u00a0racial tensions have risen during the campaign. When she went to vote the other day, she said, a man asked her to move her car because he said it was blocking his vehicle, which bore a Trump sticker. \u201cI said, \u2018You have 3 feet in front of me; I don\u2019t need to move my car\u2019,\u201d she recounted. \u201cAnd I heard him say [the N-word] as he got in the car.\u201d What can bring them\u00a0together? \u201cIf she gets in there I\u2019ll have all the hope and the faith in the world. I\u2019ll be able to sleep at night,\u201d she said. And if Trump wins? For more on politics \u00bb At\u00a0a convivial street fair in a thriving strip of shops\u00a0along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh, Jeanne and Chris Stephens were not feeling doomed. But neither were they thrilled\u00a0with the presidential race or optimistic about what follows. Trump and\u00a0Clinton aren\u2019t\u00a0talking about climate change or education, Jeanne says, nor about lives like theirs. \u201cHe has a great software job,\u201d she said, pointing to her husband. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. And we\u2019re still fighting [to get into the] middle class. And the more money we make \u2014 I don\u2019t mind paying the taxes, but you still feel like you really can\u2019t get ahead. And I have student loans. I\u2019m 40 now, and I have six figures in student loans still.\u201d She is not confident that anything will improve if Clinton is elected, \u201cbecause so many people hate her, so politically it\u2019s going to be a stalemate.\u201d But she cannot abide Trump. \u201cI\u2019ll vote for Hillary because I have no other choice,\u201d Jeanne says. \u201cI\u2019m voting for her to vote against Trump.\u201d A dozen miles from downtown Pittsburgh \u00a0on a Friday night, a high school football stadium was the place to hear impassioned calls for cooperation once the long election is over. The Central Catholic High School Vikings were heavily favored over the home-field Penn Hills Indians, the team for which Tony Allen\u2019s son, Joshua, plays defensive end. Tony, who was setting up to record the game, is a rare voter who thinks America will find itself if people just back off enough to let it. Any sort of coalescing, however,\u00a0will have to be neighbor to neighbor, bottom-up and not top down, negotiated by people like him, not dictated by the new president, Allen said. He has watched as friendships have broken up over this election. \u201cFacebook is a mess\u201d of\u00a0political feuds, he said. \u201cWe are allowing this election to divide us. Why?\u201d he asked. Whoever wins needs to deliver a simple message: \u201cAll the hype is over. We need to work together, to come together as a country.\u201d A few rows up and to the right is Bill Rielly, a Central Catholic fan, real estate appraiser\u00a0and Democrat-turned-Republican. \u201cI figure I\u2019m a moderate conservative, and I don\u2019t know that anybody\u2019s moderate anymore,\u201d he says, gently mocking\u00a0his position: \u201cIf you\u2019re not one way or the other,\u00a0there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201d A friend wanders by\u00a0and overhears the political talk. \u201cWho ya voting for, Bill?\u201d \u201cWell I\u2019m not voting for Hillary, Frank,\u201d Rielly replies. Rielly turns to back to the conversation. \u201c I didn\u2019t say I was voting for Trump. I said I\u2019m not voting for Hillary. ... Nobody wants to admit it. I think the Republicans are embarrassed. But by the same token, nobody wants her.\u201d Once it\u2019s all over, he wants the same thing that Tony Allen and the Stephenses and all the others want, regardless of their candidate, except that no one really seems to know how to get there. \u201cI hope the country comes together,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a polarizing election. I don\u2019t think anybody likes the two candidates.\u201d Then he repeated\u00a0: \u201cThis country needs to come together.\u201d Caption Senate candidate Kamala Harris pushing to help down-ballot Democrats State Atty.

Sixty-four percent of likely voters say the election of the next president has made the nation more divided, versus 23 percent who think it's made it more united. NBC News In addition, 62 percent say the country is headed in the wrong direction. And strikingly, 6 in 10 voters say the election has made them less proud of the country \u2014 compared with just 12 percent who said that before the 2008 presidential election. \"This election was never about hope, but it was an election about fear,\" says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the NBC/WSJ survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm. \"Donald Trump's message was the fear of what was happening to America, and Hillary Clinton's was about the fear of Donald Trump.\" Majorities have negative opinion of Trump, Clinton Both Clinton and Trump remain the most unpopular presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Fifty-nine percent of likely voters have a negative view of Trump, while 53 percent have a negative opinion of Clinton. So regardless who wins the election, the next president will be someone \"this country will be very uncomfortable with,\" says McInturff, the Republican pollster. When voters were asked about Clinton's and Trump's controversies and vulnerabilities during the presidential campaign, 76 percent said that whether Trump has the right temperament to serve as commander-in-chief is an important factor in deciding their vote. Sixty-five percent said the same of Trump's comments and language about women, immigrants and Muslims. For Clinton, 58 percent said her use of a private email server is an important factor in deciding their vote, and 50 percent said the same of the FBI's recent account of an investigation into thousands of emails that might be related to Clinton's use of private server. Obama's job-approval rating remains at 53 percent Despite that negativity, however, the popularity of the current Oval Office occupant remains high. President Barack Obama's overall job-approval rating stands at 53 percent among likely voters, which is unchanged from last month. Moreover, 51 percent have a position view of the president, versus 40 percent who have a negative view. And 49 percent said they would consider voting for Obama if the U.S. Constitution allowed him to seek a third term, compared with 50 percent who said they wouldn't consider it. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Nov. 3-5 of 1,282 likely voters (including more than 600 reached by cellphone), and it has a margin of error of plus-minus 2.7 percentage points. Mark Murray ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Why you should vote for me. Hillary Clinton campaigns Nov. 6, 2016, in Cleveland. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images) 22401 CONNECT TWEET 232 LINKEDIN 369 COMMENTEMAILMORE In January, America is going to have a new president. Things are going to change \u2014 that much is certain. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? We can build an economy that works for everyone, or stack the deck even more for those at the top. We can keep America safe through strength and smarts \u2014 or turn our backs on our allies, and cozy up to our adversaries. We can come together to build a stronger, fairer America, or fear the future and fear each other. Everything I\u2019ve done, as first lady, senator, or secretary of State, I\u2019ve done by listening to people and looking for common ground, even with people who disagree with me. And if you elect me on Tuesday, that\u2019s the kind of president I\u2019ll be. Here are four priorities for my first 100 days \u2014 issues I\u2019ve heard about from Americans all over our country. Donald Trump: Why you should vote for me First, we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. We\u2019ll invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come. We\u2019ll produce enough renewable energy to power every home in America within a decade. We\u2019ll cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire \u2014 because in America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. We\u2019ll pay for it all by asking the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share. And this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days. Creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidency. Second, we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was Ronald Reagan, and it was a priority for George W. Bush. I\u2019m confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship, secures our border, and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals. This is the right thing to do, and it will also grow our economy. Third, to break the gridlock in Washington, we need to get secret, unaccountable money out of our politics. It\u2019s drowning out the voices of the American people. So within my first 30 days, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. We should be protecting citizens\u2019 rights to vote, not corporations\u2019 rights to buy elections. Fourth, we need to get started on end-to-end criminal justice reform. Too many people have been sent away for far too long for non-violent offenses. I believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. There\u2019s so much more we need to do together, and we certainly won\u2019t get it all done in the first 100 days. But we\u2019re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for American families \u2014 and I\u2019ll never, ever quit. I want to be president for all Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans and independents; Americans of every race, faith and background. My opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness, fear and insults, and spent months pitting Americans against each other. I\u2019ve said many times that Donald Trump has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Because it\u2019s not just our names on the ballot this year. Every issue we care about is on the ballot, too. This is about who we are as a country \u2014 and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together, or change that pushes us further apart. It all comes down to this. I love our country. I believe in our people. And I think there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t achieve if we work together and invest in each other. Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president.

This image comes from a frame grab from the Arab 24 network. AP Targeting \"the obscurantists [who] have taken this city as capital for their so-called state,\" Syrian rebel forces have launched a military offensive aimed at kicking ISIS out of Raqqa. The groups waging the campaign, Operation Wrath Of Euphrates, is U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led. Senior members of the rebel force proclaimed the start of the campaign this weekend in Ain Issa, a town about 35 miles north of Raqqa \u2014 halfway between the larger city and the Turkish border. From Beirut, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports for our Newscast unit: \"There was no immediate comment from the U.S. military. Washington sees the Syrian Kurds as an effective partner in the fight against ISIS. Turkey, another ally in the coalition, disagrees sharply, calling them terrorists aligned with Turkey's outlawed Kurdish militants. Turkey has lobbied to be part of the operation in place of the Kurdish fighters. \"The Kurdish-led rebels say the operation, including Arab and Syrian Turkmen fighters, will start in the countryside outside Raqqa and move toward the city.\" The push toward Raqqa comes days after Iraqi forces entered Mosul, an ISIS stronghold in Iraq that's around 280 miles to the east of the Syrian city. Article continues after sponsorship As the long-awaited offensive in Mosul was showing signs of success last week, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi purportedly released an audio message calling on his fighters to hold fast in Mosul, and to conduct attacks in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As of Friday, the U.S.-backed attempt to retake Mosul had progressed more quickly than had been expected \u2014 but U.S. Major General Gary Volesky, who's leading U.S. forces in Iraq, tells NPR that he believes fighting will become more intense as Iraqi forces close in on the city's center \u2014 an area where ISIS fighters have reportedly gathered civilians to use as human shields.

The shirt has the word #CAB printed on them, and stands for Coach Art Briles, (Photo: Tony Gutierrez, AP) Brenda Tracy\u2019s voice caught, and she started crying as she has, off and on, since Saturday morning when she first saw a photo of Baylor fans lining up to buy T-shirts to wear in support of Art Briles, the former football coach fired in the wake of a wide-ranging sexual assault scandal. Recent reports now include explosive allegations of gang rapes committed by Briles\u2019 former players. \u201cThe photo itself is so hurtful,\u201d Tracy told USA TODAY Sports on Sunday afternoon. \u201cTo see this person selling those T-shirts and all those people standing in line \u2014 it was so hurtful. My heart was breaking for these survivors because I know what they must be feeling like. I just couldn\u2019t believe how cruel and callous and mean people can be. \u201cI get that you like Art Briles, and that\u2019s fine. You can think he\u2019s a good football coach, but when you\u2019re campaigning for him, you\u2019re campaigning against these survivors. What you\u2019re doing is so extremely hurtful.\" The line for #CAB shirts outside McLane Stadium. pic.twitter.com/mmbLG7Qw2f \u2014 Ryan Osborne (@RyanOsborneFWST) November 5, 2016 Tracy, who said she was gang-raped by then-Oregon State football players in 1998 and has since become an advocate for rape survivors, has been frustrated all fall by Baylor\u2019s response to a university-wide sexual assault scandal that also engulfed the football program and cost school president Ken Starr, athletic director Ian McCaw and Briles their jobs. Tracy even had visited with the team earlier this year to share her story and ideally help football players understand consent and sexual assault prevention. Now, after seeing the Baylor team take the field on Saturday in black uniforms and fans wearing those #CAB T-shirts, Tracy believes the school should cancel the rest of the football season. \u201cAll this stuff keeps coming out and these people just keep defending that man (Briles) \u2014 at the expense of all these victims and survivors \u2014 and I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why nobody is standing up and saying something about it. \u2026 You know that this is being organized. Why would you do this?\u201d Tracy paused to regain her composure. Baylor fans line up for T-shirts supporting Art Briles \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about 15 years of wanting to take my own life. I think about how badly I wanted to die every day. I think about these young women, and they\u2019re already traumatized by a rape, especially the women who were gang-raped. They\u2019re already struggling to survive, and you are putting this further trauma on top of them. It\u2019s like spitting in their faces. \u201cI think about how much they must be struggling \u2014 and how shameful it is of Baylor in this football season to not even care what these victims are going through. I\u2019m so angry with them. \u2026 You\u2019re making sure their lives are destroyed. People treat us (rape survivors) like we\u2019re not even human, like we don\u2019t even matter.\" Tracy read about Harvard canceling the remainder of its men\u2019s soccer season after it discovered those players had sexually objectified and written lewd observations of members of the women\u2019s soccer team. She thinks that\u2019s what Baylor should do with its football program \u2014 nothing the university has done so far has really shown that the players, coaches and program as a whole have learned anything from this scandal. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Baylor end the season for this?\u201d Tracy said. \u201cTo me, this is egregious behavior. This is not OK on any level. You cannot tell me that those assistant coaches and players didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\" After the release of the Pepper Hamilton report earlier this year, nine assistant coaches remained with the football program, now under direction of interim coach Jim Grobe. Those assistant coaches have remained steadfastly loyal to Briles amid what they perceive is an unjust firing, trying to convince visitors like Tracy that Briles did nothing wrong, and tweeting out statements disputing the new news reports regarding a 2011 gang rape. There's a #CAB banner hanging from one of the suites at McLane Stadium #Baylor #TCUvsBAY pic.twitter.com/urkDe5K6hO \u2014 Jessica Morrey (@JessicaMorrey) November 5, 2016 Kendal Briles, Art Briles\u2019 son and the Bears\u2019 offensive coordinator, wrote the letters CAB \u2014 for Coach Art Briles \u2014 on his hands during Baylor\u2019s season-opening win. Since then, the hashtag #CAB has gained traction among those in the Baylor fan base who believe the scandal is part of some wide-ranging conspiracy to oust the school\u2019s most successful football coach; this subset of fans also tends to believe that the sexual assault survivors who have come forward are either lying or anomalies and not part of a program-wide or school-wide problem. #CAB T-shirts and the subsequent push for a \u201cblackout\u201d to protest Briles\u2019 firing were planned for Saturday\u2019s game against TCU. Baylor players wore black uniforms, too, although the team denied that the uniforms were for any other reason than that of a heated rivalry against the Horned Frogs. \u201cNo,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re embroiled in this scandal. You are intentionally doing things to be hurtful and spiteful. I felt like that game and those uniforms were so disrespectful. \u2026 Those assistant coaches, I\u2019m so frustrated with them. What type of leadership is that? You should not have those kids in black uniforms. You know what black uniforms stand for. Even if those kids were innocent, and, \u2018Oh it\u2019s just a game and we do this every year' \u2014 in the middle of this scandal, and people trying to organize blackout for Art Briles, you don\u2019t do it. Period.\" Brenda Tracy speaks out after disappointing encounter at Baylor Tracy said she\u2019s tried to give Baylor the benefit of the doubt in the past, particularly because Grobe had invited her to visit with the team. She wants to believe that the players were engaged and absorbed her lesson. She wanted to believe that the coaching staff was, too. But receivers coach Tate Wallis accosted her afterward , trying to convince her Briles had done nothing wrong and she shouldn\u2019t even have visited. \u00a0And she\u2019s watched the other assistants tweet #TruthDontLie and other related hashtags to support Briles and antagonize those in the Baylor university administration who do want to address the scandal and implement changes. So Tracy says she is done being optimistic \u2014 and is now calling for the rest of the football season to be canceled. She believes only a drastic measure will actually affect change at this point. Baylor (6-2) has four games left in the regular season. ",

For those who couldn't make it to the celebration or didn't want to brave the estimated crowds of 5 million people, a Saturday trip to the Friendly Confines made for a much better option. And so Wrigleyville continued to buzz with excitement and something else it hasn't experienced in a century: November elation instead of October heartbreak. Hundreds of fans flitted around Wrigley Field, eager to take souvenir photos in front of the marquee, which for the first time in its history displayed the words \"World Series Champions.\" Many in the crowd had work obligations in the days following the Cubs' victory Wednesday over the Cleveland Indians, so Saturday was their first chance to finally celebrate. Others, who attended the Cubs Parade on Friday, took to Wrigleyville on Saturday for a second day of partying. Deanese Williams-Harris CTA officials announced Saturday that a train and bus decked out in special Chicago Cubs World Series decor will start running Monday near Wrigley Field. According to a CTA release, the agency has wrapped four rail cars on the Red Line and a No. 152 Addison bus with the blue \"W\" and Cubs logo celebrating...

According to a CTA release, the agency has wrapped four rail cars on the Red Line and a No. 152 Addison bus with the blue \"W\" and Cubs logo celebrating... (Deanese Williams-Harris) Wearing their newly purchased World Series hats and T-shirts, Cubs fans packed weekend Red Line trains and spilled onto Addison Street, documenting with their iPhones every jubilant moment: The tuba player on Addison and Sheffield Avenue tooting \"Go Cubs Go\"; the scribbled messages scratched onto the ballpark's exterior walls; the crowd's sudden eruption into a \"Let's go, Cubbies\" cheer, their fists pumping the air. It was a frenzy that could be easily mistaken for game day enthusiasm, drummed up by fans like 18-year-old Rob Simmons, who took the Metra train to Wrigleyville from Elburn with his family because work commitments kept them from attending the citywide celebration Friday. \"This means a lot, just how cool it is to be alive to see everything. Even today, when nothing is going on, people want to be here,\" he said. Simmons' father, 49-year-old Robert Simmons, said he didn't think he'd see the Cubs win a World Series in his lifetime. A city's love for the Cubs at parade and rally Chicago came out to support the 2016 World Series champion\u00a0Cubs during a parade and rally on Nov. 4, 2016. (Chicago Tribune) Chicago came out to support the 2016 World Series champion\u00a0Cubs during a parade and rally on Nov. 4, 2016. (Chicago Tribune) See more videos For 39-year-old Brian Sikorski, a stop in Wrigleyville on Saturday morning was part of a weekendlong Cubs celebration. He attended Friday's parade, he said, and planned to stop at his grandparents' and Harry Caray's graves Saturday afternoon at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines. Sikorski, of Lisle, said he doubts it will take another century for the Cubs to win another World Series, as he's confident with the players' athleticism and the team's management. What's important, he said, is that the drought, the team's \"biggest hurdle,\" has ended at last and a weight has been lifted. \"I'm not getting greedy,\" he said, hesitating to predict how soon the Cubs will bring\u00a0home the world title again. \"I'm just enjoying today.\" meltagouri@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "FBI clears Clinton after round-the-clock review of new emails, Comey says James Comey J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press FBI Director James B. Comey. FBI Director James B. Comey. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) David Lauter and Del Quentin Wilber Contact Reporters The FBI 's much-trumpeted new scrutiny of emails related to Hillary Clinton has turned up nothing that would cause the bureau to recommend charges against her, the bureau's director, James B. Comey , has told Congress. Nine days after rocking the presidential race with word that a new trove of emails had been discovered, Comey sent a brief letter to Capitol Hill that, in effect, put an end to the renewed controversy. The letter said that agents \"have been working around the clock to process and review\" the emails, which had been found on a computer owned by former Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin . FBI letter on Hillary Clinton emails Open link \"During that process, we have reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,\" Comey wrote. \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\" In July, Comey sharply criticized Clinton for being \"careless\" in handling classified materials but said there was no basis for bringing any criminal charge against her. A law enforcement official familiar with the matter said that almost all of the emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer were either duplicates of messages the FBI already had reviewed or were personal in nature. None rose to level that would cause agents to reconsider whether Clinton or her aides had knowingly mishandled classified information, the official said. Clinton\u2019s campaign quickly expressed satisfaction with the announcement. \u201cWe are glad this matter is resolved,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri.\u00a0 But the news from the FBI seems unlikely to calm the anger of many Democrats who have called for Comey to resign. His announcement that the emails had been discovered had violated Justice Department rules designed to prevent investigative actions from influencing elections, many prominent Democrats have said. Even if Clinton wins the presidential election, many Democrats fear that the controversy set off by Comey\u2019s announcement, which dominated news coverage of the campaign for the past week, had\u00a0damaged their prospects in several close Senate races that could determine control of the chamber. Comey was appointed by President Obama in 2013 to a 10-year term as head of the FBI. He prides himself on his independence and tangled with the White House in his previous job, as a senior Justice Department official\u00a0in the George W. Bush administration. The fact that Comey\u00a0is a Republican, however, coupled\u00a0with a seeming deluge of leaks damaging to Clinton from current or former FBI agents in recent days, has caused concern among many Democrats. The substance of Comey\u2019s announcement was not surprising \u2014\u00a0although the timing was. Former government officials and outside legal experts with knowledge of the case had said in recent days that the chances were slim that any of the newly found emails would change the FBI\u2019s previous conclusions. Bringing a charge would require\u00a0finding evidence that\u00a0clearly demonstrated that Clinton or her aides knowingly broke the law, exchanged materials they knew to be classified\u00a0or attempted to interfere with the investigation by withholding or destroying evidence, according to former federal prosecutors and legal scholars. During its nearly yearlong investigation of Clinton\u2019s email practices, FBI agents already had interviewed dozens of witnesses, conducted forensic tests and examined\u00a0tens of thousands of messages. In that previous phase of the investigation, the bureau had discovered information that officials said should have been considered classified in 193 emails that were part of 81 email chains. Eight of the chains should have been treated as top secret, the highest level of classification, the FBI reported. None of the emails was\u00a0marked with a classified header, however, and officials said they had not turned up evidence that Clinton or her aides had known that the information was considered classified. Indeed, State Department officials continue to dispute whether at least some of the messages should have been considered classified at all.

    "text": "Email Who among our presidents deserves the dubious distinction of being called WORST EVER? Mo Rocca tells us that, of all the possibilities there\u2019s one who stands out: James Buchanan was at Wheatland, his Lancaster, Pa., estate, when he was notified he\u2019d been elected president in 1856. It\u2019s a gorgeous home, with one very special amenity, which Wheatland\u2019s director, Patrick Clarke, showed Rocca: an outhouse for five. James Buchanan\u2019s Wheatland, in Lancaster, Pa. CBS News \u201cThis is pretty unique,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cIt has two adult seats, one for maybe a teenager, two for little kids. \u2026 This is the family that \u2018goes\u2019 together!\u201d \u201cYou could have a whole cabinet meeting in there!\u201d said Rocca. But ask historians where they rank our 15th president and, well, he\u2019s in the proverbial toilet. Lyons Press \u201cOh, he\u2019s definitely the worst,\u201d said author Robert Strauss. \u201cThe worst president ever.\u201d Which is also the title of Strauss\u2019 book. Buchanan had his detractors, like President Andrew Jackson, but not everyone hated him. After all, he was elected president in 1856. But this Northern Democrat\u2019s sympathies with the slave-holding South exacerbated long-simmering tensions. Under Buchanan, the country split apart, a crisis bequeathed to his successor, Abraham Lincoln. Yet at Wheatland, they\u2019re not quite so hard on the guy. When asked where he would rank Buchanan among the 43 men who have occupied the Oval Office, Patrick Clarke replied, \u201cProbably 42nd.\u201d If Buchanan is remembered at all, it\u2019s for being the \u201cBachelor President\u201d -- the only president never to marry. Rocca asked Strauss, \u201cLet\u2019s just get this out of the way right now: What was the deal with James Buchanan?\u201d \u201cHe did have a bad relationship early on,\u201d Strauss replied. \u201cHis fianc\u00e9 probably committed suicide based on --\u201d \u201cBecause he was gay?\u201d \u201cWell, maybe so,\u201d Strauss laughed. Clarke says, \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to say that he was gay. But there\u2019s no evidence to prove that he was a heterosexual, either.\u201d But there\u2019s plenty of evidence that he knew how to throw a great party. \u201cHe threw the best party of the middle part of the nineteenth century, the Inaugural Ball,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cSix thousand people show up!\u201d And Buchanan seemed worth celebrating, if only for having the greatest resume of anyone who\u2019s ever run for president: \u201cHe served in both houses of the Pennsylvania State Legislature, served in both houses of the U.S. Congress, he was ambassador to Russia, ambassador to Great Britain, he was also Secretary of State,\u201d said Strauss. All of which raised high hopes at the beginning of his administration. But, Strauss noted, \u201cThey were dashed pretty quickly.\u201d Only two days after his inauguration, the Supreme Court handed down the infamous Dred Scott decision, allowing that escaped slaves be forcibly returned to their owners. Buchanan backed this decision. Slavery would be the country\u2019s -- and his -- undoing. Dred Scott vs. Sandford (1857) (Cornell University Law School) \u201cHe feared that if you handled the issue of slavery too robustly, that it would create what he believed would be the end of the union, secession,\u201d said Clarke. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. After Lincoln\u2019s election but before his inauguration, seven states seceded while a politically-paralyzed Buchanan presided.

Jason Hammel delivers to the Cincinnati Reds in the first inning Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, at Wrigley Field. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Cubs started to look toward the future Sunday by cutting ties with 15-game winner Jason Hammel . The team announced it declined Hammel's option for 2017, making the right-hander a free agent. The option was worth $12 million, and Hammel gets a $2 million buyout. President Theo Epstein, in a statement, said the Cubs' intent was never to pick up the option and trade Hammel, which a few teams anticipated. \"While Jason is healthy and primed to have another effective season in 2017, we have decided to consider other internal and external options for our starting rotation next year,\" Epstein said in a statement. \"Our hope is that by giving a starting opportunity to some younger pitchers under multiple years of club control, we can unearth a starter who will help us not only in 2017 but also in 2018 and beyond.\" The only way the Cubs would have picked up the option was if the Cubs intended to keep him, Epstein added.

(Photo: Brennan Linsley, AP) 7135 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 174 COMMENTEMAILMORE For 17 months, I\u2019ve traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams. I\u2019ve been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare \u2014 Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof. It also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA and China deals that have deindustrialized the United States \u2014 importing unemployment and exporting our wealth. It means we don\u2019t have to keep kids trapped in failing schools \u2014 that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton: Why you should vote for me Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis \u2014 Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt. America has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation. It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people. That\u2019s what I\u2019m offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It\u2019s there for you to read at www.TheTrumpContract.com. In my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs. In my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged \u201copen borders,\u201d mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America\u2019s immigration officers described Hillary\u2019s extremist plan as \u201cthe most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history.\u201d I will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same. Finally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities. I am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the White House. Together, we will take our government back from the special interests \u2014 and we will Make America Great Again. Donald J.

(Reuters) A new lawsuit accuses Uber of stiffing its bike-riding food deliverers out of tips, BuzzFeed News reports. The lawsuit filed in federal court in New York City Nov. 1 alleges that nearly all GrubHub deliveries for UberRush included an \u201con-line gratuity \u2014 none of which were passed onto the couriers. It also claims that a $3.99 fee UberEats charges in lieu of a gratuity should be passed on to the courier under current wage law. The plaintiff is a former New York City Uber courier. BuzzFeed News reports that Uber wasn\u2019t commenting on lawsuit. Couriers who belong to the Messenger Alliance in New York City said they too have not received tips from GrubHub orders, as the lawsuit alleges. Sadio Ballo, who is also an UberRush courier, told BuzzFeed News that when messengers complained, the company \u201ctold them it was the restaurants that were keeping the tips.\u201d \u00a0 ",

    "text": "A Spartanburg County Sheriff\u2019s investigative report says Kohlhepp \u201cconfessed to investigators that he shot and killed\u201d the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of the motorcycle shop. \u201cKohlhepp gave details ... that only the killer would know,\u201d the report says. Authorities say Kohlhepp is a suspect in at least three other deaths. Sheriff Wright says Kohlhepp also showed law enforcement officers Saturday where he says he buried two other victims on his 95-acre property near Woodruff. Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, was at the site for less than an hour. The sheriff would not say whether more bodies were found in the graves Kohlhepp led them to, but he did say they would be excavated, reports CBS Spartanburg affiliate WSPA-TV . Those alleged grave sites are in addition to the body found Friday at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver , the boyfriend of the woman found Thursday. Carver and the woman went missing around Aug. 31. Their last known cellphone signals led authorities to the property. The Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted. Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds. An anthropologist is helping determine how long Carver was buried, Clevenger said. He declined to say how many times Carver had been shot. The sheriff says it\u2019s possible more bodies will be uncovered. The wife of one of the 2003 victims said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the shop several times. Melissa Ponder told The Associated Press she was resigned that her husband Scott\u2019s death would never be solved before getting a phone call Saturday evening from one of the case\u2019s original detectives. Detectives told family members of all four victims of the confession at the same time. \u201cHe knew too much about the crime scene,\u201d Ponder said of Kohlhepp\u2019s account to detectives. \u201cHe knew everything.\u201d The Superbike killings stunned the Chesnee community, with rumors like they were committed by a Mexican drug gang or were part of a love triangle crushing the families of the victims. Melissa Ponder is glad the rumors weren\u2019t true. \u201cIt isn\u2019t closure, but it is an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am thankful for that.\u201d Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. Fifteen years after he was released from prison for that crime, Spartanburg County deputies were brought to his property by the last known cellphone signals of two missing people. On Thursday, they found Brown chained in a container for two months. She told investigators that Kohlhepp shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her.\u00a0 His prison stint didn\u2019t stop Kohlhepp from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm. Wright said \u201cit\u2019s strange\u201d that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long. Scott Waldrop, who\u2019s lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \u201cprepper\u201d who liked his privacy, but \u201che didn\u2019t seem like a threat.\u201d Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \u201cI was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hate to know somebody who\u2019s done something like this.\u201d Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private but liked to brag about how much money he made day trading online. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Police Chief Russell Whitman says officers Steve Dunham, Amanda Myers and Kyle O'Neal and dispatcher Lindsay Alvarez will receive the Police Exemplary Performance Award. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reports ( http://bit.ly/2eLXfid ) the presentation is planned Monday at the Franklin city council meeting. The boy's parents are serving 180-day jail sentences after pleading guilty to child endangering charges. The boy told Dunham in August he hadn't eaten for days, so the officer took him to a restaurant. He left him with Alvarez to join the other officers at the child's home, finding four older boys living amid garbage and cat urine. 0 Shares ",

Credit Librado Romero/The New York Times They came of age in the 1960s and \u201970s, in the traumatic aftermath of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They fought and protested a war together, argued over Nixon and Kissinger together, laughed at Archie Bunker together. As children, they practiced air-raid drills; as adults, they cheered the fall of the Berlin Wall . In the 1990s, they saw one of their own become president, watching him gain glory as one of the most gifted politicians of his time, but also infamy as one of its most self-indulgent \u2014 a poster child for the Me Generation. They are of course the baby boomers, the collective offspring of the most fertile period in American history. At 75 million strong, they have been the most dominant force in American life for three decades, and one of its most maligned. Enlightened but self-centered, introspective but reckless, they are known among the cohorts that followed them \u2014 and even to some boomers themselves \u2014 as the generation that failed to live up to its lofty ideals, but still held fast to its sense of superiority. If Bill Clinton was their white-haired id, Hillary Clinton is their superego in a pantsuit. A second Clinton presidency could represent a last hurrah for the baby boomers. But it could also offer a shot at a kind of generational redemption. \u201cThere is a kind of do-over quality to it,\u201d said Landon Y. Jones, the author of the 1980 book \u201cGreat Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation.\u201d \u201cThis is their last chance to get it right.\u201d Photo Hillary Clinton greeting supporters last week in Dade City, Fla. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times A shared history binds the boomers \u2014 as do, broadly speaking, some shared traits. Their parents suffered through the Depression and World War II before rearing them in the most prosperous society the world had ever seen. Inevitably, perhaps, they were guided by two polestars: responsibility and entitlement. Those dueling impulses powered the rise of both Clintons: one impulse galvanizing supporters who deeply admired their commitment to public service, the other galling critics who saw them as playing by their own rules. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere\u2019s this tremendous idealism with the Clintons \u2014 actually living social change, embodying social change,\u201d said Gil Troy, the author of \u201cThe Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s\u201d and a history professor at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cBut also, at the end of day, not just having this will to power, but also being so convinced of their own self-righteousness that they improvise a new set of morality and ethics.\u201d Like her husband\u2019s, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political odyssey began in earnest when she volunteered for George McGovern\u2019s youth-powered 1972 presidential bid, one that ended in a lopsided, welcome-to-adulthood takedown of \u201960s idealism at the hands of President Richard M. Nixon and his \u201csilent majority.\u201d It was there, in the trenches, that the Clintons \u2014 still in their mid-20s, and not yet married \u2014 began to assemble the network of trusted friends that continues to surround them. Twenty years later, at 46, Bill Clinton became the third-youngest president ever elected. At 69, Hillary Clinton would be the second-oldest. In many respects, her journey has become her generation\u2019s journey \u2014 from protester to parent and now grandparent, from earnest idealist to battle-hardened realist.

Credit William Sauro/The New York Times They would be bookends on their cohort, one seizing the national stage on behalf of their generation in its prime, the other, who now qualifies for Medicare , vying to lead it into its dotage. Of course, the presidential election has featured not one but two members of the generation born between 1946 and 1964. And just as the Clintons grew out of the campus left, Donald J. Trump traces his political following, if not his own formation, to that generation\u2019s Nixon voters: those who did not protest, or even attend college; who preferred Elvis to the Beatles, Sinatra to Santana, the familiar to the foreign, order to upheaval. (Though at this point, what was once the counterculture has become the culture: Mr. Trump has been known to play the Rolling Stones at events.) If Mr. Trump does not fit the profile of the searching, liberal, conflicted boomer, well, blame the liberal boomers whose cultural contributions crystallized that image, most memorably in \u201cThe Big Chill.\u201d (They also created its counter-counterculture foil: Think of Mr. Trump \u2014 thin-skinned, red-faced, schooled in uniform \u2014 as the R.O.T.C. commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer in \u201cAnimal House.\u201d) The most enduring boomer icons, however, sprang not from a Hollywood script but from Yale Law School and the Arkansas Statehouse. Standing under the balloons at Madison Square Garden in 1992 \u2014 with Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d blaring \u2014 the Clintons sent a clear message to their peers: Yesterday\u2019s gone. Our time is now. And also, maybe, now. Not much remains of the we-can-change-the-world optimism that swept in with the new administration in 1993, and maybe with good reason. The great accomplishments of Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency \u2014 peace and its anticipated dividends, a surging economy, shrinking budget deficits \u2014 were washed away. As some boomers sent their kids to college, others sent their sons and daughters off to fight in a seemingly permanent conflict halfway around the globe. If elected, Mrs. Clinton would inherit the Islamic State, an ever-widening income gap, partisan gridlock and a populace so polarized and full of loathing that it seems to be segregating. Her husband had it easy by comparison. Photo Senator George McGovern at a campaign stop in June 1972 in Brooklyn. Credit Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times It\u2019s no fun getting old. Not that Mrs. Clinton is complaining. She has embraced her longevity, beginning a recent rally in Pueblo, Colo., with a callback to her last visit there. \u201cI know there are a lot of really young people here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut was anybody here back in 1992?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cheers shot up from some of the gathering\u2019s elders.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 6, 2016 10:19 PM EST FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to Congressional leaders Sunday that the agency has not found anything new that would warrant charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Comey wrote Sunday, in a letter sent to members of Congress and released by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California).\u00a0 This summer, the FBI announced that after a full investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, it was not recommending criminal charges against her. However, in a surprise move, Comey wrote to Congress on Oct. 28 -- barely ten days before Election Day -- to say that the agency was taking steps to review new emails relating to Clinton\u2019s case. That news was then leaked by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and the letter began to circulate more widely. The new emails came from the laptop of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. That announcement upended the 2016 race between Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump, with the Trump campaign praising Comey\u2019s actions and Democrats expressing concern that the FBI would make such an \u201cunprecedented\u201d move so close to Election Day. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d Comey wrote on Sunday. \u201cDuring that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State \u2026 I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.\u201d A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Comey reached his decision on not recommending charges Sunday shortly before he sent the letter to Congress. Comey reportedly had interaction with the Department of Justice before sending the letter to Congress, the source said. However, it\u2019s not clear as to whether he spoke with Attorney General Loretta Lynch directly. The bulk of emails to and from Clinton which were discovered on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop were found to be either personal emails or duplicates of emails previously reviewed by the FBI, the source said. Others had to be painstakingly investigated to determine if they contained sensitive national security matters. Dozens of FBI agents worked as fast as they could to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review. The assistance of special software helped in the efficiency of the process. Speaking to reporters aboard the campaign plane, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters they are happy the issue has been \u201cresolved.\u201d \u201cWe have seen Director Comey\u2019s latest letter to the Hill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were glad to see that as we were -- that he has found as we were confident that he would that he has confirmed the conclusions that he really -- reached in July and we\u2019re glad this matter is resolved.\u201d Trump, too, responded to the news at a rally in Minneapolis. \u201cYou have to understand, it\u2019s a rigged system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s protected.\u201d And then in Sterling Heights, Michigan, he cast doubt on the FBI\u2019s ability to process the emails so quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,\u201d Trump told the rally. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, folks.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the FBI\u2019s initial findings about Clinton\u2019s email practices were \u201ca damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment\u201d -- and that the new statement doesn\u2019t change anything. \u201cThe FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNone of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "FBI sends letter to Congress saying email review completed, decision not to prosecute Clinton stands Published               November 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI\u2019s original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would in the unrelated case review additional emails related to Clinton\u2019s time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. \u201cSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,\u201d Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. \u201cDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.\u201d Reaction from the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill to the letter, which still appears to leaves some unanswered questions, was swift and largely partisan. \u201cWe're glad this issue is resolved but for the record, this could easily have been learned before 1st letter was sent,\u201d tweeted Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton Democratic presidential campaign. \u00a0 The new case is purportedly related to ex-New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner using a laptop he shared with estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin for \u201csexting\u201d an apparently underage female.\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Comey\u2019s letter last month said only that a new batch of emails \u201cappeared to be pertinent\u201d to the FBI\u2019s original Clinton email investigation. The Clinton campaign and it supporters howled that Comey with his letter had injected himself in the closing days of a very close White House race, while providing little information about the emails and the new probe. \"Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Sunday night. \u201cShe simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules. ... The American people should not have to endure four more years of their scandal and baggage. \u2026 Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump\u00a0on Tuesday.\" Neither Clinton nor Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has yet to comment on the Comey letter. Trump landed in Minnesota for a rally moments after\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement. He made no direct mention of the FBI decision and continued to insist that Clinton would be under investigation during her potential presidency. \"She's protected by a rigged system,\" he told supporters. \"She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president.\" Comey in July concluded the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of the private server system while at the State Department by saying some of the emails included classified information and that Clinton has been \u201cextremely careless.\u201d However, he declined to recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department, and the case was effectively closed. Clinton had appeared to be heading for a sweeping victory before the FBI review, but\u00a0Comey's\u00a0announcement blunted her momentum. Since then, national polls and battleground states have tightened, though Clinton still appears to hold an edge over Trump in the campaign's last moments.
