Video provided by Newsy Newslook Oklahoma City Police Capt. Paco Balderrama briefs reporters about the fatal shooting Tuesdayat Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport  Wednesday Nov. 16, 2016. Police say the man accused of fatally shooting an Oklahoma City airport employee used to work for Southwest Airlines and that the attack was likely in retaliation for circumstances that led to the attacker's 2015 resignation. Balderrama identified the shooter as Lloyd Dean Buie, of Oklahoma City.  (Steve Gooch/The Oklahoman via AP) ORG XMIT: OKOKL101 (Photo: Steve Gooch, AP) 44 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE The man who shot and killed the father of an NFL player at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport is\u00a0a\u00a0former\u00a0employee of Southwest Airlines, police said Wednesday. Perched on the fourth floor of a five-story parking garage,\u00a0Lloyd Dean Buie, 45,\u00a0used a rifle to shoot Southwest Airlines employee Michael Winchester, 52, from around 50 yards away, Oklahoma City Police Capt. Paco Balderrama said at a news conference.\u00a0The attack occurred just before 2 p.m. ET Tuesday as\u00a0Winchester, a former punter for the University of Oklahoma Sooners,\u00a0 walked to his car after work. He was later pronounced dead at an area hospital. Buie then shot himself. Police found him in a red pickup\u00a0truck\u00a0with a gunshot wound to the head.\u00a0It was not clear whether the suspect\u00a0used the same rifle to kill himself. Buie had resigned from Southwest Airlines in April 2015. He knew the path airline\u00a0employees took between the main terminal and the employees parking lot, leading investigators to believe Buie planned the attack,\u00a0Balderrama said. Winchester was shot as he walked to his car after leaving work, he said. He was not Buie's immediate\u00a0supervisor. Balderrama said Buie drove to the airport Tuesday with the intent to kill someone. He likely used some sort of scope on the rifle and was probably familiar with the weapon. \"You don\u2019t have to be an expert marksman to hit a 50-yard shot, but it's not an easy shot either,\" he said. \"We do not know if Mr. Winchester was the intended victim,\" Balderrama said, \"but it is possible the suspect acted in retaliation against the circumstances leading up to his resignation.\" Authorities temporarily closed\u00a0the airport Tuesday as they combed the grounds for additional suspects or victims. Police are reviewing surveillance video at the airport and searching Buie's home for further clues as to his motive. Buie had filed for bankruptcy in September after being out of work for more than a year, according to The Oklahoman\u00a0website.\u00a0He reported $150,800 in assets and $254,761 in liabilities, including a mortgage, an auto loan and thousands of dollars in unpaid credit card bills, the news site said.\u00a0\u201cDebtor has not worked since May 2015,\u201d the petition stated. In this photo taken Oct. 8, 2007, Michael Winchester, second from right, poses for a photo with children, from left, Emily, Carolyn, James and Becca in Washington, Okla. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Strasen, The Oklahoman via AP) Winchester was a former punter \u00a0for the University of Oklahoma Sooners football team from 1984 to 1986 and played for the university's national championship team.\u00a0Southwest Airlines confirmed that he was an airline employee. He is also the father of an NFL football player, James Winchester, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. ",

New Balance sneakers Edward Berthelot / Getty Images A white supremacist blogger and self-described internet troll has declared New Balance sneakers \"the official shoes of White people\" and encouraged his readers to buy them \"so we will be able to recognize one another by our sportswear.\" The blog post comes just one week after the New Balance VP of public affairs Matt LeBretton said a Trump presidency would take the company \"in the right direction\" to compete on the global stage. That comment led to some New Balance customers throwing their sneakers down the toilet and burning them. The shoe company took to Twitter to distance itself from the blog's statements. \u2014 New Balance (@newbalance) November 15, 2016 That hasn't mollified some customers who are voting with their feet, like prominent lesbian comedian Cameron Esposito: The only sneakers that fit my feet are now white supremacist shoes. In the same way that a popular green cartoon frog internet meme was declared a hate symbol this year , online culture experts say this is just a case of bigoted provocateurs intent on disrupting the conversation.

They're easily recognizable and they could twist LeBretton's statements as evidence of the neo-Nazi connection,\" wrote Erin Buckles, a PhD Psychology student at the University of British Columbia who has conducted research on online harassers. \"The left responded predictably by burning the shoes in protest.\" In an interview with Motherboard about the online racist harassment this summer of Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones by the alt-right , Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of writing at Mercer University who has literally written the book on trolls , reflected on the difficulty in dealing with toxic material online and how a critical story covering the exchange could itself become a way of further spreading a hateful message. \"All the people who retweeted that tweet and who commented on that story and who then perpetuate it inadvertently \u2014 even the people who are doing it from a well-meaning perspective or commenting on the story in order to condemn the story \u2014 we're all responsible for how the internet is. The internet is not bad because of a few bad eggs,\" she told Motherboard. \"If the internet is bad or if it yields more negative outcomes than positive outcomes, that's a function of all of us.\" Ben Popken ",

    "text": "Aaron Ybarra, the gunman who allegedly killed one person at Seattle Pacific University, was involuntarily committed for mental health evaluations... Prosecutors had argued the crime was premeditated and that Ybarra knew what he did was wrong. King County Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Kristin Richardson told jurors during closing arguments that Ybarra didn\u2019t mention God, Satan or Lucifer directing him to carry out the rampage until months after the shootings. The trial, which began Oct. 10, included testimony from Ybarra as well as student and safety monitor Jon Meis , who was hailed as a hero for taking down the gunman during the June 5, 2014, shooting. Meis testified at trial that he waited to hear the shooter reload his shotgun, took pepper spray out of his backpack and sprayed the gunman in the face twice. Surveillance video showed Meis wrestling the shotgun away, stashing it in an office and returning to tackle Ybarra again as Ybarra struggles to pull a knife. Ybarra also testified over two days and told jurors he was compelled by the voices of God, Lucifer and Satan to carry out a campus shooting, The Seattle Times reported. He also said he identified with Eric Harris, one of two student gunmen responsible for the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. Jurors also took a short field trip to the campus hall where the shooting occurred. On the second day of deliberations, jurors asked to see the police video of Ybarra\u2019s interrogation, KING-TV in Seattle reported. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

(Gary Cameron/Reuters) Vice President Biden and his wife, Jill, hosted Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his family for lunch at the Naval Observatory on Wednesday, a gathering that culminated in Biden pledging to be \u201cavailable to him 24-7\u201d after leaving office. The get-together, which included Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, and daughter Charlotte, featured a tour of the house and grounds that the Pences will occupy starting Jan. 20. Afterward, Pence told reporters he had received a \u201cCook\u2019s tour\u201d of the residence and appreciated the Bidens\u2019 hospitality. Biden, for his part, said he was not worried that Pence and President-elect Donald Trump would dismantle the legacy he and President Obama had forged over the course of eight years. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cLook: They ran on a platform they\u2019re gonna try to move. I think there\u2019s a lot of things that were done where [people] can reach some accommodation. \u2026 It\u2019s a whole new world.\u201d In the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, Obama has privately and publicly lobbied the New York businessman to consider backing off some of his campaign pledges to undo the administration\u2019s landmark policies. Biden, who said he and Pence discussed foreign policy matters during their time together, has now adopted the same stance. \u201cI also said although I had been a senator for 36 years, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for a decade, in the end I had been [on the] national security apparatus for a long time, there\u2019s a lot in town here that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I plan on being available to Mike as senior staff for him as he moves,\u201d Biden added. \u201cHe\u2019d be smart to reject most of my ideas, but I think he\u2019ll listen.\u201d powerpost ",

Robert Farley, FactCheck.org 9:16 a.m. EST November 16, 2016 x Share The electoral college is a part of the Constitution. And it's been more than two decades since we've made any amendments. Video provided by Newsy Newslook A line of early voters wait at the Franklin County Board of Elections on Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP) Can the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton on Dec. 19? Answer:\u00a0 Is it Trump or Clinton? FULL ANSWER A\u00a0 Change.org petition , now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is \u201cunfit to serve\u201d and that \u201cSecretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.\u201d \u201cIf they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,\u201d the petition states. \u201cHowever, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine \u2013 which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states\u2019 votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.\u201d A number of our readers reached out to us by phone and email and asked if it was true that members of the Electoral College are not bound to vote for the candidate who won a majority of votes in their state, and specifically whether the Electoral College could actually give the presidency to Clinton over Trump. Let\u2019s back up a bit and explain how the Electoral College works, and why \u2014 an issue\u00a0 we addressed \u00a0in 2008 in an article that has gotten a lot of views recently. x Share If Clinton wins popular vote, expect calls to kill Electoral College As we explained then, when U.S. citizens go to the polls to \u201celect\u201d a president, they are in fact voting for a particular slate of electors. The electors, selected based on which party\u2019s candidate wins the most votes in a state, meet in their respective states 41 days after the popular election. There, they cast a ballot for president and a second for vice president. In every state but\u00a0 Maine and Nebraska , the candidate who wins the most votes (that is, a plurality) in the state is supposed to receive all of the state\u2019s electoral votes. Because candidates can win some states by wide margins and others by a slim one, it is possible for a candidate to win the Electoral College vote even if he or she\u00a0loses the national popular vote. Indeed that has happened\u00a0 three times in U.S. history , most recently in 2000 when George W. Bush lost the popular vote by about 540,000 votes to Al Gore, but won the electoral vote, 271 to 266.\u00a0(Also, in 1824, John Quincy Adams was elected president even though Andrew Jackson received more popular and electoral votes.) Trump called Electoral College a 'disaster' in 2012 tweet And the popular vote winner may not be the same as the electoral winner again this year. Absentee votes are still being counted, but as of Nov. 15, Clinton was winning the\u00a0 popular vote tally \u00a0by more than 775,000 votes, even as Trump was handily winning the Electoral College tally. Why is there an Electoral College? As we wrote in our 2008 story, most of the nation\u2019s founders were actually rather afraid of democracy, and wanted an extra layer beyond the direct election of the president. As Alexander Hamilton\u00a0 writes \u00a0in \u201cThe Federalist Papers,\u201d the Constitution is designed to ensure \u201cthat the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u201d The point of the Electoral College is to preserve \u201cthe sense of the people,\u201d while at the same time ensuring that a president is chosen \u201cby men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice.\u201d In modern practice, the Electoral College is mostly a formality. It is true, as the\u00a0 National Archives and Records Administration notes , that there is \u201cno\u00a0 Constitutional provision \u00a0or\u00a0 Federal law \u00a0that requires Electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote in their states.\u201d But the U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0 ruled \u00a0in 1952 that\u00a0states\u00a0could require electors to take a pledge to support the party\u2019s presidential and vice presidential nominees from its national convention. And many do. Some even prescribe fines of $500 to $1,000 to so-called \u201cfaithless electors\u201d for not voting for the party\u2019s nominee, or allow them to be replaced by an alternate. Whether those pledges or fines could be upheld by the Supreme Court is unclear. As the National Archives notes, \u201cNo Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged.\u201d In addition, more than 20 states do not have a state law or party or state pledge requiring electors to back the candidates with the most votes in their state.

And as Obama and the rest of his national security team watched the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden on a live feed from Pakistan, White House photographer Pete Souza captured the drama in the Situation Room. That mesmerizing shot from May 1, 2011 became the most iconic photograph of the Obama presidency. But Souza says he didn't realize he struck gold until long after he snapped that picture. Then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with with members of the national security team, receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House in Washington. Pete Souza / White House / AP \"I was in that room for 40 minutes,\" Souza recalled in a wide-ranging interview with NBC News about his years as the official White House photographer. \"It was very tense. You can see it in the faces, of those people. And I can't say I knew that singular image would get as much attention as it did.\" In all, Souza took more than two million photos as he chronicled the nation's first African-American president \u2014 a journalistic journey that began three years before Obama was elected in 2005 when he was then a little-known Illinois senator. Pete Souza has a level of access unprecedented for White House photographers. Souza spoke with NBC News while Obama was in Greece on what's likely to be his final foreign trip as president. A 61-year-old former newspaper photographer who was the official White House shutterbug during President Reagan's second term, Souza said the Obama the public sees and the Obama he sees in private are mostly one and the same. President Barack Obama tours the Acropolis in Athens on Nov. 16. Pete Souza / The White House \"He is not much different than what you see in public,\" he said. \"I think he's a little more open and funny and less guarded, obviously.

The homeless gather around tents along 5th Street and Stanford Avenue on skid row in Los Angeles this month. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Gale Holland Contact Reporter For the second year in a row, Los Angeles reported the largest number of chronically homeless people in the nation \u2014\u00a0nearly 13,000 \u2014 and 95% of them live outdoors, in cars, tents and encampments,\u00a0according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s report to Congress released Wednesday. Los Angeles also topped the national register this year in homeless veterans \u2014\u00a02,700 \u2014 despite slashing the numbers by a third. It also recorded the most\u00a0unaccompanied homeless\u00a0youth\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0more than 3,000, the report said. Federal housing officials blamed soaring rents and Congress\u2019 failure to fund affordable housing for a rise\u00a0in homelessness in Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas and the District of Columbia, which reported the biggest jumps. \u201cWhat we saw in Los Angeles and Seattle in particular is consistent with the housing crisis we\u2019re seeing particularly in higher-cost areas on the West Coast,\u201d Norm Suchar, director of the federal housing agency\u2019s homeless assistance programs, said during a phone conference with reporters. The numbers came from a nationwide street count and shelter survey conducted in January; local results were released in May. City and homeless officials at that time pointed to an improvement in counting homeless youth to account for all or part of the city\u2019s 11% increase in homelessness and a 5.7 % jump countywide from the year before. Who are L.A. County's homeless? Open link Suchar, however, said the federal housing agency had decided against including a footnote or adjusting the numbers, as they had in the past when they believed Los Angeles\u2019 methodology skewed the count. \u201cI think it\u2019s a part of the story of their increase;\u00a0it\u2019s not an overwhelming part of the story,\u201d Suchar said of the improved youth tabulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like everything was OK\u00a0except for the youth count.\u201d Tom Waldman, spokesman for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority countered:\u00a0\u201cThe change in youth count methodology drove an increase in the overall count. Without the methodological change, the count would have been relatively flat, which means we saw an increase in the single adult population, since families and vets decreased. (Doug Smith) Los Angeles continues to trail New York City in the overall number of homeless people, with 44,000 compared with\u00a0New York\u2019s 73,500. (The Los Angeles city and county tabulation excludes Glendale, Pasadena and Long Beach, which conduct separate tallies). But most homeless people in New York live with their families in leased shelter apartments or other shelters, while in Los Angeles, three-quarters, including many families, live on city sidewalks, ravines and riverbeds. New York in recent years had also reported rises in homelessness, but in 2016, recorded a 2% drop from the year before. Suchar said Los Angeles, though recording the\u00a0increase in chronically homeless people, had made good progress in reducing the numbers of veterans and families in the\u00a0streets. The\u00a0housing agency defines people\u2019s homelessness as chronic if they are disabled, out of a home for a year or homeless four times in three years. \u201cIn Los Angeles, there\u2019s a lot of very good stuff happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work on family homelessness\u00a0is impressive \u2026 certainly they are focusing on single adults but clearly not showing progress yet.\u201d Suchar said the affordable housing crisis is the major \u201cdriver\u201d of homelessness. Los Angeles city voters this month approved a $1.2-billion bond measure to finance construction of 10,000 homeless housing apartments\u00a0over 10 years.

Steve Bannon\u2019s cynicism spreads online USA Today Network Josh Hafner , USA TODAY 8:52 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 x Share Anti-hate groups are protesting Steve Bannon's promotion to chief strategist of the Trump administration. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Republican president-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon stand on stage during the election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) Words of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist \u2014\u00a0\u201cturn on the hate\u201d \u2014\u00a0 trended\u00a0on Twitter Monday, offering something of a Rorschach test for the vitriol increasingly spewed in America\u2019s political landscape. Trump\u2019s strategist, Stephen Bannon, typed the phrase in a 2014 email discussing Republican leadership, as reported in the Daily Beast . At the time he ran Breitbart News, a website popular among\u00a0white nationalists. \u201cLet the grassroots turn on the hate,\u201d Bannon wrote, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty.\u201d Bannon\u2019s call for hatred resurfaced Monday in a the headline of a New York Times editorial that described the adviser\u2019s appointment as a sign that a \u201ctoxic ideology\u201d had found its way into the White House. By the time the phrase crested on Twitter, there seemed to be some confusion over why it was trending and its source. Wow 'Turn On The Hate' is trending...from a group that preaches love and tolerance... \u2014 Caitlin Tierney (@KatieTierneyH) November 15, 2016 Its the title of a news article --> Steve \u2018Turn on the Hate\u2019 Bannon, in the White House https://t.co/jH50DSv7mc https://t.co/JDCY4IGPqT \u2014 Unimpressed (@brownricediva) November 15, 2016 Trump\u2019s supporters accused his detractors of \u201cturning on the hate\u201d amid days-long protests, some of which involved violence. Those detractors said the hatred lies\u00a0with supporters of Trump, who in Bannon appointed a man who once called progressive women \u201ca bunch of dykes,\u201d as the Times noted . Liberals love to turn on the hate when things don't go their way. #RepublicansUnitedForPeaceAndLove \u2014 SaLtY DoGz (@SaLtYdOgZ) November 15, 2016 \"Turn on the hate\" would've never happened, if Trump wasn't a hater! \u2014 Ivy Bliss (@MsiBliss) November 15, 2016 On Tuesday, NPR host Steve Inskeep asked a Breitbart editor to explain\u00a0Bannon's incendiary past. The editor, Joel Pollak, responded by calling NPR's programming \" racist .\" While both sides\u00a0continue to volley accusations, experts who study hatred and public discourse say that Bannon\u2019s appointment stands to only worsen Americans\u2019 blame game until real listening can occur. Gordana Rabrenovic, a sociologist, serves as a director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict at Northeastern University. She co-authored the book, Why We Hate, and said the violent protests and racially charged hate crimes unfolding since Trump\u2019s election provide an all-too-easy, if unfruitful, answer to Americans\u2019 frustrations. \u201cHate and intimidation is meant to silence people, which can push people away from this public discourse about how we\u2019re going to solve our really challenging questions we save as a nation and world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t face them by blaming particular groups of people. Although that\u2019s the easiest way: You don\u2019t have to put forth a particular solution as long as you blame people.\u201d And the high-level White House appointment of a figure like Bannon can only hamper public discourse, said Timothy Shaffer, a researcher with the National Institute for Civil Discourse. The fringe ideas that Bannon peddled at Breitbart don\u2019t represent most Trump supporters, Shaffer noted, and many didn\u2019t know who he was until this week. But that hasn\u2019t stopped accusations of white nationalism from being hurled at Trump\u2019s supporters, he said \u2014 a guilt by association that has to stop. \u201cThis conflation becomes a real obstacle for public dialogue and discussion,\u201d said Shaffer, who teaches communications studies at Kansas State University. Equally important, he added, is for Republicans not on board with Bannon to say so. \u201cThe people I grew up with, in my hometown in Ohio, who voted for Trump for reasons not aligned with Bannon\u2019s rhetoric, those Republicans need to be able to step up and say something,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve exercised your right to vote. But these seemingly intensified elements need to be stood up to.\u201d ",

Todd Campbell, The Motley Fool 5:31 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 x Share The government has announced that Social Security beneficiaries will receive a 0.3% cost-of-living adjustment to their monthly checks in 2017. WIBBITZ The biggest Social Security benefit that will be paid in 2017 is $2,687 per month. (Photo: Getty Images) Inflation ticked higher this year, and as a result, the Social Security Administration is increasing Social Security payments by 0.3% in 2017.\u00a0The slight increase in Social Security income means that the maximum monthly Social Security benefit at full retirement age next year will be $2,687 per month. However, the chance that someone would get that amount depends on their past earnings\u00a0and when they claim their Social Security benefits. Read on to learn how the government decides how much you'll receive in Social Security benefits \u2014 and what you can do to boost your take. How is my Social Security calculated? It takes most Americans about 10 years of working to accumulate enough Social Security credits (40) to qualify for Social Security benefits. If you qualify for Social Security, then the Social Security Administration will calculate your monthly benefit by adjusting your income \u2014 up to specific limits \u2014 into current dollars. Your highest 35 years of adjusted income are then totaled and divided by 420 (the number of months in 35 years) to arrive at your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Your AIME is then adjusted by multipliers at specific earnings thresholds to determine your maximum monthly Social Security benefit at full retirement age, or FRA.\u00a0For instance, if you become eligible for Social Security in 2017, then you'd multiply the first $885 in AIME by 90%. Any amount earned between $885 and $5,336 would be multiplied by 32%, and any amount above $5,336 would be multiplied by 15%. The resulting amounts are added together and rounded down to the nearest dime to determine your monthly FRA benefit Although this calculation is complicated, you don't need to run the numbers yourself to find out how much you'll get in benefits. The Social Security Administration provides two ways for you to learn how much you're likely to receive in monthly benefits. You can either use their calculator to estimate your benefit or you can set up an account so that you can log in to view your projected benefit. Overall,\u00a0Social Security is designed to replace roughly 40% of the average American worker's pre-retirement income, however, as the following chart shows, the amount Americans receive in benefits varies widely. \u00a0(Photo: Social Security Administration) How to get a bigger Social Security check Obviously, the best way to get more Social Security in retirement is to earn more money. Workers pay a payroll tax that applies to income earned up to $127,200 in 2017 (up from $118,500 in 2016), so if you earn less than that, increasing earnings can net you a bigger Social Security check in the future. Also, if you've already worked 35 years, know that higher income earning years will replace lower income earning years in your benefit calculation, further boosting your benefit. Another way to increase your Social Security income is to take advantage of delayed retirement credits. Delayed retirement credits increase your payment if you claim Social Security after your full retirement age.\u00a0In 2017, the full retirement age is 66 years and 2 months. If you were born in 1955 and you wait until age 70 to claim your benefits, then your monthly check will be 130 2/3% bigger than the amount you would otherwise receive at full retirement age. Waiting to claim can also increase your payment if you're already scheduled to receive the maximum monthly benefit amount. For instance, retiring at age 70 results in a maximum monthly benefit of $3,538 in 2017. Of course, deciding when to claim Social Security is a personal decision that will depend on your health, savings, and many other things. If you're closing in on retirement, though, waiting to claim could be your best strategy to maximizing your Social Security benefit. Try any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days .

Castile was later determined to not be a suspect in that robbery. Yanez's partner at the scene, Officer Joseph Kauser, was cleared of any wrongdoing. Philando Castile. Courtesy of Castile Family But family members claimed that Castile, a beloved elementary school cafeteria worker, was racially profiled because he was black. Choi got the case in late September and began reviewing the evidence for possible charges. Choi resisted pressure immediately after the shooting to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He also enlisted the help of national use-of-force consultants. \"To those of you may say this incident was Philando Castile's fault, I would submit that no reasonable officer \u2014 knowing, seeing and hearing what Officer Yanez did at the time \u2014 would have used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Choi said Wednesday. Castile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a weeks-long demonstration outside the governor's mansion and a rally that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. Castile's extensive driving record raised questions about the biased targeting of minority drivers \u2014 a pattern that was blasted by a Justice Department report in Ferguson, Missouri, following the fatal shooting of black teenager Michael Brown . Castile's driving record shows that he had received 82 non-parking citations \u2014 47 of which were eventually dismissed. In the days after Castile's death, Gov. Mark Dayton suggested that race was an underlying factor for the traffic stop and his killing. Erik Ortiz ",

With the Cubs holding a 3-0 lead, several fans, including Bartman, tried to catch a foul ball, possibly\u00a0disrupting a catch by Cubs outfielder Moises Alou. The Cubs would go on to lose the game and the series. Chicago Tribune staff Contact Reporter Cubs owner Tom Ricketts said the team plans to reach out to Steve Bartman \"at the right time.\" \"I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure something out that provides closure for everybody,\" Ricketts told USA Today . \u201cHopefully, we can make it work. \u201cI never focused on ghosts or curses or Bartmans or any of that stuff. ... We wanted to eventually get to that point where we can pick out rings, like we did (Tuesday), and here we are.\u2019\u2019 Bartman, of course, is the fan who reached for that foul ball in Game 6 of the 2003 National League Championship Series , which the Cubs went on to lose to the Marlins in seven games. But ever since the Cubs won the World Series on Nov. 2, some fans have called on the Cubs to reach out to Bartman, who has maintained a remarkably low profile since 2003. A team executive confirmed Ricketts' comments, adding there's no definitive time to contact Bartman. The 'Bartman Game' Tribune reporter Paul Sullivan takes a look back at the infamous \"Bartman Game\" in the 2003 NLCS between the Cubs and Marlins.

Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer works against the Dodgers in the fifth inning during Game 5 of the National League Division Series at Nationals Park on Oct. 13, 2016, in Washington, D.C. (Rob Carr / Getty Images) Cubs pitchers Jon Lester and Kyle Hendricks will settle for World Series rings in April as the Nationals ' Max Scherzer was more dominant in the eyes of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, which named him as the National League Cy Young Award winner Wednesday. Scherzer \u2014 who led the league with 20 victories, 34 starts, 2281/3 innings and 284 strikeouts \u2014 earned 25 of 30 first-place votes to easily outdistance Lester and Hendricks on a 7-4-3-2-1 points system. Two writers from each of the 15 NL cities participated in the voting, which was completed before the postseason. Lester received one first-place vote and finished second. Hendricks earned two first-place votes and finished third. Their chances might have been hindered by the Cubs' run to the World Series title. Manager Joe Maddon used left-hander Mike Montgomery for five starts in late August and early September to give his rotation extra rest in preparation for the postseason. As a result, Lester was the only Cubs starter to pitch 200 innings, finishing with 202 2/3. He led the Cubs with 19 wins \u2014 including a 10-game winning streak \u2014 and posted a 2.44 ERA. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The campaign for North Carolina GOP Gov. Patrick McCrory, whose reelection bid remains too close to call, is seizing on reports of potential voter fraud to raise questions about the integrity of last week's election.\u00a0 McCrory trails by as many as 5,000 votes against Democratic challenger Roy Cooper -- eight days after the polls closed. The fraud concerns emerged in a separate local election in Bladen County, where officials have acknowledged \u201covertly similar\u201d handwriting on several hundred absentee ballots. \u00a0 While a formal complaint was filed by the winner of that local supervisor race, the McCrory campaign alleges some evidence suggests a group associated with the state Democratic Party may have paid people to cast votes for a write-in Democrat in that race and every other Democrat on the ballot, including Cooper. Campaign official Ricky Diaz on Wednesday cited evidence suggesting potentially similar situations in other counties, though he declined to say whether this suggests voter fraud is widespread enough to impact the gubernatorial election. \u201cIt warrants scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fully expect it will be looked at.\u201d\u00a0 Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 McCrory has faced political headwinds since July, when he signed legislation requiring transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings that are associated with their birth gender, not the gender to which they identify. The passage of the so-called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d resulted in a country-wide backlash, including the NBA moving its all-star game in February.\u00a0 The fresh fraud complaints, while focused on Bladen County, could serve to stoke doubts about the ballot-counting statewide.\u00a0 County election officials sent a letter Nov. 2 to state election officials about finding the similarities in several handwritten ballots. The letter raised the possibility the similar handwriting could be the result of people legally assisting voters in filling out ballots. However, there was no accompanying documentation to verify this. The state board of elections confirmed with FoxNews.com that it is investigating the matter and provided a copy of the complaint filed by McCrae Dowless, the winner of the local Bladen County election. His 53-page complaint argued there are at least 250 questionable ballots connected to five people who were ballot \u201cwitnesses\u201d and paid by the Bladen County Improvement Association PAC. The letter from the county election board to the state election board acknowledges handwriting on the questionable ballots and their envelopes is similar to those of two people cited by Dowless, who ran as an unaffiliated candidate. \u201cA massive voting fraud scheme has been uncovered in Bladen County,\u201d the McCrory campaign said in a recent fundraising email. The state Democratic Party told the News & Observer newspaper that McCrory\u2019s campaign is exaggerating the issue. \u201cAs usual, these claims from the McCrory campaign are over the top and completely false,\u201d said Kimberly Reynolds, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe complaint in question does not even deal with a Democrat.\u201d The Cooper campaign told the newspaper the Bladen County case is \u201cisolated\u201d and it fully supports the investigation. \u00a0 ",

Jones has regularly and falsely claimed the Sandy Hook shooting was staged and that no one was killed. Erica Lafferty lost her mother, school principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, in the shooting, which also claimed the lives of 20 children and five other adult at the Connecticut school. \"You've appeared on Jones' radio show, praised his 'amazing' reputation and promised him that you 'won't let him down,'\" Lafferty said in a Medium post . \"Now he's claiming you've personally called to thank him after the election, and will be on his show again soon. That's unacceptable.\" Related: Infowars' Alex Jones Says Trump Made Thank You Call Jones, has spread a variety of baseless conspiracy theories, including that the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by the government. His site, Infowars, was a hub for pro-Trump and anti-Clinton conspiracies during the campaign and hosted Trump for an interview last year. Jones also attracted attention in the waning days of the campaign with a rant warning of a \"Jewish mafia\" out to \"scam\" Americans. Trump's ties to fringe media have garnered more scrutiny in recent days with his appointment of former Breitbart president Steve Bannon, whose own site published a variety of inflammatory content , to a senior White House role. Erica Lafferty, daughter of Sandy Hook Elementary School victim Dawn Hochsprung, attends a town hall meeting with Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) in Warren, NH, the first town hall the Senator has held since voting against a bill that would increase background checks for gun buyers. Frank Thorp V / NBC News \"It's unacceptable,\" Lafferty wrote in the same post. \"I'm asking you to denounce it immediately and cut ties with Alex Jones and anyone who subscribes to these dangerous ideas.\" According to Jones, Trump called him after the election and said \"We know what you did early on and throughout this campaign, stand up for what's right, it shows.'\" Trump's transition team did not respond earlier this week to requests to confirm or deny the claim by Jones this week that he called him after his election and also promised to return to show. Trump's team also did not immediately respond to a follow-up email on Wednesday requesting comment on Lafferty's demand. Benjy Sarlin ",

Nov. 16, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 Quesola Mimms, whose remains were found in the McKinley Park lagoon in late September, had disappeared before starting a new job. Nov. 16, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporter Quesola Mimms had just gotten a new job at a Chicago factory. But when the big first day came, she didn't show. She left the home she shared with her mother on Sept. 21, a few days before she was to report for her first shift, a family spokesman said. She wasn't heard from again. Then on Sept. 23, a severed head was found in a plastic bag in the McKinley Park lagoon, at South Damen Avenue and West 37th Street. On Wednesday, the Cook County medical examiner's office confirmed what her family had long suspected: It was Mimms.

Quesola Mimms in a 2011 photo taken for a Tribune story when she was a Dyett High School student. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Mimms, 20, of the 700 block of East 105th Place, was identified about two months after a maintenance worker discovered the bag as he was cleaning the lagoon. Mimms was a young mother who left behind an 18-month-old daughter, said her grandmother, Dorothy Mimms. \"Well, we\u2019re doing as best as we can,\" she said Wednesday. She described her granddaughter as outgoing and religious, of the Baptist faith. \"She was kind, she loved people,\" Dorothy Mimms said. Community activist Andrew Holmes, who lost his own daughter to violence, said the family can't fathom how or why someone would do this to the vivacious girl. \"That\u2019s what they're doing now, just trying to work with detectives to look at social media \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram \u2014 anything they can find. They're trying to work with her friends to determine anyone she would've had a problem with,\" he said. In September, days after the discovery was made, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said divers from the police marine unit planned \"grid searches\" in the lagoon, similar to the search in September 2015 for the remains of 2-year-old Kyrian Knox, whose dismembered body was found in the Garfield Park lagoon on the West Side. City workers drained the lagoon in an attempt to ensure no other human remains had been dumped there, Guglielmi said at the time. The rest of Mimms' body has not been recovered, officials said. ",

Greg Abbott recalled in an interview that, as his state\u2019s attorney general, he had filed 31 lawsuits against the current administration over policies including President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law, greenhouse-gas rules and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. \u201cThe Trump administration is going in there and doing exactly what the states have been calling for,\u201d Abbott said of the president-elect\u2019s promises to dismantle all of those measures starting on Inauguration Day. Florida Gov. Rick Scott answers questions during a news conference at the Republican Governors Association conference Nov. 15 in Orlando. (John Raoux/AP) South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley once said that Trump represented \u201ceverything a governor doesn\u2019t want in a president\u201d and jabbed at him in her response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address this year as \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices.\u201d But on Tuesday, she told reporters she is \u201cjust giddy\u201d about what lies ahead in a Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019ve never known what it\u2019s like to have a Republican president,\u201d she said. \u201cI can tell you, the last six years, Washington was the hardest part of my job.\u201d [ Key figures purged from Trump transition team ] She and other state chief executives also noted frequently that Trump has chosen one of their own \u2014 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2014 to be his vice president and run his transition. Pence spoke to the group in a private session Monday. The governors here are well aware that the collective fate of their party at the statehouse level could hinge on whether Trump succeeds in the early years of his presidency. The GOP holds 33 governorships, the highest level of either party since 1922, when Warren G. Harding was president. But the map for them will be challenging in the 2018 midterm elections. Of the 36 states where governorships will be on the ballot, at least 15 will be open seats now held by Republicans. Only three of the gubernatorial offices that will be vacated because of term limits are in the hands of Democrats. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, left, speaks alongside Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson at the Republican Governors Association conference Nov. 15 in Orlando. (John Raoux/AP) The celebratory atmosphere here at the conference, heavily attended by lobbyists and donors, was a decided contrast from the RGA\u2019s meeting four years ago in the wake of GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat. At that meeting, Louisiana\u2019s then-governor, Bobby Jindal \u2014 then the incoming RGA chairman and considered among his party\u2019s brightest presidential prospects \u2014 had admonished Republicans that \u201cwe need to stop being a dumb party\u201d and become more inclusive. Jindal turned out to be one of 16 Republican contenders vanquished by the outsider Trump in the GOP primary. He folded his campaign even before the Iowa caucuses, saying, \u201cThis is not my time.\u201d Four years ago, former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour spoke to the RGA of the need to \u201cgive our political organization a very serious proctology exam.\u201d In an interview Wednesday, he said: \u201cPeople here are upbeat. They want Trump to succeed. They want governors to be part of helping him to succeed.\u201d [ President Obama warns of a \u2018crude sort of nationalism\u2019 in the U.S. ] If Trump does follow through on some of his biggest promises, however, there will also be challenges for Republican governors \u2014 among other things, what to do about health coverage for the estimated 20\u00a0million people who have gained it under the Affordable Care Act. Abbott argued that the problems of the revamped health-care system, including higher premiums and fewer choices for some who purchase policies, will put pressure on Democrats in Congress to work with Republicans in fashioning something to replace it. Obamacare \u201cwas subject to the death penalty already. The question was when it was going to die,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIt will atrophy and die within two years, regardless of the hissy fit the Democrats in Congress are going to throw.\u201d The governors here said they have been largely impressed by the discipline Trump has shown most of the time since the election and the moderate tone of his public comments. \u201cI hope he can continue to be that same person, using that same tone,\u201d South Carolina\u2019s Haley said Tuesday. But she added that Trump must also convince the country that real change is occurring on his watch. \u201cThe key is communication, communication, communication,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunicate what is being done. His goal should be to do something every day. Communicate every day to the American people on what you\u2019ve changed today.\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 another failed GOP primary candidate \u2014 said it would be \u201ca good use for his Twitter feed.\u201d Thus far, governors said, they have not been concerned about Trump comments such as when he indicated he would \u201camend\u201d Obamacare, which sounded less ambitious than his pledge to repeal and replace it. But Florida Gov. Rick Scott cautioned that as president, Trump will have to choose his words more carefully. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to work with your legislature, you\u2019re going to have to be precise,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cHe will. He has to.\u201d Some also called for more clarity in Trump\u2019s dealings internationally. \u201cIn the first 100 days, he\u2019s got to give assurance to our allies and confidence in his leadership,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said during a panel discussion. \u201cHe needs to provide clarity on immigration and border security. Those are expectations of the American people, and during the campaign it was opaque.\u201d In an interview afterward, Hutchinson said, hopefully, \u201cI think we will be reassured in the coming weeks.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 11, 2016\u00a0 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/\u201d60 Minutes\u201d via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Of America's 320-million-odd residents, only about three-quarters are eligible to vote (mostly because they're over the age of 18). Of the group that could vote in the presidential election, the U.S. Election Project's Michael McDonald estimates that about 58.1 percent did \u2014 meaning that 41.9 percent of eligible Americans didn't vote last week. Using the most recent national splits from Cook Political's Dave Wasserman , that means that Donald Trump was elected president with the support of fewer than 1-in-5 Americans. So be it. That's the system. You vote; you shape the government. You stay home, you don't. The Post partnered with the Schar School for Public Policy at George Mason University to survey Americans in the wake of last week's voting. Among the questions we asked was a simple one: How do you feel about the election of Donald Trump as president? It was an open-ended question, and we noted what people said in response. The most common sentiment was happiness and excitement, followed by those who indicated that they were upset. Many said they were hopeful (in one way or another); many expressed that they thought the results were terrible or that they were scared or worried about the result. The graph above groups responses by type, but the overall most common reply we heard was \u201cdisappointed\u201d (which fits into that \u201cupset\u201d category). Of course, the responses varied depending on who we were asking. Trump voters were much more likely to be happy and hopeful; Clinton backers more likely to be upset, scared and shocked. Not hugely surprising. But then we also broke out responses from those who didn't even bother voting. It's a small sample size, but the responses were more evenly distributed. More nonvoters said they thought the results were terrible than expressed happiness about them, for example. To which I say: Are you kidding me? Some people aren't\u00a0able to vote on Election Day because they're working or have some sort of emergency that prevents their doing so. Those people are excused from the following critique. For those who were eligible to vote but chose not to: Your opinion is bad. Voting is the price of admission for complaining about the results. Nothing's stopping you from complaining, of course; the First Amendment protects complaints more than anything else, really. But don't roll up to America and say \u201cyou made a bad choice\u201d after not weighing in on that choice. It's like showing up to dinner with a group of friends an hour in and complaining about what they ordered. Tough luck, man; eat your liver. Let's revise that first graph, re-categorizing it slightly. politics ",

By Monica Hesse November 16 at 2:24 PM Follow @MonicaHesse Ivanka Trump\u2018s mystery is that she always does seem to be running some kind of clandestine mission. (Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images) We might as well start with Ivanka, as we plumb the present and future of Trumpism, the Trump Cabinet, the Trump family, the Trump brand. Because \u2014 Ivanka. The most personable, palatable, fashionable, Trump-lite member of the future first family. The most inscrutable, yet most weirdly relatable. Some people think she\u2019ll be the real first lady, with her telegenic personality and her copacetic pet causes, and her lifestyle website, already dedicated to being a gracious host and professional woman. Last week, her father formally named her to his transition team; early this week, rumors swirled \u2014 which Donald Trump later denied \u2014 that the president-elect had requested top-secret security clearance for Ivanka and her brothers. On Monday evening, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash went on air and read out loud an incredulous text message from a friend: \u201cWhat clandestine operation is Ivanka going to run?\u201d All the operations, Dana. We can\u2019t shake the feeling that Ivanka is the key to this all. What is going on here? is a question everyone is asking about everything happening at every moment in Washington right now, and possibly until the end of time. On Tuesday, major news outlets reported that the transition team was a mess; on Wednesday, Donald Trump tweeted that the transition \u201cis going so smoothly,\u201d and we are reduced to scouring Ivanka Trump\u2019s Instagram feed to figure out the future of the country. Here is a video of Ivanka\u2019s daughter singing a song about pineapples, posted at the same time that a former national security official warned the world to \u201cstay away \u201d from the \u201carrogant, screaming\u201d transition team. Here is Ivanka, 35, in a Snapchat-filtered floral headdress. Here is a current article on her pastel, aspirational lifestyle website, headlined \u201c5 tips for mixing work and family.\u201d (Family dinner agenda: appoint new attorney general; secretary of state?) Ivanka sat for a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with the rest of her family this week and folded her hands primly across her lap, one wrist bedecked with a heavy gold bracelet. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a daughter,\u201d she said firmly when Lesley Stahl asked whether she would be seeking a job in the Trump administration. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl, left, interviews President-elect Donald Trump and his family at his home: wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, seated right, daughter Tiffany, seated second row from left, and sons Donald Jr. and Eric. (Chris Albert/AP) The next morning, a sales representative from her jewelry line sent out a notice to journalists that the aforementioned gold bangle was Ivanka\u2019s \u201cfavorite.\u201d It could be purchased for $10,800 through the Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry website. Daughter-slash-businesswoman? Businesswoman -slash-presidential adviser? What does it all mean, Ivanka? Journalists debated whether the bracelet event was an outright conflict of interest or a slightly murky but also savvy move. The mystery of Ivanka is that she always does seem to be running some kind of clandestine mission \u2014 blowing some kind of dog whistle or bleating some kind of Morse code, or becoming the attractive vessel into which both parties poured their own hopes and dreams. \u201cLike many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat,\u201d she said while introducing her father at the Republican National Convention in July. \u201cMore than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka said her father is a \"fighter\" will fight for America. (The Washington Post) Could Ivanka be reasoned with? wondered the commenters who viewed her father as too unpredictable and were seeking reassurance. Was Ivanka the one secretly running the whole show? When there are no answers, it\u2019s easier to ask questions and adapt wild conspiracy theories as the answers. \u201cAre Ivanka and Jared Kushner concocting a House of Cards-style game of their own?\u201d Vanity Fair asked this week, in an article about the hypothetical machinations of Ivanka and her husband. They were, the essay argued, \u201cpositioned to become the de facto first couple.\u201d Ivanka was the one who stayed focused. She was the one who had a politician\u2019s poise, and she held her highest cards close to her vest. President-elect Donald Trump and his daughter. Ivanka seems like the steeliest of the Trump clan, the kind of person who might bring a stiletto to a knife fight. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) What do we make of her? What is her endgame, when she insists that she is not a political person, while advocating for politically divisive causes, like equal wages for women and paid maternity leave? When, while working on the transition team for the highest office in the land, she is simultaneously posting videos online of her with her officemates, goofing around, doing the mannequin challenge? Ivanka: is the fairest of them all, but she also seems like the steeliest, the kind of person who might bring a stiletto to a knife fight. Ivanka: poised to fight for child-care reform, amid her own online pregnancy photos that revealed she was one of those women who looked as though she tucked a soccer ball down her size 2 dress and emerged nine months later with a baby. Ivanka: in those other photos where \u2014 and we realize that cameras are always catching things at weird angles and odd moments \u2014 but those photos where the president-elect always seems to be patting around his daughter\u2019s butt. \u201cShe does have a very nice figure,\u201d Trump once said of his daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve said that if Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her.\u201d Oh, Ivanka. Oh God, Ivanka. Speak to us. We are listening. This entire election has been about large portions of the electorate puzzling over whether their candidate really intended to do the things he said he was going to do, trying to read the election\u2019s burned entrails for the future of the country. The country needs someone who is an expert in shadowy operations, who can report back from the inside what is really going on. The country needs Ivanka. We\u2019ve got to figure out Ivanka. lifestyle ",

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Democrats stunned by Election Day losses began the process on Wednesday of trying to reconcile their competing factions, framing the contours of a contentious debate within the party. In the Senate, they elected a new slate of leaders, led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York , that in many ways reflected the divide. That group included Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the best-known figures in the progressive wing, and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist up for re-election in 2018. \u201cThis team is ideologically and geographically diverse, it mixes the wisdom of experience with the vigor of youth, at least in Senate years,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement. \u201cBut from the top to bottom, each of these senators has devoted their lives to fighting for the middle class and those struggling to get there.\u201d Mr. Schumer\u2019s immediate challenge will be to meet the often competing imperatives of those senators, part of Democrats\u2019 larger struggle over whether to try to tailor an appeal to the working-class white voters who left them and led to the election of Donald J. Trump, or to attempt to increase the so-called Obama coalition anchored by minority and younger voters. Mr. Sanders will serve as the conference\u2019s outreach chairman and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. Video Who Is Chuck Schumer? Senator Chuck Schumer, who will take over as the leader of the Senate Democrats after the retirement of Harry Reid, is known as a hard-charging Brooklynite.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cI am going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking working class and not billionaires who are doing phenomenally well,\u201d he told reporters.

For someone whose poll numbers hit rock bottom earlier this year, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has had a pretty good run. He just signed off on a tentative contract with Chicago Public Schools teachers, avoiding what would have been a disruptive and politically dicey strike. He introduced a budget that sidestepped... (Editorial Board) Emanuel's budget includes a new 7-cent fee for each store-provided disposable bag, designed to raise about $13 million next year. It replaces a city ban on plastic bags that was deemed largely ineffective. People can avoid paying that tax by bringing reusable bags to the store. The mayor also plans to add 685 new parking meters, with 460 in the Loop and surrounding business district and 225 in neighborhoods. The $5.4 million raised by the new meters would partly offset the $12 million the city estimates it will pay to Chicago Parking Meters LLC for meters that are out of service. Parking rates at O'Hare International and Midway airports would rise, with the daily fee going up by as much as $12.25 under a complex system that varies by the type of lot used. The proceeds will be plowed back into city airport improvements and operations. Other fee increases include so-called surge pricing to $4 from $2 at 820 parking meters near Wrigley Field starting two hours before a game or event. Plans to do the same at 670 parking meters near Soldier Field were put on hold so 3rd Ward Ald. Pat Dowell can have further talks with local businesses. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel presents his 2017 budget to the City Council on\u00a0Oct. 11, 2016, at City Hall. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Drivers also would pay to use commercial loading zones with hourly parking rates set at $14 downtown and in two nearby wards. Once fully in place, the administration expects to collect $13 million to $18 million a year. For their money, Chicagoans stand to see 545 new cops added to the Chicago Police Department's ranks next year and $36 million over three years spent on expanding teenage mentoring programs. Five-year tally The series of tax and fee hikes pushed by Emanuel and approved by aldermen adds up to about $1,692 a year once they take full effect. Here's a breakdown: *About $994 in property tax hikes for City Hall and CPS. That's based on a $250,000 home. *$50.40 for the 911 phone tax passed in 2014. That's based on a total of three phone lines, cell or land. *$355 from water and sewer fees that were doubled in 2011. *$134 from the water and sewer tax passed in September. That's for metered service. People without meters can expect to pay $229. *$25 from a 2011 city vehicle sticker hike. The increase was $10 per car and $15 for SUVs. *$19.40 from a cable tax hike approved in 2014. That's based on an $80 monthly bill. *$114 a year for garbage pickup approved in 2015. That's based on $9.50 per unit a month for a single-family home. Much of the money is going to the underfunded government worker pension systems, which are $18.6 billion short. The 911 tax is going to the laborers' retirement fund at about $40 million a year. The city property tax hikes are being poured into the police and firefighters' funds at $543 million a year. Another $250 million or so a year is going to the CPS retirement fund. The new water and sewer tax will result in an additional $239 million a year for the municipal workers' pension fund. All the major tax, fee and fine increases enacted or set in motion by the city and CPS during the past five years approach $1.9 billion. That doesn't include new sales and beverage taxes approved by the County Board under board President Toni Preckwinkle, which are slated to eventually raise another $698 million. Cost containment During Emanuel's tenure, the city budget has increased from about $6.2 billion to about $8.2 billion. Part of that 34 percent increase is due to the city continuing to pay for programs that the federal government stopped funding and more money being spent on water and sewer construction projects. Day-to-day spending for city operations has risen to roughly $3.7 billion from about $3.3 billion, around a 14 percent increase. Much of the increase is covering city worker raises. The mayor has cut the city workforce by about 5 percent. To be sure, Emanuel faced significant financial hurdles when he took office in the aftermath of the Great Recession. To keep the city afloat and avoid tough decisions, former Mayor Richard M. Daley was using one-time revenue, like the $1.15 billion payment to the city for leasing out its parking meters, and relying on costly, frowned-upon borrowing practices. The pension funds were losing money and headed toward insolvency. The bulk of the tax increases enacted under Emanuel are being used to try to fix the pension funds, with much of the rest going to shore up a city water and sewer system that was deteriorating. The mayor also is phasing out costly borrowing practices \u2014 though he's not all the way there yet \u2014 and has nearly eliminated the use of one-time revenue to keep the city afloat. Emanuel also in the final stages of phasing out health care insurance subsidies for most retired city workers to save about $90 million a year, has moved the city to a more efficient grid-based garbage system that his administration says has freed up about $30 million for other city services, and has eliminated or started to phase out special taxing districts that drain city property taxes from day-to-day operations.

Over the past several decades, the United States has become increasingly segregated by class , with college-educated people marrying, living and socializing apart from less-educated Americans. The result has been that Americans have lost touch with one another, sociologists say, and helps explain why each side is so baffled by the other. \u201cIf you went to Thanksgiving dinner 50 years ago, you\u2019d be very likely to have dinner with people from a different walk of life,\u201d said Robert D.

This was the second time Pence and Biden have met since Donald Trump won the presidential election a week ago. Pence and Biden were accompanied by their spouses, Karen Pence and Dr. Jill Biden. Pence\u2019s youngest daughter Charlotte was also present but she did not join the lunch. Appearing in front of the press following the meeting, Biden brushed aside questions as to whether the Trump administration would be ready to govern in January, saying \"no administration is ready for day 1.\" Mike Pence Says His Role Model for Vice President Is Dick Cheney He added that he wasn't worried about Trump and Pence dismantling the work of the past eight years and that he was ready to help the new administration, if needed. \"I told Mike, the vice president elect, that I am available to him 24/7,\" said Biden. \"I plan on being available to Mike as senior staff for him as he moves.\" Pence noted that he and Karen were \"very grateful for the hospitality\" and that they had \"an enjoyable time. Pence and Biden first met for 30 minutes last Wednesday in Biden\u2019s West Wing office, shortly after Trump and Obama met. According to Biden\u2019s office, during their first meeting the two men \u201cspoke about their time working together in Congress and their friendship dating back many years. The vice president talked with the vice president-elect about the key duties of the vice president, and discussed a number of specific policy portfolios that have been a critical focus for him during his time in office, including NATO and eastern Europe and expanding access to the middle class.\u201d Pence, who is still serving as governor of Indiana, is now headed back to the Hoosier state.

Ortiz , USA TODAY Sports 6:37 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 Max Scherzer led the NL in wins (20) and strikeouts (284). (Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports) When Max Scherzer rejected the Detroit Tigers\u2019 $144 million extension in 2014, coming off a Cy Young Award-winning season, he not only gambled he could get a bigger offer but also argued he was still improving. Turns out he was right on both fronts. In his second season with the Washington Nationals, who signed him to a seven-year, $210 million deal in January 2015, Scherzer proved to be the most dominant pitcher in the National League, and on Wednesday he was rewarded with his second Cy Young in a runaway over\u00a0the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Jon Lester and Kyle Hendricks. Scherzer received 25 of the 30 first-place votes for 192 points, easily outpolling Lester (102) and Hendricks (85). Scherzer, 32, becomes just the sixth pitcher to earn Cy Youngs in both leagues, joining Hall of Famers Gaylord Perry, Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson, as well as Roger Clemens and Roy Halladay. In going 20-7 with a 2.96 ERA and 284 strikeouts, Scherzer led the league in two of the three Triple Crown categories, lagging only in ERA (eighth). He also displayed a rare combination of overpowering stuff, durability and knack for keeping runners off base by pitching a league-high 228 1/3 innings while registering the NL\u2019s lowest WHIP (walks and hits per inning) at 0.97 and holding batters to a .199 average. Scherzer had his signature moment on May 11 when he tied a major league record by striking out 20 batters in a game \u2013 against his former Detroit teammates. His overall numbers this year were comparable or a shade better than in his Cy Young season of 2013, when Scherzer went 21-3 with a 2.90 ERA but with fewer innings pitched (214 1/3) and strikeouts (240). The Cubs boasted by far the majors\u2019 best starters\u2019 ERA at 2.96, with Hendricks (2.13) and Lester (2.44) ranking 1-2. They also finished 2-3 in WHIP just behind Scherzer, but the Nationals\u2019 ace had a sizable lead in innings pitched and strikeouts, and those might have been the decisive factors. Hendricks had a 16-8 record, led the majors in ERA and finished just behind Scherzer with a WHIP of 0.98. Lester tied his career high in wins with a 19-5 mark. Gallery: Recent NL Cy Young winners ",

By Paul Farhi November 16 at 4:30 PM Follow @farhip Donald Trump vilified and condemned reporters when he was a candidate. As president-elect for the past week, he seems to have moved on to simply ignoring them. Defying the usual presidential press protocols, Trump has twice in the past week ditched the pool of reporters who follow him in public. The latest incident occurred Tuesday night, when reporters were led to believe by his staff that he had retired for the night \u2014 only to learn that he was at dinner with his family at a restaurant in New York. Trump has not held a news conference since the election and has not designated a surrogate to brief reporters on his transition. This has left journalists in the dark about key appointments and other developments with his new administration. The cold shoulder has renewed a nagging question for reporters: Will President-elect Trump\u2019s behavior be a preview of his approach, or perhaps non-approach, to his relations with the news media when he takes office? [ Donald Trump ditched the media ] Members of the press await the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump for a meeting with President Obama at the White House on Nov. 10. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) The pool consists of a small group of reporters who follow the president and president-elect to all public appearances and act as proxies for hundreds of other reporters. This \u201cprotective pool\u201d \u2014 which is cleared by the Secret Service \u2014 then shares its observations with fellow journalists. The arrangement enables reporters to know the president\u2019s whereabouts at all times and to report anything newsworthy, from the mundane to an attempt on his life. But Trump has blown off the pool as president-elect twice in the past eight days, the first time in Washington last Thursday when he met with President Obama at the White House and later with Republican leaders. That elicited a worried statement Monday from the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association , which represents reporters in negotiations about press access to the president. The organization said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s decision to reject a protective pool. \u201cThis is all about the public having information,\u201d Julie Pace, the Associated Press\u2019s White House reporter, said Wednesday. \u201cIf there were an emergency or a crisis, would people want to know where the president is? I think most people would say yes.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s episode particularly exasperated reporters because Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, had told them around 6:15\u00a0p.m. that Trump had returned to Trump Tower for the night, placing what\u2019s known in pool parlance as a \u201clid\u201d on further activities. Trump\u2019s subsequent appearance for dinner at a midtown Manhattan steakhouse set off a Keystone Kops-style scramble by reporters to get to the scene. One group set off in a cab but wound up at the wrong restaurant, thanks to an errant report by another journalist. Once they arrived at the proper location, the 21 Club, they found it barricaded by police. Several journalists \u2014 those without New York City press passes \u2014 were ordered by police to stand a block away from the restaurant, where their view of the restaurant was blocked by a dumpster. Donald Trump has had an up-and-down relationship with the media for a long time. He spent much of the campaign calling the press \"crooked\" and \"rigged.\" The Fix's Peter Stevenson explains what the president-elect\u2019s relationship with the press might look like going forward. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Hicks said Tuesday night that she was unaware of Trump\u2019s dinner and that she didn\u2019t intend \u201cto leave the press in the dark.\u201d She said in an email Wednesday, \u201cWe are still in the process of formalizing a protective pool structure and look forward to implementing that as soon as possible.\u201d Once that is set up, she told pool reporters Tuesday, journalists will have \u201call of the access that they have ever had under any president.\u201d However, the signs have not been promising. In addition to repeatedly disparaging reporters at his rallies, Trump has shown few signs of transparency. He declined to release his tax returns during the campaign, making him the first major presidential candidate in 40 years to withhold them. He banned about a dozen news organizations, including The Washington Post, from his rallies and events, and threatened to sue others, including the New York Times. At one point, he traveled to Mexico City without a pool in tow. He has also refused to fly on the same plane as his campaign pool. Since Election Day, Trump\u2019s staff has declined to answer even basic questions about how he is building his new administration. The news blackout has led to much speculation. Perhaps responding to the confusion, Trump sent a tweet Tuesday night reading: \u201cVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d Trump is not required to speak to the news media, but he has dispensed with generations-old traditions and formalities that have framed the relationship between the news media and presidential politicians. \u201cHis combative approach to press relations is not helpful,\u201d said Jeffrey McCall , a communications professor at DePauw University who studies the news media. \u201cHe clearly doesn\u2019t respect the media, which he is certainly allowed to do, but at a certain point he has to find a way to work with them. When he decided to run for president, he stepped into a much higher degree of scrutiny than what he had as a reality-TV star and businessman. Now that he is president\u00ad-elect, that press attention necessarily grows.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t owe it so much to the press to be accessible as he owes it to the citizens who are represented by their press surrogates,\u201d McCall added. \u201cHis prospects for a successful presidency hinge in large part on his ability to keep his message in front of the public. Whether he likes it or not, those messages will go through the filter of the press.\u201d Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. Correction: An earlier version of this article said Trump had traveled to Scotland as a candidate without telling the media. It was actually a trip to Mexico City, which he embarked on without formally telling his press pool. lifestyle ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump, shown here the night of the election, dismissed reports of infighting among his transition team on Wednesday. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump denied Wednesday that his transition was in disarray, assailing news media reports about firings and infighting and insisting in an early-morning Twitter burst that everything was going \u201cso smoothly.\u201d But legal and procedural delays by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team continued on Wednesday, all but freezing the traditional handoff of critical information from the current administration more than a week after Mr. Trump won the presidential election. The president-elect criticized a report in The New York Times about his early telephone contacts with foreign leaders. In a post on Twitter , he said he had made and received \u201ccalls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.\u201d The Times reported that Mr. Trump had taken calls from the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Russia and Britain, but said they had been conducted haphazardly and without State Department briefings that traditionally guide conversations with foreign leaders. Of the transition effort, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cIt is going so smoothly.\u201d Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that the effort to fill staff positions in the new administration was \u201cvery calm, it\u2019s very structured.\u201d He said that reports of chaos were being spread by disgruntled former members of the transition or people bitter about the election results. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was put in charge of the transition last Friday, has counseled Mr. Trump not to feel pressured to make announcements rashly, according to people familiar with the deliberations inside Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Miller said Mr. Trump was taking a \u201ca very structured, methodical approach\u201d to staffing. Mr. Miller also rejected as \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d reports that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had been purging the transition team of people allied with Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, who was removed last week as head of the transition effort. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Picking His Cabinet. Here\u2019s a Shortlist. But Mr. Miller confirmed that Mr. Pence had directed that the transition should not include lobbyists, confirming reports that some existing members of the team had been asked to leave. Mr. Miller said that officials were \u201cmaking good on President-elect Trump\u2019s promise that we\u2019re not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts. When we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps. And so, the bottom line is, we\u2019re going to get the transition team where we need it to be.\u201d White House aides said Obama administration officials at agencies across the government remained legally barred from delivering the normal guidance and briefings to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team because essential documents had still not been completed. A wholesale shake-up of Mr. Trump\u2019s team \u2014 replacing Gov. Christie and the transition staff he had assembled \u2014 has forced Mr. Pence to sign a new memorandum of understanding, a legally required document. White House officials said Mr. Pence delivered that document to them on Tuesday. But by Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s team still had not delivered a series of required, supporting documents, including certifications that each transition member would abide by a code of conduct and would not divulge sensitive information about the inner workings of the government. \u201cThe next step is for the president-elect\u2019s transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the White House. \u201cOnce we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts.\u201d Advertisement ",

Despite the dire warning , Hawking also tried to sound a hopeful note about the future of human achievement. \u00a0 \u201cRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet,\u201d Hawking said, according to The Independent. \u201cTry to make sense of what you see, wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don\u2019t just give up.\u201d In recent months, Hawking has used his stature in the sciences to make broad statements about the thorny moral and political dilemmas facing modern societies. In an essay published in The Guardian in July, Hawking argued that in order for humans to survive the massive, serious challenges ahead \u2014\u00a0 climate change , overtaxed food production, and overpopulation, to name a few \u2014 they need to resist the individualism and isolationism that have fueled political movements like Brexit . \u201cWe will need to adapt, rethink, refocus and change some of our fundamental assumptions about what we mean by wealth, by possessions, by mine and yours. Just like children, we will have to learn to share,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we fail then the forces that contributed to Brexit, the envy and isolationism not just in the UK but around the world that spring from not sharing, of cultures driven by a narrow definition of wealth and a failure to divide it more fairly, both within nations and across national borders, will strengthen. If that were to happen, I would not be optimistic about the long-term outlook for our species.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Laurent Gizon et al. and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany. Illustration by Mark A. Garlick.) A\u00a0distant star some 5,000 light-years from Earth has attained a newfound status as the\u00a0roundest natural object ever discovered\u00a0in the universe. While still not a perfect sphere, Kepler 11145123\u00a0is only about 4 miles bigger at the equator than at the poles, according to a\u00a0new study.\u00a0That\u00a0is astonishingly small compared to the\u00a0star\u2019s average diameter of 2\u00a0million miles. While the star is over twice the size of the sun, it\u00a0is \"significantly more round than the sun,\" said\u00a0Laurent Gizon\u00a0of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research who lead the study\u00a0published Wednesday in Science Advances. Stars and planets are not perfect spheres. Instead, they tend to flatten out in the middle when they rotate due to centrifugal force.\u00a0The sun is six\u00a0miles\u00a0bigger at the equator than at the poles, while the Earth is 13 miles\u00a0bigger at the equator. Astronomers used instruments aboard the Kepler space observatory to conduct\u00a0the research. The technique used to measure the size of the star is relatively new and allowed astronomers to\u00a0determine\u00a0its size\u00a0with unprecedented precision. \"We intend to apply this method to other stars observed by Kepler,\" Gizon said.\u00a0\"An important theoretical field in astrophysics has now become observational.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fxOcV4 ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 16, 2016 5:42 PM EST DES MOINES, Iowa - An Iowa lawmaker plans to introduce what he calls the \u201csuck it up, buttercup\u201d bill to cut budgets at public universities that spend extra money on students upset about the presidential election. Republican Rep. Bobby Kaufmann tells The Des Moines Register that the proposed legislation would target schools using taxpayer dollars to fund election-related sit-ins and grief counseling above and beyond what is normally available to students. He said the bill will also call for creating new penalties for protesters who block highways. \u201cI\u2019ve seen four or five schools in other states that are establishing \u2018cry zones\u2019 where they\u2019re staffed by state grief counselors and kids and come cry out their sensitivity to the election results,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cI find this whole hysteria to be incredibly annoying. People have the right to be hysterical ... on their own time.\u201d\u00a0 Speaking to CBS News, Kaufmann elaborated on his feelings: \u201cThat\u2019s not how life works. My concern is if you think when adversity hurts you you\u2019re able to press pause on reality, you\u2019re gonna be hit with a strong slap on the face. You\u2019re not going to get to do a time out.\u201d CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI reports that University of Northern Iowa students and faculty gathered at three sessions to discuss the election and their fears. Spokesman Scott Ketelsen says no money was spent on those sessions. Students and faculty at Iowa State University held a rally, and University of Iowa student groups held events. The schools say no extra funds were spent on the events. \u201cThis election was somewhat unique,\u201d Ketelsen said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like previous elections, so the response wasn\u2019t like previous elections. And that\u2019s OK. But people have to be able to sit down and have open dialogue and honest communication with one another.\u201d Protests haven\u2019t been limited to college campuses in Iowa. More than 100 protesters shut down Interstate 80 in Iowa City for about a half hour on Friday night. Iowa State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Nathan Ludwig said troopers quickly cleared the Friday protest, but he said the event could have posed a threat to public safety. Similar protests and rallies have been held nationwide following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election.\u00a0 KCCI reports Kaufmann is a controversial conservative figure in Iowa. LGBTQ youth groups have accused him of a witch hunt against them.\u00a0 The bill still needs to be formally written, Kaufmann said, but he\u2019s confident it will be well-received. \u201cI would be shocked to see it not pass,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Got it The Post\u2019s Greg Miller explores what\u2019s behind the national security shake-up within President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller November 16 at 4:50 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to push back against news coverage describing a chaotic transition to power, saying the process of selecting Cabinet secretaries and working with the Obama administration \u201cis going so smoothly.\u2019\u2019 As Trump met with senior advisers to discuss potential Cabinet candidates, there were further signs that power in his transition effort was consolidating within an ever-smaller group of loyalists generally not aligned with Republican members of the Washington establishment. [ The latest news on the Trump presidential transition ] Among them is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump adviser known for his hard-line views on immigration. His former staff director at the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is now helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump\u2019s team, according to two prominent Republican lawyers with knowledge of the matter. 1 of 8 Here\u2019s what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 11, 2016\u00a0 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/\u201d60 Minutes\u201d via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Benczkowski replaced Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former U.S. attorney and associate attorney general who had been managing the Justice Department transition, the lawyers said. A white-collar defense attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski previously worked in a number of senior Justice Department jobs and is a respected lawyer. His elevation is likely another indication that power has shifted away from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who was recently replaced as head of the transition team by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and who had been considered an emissary to more mainstream Republicans. Benczkowski declined to comment. The new developments came as Sessions himself emerged as a top candidate for defense secretary, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Both would bring hawkish views and military experience, but neither has executive experience running a massive bureaucracy such as the Pentagon. Trump was also visited Wednesday by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who emerged from a meeting with the president-elect saying that he told Trump that \u201cso many New Yorkers are fearful\u201d of what he plans to do as president. De Blasio, a liberal Democrat, has clashed with Trump in the past. And like mayors in many of the nation\u2019s major cities with diverse cultures, he has said New York City authorities would not assist federal immigration officials with the deportations of immigrants who are here illegally, providing them sanctuary. Despite such differences, De Blasio said the hour-long session was \u201crespectful\u201d and added that Trump \u201cloves this city.\u2019\u2019 Here are the people the rumor mill says Trump might pick for Cabinet spots Transition turmoil On his Twitter account, Trump took particular aim at a favorite target, the New York Times, which reported Wednesday that the transition has been marked by firings and infighting, and that U.S. allies were having trouble reaching Trump at New York\u2019s Trump Tower as he plans his government. \u201cThe failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. . . . I have received and taken calls from many foreign leaders,\u2019\u2019 Trump wrote in a series of posts on the microblogging site. He also denied reports that his transition team has sought security clearances for his children. In his tweets, Trump falsely implies the Times reported that he had not spoken with foreign leaders and never points out exactly what the Times had in error. The Times did report that American allies were \u201cblindly dialing in to Trump Tower\u201d in an attempt to reach the president-elect and that key members of the transition team had been fired. The paper reported that even key U.S. allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May had been patched through to Trump \u201cwith little warning,\u201d citing a Western diplomat. Later in the day, the transition team released a list of foreign leaders that Trump and Pence have spoked with. [ Trump\u2019s gripes about the Times are usually about stories that prove accurate ] The Washington Post has also reported about turbulence in Trump\u2019s transition . But Peter Hoekstra, a Republican former congressman from Michigan, defended Trump in an interview Wednesday, saying the president-elect\u2019s team has \u201ca monumental job to do and a short time to do it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just watching all the sniping coming in. They\u2019re not doing this right. They\u2019re not doing that right,\u2019\u2019 said Hoekstra, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman who is reportedly under consideration for CIA director. \u201cThis is what any transition team would do. You start with the people who brought you. I think the Trump team is going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they\u2019re going to do it in a methodical way.\u2019\u2019 The reported bloodletting in Trump\u2019s transition team that began with last week\u2019s ouster of Christie had escalated Tuesday with new departures, particularly in the area of national security. Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) announced that he had left his position as the transition\u2019s senior national security adviser. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leading candidate for CIA director, was among at least four transition officials purged this week, apparently because of perceived connections to Christie. As turbulence within the team grew, some key members of Trump\u2019s party began to question his views and the remaining candidates for top positions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Trump\u2019s efforts to work more closely with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin amounted to \u201ccomplicity in [the] butchery of the Syrian people\u201d and \u201can unacceptable price for a great nation.\u201d Trump met Tuesday with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who replaced Christie at the head of the transition Friday, to discuss Cabinet and White House personnel choices. Little to no information was released by the transition office, leaving a clutch of reporters gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower to hustle after team members passing between the front doors and the elevators. Trump posted a message Tuesday night on Twitter saying that a \u201cvery organized process [is] taking place\u201d as he decides on Cabinet and other positions. \u201cI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d As he had during the campaign, Trump appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable with outsiders and suspicious of those considered part of what one insider called the \u00ad\u201cbicoastal elite,\u201d who are perceived as trying to \u201cinsinuate\u201d themselves into positions of power. Those in the inner circle reportedly were winnowed to loyalists who had stuck with Trump throughout the campaign and helped devise his winning strategy. They include Sessions, former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and members of Trump\u2019s family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. \u201cThis is a very insular, pretty closely held circle of people,\u201d said Philip D. Zelikow, a former director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and a senior figure in the George W. Bush transition. \u201cConfusion is the norm\u201d for transitions, he said, \u201cbut there are some unusual features here, because they\u2019re trying to make some statements.\u201d \u201cThey feel like their election was a lot of the American people wanting to throw a brick through a window,\u201d Zelikow said. \u201cThey want to make appointments that make it sound like glass is being broken.\u201d [ President Obama warns against \u2018a crude sort of nationalism\u2019 in the U.S. ] Increasingly, among the shards are more mainline Republicans in the national security field. In an angry Twitter post Tuesday, Eliot A. Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump during the campaign who had advised those interested in administration jobs to take them, abruptly changed his mind, saying the transition \u201cwill be ugly.\u201d After responding to a transition insider seeking names of possible appointees, Cohen said, he received what he described as an \u201cunhinged\u201d email from the same person saying \u201cYOU LOST\u201d and accusing Trump critics of trying to infiltrate the administration\u2019s ranks. \u201cIt became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls, instead of the sense that actually what you\u2019re trying to do is recruit the best possible talent to fill the most important, demanding, \u00adlowest-paying executive jobs in the world,\u201d Cohen said. Rogers\u2019s departure coincided with word from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose possible selection as secretary of state comforted more mainline Republicans, that he was unlikely to be chosen. \u201cHas my name been in the mix? I\u2019m pretty sure, yeah. Have I been having intimate conversations? No,\u201d Corker said in an interview. \u201cDo I understand that it\u2019s likely that people who\u2019ve been involved in the center of this for some time, and have been surrogating on television, are likely front-runners? I would say that\u2019s likely, yes.\u201d The two people whose names are mentioned most often for the diplomatic job \u2014 former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and John R. Bolton, an undersecretary of state and one-year ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 are Trump loyalists. But both could be problematic, even among Republicans who would have to confirm them. Giuliani, thought to be an early choice for attorney general, was said by a person close to the transition team to have personally appealed to Trump for the diplomatic job. He has virtually no diplomatic experience or knowledge of the State Department bureaucracy. Bolton, a national security hawk who got his U.N. job through a recess appointment after the Senate refused to confirm him, was a leading advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, contradicting Trump\u2019s campaign position opposing it. Congress voices concern Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that Bolton would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that he would actively oppose his nomination. Others were more supportive. \u201cIf he picks John Bolton, then I\u2019ll support John Bolton. If he picks Rudy, I\u2019ll support Rudy,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The shortlist for defense secretary is said to include Sessions, Flynn and Cotton. Although Sessions serves on the Armed Services Committee, his main issue there has been immigration. Cotton is a Harvard Law School graduate who just seven years ago was a first lieutenant in the Army. Senate confirmation of Flynn, who also has voiced interest in serving as director of national intelligence, could be difficult, said the person close to the transition team. He was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency after two years over concerns about his leadership, and he has potentially problematic connections to foreign governments. [ A profile of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a key Trump national security adviser ] Flynn has admitted that he accepted money for appearing at a lavish gala with Putin in Moscow last year. He recently criticized the Obama administration\u2019s treatment of Turkey in an opinion column, without disclosing to the Trump campaign that his consulting firm has financial ties to that country, said the person close to the transition, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Another possible barrier for \u00adFlynn, who retired as a three-star general after leaving the DIA in 2014, is the statutory requirement that the defense secretary be at least seven years removed from active duty. Flynn has told members of the transition team that getting a waiver to this requirement would be \u201cno big deal,\u201d said the person involved with the team. But that assertion has been met with at least some internal skepticism, including from Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who asked at meetings whether such a waiver \u201chas ever been done before.\u201d The Senate waived the provision, part of the 1947 National Security Act, when President Harry S. Truman appointed retired Gen. George C. Marshall to the post in 1950. The person with ties to the transition said support for Flynn has waned as it has become evident that \u201che has some confirmation-type problems.\u201d But Flynn\u2019s influence in the transition remains high, and several sources on the transition team or with ties to Christie said Flynn and Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had seized control of the national security posts in the new administration and engineered the purges in what they described as a troubling episode of political score-settling. Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean Sr. (R), a longtime mentor to Christie, said in an interview that Kushner was widely considered unhappy with Christie\u2019s handling of the transition. There was \u201csome shock\u201d within Christie\u2019s circle at their abrupt dismissal from the transition ranks, Kean said. Tensions between Christie and Kushner date back more than a decade. In 2005, Christie, then the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, led the successful prosecution of Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, a prominent real estate developer and philanthropist, who was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion and witness tampering. Christie also has been beset by scandal of his own making. After a month-long trial that put his gubernatorial administration in a negative light, two of his former top aides were found guilty Nov. 4 for their roles in disruptive 2013 lane closures on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge. In addition, Christie is believed by some Trump intimates to have been insufficiently loyal in the final weeks of the campaign. Those who have been ousted along with or following Christie include Richard H. Bagger, a former Christie chief of staff who had been executive director of the transition, and William J. Palatucci, a New Jersey Republican who served as the transition team\u2019s general counsel. Most recent departures, a transition official said, include Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former Justice Department official who was in charge of that agency in the transition. The New York Times also reported the exit of Matthew Freedman, a protege of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who headed the National Security Council transition team. Earlier, Freedman privately told associates that the Trump team would be \u201cvery punitive\u201d toward Republicans who signed letters opposing him during the campaign and was looking to put \u201ctrue loyalists\u201d in top jobs. None responded to repeated efforts to contact them. The person close to the transition team said it was made clear to Rogers when he received a call from Trump adviser Rick Dearborn that he was being moved aside because of connections to Christie. In an interview after announcing his departure from the team, Rogers said: \u201cI still want them to be successful. I want them to be able to get a handle on the national security infrastructure of the United States and get it in the right direction. I still think it can happen.\u201d Ellen Nakashima, Philip Rucker, Robert Costa, Missy Ryan, Adam Entous and Julie Tate contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "CBS/AP November 16, 2016, 8:10 PM Georgia executes 8th person this year Steven Frederick Spears.\u00a0 Email ATLANTA -- Georgia has executed a man who essentially gave up on his case , telling a psychiatrist he didn\u2019t want to die but also didn\u2019t want to continue living in prison. Authorities say 54-year-old Steven Frederick Spears was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday following a lethal injection. He was convicted of murder in the August 2001 slaying of his ex-girlfriend, Sherri Holland, at her north Georgia home in Dahlonega, about 65 miles northeast of Atlanta. The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case involving a convicted killer who may have been sent to death row because of his race.  Attorneys for ... A psychiatrist who evaluated Spears this week said he was capable of making a rational decision about whether to fight his execution.\u00a0 Spears was the eighth inmate executed this year in Georgia, which has executed more inmates than any other state this year, including Texas with seven.\u00a0 A Georgia Supreme Court summary of the case says Spears killed Holland because he suspected she had been romantically involved with someone else. Spears came up with four separate plans for her death and ultimately killed her by choking her, wrapping tape around her mouth and face and putting a plastic bag over her head, the summary says.\u00a0 Spears was difficult to defend at trial, refusing to let his attorneys delve into his troubled family history or to suggest he wasn\u2019t of sound mind, his trial attorney Allyn Stockton told The Associated Press last week. He also refused to allow them to pursue any post-conviction appeals and has refused to communicate with Stockton for more than a year.\u00a0 Kammer filed a petition Monday saying Spears\u2019 constitutional rights were violated during his trial, sentencing and direct appeal and asking a judge to delay his execution to set a hearing on those issues.\u00a0 The \u201cnext friend\u201d petition was filed on behalf of Gwen Thompson, who was identified in the filing as Spears\u2019 ex-wife and the mother of his child. Such a petition is available to someone who has a significant relationship with a death-row inmate who declines to appeal their sentence \u201cdue to a mental disease or defect.\u201d\u00a0 Spears told Butts County Superior Court Judge Thomas Wilson during a hearing Tuesday that he and Thompson were never married and also said he didn\u2019t want to talk to Kammer and that Kammer didn\u2019t represent him, according to a transcript of the hearing. He told the judge it is his right not to pursue post-conviction appeals and that lawyers who are trying to fight his execution now are \u201ctrying to force their beliefs on me.\u201d\u00a0 Robert Shaffer, an expert selected by Kammer, also evaluated Spears on Tuesday and said he didn\u2019t find sufficient evidence of substantial impairment to Spears\u2019 capacity to make a rational choice regarding legal challenges.\u00a0 Given the findings of both experts, Kammer asked the judge at a hearing Wednesday to dismiss the petition and said lawyers would be standing by Wednesday evening with paperwork for Spears to sign if he changes his mind, according to a transcript.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Spears, there are people in your life who care about you. They want you in their life. They love you. Please don\u2019t let it end this way, sir. Please reconsider,\u201d Kammer told Spears in court, according to the transcript.\u00a0 When asked during the evaluation by Norman if he wanted to die, Spears said, \u201cNot really, but would you want to live in a six by nine cell. That\u2019s not living,\u201d according to the psychiatric evaluation report.\u00a0 When Norman asked about his refusal to pursue post-conviction appeals, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about another ten to fifteen years. I\u2019m not doing that. The process takes so long. It\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the death penalty. I have another twenty years of appeals,\u201d he said, adding that even if the court were to grant him life with parole it would take a long time and there\u2019s no assurance he\u2019d actually get out of prison.\u00a0 About 10 percent of executions are imposed on inmates who have voluntarily waived their appellate rights, though Spears would be the first such case in Georgia, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit critical of capital punishment\u2019s application that does not take an official stance on it.\u00a0 \u201cThese executions are always problematic because they are cases in which there has not been complete judicial review,\u201d Dunham said, adding that the types of errors that typically result in a death sentence being overturned frequently are unearthed in post-conviction proceedings when a new team of lawyers digs into the case.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "With bans of alt-right users, Twitter tests the limits of free speech Twitter logos Twitter has banned the accounts of several alt-right and white nationalist users. Twitter has banned the accounts of several alt-right and white nationalist users. (AFP/Getty Images) David Pierson and Paresh Dave Contact Reporters Twitter Inc. launched 10 years ago innocently enough with co-founder Jack Dorsey tweeting about having lunch and grabbing tea after yoga. Back then, there was no certainty the micro-blogging platform he designed would become anything more than an outlet for\u00a0sharing\u00a0daily minutiae. But with its core principle that little was too trivial,\u00a0or too outrageous,\u00a0to tweet, Twitter grew over the years into a vibrant and at times abrasive hub for news, ideas and opinions \u2014\u00a0a town square for the digital age.\u00a0 Now, in the aftermath of a bitterly divisive presidential campaign that has given license for hate groups and white nationalists to tout their ideas more openly, Twitter appears to be having second thoughts. Long criticized for allowing bullies, terrorists and bigots\u00a0to run rampant to the detriment of its own bottom line, Twitter made a surprising move Tuesday by banning a slew of accounts belonging to white nationalists and leaders of the alt-right movement \u2014 which holds that traditional conservatives don't sufficiently protect the interests of white people.\u00a0 The San Francisco company declined to comment or identify which accounts were banned, but sent The Times a statement reiterating its policies restricting hateful conduct that targets\u00a0people \u201con the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.\u201d Among recently banned Twitter users are Richard Spencer, head of the alt-right think tank National Policy Institute, and other alt-right leaders, including\u00a0Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers, according to news reports. A\u00a0source familiar with the situation who declined to be named commenting on a private matter shared\u00a0with The Times several of the offending tweets, among the least vulgar of which read:\u00a0\"You are a genocidal, sub-human.\u201d\u00a0It continued:\u00a0\u201cand feminism is cancer, you diseased whore.\" Social media apps have\u00a0become a free-speech battleground over the last five years\u00a0with the companies behind them struggling to figure out how to\u00a0rein in the very thing that makes them so appealing \u2014\u00a0the ability to speak freely, and in some cases\u00a0anonymously, to anyone who also has an account, including celebrities, world leaders and complete strangers. The anything-goes approach can benefit the firms. Moderating content takes time and money\u00a0and is seen as a potential risk to user growth. By largely staying out of the fray, companies also minimize the risk of wading into legal battles over libel or defamation. \u00a0 But with a massive backlash over harassment they are starting to walk this back. Policies continue to evolve as critics assail rules as stringent or too soft.\u00a0Mothers decry takedowns of their breast-feeding photos under anti-nudity policies. And U.S. officials complain not enough is being done to rid social media of\u00a0terrorists, who others might describe as religious activists. What\u2019s clear is the apps are powerful and that they retain significant policing control.\u00a0With nearly 1.8 billion users on Facebook and more than 300 million each on Twitter and Snapchat, the services give anyone the chance to instantly spread a message to millions of people without the need for special equipment or relationships. To keep their platforms havens for discussions, the companies maintain broad discretion to kill users\u2019 accounts whenever they choose. For example, Twitter\u2019s contract with users give it the right to \u201csuspend or terminate\u201d an account \u201cat any time for any or no reason.\u201d In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Spencer\u00a0denied he violated\u00a0Twitter\u2019s user agreement and called his ban a crackdown on free speech. \u201cIt's been a five-year run for me on Twitter,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIt's over. It was the main way I spoke out. They need to issue some kind of apology and make it clear they are not going to crack down on viewpoints. Are they going to now ban Donald Trump's account?\u201d Spencer said he did not engage in harassment, which\u00a0he conceded\u00a0alt-right commentator\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulous was guilty of when he was banned from Twitter in July for sending a string of\u00a0tweets attacking \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actress Leslie Jones. As a result, Spencer believes his 1st Amendment rights \u2014 which ensure freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly\u00a0and petition \u2014 are being violated by Twitter. The 1st Amendment prevents the government from enacting laws that violate free speech.It does not apply to companies \u2014 even ones like Twitter that have come to serve as virtual town halls where anything seems to go. Many an employee has been fired for sending an offensive tweet. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any obligation to have anyone use their technology they don\u2019t want,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s\u00a0Intelligence Project. \u201cWe honor the 1st Amendment as an idea. Only the government is allowed to restrict free speech.\u201d Beirich\u2019s group reported the account of Spencer and others for promoting white nationalist ideas and using Twitter to organize events for\u00a0\u201chate groups,\u201d according to\u00a0Keegan Hankes, managing data intelligence analyst at the center. Hankes pointed to Twitter posts like Spencer's from the day of this year's Super Bowl:\u00a0\"The criminally insane Africans from my geographic region shall defeat those from your metropolitan area!\" Free speech advocates said it was wrong for white nationalists to argue their rights had been violated. They say their discriminatory words work to chill the rights of others. \u201cIf your speech is so hostile or threatening or distressing to me that I go silent, then my freedom of expression has been impinged upon,\u201d said Susan Benesch, adjunct associate professor at American University and director of the Dangerous Speech Project. \u201cEven in the U.S., where we have the most speech protective law, some acts of speech are illegal.\u00a0Nobody has suggested that to fulfill freedom of expression every act of speech has to be allowed. It doesn\u2019t mean you can post absolutely anything.

In a presentation Steve Bannon gave during a conference at the Vatican in 2014, the Trump confidant ripped into big banks and their role in the 2008 financial crisis. Stephen Bannon is pictured during a round table with the Republican Leadership Initiative at Trump Tower. CARLO ALLEGRI / Reuters He rued that no one ever was held accountable, which he said helped fuel populist fury and groups like the tea party, according to a transcript of his remarks that Buzzfeed published Wednesday. Bannon ultimately would take the reins of the Trump campaign and will be the White House chief strategist when Trump is sworn in January 20. Bannon back then approached the issue of bailouts that accompanied the crisis with a religious zeal as he spoke with the Vatican as a backdrop: \"For Christians, and particularly for those who believe in the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian West, I don't believe that we should have a bailout. I think the bailouts in 2008 were wrong. And I think, you look in hindsight, it was a lot of misinformation that was presented about the bailouts of the banks in the West.\" The stock market generally and bank stocks in particular have been in strong rally mode since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton last week, though the market and bank shares pulled back Wednesday. However, the relationship could be strained between the president-elect and the financial community. At the conference, the former Goldman Sachs investment banker was asked about poverty and proceeded to riff on the role banks played: \"The 2008 crisis, I think the financial crisis \u2014 which, by the way, I don't think we've come through \u2014 is really driven I believe by the greed, much of it driven by the greed of the investment banks. My old firm, Goldman Sachs \u2014 traditionally the best banks are leveraged 8:1. When we had the financial crisis in 2008, the investment banks were leveraged 35:1.\" After diagnosing the conditions that led to the crisis, he talked about the fallout, or lack thereof, for the financial engineers who helped drive up risk and create the Great Recession but never really had to pay the price: \"Particularly the fact \u2014 think about it \u2014 not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. And in fact, it gets worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken. So part of the prime drivers of the wealth that they took in the 15 years leading up to the crisis was not hit at all, and I think that's one of the fuels of this populist revolt that we're seeing as the tea party. So I think there are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing, making them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real cleanup of the banks' balance sheets.\" The Republican Party raised eyebrows at its convention in July, a month before Bannon joined the Trump campaign, when it approved a plank to reinstitute the Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial and investment banking. Bannon advocated breaking up the financial supermarkets during his Vatican speech: \"In addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do: Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get away from this trading \u2014 you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they've all become basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and really grow businesses and to grow the economy.\" Big bankers and hedge funds, he said, \"have never really been held accountable for what they did [and that] has fueled much of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment or to challenge or validate Bannon's remarks.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Ahmad Khan Rahimi, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, has been indicted on eight federal counts. He is accused of bombings and other crimes in New York and New Jersey in September. AP A New Jersey man, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, has been indicted on eight federal criminal charges related to bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey earlier this year. According to federal prosecutors, the 28-year-old Afghan-born U.S. citizen was inspired by international terrorists , including al-Qaida. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, \"Prosecutors say he detonated a bomb in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in September that injured 30 people. He is also charged with planting a second bomb in Manhattan that did not explode, and a pipe bomb that did explode along the course of a Marine Corps charity race at the Jersey Shore but did not injure anyone. \"Rahimi was arrested days later in Linden, N.J., after a police shootout. He remained in New Jersey recovering from gunshot wounds until last week, when he made his first appearance in federal court in New York.\" If convicted of all federal counts, Rahimi faces a mandatory life sentence in prison. Joel notes that Rahimi is expected to plead not guilty. The charges against Rahimi include the use and the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, the interstate transportation and receipt of explosives, and the bombing of a place of public use. Article continues after sponsorship According to the Associated Press , Rahimi also is facing 30 counts in New Jersey state court in connection with the Sept. 19 shootout, including attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. Those charges could result in another life sentence if he is convicted. Rahimi's arraignment on those counts was held via video conference between a state courthouse and his Newark hospital bed in October . In his court appearance last Thursday in Manhattan, Rahimi's lawyer, David E. Patton, a federal public defender, questioned whether the defendant can receive proper medical care in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. ",

She was wearing a pink shirt with spaghetti straps, blue sweat pants with a Winnie the Pooh\u00a0logo and a jacket with a medical insignia. Police searched her apartment at the time and gathered physical evidence that led them to suspect foul play, according to Zabel. Police \u201cdo not believe she left of her own free will,\u201d Zabel said. Zabel said investigators have received several phone calls in the past 16 years suggesting\u00a0Rojas had been killed. Detectives searched for her remains in multiple locations based on those tips with no success. Detectives are confident, however, that the Ridgecrest location where they plan to conduct an excavation Thursday\u00a0will lead them to Rojas\u2019 remains. NecroSearch, a Colorado-based company that specializes in locating clandestine graves and evidence recovery, examined the area using satellite images and discovered \u201ctopographical inconsistencies,\u201d police said. Cadaver dogs from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department homicide unit searched the area and showed interest in one of thelocations pinpointed by NecroSearch\u2019s efforts, according to police. The dogs are trained to locate cadavers that are more than 10 years old. Zabel would not say exactly where the remains might be located, but a police spokeswoman described it as a \u201cdesert area.\u201d Still, even if police recover Rojas\u2019 body, they are still a long way from figuring out how and why she wound up there. After waiting years for justice, Rojas\u2019 relatives are hoping the public can help finally bring their nightmare to an end. \u201cIf there is anyone out there with any information, anything, please help my family find closure,\u201d said Solomon Cortez, Rojas\u2019 brother.

The latest report from the Commonwealth Fund, which routinely points to the shortcomings of the U.S. healthcare system, shows not much has changed in 15 years or longer. Americans still pay far more for medical care than people in other rich Western nations but have little to show for all that spending. Play Most US children do not meet standards for cardiovascular health 0:26 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161116224332if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/743197251929\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The group surveyed 26,863 adults from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. It found 43 percent of low-income Americans went without medical care because of costs. In the other countries, these rates ranged from 8 percent in Britain to 31 percent in Switzerland. \"In comparison to adults in the other 10 countries, adults in the United States are sicker and more economically disadvantaged,\" the report reads. \"The United States trailed other countries in making health care affordable and ranked poorly on providing timely access to medical care (except specialist care),\" the report reads. \"Problems were often particularly acute for low-income adults.\" Yet Americans now spend $9,523 per person a year on medical expenses \u2014 by far the most among developed countries. Health spending now tops $3 trillion a year. Health insurance premiums have been steadily rising since 2008 and employers, who cover 60 percent of Americans, have been increasing the amount their workers must contribute to their own medical care. Related: Health Spending Goes Up Again in U.S. \"The U.S. spends more on health care than any other country, but what we get for these significant resources falls short in terms of access to care, affordability, and coordination,\" said Commonwealth Fund President Dr. David Blumenthal. \"We can learn from what is working in other nations. If we're going to do better for our patients, we need to create a health care system that addresses the needs of everyone, especially our sickest patients, and those who struggle to make ends meet.\" \"If we're going to do better for our patients, we need to create a health care system that addresses the needs of everyone, especially our sickest patients, and those who struggle to make ends meet.\" The weaknesses predate the 2010 Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. It was President Barack Obama's signature legislation, but was from the beginning a compromise, broadly rejected by Republicans in Congress and criticized by liberals who wanted a single-payer system. The law was meant to gradually lower health care costs by first getting more Americans health insurance so they could get chronic health conditions taken care of. It's gotten an estimated 20 million more covered, bringing the rate of people without health insurance down from 15 percent to under 9 percent now. The report says it's only begun, but president-elect Donald Trump has promised to either repeal or significantly reform it. Related: Trump Health Plan Would Raise Costs, Report Finds \"The major coverage expansions of the law were launched only in 2014 and are thus still in a ramping-up period,\" the report reads. \"In addition, there are ongoing barriers to coverage, including the fact that\u2014as of November 2016\u201419 states have not chosen to expand eligibility for their Medicaid programs, the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from both Marketplace and Medicaid coverage, low awareness of coverage options, and concerns about affordability among those who remain uninsured,\" it adds. \"An estimated 23 million adults in the United States lack health insurance, while the other countries in our survey have universal coverage.\" Graph showing cost-related access barriers in the past year. The report finds Americans are more likely than people in other countries to have more than one chronic condition such as arthritis, heart disease, asthma, high blood pressure or diabetes. It found 28 percent of Americans have multiple chronic conditions, compared to 14 percent in Britain and the Netherlands, 18 percent in France and 22 percent in Canada. The Commonwealth Fund says its research consistently finds that providing high-quality, well-coordinated and inexpensive health coverage translates to better health overall. \"The hallmark of these other countries in these surveys is that everyone has health insurance.\" \"For example, the health care systems in Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have no deductibles or cost sharing for primary care; the French system exempts low-income adults and those with chronic illnesses from cost sharing; and out of-pocket spending is capped at 1 percent of income for the chronically ill in Germany and at US $123 annually in Sweden,\" it says. Related: Health Insurance Premiums Have Been Growing Since 2008 The group's Sara Collins said if Americans continue to get better access to health insurance, their health should start to improve. \"It's really too early to know whether and how and which part of the law the new administration might address in the coming months,\" she told reporters. \"The hallmark of these other countries in these surveys is that everyone has health insurance.\" Play ",

    "text": "AP November 16, 2016, 4:18 PM Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio replacement Paul Penzone facing tough and odd choices In this Nov. 8, 2016, file photo, then-Democratic Maricopa County sheriff candidate Paul Penzone speaks to supporters during an election party in Phoenix. AP Photo/Matt York Email PHOENIX - Sheriff Joe Arpaio grabbed headlines and became a national political figure with his unorthodox and divisive approach to policing - jailing inmates in tents, making them wear pink underwear, leading crackdowns on illegal immigration and investigating President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Arizona county sheriff Joe Arpaio has built a reputation as the self-proclaimed \"toughest sheriff in America,\" with controversial prison policies... Last Tuesday\u2019s defeat of the longtime sheriff of metro Phoenix raises questions about whether his successor, Paul Penzone, will keep the contentious practices and how he will overhaul an agency that has been criticized for targeting immigrants, creating a culture of cruelty in its jails and serving as self-promotion for Arpaio. The retired Phoenix police sergeant will take office in January amid national uncertainty over the status of immigrants and fear within the Latino community since Donald Trump won the presidency. Penzone said he will cut off Arpaio\u2019s investigation into Obama\u2019s birth certificate and eliminate practices that he regards as Arpaio publicity stunts. But he is interested in keeping some of Arpaio\u2019s signature methods, such as using posse volunteers who help out in sheriff\u2019s operations to free up officers for police work. Here are some of the challenges that Penzone faces when he takes office: JAILS Early in his two-decade tenure, Arpaio became popular with voters for jailing inmates in outdoor military tents amid Phoenix\u2019s triple-digit summer heat, making them wear pink underwear and using them to work on old-time chain gangs. Prisoners at the Tent City prison camp are reportedly fed twice a day, sleeping in tents lacking air conditioning despite Arizona's blazing temperatures. At one point, Arpaio issued striped prison uniforms and pink underwear and socks. The camp, pictured here in 1997, was Arpaio's response to overcrowding that was resulting in early release for some inmates and continues to operate. Jean-Loup Sense/AFP/Getty Images The tough conditions appealed to those who believed, as he did, that jail should not be comfortable. Penzone said he will eliminate the pink underwear, which he calls a ploy lacking value to taxpayers. \u201cThat\u2019s the sheriff\u2019s brand,\u201d Penzone said of Arpaio. \u201cThat\u2019s not about law enforcement.\u201d He said he is willing to close the Tent City jail but is reserving judgment until he can make a full evaluation. Penzone plans to dramatically scale back the chain gangs by only using them in places such as parks. IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWNS Penzone has no plans to restart the immigration crackdowns that made Arpaio a key figure in the country\u2019s border debate. Even if the incoming sheriff wanted to bring them back, the courts have barred the agency from immigration enforcement. Still, Penzone will be living with that legacy from Arpaio for years. Arpaio dragged his feet in complying with court orders to stop the patrols that a judge determined racially profiled Latinos, increasing the costs to taxpayers. The financial hemorrhaging is likely to continue until the sheriff\u2019s office comes in full compliance for three straight years. The case also led to a criminal contempt-of-court charge for Arpaio two weeks for Election Day, and he still faces possible jail time if convicted. Penzone said ending court oversight of the agency and controlling taxpayer costs are his priorities. The case is projected to cost taxpayers $72 million by next summer. MISCONDUCT After a court order, the sheriff\u2019s office is overhauling its internal investigations into officer misconduct . The judge in the profiling case said Arpaio\u2019s internal investigations were fraught with biased decision-making and had been manipulated to shield officials from accountability. The judge has ordered new investigations into allegations that Arpaio\u2019s officers regularly pocketed items in traffic stops and safe-house busts. The agency\u2019s former head of internal affairs is under federal investigation on suspicion of concealing nearly 1,500 IDs. REBUILDING TRUST Perhaps the most difficult challenge Penzone faces is restoring the Latino community\u2019s trust in the sheriff\u2019s office. The relationship was damaged by the dozens of Arpaio\u2019s immigration crackdowns over the years, leading some Latinos who witnessed crimes to avoid cooperating with police. The incoming sheriff said he will rebuild trust by establishing a culture of professionalism, meeting expectations on how the agency should operate and relieving taxpayers of their unnecessary financial burdens from the racial profiling case. Penzone said he was not worried about a backlash if he reverses Arpaio\u2019s policies. \u201cYou can be efficient, you can be ethical, you can be professional and still be strong on crime,\u201d he said. Arpaio said he doesn\u2019t mind if Penzone decides to undo his signature practices. The voters made a decision and he will accept it. \u201cIf someone else wants a change, it doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d Arpaio said. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media following a City Council meeting at City Hall in Chicago on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday said he doesn't think Republican President-elect Donald Trump will cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities, the latest salvo in the mayor's post-election defense of immigrants here without permission against possible deportation by the incoming White House . \"I don't believe they'll do it, because that would mean every major city in the United States would be targeted, and that's not what an administration will do,\" Emanuel said after a City Council meeting. \"When you're in the White House, it is incoming,\" said Emanuel, who worked in the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"When they look at all the things they want to get done and all the battles that will be coming \u2014 whether the battles they initiate and the ones that come to them \u2014 they will make a choice that this is not the battle they want to take on because they have bigger fish to fry, mark my words.\" Trump has pledged to deport millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. The Justice Department released a memo in May saying Chicago could stand to lose nearly $29 million in annual justice grants if found to be in violation of federal laws on detaining people to be turned over for possible deportation. On Wednesday, the mayor declined to say what he would do if Trump takes away that money, calling it a hypothetical that wouldn't happen.

Bruce Rauner to do the same for Illinois. The mayor has taken several opportunities since Trump's Nov. 8 election to reiterate his support for Chicago's large immigrant community, and he did so again Wednesday, hanging around in council chambers after his budget passed to make comments about the symbolic resolution. During the 40-minute council debate on the resolution \u2014 a discussion that lasted much longer than the brief consideration of Emanuel's $8.2 billion 2017 budget package \u2014 the mayor choked up as he recalled the display in his childhood home of his grandmother's passport from when she immigrated to America alongside photos of relatives who didn't make it.

Rahm Emanuel is running for re-election as mayor of Chicago and he's doing it nimbly, with stunts and tricks. He's scrambling to outpace his critics on the angry left by cleaving to Latinos and picking a fight with President-elect Donald Trump over \"sanctuary cities.\" And there was that oh-so-syrupy... (John Kass) \"And it was to remind (my brothers and me) why we were here, why we were fortunate, and why we could not waste our time in this great city and this great country,\" he said. \"And that we needed to do something to honor those eyes that looked upon us, to honor my grandmother and my grandfather who came here.\" And the mayor said Chicago is standing up for immigrants to stop hate speech and anti-immigrant positions, such as those espoused by some Trump supporters, from becoming acceptable. \"We are normalizing a language and a view, that's why this resolution is important,\" Emanuel said. \"Yes, to reaffirm to the children and their families and their parents 'You're safe.' But to stand up for a set of values that does not normalize a sense of identification that 'You are that ... (you are) other.'\" In other City Council business Wednesday, aldermen passed an ordinance prohibiting child sex offenders from spending time in parts of city libraries used for programs for teens or children, unless accompanied by their own children. Violators face expulsion from libraries or arrest, and fines between $500 and $1,000. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com Twitter @_johnbyrne Immigrants' rights advocates speak at a news conference to discuss expanding mental health services for those fearful that Donald\u00a0Trump will deport them or their families when he is sworn in as president.

Now, Climate scientists, policymakers and diplomats are questioning how his presidency will shape the future of climate change policy. Time China is reminding the\u00a0president-elect of the United States that they didn't make up global warming, really. China\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told reporters that Trump\u2019s previous claims that the country had created global warming to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive simply couldn\u2019t be true because other Republican presidents worked on climate negotiations. \u201cIf you look at the history of climate change negotiations, actually it was initiated by the IPCC with the support of the Republicans during the Reagan and senior Bush administration during the late 1980s,\u201d Liu said according to a Bloomberg story published Wednesday. In 2012, Trump tweeted that the concept was fictionalized by the Chinese. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 Trump called this claim a \"joke\" during a January appearance on Fox & Friends after Sen. Bernie Sanders pointed out the 2012 tweet but he quickly added that, \"this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\" China's role aside, Trump also called climate change and global warming a \"hoax\" in a flurry of tweets in January, 2014. NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2014 Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014 Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014 Trump frequently criticized China\u2019s trade practices during the campaign but Sunday night he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping via telephone. According to the Trump team the two \u201cestablished a clear sense of mutual respect for one another.\u201d ",

To be clear, at any given time, between 10 and 13 people live with Kenneth Shakespeare. \"I sleep in with my mom and dad where, um, they're in that room with the bunk bed and stuff,\" Taya Dixey, Lynell's 8-year-old granddaughter says. Lynell says it would be nice if Taya's family could move into a trailer now sitting on the property, but says that means paying $6,000 to install electricity, which is money they don't have. One of Lynell's daughters is on the waiting list for low-cost tribal housing, but has been waiting for two years. Lynell says, anyways, the family prefers to live together and take care of their elder. Article continues after sponsorship \"We don't want to go to housing,\" she says. \"We can stack up here.\" Patrick Goggles, who serves as Northern Arapaho Tribal Housing director, says Lynell and her family's preference to stay together is not uncommon. \"We find that a cultural value that enhances our family life,\" Goggles says. Oregon Occupation Unites Native American Tribes To Save Their Land He says a high birthrate has led to a population explosion and that traditional lifestyle is now strained. The tribe has grown to 11,000 people, but if they want to stay with family on the reservation, they have to cram into one of only 230 homes. \"In the business I'm in you never have all the funds or resources you need,\" Goggles says. Goggles says 600 more homes need to be built, but he has to use the funds he has to keep the limited housing livable. Heidi Frechette works for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Native American Program. She says Congress hasn't made sure funding has kept up with inflation over the years, or with the growing tribes. \"We're finding that folks are using more and more of their funds to rehab or repair existing homes and have less buying power and ability to construct new homes,\" Frechette says. More than 55 percent of the Northern Arapaho tribe can now be categorized as homeless because they're couch surfing. Tribal administrator Vonda Wells says that kind of overcrowding hurts families. \"People get stressed and...things happen...violence happens,\" Wells says. And she says with more domestic violence comes chronic illness such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. These living environments are especially hard on the kids. Wells says there is one boy she knows who sleeps on a bench every night. On Columbus Day, A Look At The Myth That 'All The Real Indians Died Off' \"Your body is sore,\" Wells says. \"And then sending this child to school. And then, him trying to learn, trying to think about what his teacher's telling him and he's exhausted.\" With these problems in mind, tribal leaders have been brainstorming ways to eliminate overcrowding without giving up on multigenerational living and possibly building homes to accommodate extended families with lots of bedrooms and bathrooms, and big living rooms for hosting ceremonies. For the Shakespeare family, a roomy kitchen would be great. \"Oh, is this the elk meat, Jojo?\" Lynell asks. The family has gathered to cut and dry an elk brought in from a recent hunting trip. They say, until more homes are built, they'll keep living in a traditional lifestyle, even if it is crowded. ",

Critics of Twitter's ban on alt-right users say it could backfire and fan their activity. (Photo: AP Photo/Richard Drew) SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter's move to ban alt-right accounts on the heels of a bitterly divisive election has drawn the company\u00a0into a heated debate over who gets to speak freely on its platform. Critics warn\u00a0the mass ban could backfire. Rather than silencing the alt right, Twitter\u00a0risks amplifying the message from white nationalists and other fringe groups. When reached by phone, Matthew Heimbach was practically ebullient\u00a0about Twitter's purge of alt-right accounts. In 2015, Heimbach founded the Traditionalist Worker Party, a political party of white separatists who want different homelands inside the U.S. for whites and blacks. Twitter suspends alt-right accounts \"The more the system tries to make the ideas of nationalism taboo, the more people are going to be interested and seek them out,\" he said. \"It's helping us propagate our message every time they try very clumsily to shut us down.\" For years, Twitter billed itself as the \"free speech wing of the free speech party.\" But it's been under growing public pressure over its failure to stop hate speech, including the targeting of actress Leslie Jones by racists. The alt right gained prominence during the presidential election for using social media to spread its ideology through racist viral memes and anonymous attacks on users from pro-Donald Trump accounts . On Tuesday Twitter\u00a0 banned the accounts of prominent members of the alt-right .\u00a0The move put\u00a0the social media service in the dicey position of deciding what is acceptable speech and what is not. Twitter headquarters in San Francisco \u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Twitter's\u00a0head of safety, Del Harvey,\u00a0 told USA TODAY this week that\u00a0Twitter is drawing a hard line between free speech and\u00a0\"behavior that is intended to silence others.\" The first target: the alt-right movement, a loosely organized group that includes individuals\u00a0who dream of a white \"ethno-state.\" Heimbach's account was not suspended but he says he was warned by Twitter on Wednesday that some of his tweets violated the company's\u00a0terms of service and was told to delete them. White nationalists leveled allegations\u00a0of one-sided\u00a0censorship against Twitter\u00a0on Wednesday. The lack of transparency into why Twitter suspended the\u00a0accounts in question, such as that of alt-right leader Richard Spencer, fueled perception in some quarters that Twitter is arbitrarily stifling speech. Spencer, who coined the term alt right in 2010,\u00a0says he was tossed from Twitter for\u00a0his political views \u2014 he wants to segregate the\u00a0United States by racial groups \u2014 not for\u00a0harassing Twitter users. In a statement, Twitter said: \"The Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies.\" Twitter says it's cracking down on hate speech As a private company, Twitter has no obligation to provide a forum for white nationalist views and is subject only to non-discrimination laws, said George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center. \"The First Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights that protects the individual from government. It doesn't protect the individual from private companies. A company is free to do really whatever it wants,\" Freeman said. \"There really are no speech rights accorded to the public that uses the private company. Twitter\u00a0is\u00a0perfectly within its\u00a0legal rights.\" Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com, a libertarian website, says he believes Twitter blundered in shutting down alt-right accounts. Instead of restricting speech and denying the alt right a platform, Twitter should give individual users\u00a0greater power to regulate what they see and don't see on the service, he said. \"Why cede any kind of magical powers to the stupidity of the alt right? Let them say what they want to say in public and be rebuffed or be ignored,\" Gillespie said. \"You are not helping to combat it by walling it off and saying it's so repugnant that individual users can't block them if they want, can't mute them or engage them if they want.\" ",

    "text": "Email OREM, Utah --\u00a0High school junior Karen Martinez was arriving for her first class when she saw three boys run from a locker room toward the school\u2019s central office, one with a head wound and another with a neck injury. One had blood running down the back of his shirt. Inside the locker room, police say, a 16-year-old straight-A student with no record of disciplinary trouble had attacked his classmates at Mountain View High School with a knife as they changed into their gym clothes. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d said Martinez, her eyes filled with tears. \u201cIt was so terrifying. I didn\u2019t know any of the kids but still it was like an awful feeling to see all those kids getting hurt.\u201d Police respond to Mountain View High School in Orem, Utah Nov. 15, 2016 KUTV On Wednesday, authorities released chilling 911 recordings about the attack a day earlier, with callers to police pleading for help. One caller told dispatchers: \u201cThere\u2019s someone at Mountain View killing people! He\u2019s stabbing people! He\u2019s stabbing people!\u201d In another call, a woman said a boy was in the school\u2019s attendance office with stab wounds to his neck and that another victim was on the way. \u201cWe just need some help,\u201d she said. Police say the suspect, a sophomore in his first year at the high school after being home-schooled, also stabbed himself in the neck. He was cornered Tuesday by school workers until a police officer assigned to the school got to the locker room and subdued him with a Taser shot. Authorities did not identify the suspect by name because of his age. The five victims are all expected to survive, hospital officials said. The two most seriously injured were in critical but stable condition, according to Utah Valley Hospital. The attack spread fear and panic among students who described a gruesome scene immediately after the stabbings. Police said the knife used in the attack had a 3-inch blade. Orem police posted a letter online they said was from the parents of the teen, apologizing. They said none of the victims had done anything to hurt their son and the stabbings were not racially or ethnically motivated. \u201cWe are at a loss to express how deeply sorry we are for the pain and injury caused,\u201d the letter says. Police said it appears the victims weren\u2019t singled out for any reason other than being nearby when the attack started. School district spokeswoman Kimberly Bird said there were no indications the suspect was having problems or being bullied, she said. Investigators are talking to students who witnessed the attack and who knew the suspect as they try to determine a motive, said Gary Giles, the police chief in the city of Orem about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City where the attack happened. \u2014 Orem Police Dept. (@OremDPS) November 15, 2016 \u201cIs it a fight? Is it somebody who is upset with somebody? Is there more to it than that?\u201d Giles said. \u201cI don\u2019t have those answers.\u201d Student Paxton Ransom was in the locker room when it happened. He saw blood on the floor and thought it was fake until he looked around the corner and saw someone on the ground who had been stabbed. He ran away and hid with other students in the school\u2019s weight room, texting his mother \u201cThere\u2019s been a stabbing but I\u2019m ok.\u201d She joined hundreds of parents who rushed to the school to find out if their children were safe, letting him go back to classes after giving him a hug. The school, with 1,300 students, was put on lockdown after the stabbings for about an hour until police determined there was no danger for students. Some parents took their children home and others allowed them to finish the school day. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert\u2019s children attended the school years ago, and he tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s a community close to our hearts. My prayers are with the students and staff.\u201d The school plans to investigate if the suspect had had been acting in a way that should have been addressed by school officials prior to the attack, Bird said. The school bans weapons but doesn\u2019t have metal detectors or other security procedures to check students each day, she said. It\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll implement any of those now, either, because they don\u2019t want to make the school feel like a prison, Bird said. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Netherlands Institute of Military History hide caption toggle caption Netherlands Institute of Military History HNLMS De Ruyter before it sank in 1942. Netherlands Institute of Military History Three Dutch shipwrecks dating back to World War II have mysteriously disappeared from the sea floor, Dutch defense officials say. The three warships were sunk by the Japanese during the 1942 Battle of the Java Sea, near the coast of Indonesia. In 2002, amateur divers found the wreckage, where 900 Dutch and 250 Indonesian-Dutch soldiers are buried. A team of divers recently went down to shoot footage of the wrecks prior to the 75th anniversary of the deadly battle, Dutch Navy spokesperson Paul Middelberg tells The Two-Way. \"They dived for the wrecks to find that the wrecks were gone,\" he says. Using sonar, the divers were able to see the imprints of the missing ships on the sea floor. The remains of HNLMS De Ruyter and HNLMS Java are completely gone, the Defense Ministry says , while a large portion of the HNLMS Kortenaer is missing. The ministry says that as the final resting places of soldiers killed in battle, they are seen as war graves and desecrating them is a serious offense. Article continues after sponsorship Wreck Of Legendary Spanish Galleon Is Finally Found, Colombia Says An investigation is trying to solve the mystery of why the wrecks disappeared, Middelberg says. He declined to speculate out of respect for the families of the dead. \"We don't want to give misinformation or half information,\" he adds. \"We want to find out what happened and come out with that message.\" This comes on the same day The Guardian reported that the wrecks of three British ships and a U.S. submarine in the same area have been \"destroyed by illegal scrap metal scavengers.\" The newspaper says it was able to obtain 3D maps of the seabed, which show large holes where the ships used to be. \"The commercial salvaging of war wrecks has caused significant upset among veterans, historians and governments who want to preserve the final resting place of sailors who went down with their ships,\" the Guardian adds. Ship That Vanished 95 Years Ago Is Found Could the Dutch ships also have been salvaged? According to the BBC , experts say the Dutch ships were 60 miles off the Indonesian coast and 70 meters underwater. \"It is impossible to salvage this,\" one salvage operator told the BBC, \"It is far too deep.\" And \"experts say the operation would have needed large cranes for long periods of time and would be unlikely to have gone unnoticed,\" the broadcaster adds. Indonesian authorities also seem puzzled: Navy spokesman Gig Sipasulta told the BBC that \"to say that the wreckage had gone suddenly, doesn't make sense.\" The February 1942 battle was a major defeat for the Dutch, U.S., British and Australian navies against Japan, which led to Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, or what is now Indonesia.

Since 2013, the DWP has been plagued by a faulty computer billing system. (Richard Vogel / Associated Press) The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power owes its customers at least $67.5 million in refunds and credits after the utility overbilled them, an independent monitor has concluded. The latest estimate represents a significant increase from the proposed $44-million class-action settlement announced in August 2015. The DWP has been plagued by a faulty computer billing system launched in 2013\u00a0that overcharged tens of thousands of customers while failing to bill others at all.\u00a0 Officials said this week that after a year of working with the independent monitor and revising the settlement agreement, customers can expect to get refunds as early next summer. Under the terms of the settlement, DWP will refund customers 100% of the amount they are owed, officials said. Customers can also file claims for reimbursement if they disagree with the refund amount. Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the nation\u2019s largest public utilities. The tally for Measure RRR as of Wednesday afternoon was 52% against and 48% in favor, with 100% of precincts... Voters appear\u00a0to have rejected a ballot measure aimed at granting more autonomy to the scandal-plagued Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , one of the nation\u2019s largest public utilities. The tally for Measure RRR as of Wednesday afternoon was 52% against and 48% in favor, with 100% of precincts... (Jack Dolan) The $67.5-million estimate is \u201ca floor,\u201d said Tom Merriman, an attorney with Landskroner Grieco Merriman, the law firm representing the ratepayers. He said his team expects \u201cthe\u00a0total value of the settlement to go up,\u201d in part because ratepayers have the right to make claims for \u201cconsequential damages\u201d stemming from the billing debacle, such as if a check bounced or if a customer unnecessarily hired a plumber.\u00a0 Both the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and DWP officials said they hope the court will grant preliminary approval to the revised settlement at a hearing Friday. If the court OKs the settlement, customers affected by the overbilling will receive letters detailing how much money they are owed within 90 business days, Merriman said. The $23-million increase brings the total estimated value of the settlement to about $90 million, according to court documents. The agreement requires LADWP to spend about $20 million\u00a0\u201cto remediate and stabilize\u201d its billing system. Not everyone is satisfied.\u00a0 Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said ratepayers have been waiting years to get refunds and still don\u2019t have a clear sense of what went wrong with\u00a0the billing system.\u00a0 Plaintiffs will ask the court to award attorneys up to $19 million \u2014 a $6-million increase from a previous version of the agreement \u2014\u00a0while the independent monitor can be reimbursed as much as $2.5 million, according to court documents. Those fees would be added to the $90 million already allocated by the settlement. But Court deems those\u00a0fees excessive. The lawyers in this case, he said, are \u201ccreating a very large \u2026 bill to enrich themselves.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAny extra money should be given to the ratepayers as interest on the three years of waiting,\u201d he said. Merriman, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, said\u00a0the judge will decide on the level of fees, and they may not total the maximum allowance. The flawed customer billing system was designed and implemented by PricewaterhouseCoopers , according to the DWP. In a statement, the nation\u2019s largest public utility said it has partnered with the city of Los Angeles and continues to \u201cpursue full repayment by PwC of \u2026 damages\u201d through separate litigation.\u00a0 City and utility officials have alleged\u00a0that the consulting firm misrepresented how it could help launch the\u00a0DWP's\u00a0system. The firm's initial contract with the city was $60 million; it was later increased by $9.2 million. Earlier this summer, attorneys for the city accused senior managers at PricewaterhouseCoopers of inflating their time records to earn additional payments and spending that money on liquor and prostitutes in Las Vegas. Representatives for the firm deny any wrongdoing and have called the original lawsuit \u201cmeritless.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Northern Californians who voted for Trump feel forgotten by the state , Megyn Kelly's new book took a new turn due to the elections , Twitter is trying to clean up , and the Crystal Cathederal is getting a new look.

    "text": "Democrats Sends Letter to Bankers Slamming Trump Picking Steve Bannon for Top Job By MaryAlice Parks Nov 16, 2016, 7:22 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Steve Bannon: In a Minute 0 Shares Email Top Democrats sent a letter Wednesday to banking industry leaders encouraging them to condemn and speak out against Donald Trump \u2019s decision to name former conservative news leader Steve Bannon the administration's chief strategist. \u201cAs leaders in the business community, you have a moral obligation to speak out against this appointment as contrary to the values of this country and to the values of your industry. We urge you to condemn this appointment immediately and without reservation,\u201d the letter reads. The note signed by some heavy hitters on Capitol Hill , including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who is known for her tough, critical stance when it comes to banking regulation and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota), who is favored to be the next chair of the DNC. The letter lists several controversial headlines from Breitbart News , an organization Bannon used to run and accuses him of promoting prejudice and bigotry through his writings and opinions. \u201cThis moment is a test of the moral leadership of the banking and finance industry\u2026. If you fail to speak up now it will only empower the Trump Administration to go further down this dangerous path,\u201d the letter continues. The letter was addressed to several CEOs, including the head of the National Association of Credit Unions , the Mortgage Bankers Association , and the American Bankers Association . Earlier in the day, another group of 169 Democrat Members of Congress signed and sent an additional letter to Trump himself, calling on him to rescind Bannon\u2019s appointment. That letter was organized by Rep. David Cicilline (D-Rhode Island), who told ABC News during an interview Wednesday that he was disappointed his Republican colleague had not spoken out. So far Republicans have steered cleared of addressing the issue. \u201cThis is a person who does not belong inside the White House. He will further divide this country,\u201d Cicilline said. He cited the uptick in racially charged acts of violence and intimidation around the country and said there were \u201creal consequences\u201d to Trump legitimizing some of the rhetoric that appears on Breitbart. A number of members of the Trump team have jumped to Bannon's defense, including newly minted Chief of Staff Reince Priebus , who called him a \"very, very smart person.\" \"I don't know where they're coming from,\" Priebus said on \" Good Morning America \" of Bannon's critics. \"That's not the Steve Bannon that I know.\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also came to Bannon's defense. \"I see where the outrage is and that doesn't surprise me. Same people who are trying to get past the election results,\" she said in Washington, DC recently. \"Steve Bannon is a Georgetown Harvard MBA grad, a former naval officer, a former Goldman Sachs vice president and really the general, the field general in our successful campaign effort -- a brilliant tactician and serves president elect Donald Trump very well.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Inside Donald Trump's Fraught Relationship With the Press By Alexander Mallin Nov 16, 2016, 6:41 PM ET 0 Shares Star Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump at the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, N.H., June 13, 2016. 0 Shares Email If anything has become apparent over the past week since Donald Trump won the presidency, it's that he has no qualms carrying on his fraught relationship with the press. Trump has taunted The New York Times on Twitter and targeted Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after the first GOP presidential primary debate. In her new memoir, \"Settle for More,\" Kelly alleges that Trump complained about her to then-Fox Chairman Roger Ailes . She called Trump \"vindictive\" and said there was \"no question\" that he is \"thin-skinned\" and \"can be mean-spirited.\" \"It definitely posed challenges when he was coming at me so relentlessly and causing security issues in my life and the life of my family, but I did it,\" Kelly, 45, said this morning on \" Good Morning America .\" \"It was a test of me as a person and a professional.\" Trump has also shown an apparent disregard for press protocol. He sneaked out of Trump Tower for a steak dinner last night without alerting the reporters covering the president-elect. That was the second time since Nov. 9 that the press was unaware of the president-elect's location. The move elicited a letter from 15 different press freedom groups calling on Trump to \"commit to a protective press pool from now until the final day of your presidency.\" Here's what to know about Trump's complicated relationship with the press and why it matters when he officially becomes the nation's 45th president. If History Tells Us Anything Throughout his campaign, Trump hardly went a day without railing against what he described as the \"dishonest\" and \"disgusting\" media following his team across the country. He would target specific reporters in attendance at his rallies, and whip up anger among the crowd by claiming that the media never reported the high levels of attendance at his events, although the media often did. He often repeated this claim without mentioning that his aides had prohibited a \"cuts\" camera that outlets request from campaigns in order to show crowds. This past winter, Trump openly threatened to \"open up our libel laws\" as president so it would become easier to sue news organizations that published or broadcast stories he believed were false. In June, the relationship between Trump and the press had become so toxic that he had banned The Washington Post and nearly 12 other news organizations from having access to his rallies. That ban wasn't lifted until early September, reportedly at the urging of his running mate Mike Pence. But the media also didn't escape scorn from Trump's primary opponents. His outsider status and controversial remarks and actions often received the brunt of attention across cable networks, leading to allegations of \"free advertising\" from his GOP opponents who claimed this legitimized Trump's candidacy. Why Reporting a Steak Dinner Matters Twice in the past week the American people were in the dark about the whereabouts of the next president of the United States. Once reporters yesterday observed a large motorcade departing Trump Tower -- the first movement by Trump from his New York City skyscraper since last Thursday -- the media began speculating whether Trump was going out to dinner, seeing a Broadway show, or potentially experiencing a medical episode. \"The worst-case scenario, of course, is a national security emergency or a threat on the president's life,\" said David Uberti, a staff writer for the Columbia Journalism Review in explaining the role of \"protective pools,\" the small group of journalists assigned with closely covering the president and relaying all of his movements. \"Journalists in the protective pool can transmit information to the public on the president's health, whereabouts, or immediate reactions, all of which can instantly shape public opinion or market reactions in a time of potential crisis.\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks had originally told members of the press that Trump had no plans of leaving his compound that evening. She assured reporters following the incident that they would be given proper access once a president-elect pool had been officially organized. The White House Correspondents' Association released a statement Wednesday calling it \"unacceptable\" for Trump's team to not include the press pool in his traveling motorcade. In the letter from press freedom groups, the leaders noted that \"the idea of a press pool that covers all of the president's movements is one that dates back to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration.\" President Obama received similar criticism in April 2010 after breaking protocol by leaving the press pool at the White House as he went to attend one of his daughter's soccer games. What the White House Press Corps Can Expect With any transition to a new administration, there is always a period of adjustment for both the new White House press office and reporters demanding as much access as possible to cover the incoming president. But there's a general anxiety among many reporters that access to Trump may be restricted. \"A protective press pool is a norm, not a legal obligation, so the Trump administration is not required to abide by it,\" Uberti said. \"The best way for journalists to put pressure on him in this regard is to actively explain why this tradition is important for their audience \u2014 that is, the public \u2014 in the hope that they also push back.\" That anxiety will likely not be eased based on the past behavior of Trump and the team of surrogates he has surrounded himself with, nearly all of whom have portrayed themselves as victims of a dishonest mainstream media. The most recent example is Trump's recent appointment of Stephen Bannon as his senior counselor and his previous role as executive chairman of the far-right website Breitbart, which distinguished itself throughout the campaign with favorable reporting toward Trump and what some criticized as misleading or wrong articles about his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Whether Trump and his family will accept the probing nature of the White House press corps once they take up residence remains to be seen. Trump told CNN in June that while he would not revoke credentials from reporters as president, he would also not be shy in pointing out errors where he saw them. If his recent Twitter feed is any indication, the president-elect is sticking to his word about responding to the media. The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. ",

J. Scott Applewhite, AP Email The mood inside the House Democratic caucus was unsettled on Tuesday, as members gathered to discuss whether their leadership elections should take place on Thursday or be postponed until after their Thanksgiving recess. Behind the closed doors of the caucus, a majority of the members who spoke wanted to delay the vote in the wake of an election that was disappointing to House Democrats. They had picked up only six seats, leaving Republicans with a still-sizable 241-194 majority. Before the election House leaders predicted they could pick up as many as 20 seats, even take back control. \u00a0 House Republicans unanimously re-elect Paul Ryan as speaker According to a Democratic aide inside the room, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pushed back on the idea of delaying the vote. She wanted the House Democratic elections to be held this week and said so several times.\u00a0 A motion was made to delay the elections. Conference chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra tried to shut down the argument, complaining that members needed official notice before voting. Senate Democrats elect Chuck Schumer as their new leader Pelosi was exasperated. She told the caucus that it should be holding its elections now, saying it was an emergency. Everyone, she declared, is moving forward, and we\u2019re not. Then suddenly Pelosi changed course and agreed to postpone the elections until Nov. 30. Another aide in the room disputed the claim that Pelosi cared when the elections were held. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m agnostic,\u201d Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues, according to the second aide. \u201cI was ready to go with after Thanksgiving because I didn\u2019t want the new members to be spending all their time worrying about who they are going to vote for \u2013 for this, that or the other thing.\u201d Pelosi is facing a disgruntled caucus post-election. Multiple aides and members tell CBS News that House Democrats are angry and frustrated. A group of members, including New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, signed a letter requesting that leadership elections be postponed. \u201cI really think we need to look at each other eyeball to eyeball\u2026 to get something more definitive,\u201d Rep. Pascrell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not only not listening to\u2026 our opponents, we\u2019re not listening to our own comrades.\u201d An aide explained it this way: We\u2019ve had this same experience before. Democrats underperform, Pelosi promises change, and then she appoints the same people to \u201cchange\u201d things. On Wednesday, Pelosi announced she would run for re-election as Democratic leader, and at this point, she remains unopposed. Pelosi\u2019s hold on power is tight and few in the caucus believe any member could build enough support to beat her. What is more realistic is that rank and file members will pressure their leadership for concessions, like electing the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the campaign arm of Democratic House members. Currently, Pelosi appoints that position. Members could also push to implement term limits for ranking committee members. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "WATCH Footage of Starving Teen in Yemen Shows the Horrors of War 0 Shares Email On an August morning, a taxi driver in northwestern Yemen hugged his kids and jokingly told his family, \"Forgive me if I don't come back.\" It was his way of laughing off the danger of driving in a country where airstrikes can hit any road at any time. In the afternoon, Mohammed al-Khal happened upon just such a strike. Three missiles had hit a highway, leaving bystanders wounded. Al-Khal took one of them, an ice cream vendor, in his car and rushed him to the nearest hospital, run by the international humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders. But the warplanes were still hunting. Moments after al-Khal pulled up at the hospital in the town of Abs, a missile smashed down by his car, just outside the hospital entrance. Al-Khal, a father of eight, was incinerated. The blast ripped through patients and family waiting in an outdoor reception area. Nineteen people were killed, along with two civilians killed on the highway. The Aug. 15 attack typified what has been a pattern in the nearly 2-year-old air campaign by Saudi Arabia and its allies against Yemen's Shiite rebels, known as Houthis. Rights groups and U.N. officials say the U.S.-backed coalition has often either deliberately or recklessly depended on faulty intelligence, failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets and disregarded the likelihood of civilian casualties. Experts say some of the strikes amount to war crimes. \"The Saudis have been committing war crimes in Yemen,\" said Gabor Rona, a professor teaching the laws of war at Columbia University. He warned that American personnel helping the coalition \"may also be guilty of war crimes.\" Nearly 4,000 civilians have been killed in the war, and an estimated 60 percent of them died in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition, the U.N. says. Saudi Arabia launched the coalition campaign in March 2015 in a bid to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, after the Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and the north of the country. The Iranian-backed Houthis are allied with troops loyal to Hadi's ousted predecessor, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The war has devastated the country of 26 million, causing widespread hunger and driving 3 million from their homes. Warplanes have hit medical centers, schools, factories, infrastructure and roads, markets, weddings and residential compounds. The U.S. and its allies have sold billions of dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia for the campaign. The U.S. military provides it with intelligence, satellite imagery and logistical help. Washington underlines it does not make targeting decisions and calls on the coalition to investigate reported violations. Over the summer, the U.S military reduced the number of military personnel advising the coalition from several dozen to fewer than five, an apparent move to distance itself from the campaign. \"U.S. security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank check,\" National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said. The coalition says it does its utmost to avoid civilian casualties and notes rebels often operate among civilians. Rights groups and U.N. officials have reported probable war crimes by the Houthis, including shelling civilian areas and basing their fighters in schools and other civilian locations. \"This is the fog of war,\" the coalition's spokesman, Saudi Gen. Ahmed al-Asiri, told The Associated Press when asked if there is a pattern of civilian deaths. \"In war, there are decisions that should be taken fast.\" The coalition, which says it investigates every claim of violations, has made nine investigations public. In two it acknowledged mistakes and said it would pay compensation to victims. In most of the other cases, it said the strikes were against a justified military target. But critics say the American and international backing has given Saudi Arabia and its allies a free rein. \"We believe that the coalition understood ... it has a green light to commit more massacres in Yemen,\" said Abdel-Rashed al-Faqeh, the head of Muwatana, one of Yemen's most prominent rights groups. The strike in Abs underscored several of the problems experts point to in many strikes \u2014 the failure to distinguish between civilian and military targets and a lack of proportionality, the principle that use of force must be balanced to avoid civilian casualties. In the strikes, warplanes initially fired a rocket targeting a Houthi checkpoint manned by two rebels on a highway outside Abs. The fighters escaped, but two more rockets were fired, killing two bystanders and wounding others. It appears the warplanes followed al-Khal's Camry, believing he was carrying a wounded fighter, and struck him outside the hospital. The hospital was on a coalition list of sites not to be targeted in airstrikes, and had markings on its roof to show it was a medical facility. The AP interviewed witnesses to the strikes on the highway and at the hospital, as well as al-Khal's two wives. The head of Doctors Without Border's mission in Yemen, Colette Gadenne, said the coalition acknowledged to the group privately that the strike was a mistake. The head of the coalition's investigation team, Mansour al-Mansour, said he could not discuss the investigation results in public. He said the coalition gave Doctors Without Borders all information it gathered. The effect of the strike \u2014 the fifth on a facility run by the group in Yemen \u2014 has been wide-reaching. The organization pulled its personnel from northern Yemen, straining staff at multiple hospitals. The Abs hospital served around 100,000 peoplpe, said its manager, Ibrahim Ali. Now it is shut down and the nearest medical facilities are two or three hours away by car. \"Patients sometimes die on the road,\" Ali said. Rona, the legal expert, said those behind the Abs strikes \"didn't take sufficient precautions to determine that the people in the taxi are targetable.\" Then, warplanes struck where \"there would be significant collateral damage to the hospital.\" \"Any way you look at it, it is a war crime.\" \u2014\u2014 Al-Haj reported from Sanaa, AP journalists Maad al-Zikry and Hani Mohammed contributed to this report from Yemen. 0 Shares ",

Last year, archaeologists using electrical imagining techniques found that the pyramid, which is also known as El Castillo, was built atop a subterranean river, or a cenote. Archaeologists have long known that a smaller pyramid is encapsulated underneath the visible temple. Researchers said Wednesday that they had detected an even smaller structure inside the other two structures. Using what is called tri-dimensional electric resistivity tomography, or \u201cERT-3D,\u201d they found a 10-meter (yard) tall structure within the 20-meter tall \u2018intermediate\u2019 pyramid that was covered over by the last construction stage, perhaps around 900 A.D. Archaeologist Denisse Lorenia Argote said \u201cif we can research this structure in the future it could be important, because it could tell us about the first-period inhabitants\u201d of the site. Argote, of Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History, said the first structure may be in the \u201cpure Maya\u201d style from between 500 and 800 A.D.\u00a0 A robot named Tlaloc II, after the Aztec god of rain, recently discovered three chambers while exploring a 2,000-year-old tunnel underneath a pyr... University of California, San Diego anthropology professor Geoffrey Braswell, who was not involved in the latest project but who has conducted research at Chichen Itza, said the discovery may be new, or may be a structure detected in the 1940s. Braswell said that while digging into the intermediate-layer pyramid in the 1940s, one archaeologist found a third platform buried within it. \u201cThe tunnel was unstable, so we know very little about this platform,\u201d Braswell wrote. \u201cIt appears to be much smaller than the outer two pyramids, and is not perfectly aligned within them.\u201d The computer image distributed by the researchers also showed underlying structure not quite aligned with the subsequent layers. Braswell compared the Kukulkan pyramid to a Russian nesting doll, with each layer encapsulating another. But at the bottom, there may be more than one platform encapsulated. \u201cTo make matters more complicated, \u201c Braswell wrote, \u201cthe third Russian doll moving in may actually be one of a set of several small dolls rattling around inside the same shell.  We just do not know. \u201c Rene Chavez, a researcher at the National Autonomous University\u2019s Institute of Geophysics, said the early structure appeared to have a staircase and perhaps an altar at the top that may have just been filled in and preserved. The structure has been mapped, but it is not clear whether it will be excavated. \u201cGiven that no one has excavated this structure ... it is difficult to say with certitude if it is one of the oldest buildings at the site,\u201d Braswell said. \u201cBut this is quite possible.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Greg Harris, D-Chicago, left, and Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, right, head into Gov. Bruce Rauner's office during a veto session at the Capitol on Nov. 16, 2016, in Springfield. (Seth Perlman / AP) Privacy Policy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's budget office estimates the state's backlog of unpaid bills will hit a record $13.5 billion by July if the governor and Democrats who control the General Assembly remain deadlocked over a complete spending plan, a bleak reminder of what's at stake as negotiations begin anew. The projection came as the comptroller's office announced the bill backlog hit $10.6 billion on Wednesday, a situation that's turned thousands of vendors and small businesses into creditors for state government as they're forced to wait months to be paid for services rendered. Despite the grim prediction, Rauner and Democratic leaders gave little indication much will change to reverse that trend, as both sides seized on the figures to plead their case. Democrats led by House Speaker Michael Madigan pointed to the numbers as proof that it's time for Rauner to set aside the economic agenda he's made a condition of a larger budget deal, saying the state's budget problems are more pressing and changes would not bring about immediate savings. Rauner countered that Democrats aren't focusing on the big picture, saying quick budget fixes will mean nothing in the long term if Illinois doesn't take steps to help businesses grow and improve the overall economy. The figures were among the topics up for discussion as Rauner and legislative leaders met for the second day in a row ahead of the expiration of a temporary stopgap spending plan at the end of the year. Also on the agenda was an updated list of items the governor wants as part of a broader deal. They include a freeze on property taxes coupled with government consolidation, term limits for lawmakers and legislative leaders, a rewrite of the school funding formula and the curbing of costs associated with the workers' compensation system for employees hurt on the job. Rauner also wants an overhaul of the state employee pension system, which now has an unfunded liability of nearly $130 billion, according to a report released this week by the bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.

Just Follow the Rules by Nicole Spector A worker gathers items for delivery from the warehouse floor at Amazon's distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. REUTERS/Ralph D. Freso Share advertisement Holiday shopping mania is about to kick in at full force, and while zeroing in on the best deals, online shoppers may also want to consider the rules that pertain to their favorite retail and coupon websites. If you don't play by them, you could become ineligible for certain discounts and even banned from using those sites altogether. \"We can get up to several million shoppers on our PromotionCode coupon site each month and invariably some of them will do things offensive or aggravating enough to get banned,\" said Mike Catania, co-founder and CTO. We've complied a list of 'Shopping Do Nots' \u2014 some of which may come as a surprise. Being a Bully In the Comments Section What is it about the comments sections that enables us to become our worst selves? We see it often enough on media sites \u2014 commenters criticizing one another in light of their opinions \u2014 but this kind of catty aggression has no place (fortunately) on retail-oriented websites. \"We have no tolerance whatsoever for visitors on our site attacking other users in comment sections,\" said Catania. \"It might seem unlikely that a coupon site would have that sort of vitriol in the comment sections but it's true: People who submit coupons where they have a vested interest will mercilessly attack other users in an effort to have other codes removed.\" If you must, first scream into your pillow, and then return to your computer. Promoting Your Own Business Another behavior you'll want to avoid in the comments section and other discussion boards on professional retail sites, is using the space to link to another site. No matter what great deals or advice you have to share, and no matter how potentially relevant you think it could be to shoppers, you're better off sticking to social media for linking to outside sources. \"When I was an amateur in digital marketing I was banned for posting promotional links to different discussion boards,\" admitted Tochukwu Mbiamnozie, the Founder & CEO of TucciPolo , a lifestyle luxury footwear brand. \"I learned my lesson.\" Stick to the subject (and the site) at hand, folks! Buying Gift Cards For Yourself \"Some retailers used to give rewards points or cash back when users purchased gift cards from them,\" said Erin Warren, senior VP of marketing for Splender.com , an online cash back shopping site. \"But, most of this rewarding is being eliminated as retailers learn that many people aren't giving gift cards as 'gifts' \u2014 which [aim to] bring in new customers \u2014 but instead are buying gift cards for themselves in order to 'manufacture' more rewards points and/or cash back... ultimately costing the retailer more money.\" This is called \"gift card churning,\" Warren noted, and it can get shoppers banned. Creating Multiple Accounts Thinking you can maximize deals by creating more emails/log-ins? Yeah, you're probably going to get busted \u2014 and banned. \"This is the era of Big Data. So when community members create several accounts, we can obviously see matching IP addresses that are created just to up/down-vote offers,\" said Catania, adding that often people will lie when confronted, a move that gets them in even more hot water. \"Trying to game the system and then unabashedly lying about it when confronted with evidence is a quick way to get banned.\" Faking Friends Some retailers will offer you additional discounts if you get your friends to shop on their site, too. Sneaky shoppers have been known to make up friends \u2014 or at least, make up friends' accounts \u2014 in order to meet the quota for these bonus savings. \"Some people make up fictitious accounts to collect bounties for new customers,\" said Warren, adding that if you're found out, you'll likely get banned. Being Aggressive With Customer Service Annoyed about something and want to let customer service know all about it? Well, you're certainly encouraged to do so, but you've got to be respectful. Don't hit send on that chat or email until you've cooled down and made sure that you aren't saying anything aggressive. \"Some people take for granted that there's a live human being, complete with feelings, on the other side of their angry emails,\" said Catania. \"It's alarming how worked up some people can get because their expired coupon wasn't accepted \u2014 and [how they] have no fear about putting it in writing. It's one thing to be disappointed or upset but another to make personal threats; it's a quick way to get banned.\" Here's another opportunity to scream into your pillow, instead of lashing out. Manipulating Reviews This applies more to sellers than to buyers, but in the golden age of eBay, Amazon, and Craigslist, where anyone can sell something, it's worth noting. Sometimes people selling a product will try to give themselves positive reviews, or \"upvote\" other positive reviews. This is a definite no-no, and Amazon in particular has become very savvy at detecting these actions. So good in fact that you have to be quite careful; even if you're not meaning to seem shady, you could mistakenly appear as though you are. For instance, if you have multiple Amazon accounts and use more than one of them to diss (or applaud) a product, you could trigger an alert causing Amazon to delete your reviews. Manipulating reviews probably won't get you completely banned from a site, but it will get you banned from the reviews section, and likely wipe out your history as a reviewer. Nicole Spector ",

    "text": "San Francisco Teachers Union Offers Trump Lesson Plan By jocelyn gecker and janie har, associated press SAN FRANCISCO \u0097 Nov 16, 2016, 9:07 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Nov. 10, 2016, file photo, high school students carry signs as they march in opposition of Donald Trump's presidential election victory in San Francisco. The union representing San Francisco's public school teachers is circulating a classroom lesson plan that calls President-elect Donald Trump a racist and sexist man. The United Educators of San Francisco posted the plan on its website and distributed the plan via an email newsletter. The union represents about 6,000 members. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) 0 Shares Email San Francisco's public schools have been offered a classroom lesson plan that calls President-elect Donald Trump a racist, sexist man who became president \"by pandering to a huge racist and sexist base.\" The union that represents city teachers posted the plan on its website and distributed it via an email newsletter to its more than 6,000 members. The school district has more than 57,000 students. It is unclear how many teachers have used the plan outlined by a Mission High School teacher, but it appears to have the tacit support of city education officials. School district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe said the plan is optional and not part of the official curriculum. \"Educators are entrusted to create lessons that reflect the California standards, support students' social and emotional well-being and foster inclusive and safe school communities,\" she said in a statement that neither praised nor rebuked the lesson plan. San Francisco schools serve diverse populations and teachers are encouraged to include multiple perspectives in lessons, she said. The Republican Party in San Francisco reacted sharply. \"It's inappropriate on every level,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC committeewoman from California. She called it \"inappropriate propaganda that unfairly demonizes not only the campaign that Donald Trump, the winner, ran, but also all of the people who voted for him.\" The lesson plan was written by social studies teacher Fakhra Shah, who said she hadn't planned for it to spread citywide \u2014 that was a step taken by the teacher's union. She wrote it at 2 a.m. Nov. 9, just hours after results came in, to help teachers at her school struggling with how to answer students' questions and concerns about Trump becoming president. \"I think a lot of people were lost for words, wondering, 'What do we say? What do we do?' \" said Shah, whose Latino, African American, white, Muslim and LGBTQ students are worried about a surge in hate crimes since the election. \"We're calling him out,\" she said. \"If he's our president, I have the right to hold him accountable and ask him to take a stance that is anti-hate and anti-racist.\" The plan encourages teachers to let students express their concerns and to offer them hope and tell students that they can keep fighting. \"We can uplift ourselves (and) fight oppression here at school even if we cannot control the rest of the country,\" she said. San Francisco is diverse, with many students whose families are in the country illegally and who are worried by Trump's calls for deportation. She warned teachers that some students may use inappropriate words to express their fear and anger. \"I know that they might curse and swear, but you would too if you have suffered under the constructs of white supremacy or experienced sexism, or any isms or lack of privilege,\" she wrote. About 2,000 San Francisco students walked out of class last week to protest the new president. On Monday, Mayor Ed Lee declared that San Francisco would continue to provide sanctuary for all immigrants, religious minorities and gays and lesbians. The union that represents teachers, the United Educators of San Francisco, defended the plan. Union President Lita Blanc said that even House Speaker Paul Ryan had called Trump's campaign racist and sexist. \"There is a time and a place for using words that match action,\" Blanc said. She praised the plan's advice for students \u2014 \"to stand up and defend themselves, and speak out for themselves and make a difference.\" 0 Shares ",

Windsor Public Schools Superintendent Craig Cooke said Tuesday the mural at Oliver Ellsworth School was painted over to make way for something that would showcase student work. He says it was done Nov. 8, when the school was closed, so students and staff wouldn't inhale harmful odors in the paint. The 2009 mural featured student signatures and other historical events of that time. Cooke says the timing for replacing the mural \"couldn't have been worse\" and apologized for the \"mistake.\" Cooke told parents at a meeting Tuesday that district officials will work to replace the mural. 0 Shares ",

Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is now overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's transition, walks by reporters while exiting Trump Tower on Tuesday. Spencer Platt/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump's first week after pulling off an upset victory has had plenty of missteps. That rocky start to his transition planning that one source described to CNN as a \"knife fight\" has done little to assure his critics and skeptical Republicans that he'll have a smooth ascension to the Oval Office surrounded by qualified advisers. Trump denies that the transition is rocky. From the outset, his former transition chief throughout the campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, had to be replaced with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Just days before the election, Christie's top aides had been convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, and a pall of scandal hung over one of Trump's most loyal backers who likely would have had a top job in the new administration. From Lobbyists To Loyalists, See Who's On Donald Trump's Transition Team But with Pence now at the helm, the Indiana governor has apparently done little to steady the ship or stop leaks to the press. Trump's closing refrain of his campaign was that he would \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, but his initial transition team was flush with lobbyists . In one of his first moves, Pence ordered the removal of all lobbyists, according to the Wall Street Journal . Several very experienced members of the transition team \u2014 whose presence gave wary lawmakers comfort \u2014 have departed too. Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stepped down though several reports say he was let go. He had been seen as a possible candidate to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, but NBC News reported he was ousted in what two sources close to the former congressman described as a \"Stalinesque purge\" of Christie loyalists. Article continues after sponsorship \"I think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they'll get that settled pretty soon. I think they're going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,\" Rogers told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Shaping Trumponomics: These Names Are Being Floated For Cabinet Posts CNN also reported that the overhaul of Christie's picks was spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. There's no love lost between Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, and Christie, who prosecuted Kushner's father for tax evasion and witness tampering in 2004 as a U.S. attorney. President-Elect Trump Names Pence To Lead Transition Team But his reported instigation of removing experienced hands like Rogers was described to CNN by sources as a \"knife fight\" that was \"mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues.\" Former State Department official Eliot Cohen, who served under President George W. Bush, had been a Trump critic but said he was open to advising him after the real estate magnate's upset victory. But on Tuesday, he had done a complete turnaround, painting the transition as chaotic and motivated by revenge. After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming \"you LOST!\" Will be ugly. \u2014 Eliot A Cohen (@EliotACohen) November 15, 2016 Cohen later told the New York Times in an interview that \"Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered some names of people who might serve in the new administration, but only if they felt departments were led by credible people.\" \"They think of these jobs as lollipops,\" Cohen told the Times. President-elect Trump's outreach to and from foreign leaders has been confusing and disorderly too, per the Times: Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through \u2014 a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain. On Monday Trump touted his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 who he repeatedly praised throughout the campaign even as U.S. intelligence found the Russian government had hacked into the Democratic National Committee to try and influence the American elections. That drew a sharp rebuke from Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who said that Putin's promises of improved U.S.-Russia relations should be taken with \"as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections.\" Trump's rumored choices for America's top diplomat have also been met with controversy. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's most passionate surrogates during the campaign, is said to be atop the list. But Politico reported Tuesday that consulting work he did for foreign governments and companies, and the money he accepted from places like Qatar, Venezuela and from Iranian exiles, could prove problematic \u2014 not to say that Trump repeatedly criticized the Clinton Foundation for taking similar gifts from foreign governments. Another name that's surfaced to lead the State Department has been former UN Ambassador John Bolton. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who was among the challengers to Trump during the GOP primaries, said on CNN Tuesday that the former Bush appointee was \"totally unfit\" for the job, and also dismissed Giuliani as a choice. In a closely divided Senate, where the GOP is expected to have a 52-48 advantage, Republican defections will matter. Ex-Breitbart Executive Brings Alt-Right Ties To The White House All of the skirmishes over his transition team and possible cabinet picks may pale in comparison to furor over his controversial appointment of former Brietbart News Head and his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be his senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has ties to the alt-right movement, that's associated with white nationalism. Trump has also denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. NBC News reported Tuesday night Trump had requested a security clearance for Kushner, his son-in-law, so that he could join him for his daily security briefings. Trump tweeted Tuesday denying that the transition was in turmoil. But he added a bit of bombast and suspense typical of his background as a reality TV host: Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 And, in typical Trump fashion, he also took shots at the press, in particular the New York Times calling its reporting \"inaccurate\": The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. ",

For nearly the entire week since he became president-elect, Donald Trump has been holed up in Trump Tower, his gilded New York skyscraper. (Kathy Willens / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump and his team on Wednesday vigorously rejected charges of turmoil and infighting roiling efforts to set up his White House, national security and economic teams. A week after his upset victory, Trump said the enormous endeavor was proceeding \"so smoothly.\" Trump dished out his rebuttal on Twitter, spending yet another day ensconced in his New York skyscraper, beyond the public eye. Aides and allies vouched for the transition efforts on his behalf, suggesting some commotion was to be expected. \"The beginning of any transition like this has turmoil because it's just the nature of the process,\" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said as he left Trump's transition headquarters in Washington. He said the picture of Trump's administration would become clearer over the next two or three weeks. Others close to the transition process described advisers \"fighting for power.\" Trump has long stoked internal rivalries among his staff \u2014 both in his businesses and his campaign \u2014 and has created ambiguity in his transition about who has authority to make key decisions.

But it wasn't until a few months ago, shortly before Iraq's military began its offensive to retake Iraq's second-largest city, that the militants' true character was laid bare. \"They just started to create executions. Just for anybody,\" said the 47-year-old iron worker, who now lives with his large family in a tent in the massive camp for displaced people in Khazer. \"They were afraid of the people \u2014 that's why they were acting that way.\" Amidst the tales of escalating war and harrowing escapes, Ali Mohammed and his fellow exiles from Mosul described a terrorist group that had rapidly morphed from a formidable pseudo-army that controlled the city into a shambolic gang of murderous thugs. Related: Two-Front Battle Puts 'Huge Amount of Pressure on ISIS ' If ISIS' oppressive rule had been unbearable when the group was at its most powerful, it became even worse under its decline as U.S.-backed Iraqi military forces drew closer, according to former Mosul residents. The jittery militants turned harshly on the civilians they had once tried to recruit. To be sure, life in Mosul had been as difficult as ISIS had been severe. The militants forced male residents to wear their beards long and their trousers short \u2014 an indication of piety among very conservative Muslims. Women were made to cover their faces entirely, said Mahren Jassimi Abdullah, 60, who arrived at the Khazer Camp for displaced people from eastern Mosul on Friday. Khalid Ibrahim, 37, shows off his tattoo inside the safety of the Khazer Camp. Bredun Edwards / NBC News Khalid Ibrahim, 37, a laborer in eastern Mosul, said he was whipped 100 times by ISIS militants and jailed for 12 days because of his somewhat lewd tattoo of a busty woman on his right bicep. \"They said I was trying to imitate Jewish life,\" said Ibrahim. \"They prevented people from putting pictures in their homes.\" But early in their rule of the city, ISIS had shown a kind of mercy. Shortly after taking over in June 2014, they told residents who had been in any way affiliated with the security forces or the local police to line up at ISIS administrative offices and \"repent\" by swearing loyalty to the group. Thousands of men followed suit. Two years later as Iraqi security forces began to coalesce around Mosul, ISIS militants changed their mind in the most severe way: They rounded up former officers and soldiers and executed them by the hundreds \u2014 a crime that human rights groups and the Iraqi military confirmed with the discovery of mass graves. A member of the Iraqi military forces checks a mass grave they discovered after recapturing the Hammam Alil area from ISIS jihadis during the ongoing operation to retake Mosul on Nov. 7. AHMAD AL-RUBAYE / AFP - Getty Images \"We expected that they would cancel them,\" said Qusay Mohammed, 30, a local police officer who escaped slaughter by hiding in abandoned homes until he could make a break for it. \"They're the kind that would stab you in the back.\" Qusay Mohammed and other former residents said that ISIS was suspicious that the soldiers and police would join the invading Iraqi military once they closed in on the city. But the jihadis' mounting paranoia didn't end with ex-officers. As the Iraqi military drew closer, the group became increasingly suspicious of ordinary residents. \"They were afraid to let people get close to them,\" Qusay Mohammed said. \"They would keep people at a distance scared that [the civilians] would kill them.\" It was around then that city residents noticed an even more profound change: Suddenly, the wizened older ISIS members, many of them foreigners, disappeared from the city streets. In their wake, they left teenage locals whom they recruited into their ranks. \"The elders escaped. They took their families and their money and left,\" said Jebril Shehada Abdullah, 28, a former police officer, who speculated that the older fighters had left for Syria or Turkey. \"They left only the young guys. They were all locals who were deceived.\" Play ",

Kellyanne Conway, an advisor to President-elect Donald Trump, denied reports Wednesday that his administration's transition team was in turmoil. (Kevin Hagen / Getty Images) Noah Bierman and Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump and his top aides pushed back aggressively Wednesday at accounts of a rocky transition, with Trump attacking the New York Times and his staff making efforts to assure the public that accounts of internal turmoil had been greatly exaggerated. Despite the focus on public relations, there was little indication the team had progressed toward assembling an administration, and questions remained unanswered about the level of influence that Trump\u2019s family would exert in the new White House . Rooms set aside for Trump staffers at the Pentagon, for example, remained vacant Wednesday, an indication that Trump\u2019s team had yet to begin the complicated process of getting up to speed on the details of taking over the military and other sectors of government. The State Department had also heard nothing from Trump\u2019s emissaries, even as Trump\u2019s staff released an extensive roster of foreign leaders who had spoken with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence . Democrats , still absorbing last week\u2019s electoral rebuke, took further steps toward defining how they would operate as an opposition party, voting in a leadership team in the Senate with a few new names, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , aimed at broadening their appeal to white working-class voters who defected the party for Trump. But they were also still reeling from internal party divides; across the Capitol,\u00a0House Democrats postponed their leadership elections until after Thanksgiving. A stream of visitors, including New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, Silicon\u00a0Valley financier Peter Thiel, Trump\u2019s relatives, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u00a0and a few members of Congress streamed in and out of Trump Tower in New York, giving little indication of whether they were coming to give advice, apply for administration roles or simply offer congratulations. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, whose role in the new administration remains undefined, was one of two top aides to speak with reporters in hopes of changing perceptions. \"You don\u2019t form a federal government overnight, and these are very serious issues, very serious appointments, very serious considerations,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Conway said reports of firings and disorganization were\u00a0false. Yet she offered little clarity about who would be taking roles in the administration, including\u00a0Trump\u2019s son-in-law, 35-year-old real-estate investor Jared Kushner.\u00a0She said she did not know whether Kushner would be getting security clearance to attend top-secret briefings, but left open the possibility when asked whether it would be appropriate. \"It's appropriate for whoever's going to get the presidential daily briefing to have a security clearance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not just appropriate, [but] necessary.\"\u00a0 Armand Emamdjomeh Kushner has drawn attention on many fronts, including multiple reports that he orchestrated the ouster of several transition figures with connections to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who successfully prosecuted Kushner\u2019s father on tax evasion and other charges more than a decade ago. Kushner, who lacks government experience, could also face questions about conflicts of interest because Trump has said that his children will run his business empire while he serves in the White House. Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s campaign communications director, tried to answer another set of criticisms, promising that Pence, who abruptly took over the transition team leadership from Christie on Friday, had begun \u201cmaking good on President-elect Trump's promise that we're not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts.\u201d \u201cWhen we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps,\u201d Miller said.\u00a0The team did not name any lobbyists who had been dropped from the group. Despite the lack of apparent progress, Trump received a vote of confidence from an unlikely source:\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden , who met with Pence at the\u00a0U.S. Naval Observatory, the vice president\u2019s official residence, where they dined with their wives. \"No administration is ready on Day One. We weren't ready on Day One. I've never met one that's ever been ready on Day One,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut I'm confident on Day One, everything will be in good hands and they'll be able to handle everything.\"\u00a0 Pence will huddle with House Republicans on Thursday and meet with Democratic leaders as well. Trump took out his frustrations over media accounts\u00a0on the New York Times, angrily tweeting Wednesday morning about the paper\u2019s coverage of his transition. \u201cThe failing\u00a0 @nytimes \u00a0story is so totally wrong on transition,\u201d he wrote in one of several tweets criticizing the paper this week. \u201cIt is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.\u201d The paper did not report that Trump had failed to speak with foreign leaders. Rather, it said\u00a0that prominent allies\u00a0were \"scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump\" and had been, at times, \"patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning.\"\u00a0 Even some Republicans conceded they had\u00a0concerns about the transition, however. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking leader of the Senate, said he had\u00a0received no direct information from the transition team about its work, even as the Senate will be in charge of confirming Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, according to the Texas Tribune. \u201cObviously, this is my impression that the Trump team was not completely prepared for the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd after the election, they\u2019ve had to scramble quite a bit.\u201d Democrats, just as surprised by the election result,\u00a0were doing their best to plot their own path. Sen. Charles E. Schumer\u00a0of New York was elected minority leader, replacing retiring Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada. The move, along with the approval of Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Sen.\u00a0 Patty Murray \u00a0of Washington in the spots behind him, was expected. But Schumer broadened the Democratic leadership tent with the intent of improving the party's\u00a0standing with its progressive wing\u00a0and its\u00a0working-class base, two groups whose frustration with the party and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton contributed to Trump's victory. Joining the leadership team were Sanders, who challenged Clinton for the presidential nomination,\u00a0conservative Sen.\u00a0 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia\u00a0and Sen.\u00a0 Tammy Baldwin \u00a0of Wisconsin. Populist Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also kept a top spot in the group that will help steer the party.\u00a0 \"There's a debate going on about whether we should be the party of the diverse\u00a0 Obama \u00a0coalition\u201d \u2014\u00a0referring to the minority voters, women and independents who helped put President Obama in office \u2014 \u201cor the blue-collar American in the heartland,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 \"We need to be the party that speaks to and works on behalf of all Americans and a bigger, bolder, sharper-edged economic message that talks about people in the middle class,\" Schumer said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California will take over as ranking Democrat\u00a0on the Judiciary Committee,\u00a0a key role as Trump\u00a0moves to nominate a justice to fill the\u00a0Supreme Court vacancy left by the February death of Antonin Scalia.\u00a0 Times staff writer\u00a0W.J. Hennigan contributed to this report.

Jones , USA TODAY 6:19 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 1 Shares Hufflepuffs have been victimized for far too long, and Eddie Redmayne has had enough. In a new public service announcement hosted by MTV, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them \u00a0actor stands up for Hogwarts\u2019 marginalized house, defending his fellow Hufflepuffs for whom the labels \"boring,\" \"beige\" and \"nice\" have become de rigueur. \"Do you know what I see in Hufflepuffs?\" the advocate for the fictional Coalition For Better Treatment of Hufflepuffs asks. \"I see loyalty. I see fierce friendship. We are hardworking, we are compassionate and at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to do the right thing, and not because of the glory, not because of the glory, but for the greater good. Because\u00a0(expletive) it!\" \"Sorry,\" he says, composing himself. \"It\u2019s naughty to swear. Uh, we do it because that\u2019s what Hufflepuff\u00a0means.\" \"Be proud, stand tall,\" he continues before pointing to illustrious members of the house, including People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive titleholder, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson . \"Also, Hufflepuffs are J.K. Rowling\u2019s favorite house so frankly (expletive) you.\" Well said. ",

A new study shows you'll live longer, although it matters how you use the social networking site. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more. Buzz60 Tourists take a selfie on the terraces above Machu Picchu, the most visited travel destination in Peru. (Photo: iStockphoto) If it hasn\u2019t happened yet, it likely will at some point in your online life. Fellow retirees and pre-retirees will post pictures of their travels and adventures to exotic places \u2014 the J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n Glacier Lagoon\u00a0in Iceland, Nature\u2019s Valley in South Africa, Machu Picchu\u00a0and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands \u2014 and you, not wanting to miss out on all the fun,\u00a0might want to do the very same and then some. What say experts about keeping up the with Joneses? \u2022You're not immune. \u00a0One in four adults with social media accounts find themselves envious after seeing other people's vacation photos and pictures of expensive purchases posted online, according to a survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of the AICPA. Also, consider that everyone's at risk of falling\u00a0victim to such stories. \u201cUnderneath every financial decision, there is a story we are telling ourselves,\u201d says Sarah Newcomb author of Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead without Leaving Your Values Behind. Don't jump into retirement,' phase' into it with part-time strategy \u201cEach of us has come to believe certain stories based on our upbringing and our experiences with money; stories about who we are and who we are not, stories about what we can and cannot do in the world,\u201d she wrote in Loaded. \u2022 Your wealth could be in danger. The Galapagos Islands tempt many bucket list travelers. \u00a0(Photo: iStockphoto) Others agree. \u201cWe're highly sensitive to relative comparisons, and how that's pretty much doomed to make us unhappy unless we focus our attention elsewhere,\u201d says Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at Morningstar. So what can you do to protect yourself from social comparisons that might cause you to ruin your best-laid retirement plan? \u2022 Remember, nothing is as it seems. What you see on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter and the like may be a fa\u00e7ade. \u201cKeeping up the Joneses, especially for retirees, has long been a part of the competitive drive fueling financial decision making,\u201d says Sean Stein Smith, a member of the AICPA\u2019s National CPA Financial Literacy Commission. \u201cWith the advent and proliferation of social media, it is easier than ever before to convey an image that might be not accurate. Just because it is on social media does not mean it's 100% true.\u201d For your retirement planning, count on living until age 95 Newcomb agrees. \u201cWhen we see a social media thread or post, we are seeing a \u2018story\u2019 that someone else is telling about their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cThat story is the heavily edited\u00a0highlight reel of their lives, and it doesn\u2019t tell the whole tale: We do not see their debt\u00a0or savings, or the sleepless nights. We don\u2019t see the pit in their stomach when they open their credit card bill, but we see the smiling faces when they treat their kids to a beach vacation. We see a photo and tell ourselves the story of their amazing lives, and then we compare it to our own personal story, and we decide that we fall short.\u201d And what you don\u2019t know is the real story. They may have saved up for years to buy that boat, or they may have maxed out their credit cards to take the family on that trip. \u201cWe see \u2018priceless memories\u2019 and suddenly we are willing to throw away our own security in an attempt to get the emotional bliss we think our friends have achieved,\u201d says Newcomb. Ice chunks at Jokulsarlon Glacial Lagoon at sunset on the southern coast of Iceland. \u00a0(Photo: iStockphoto) \u2022 Focus on your own finances. Enjoy the photos of family and friends on social media, but don\u2019t let jealousy and envy get the better of you. Instead, focus on your finances and what you can do or not do with your money. \u201cSocial media is sizzle,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt fades quickly. Focus on the components that really matter to your finances.\u201d \u2022 Reframe the issue. Instead of looking at how peers and others spend money, look at how they save money. \u201cChange your reference points to friends who are responsible savers and modest spenders,\u201d says Jodi DiCenzo, a partner at Behavioral Research Consulting. \u201cThe effects might serve you well.\u201d \u2022 Use social comparisons to enjoy life as well. Richard Salmen, CEO of Northern Financial Advisors, says it\u2019s possible to avoid financial missteps due to social media comparisons. But you\u2019ll need a retirement spending plan to do so. Determine how much money you\u2019ll need for travel and how much you might need for late-in-life health care costs. Once\u00a0you\u2019ve mapped out a spending plan, you can give yourself permission to travel within your budget. Salem also suggests using other people\u2019s posts for inspiration, as a\u00a0way to rule in or out places you\u2019d like to visit, or things you might want to buy or not. In reality, Salem says far too many retirees delay spending money on trips\u00a0only to regret their decisions later in life when they are no longer physically able to travel. Do's and don\u2019ts to live by Do Be happy that your friends are living well. Remember that every photo is cropped, and often there are many outtakes before the best ones are chosen. Remember that their story is different from yours. They have faced different obstacles, and you only see less than\u00a0half of the picture. Don\u2019t Compare your \"blooper reel\" with their \"highlights.\" Minimize your own strengths, loves\u00a0or adventures. Forget that the brag books of social media are often ways to compensate for feelings of emptiness and isolation. Social media activity is linked to depression\u00a0and the like.

    "text": "Mitch McConnell Refuses Comment on Bannon, Despite Record of Opining on Obama Personnel Picks By ALI ROGIN Nov 16, 2016, 7:45 PM ET 0 Shares Star Michael Reynolds/EPA Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell speaks at a news conference following a Republican policy luncheon in Washington, Nov. 16, 2016. 0 Shares Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declined Wednesday to comment on president-elect Donald Trump \u2019s appointment of Steve Bannon to be his senior adviser. \"I'm not going to comment on White House personnel selections,\" McConnell said. Bannon is the former publisher of the conservative website Breitbart, which he once described as \"the platform for the alt-right,\" a catchall for a brand of conservatism that contains racist and anti-Semitic elements. Despite his silence on Bannon, over the past eight years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, McConnell has proven more willing to share his opinions on the administration's staffing choices publicly. When then-President-elect Obama announced his intention to nominate Eric Holder as attorney general, McConnell criticized the choice, saying on January 9, 2009, \"I think the attorney general nominee, Mr. Holder, has got serious questions to respond to.\" When longtime Democratic strategist John Podesta joined the administration in December 2013, McConnell suggested he wouldn't make much of a difference in what he considered a White House struggling with policy. McConnell told reporters of Obamacare, \"The issue [Obama] wanted to be most associated with is a failure, and no amount of shifting the chairs around on the Titanic is going to solve that problem.\" In May of that same year, McConnell delivered a 1,000-word-plus floor speech on the dangers of confirming Obama's nominee to be labor secretary, Tom Perez, saying he was \"a committed ideologue who appears willing, quite frankly, to say or do anything to achieve his ideological ends.\" Trump, McConnell and Ryan: Unlikely New Power Trio for DC To be sure, some of McConnell\u2019s previous comments were about cabinet appointments, on which senators also vote. Plus, McConnell has never commented on an Obama \"chief strategist,\" which is what Bannon is to Trump. He did praise the selection of RNC chairman Reince Priebus to be Trump's chief of staff. \"The only personnel decisions he typically comments on are chiefs of staff,\" McConnell spokesman Don Stewart told ABC. This afternoon I met with President-elect @realDonaldTrump . We are eager to get to work on behalf of this great country. pic.twitter.com/99ccQEVc7g \u2014 Leader McConnell (@SenateMajLdr) November 10, 2016 But McConnell's unwillingness to comment on Bannon, citing his aversion to commenting on \"personnel selections,\" is notable not just because he has frequently commented on similar Obama staff picks, but also because Bannon, who is expected to play a key role in the Trump White House, has garnered so much opposition among congressional Democrats - and little active support among Republicans. Rep. David Cicilline garnered 168 other signatures Wednesday on a petition to Trump asking him to rescind Bannon\u2019s appointment, writing, \u201cwhether intentional or not, the appointment of Mr. Bannon sends a disturbing message about what kind of president Donald Trump wants to be.\u201d While McConnell hasn\u2019t held back previously on key Obama appointments, the Kentucky Republican\u2019s opinions on Obama staff and cabinet picks were not always negative. He said having John Kerry as secretary of state would be \u201ca popular choice with the Senate\u201d in December 2012. When former commerce secretary William Daley was pegged as the president\u2019s new chief of staff in January 2011, McConnell praised the choice. \u201cI frankly think it's kind of a hopeful sign,\u201d he said. \"This is a guy who's actually been out in the private sector, been a part of business ... My first reaction is, it sounds like a good idea.\" He also sounded an optimistic note months before Obama\u2019s first inauguration, praising incoming chief of staff Rahm Emanuel for meeting with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill . \"I think the new administration is off to a good start,\u201d McConnell said at the time. 0 Shares ",

Bob Dylan, Titan Of American Music, Wins 2016 Nobel Prize In Literature The Swedish Academy, which gives out the Nobel prizes, says it received a personal letter from Dylan saying he had \"pre-existing commitments,\" NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports. She adds: \"There was a lot of speculation whether Bob Dylan even wanted his Nobel Prize in Literature. It took him more than two weeks to even acknowledge that he'd won. When he finally did, Dylan wrote to the Swedish Academy that the news left him 'speechless.' \"He told a reporter he would try to attend if at all possible, [but] now he says he cannot accept the award in person at the December ceremony in Stockholm. \"In a statement, the Swedish Academy says it looks forward to Dylan's Nobel lecture sometime in the next six months. The Academy says that's 'the only requirement.' \" The Nobel committee announced on Oct. 13 that Dylan had won this year's prize, saying he \"has the status of an icon\" and that \"his influence on contemporary music is profound, and he is the object of a steady stream of secondary literature.\" But as Elizabeth notes, Dylan took his time acknowledging the honor. Late in October , the committee still hadn't heard from him (although a line on his website did mention the award) and called him \"impolite and arrogant.\" After receiving Dylan's letter, the Swedish Academy said : \"That laureates decide not to come is unusual, to be sure, but not exceptional. In the recent past, several laureates have, for various reasons, been unable to come to Stockholm to receive the prize, among them Doris Lessing, Harold Pinter, and Elfriede Jelinek. The prize still belongs to them, just as it belongs to Bob Dylan.\" Article continues after sponsorship The Associated Press reports that Jelinek, the Austrian playwright and novelist, cited a social phobia in declining to attend the prize ceremony in 2004. At least one past Nobel laureate \u2014 a winner of the 1973 peace prize \u2014 rejected the award outright. Le Duc Tho refused the honor because he was to share it with Henry Kissinger, who he contended \"had violated the truce\" in Vietnam. ",

(Nov. 15) AP Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called on President-elect Donald Trump to rescind his offer for Stephen Bannon to serve a key role in his administration. \u201cThis country, since its inception, has struggled to overcome discrimination of all forms: racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia. Over the years we have made progress in becoming a less discriminatory and more tolerant society \u2014 and we are not going backward,\u201d Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cThe appointment by President-elect Trump of a racist individual like Mr. Bannon to a position of authority is totally unacceptable.\u201d \u201cIn a democratic society we can disagree all we want over issues, but racism and bigotry cannot be part of any public policy. The appointment of Mr.\u00a0Bannon by Mr. Trump must be rescinded,\u201d the Vermont senator continued. Sanders is not the only one who is critical of Trump\u2019s promotion of Bannon to chief strategist on Monday. Critics say that Breitbart News, the website Bannon\u00a0headed until he left to join Trump\u2019s campaign, has racist and anti-Semitic content. But Trump\u2019s aides have pushed back. Reince Priebus, who Trump named as his chief of staff, said the criticism of Bannon did not reflect the person he knew. \"I find him not to be the\u00a0way that\u2019 he\u2019s being accused, I find him to be the opposite,\u201d Priebus said.

Kushner, who has been married to Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, since 2009, has been a close adviser to Trump and a mainstay at the Trump Tower while the transition teams maps out next year's administration. Like Trump, Kushner is the son of a wealthy real estate developer and has become an extremely successful businessman in his own right. Trump Receives 1st Presidential Daily Brief The request for Kushner's security clearance comes one day after Trump and his Vice President-elect Mike Pence received their first presidential daily brief, or PDB, a highly sensitive rundown of the days most urgent national security issues typically reserved for the president and a handful of his top officials. It is customary for the president to offer that same briefing to the president-elect. Kushner's advisory role within Trump's innermost circle has been elevated since it was announced on Friday that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would be taking over control of the transition process from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who was let go. The 35 year-old Harvard graduate was one of only a handful of advisers Trump brought with him to the White House last week, and he was seen walking the south lawn with President Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough . Ron Sachs/Polaris Jared Kushner and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough walk through the Rose Garden as they discuss the Presidential Transition in the Oval Office of the White House, Nov. 10, 2016, in Washington. Trump denied reports that he had previously requested security clearances for his children, tweeting today that \"this was a typically false news story.\" 0 Shares ",

Voters cast their ballots last week in the Los Angeles' Boyle Heights neighborhood. (David McNew / Getty Images) David Lauter Contact Reporter As Hillary Clinton \u2019s national popular vote margin over President-elect Donald Trump grows \u2014 swelled in large part by California\u2019s prolonged ballot count \u2014\u00a0a new poll details how much more liberal the state has become compared with the rest of the country and why it was so much more receptive to the Democrat. The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times post-election poll of California voters, conducted by SurveyMonkey, also shows that majorities of California\u2019s Democrats and Republicans would like to see Trump and congressional Democrats compromise on major issues. But on both sides, voters largely expect the other to do the compromising. That\u2019s\u00a0an indication of the pressures that push both parties toward confrontations that voters dislike in theory, but often demand in practice. Clinton leads Trump by about 1.2 million votes nationwide, a margin that has grown steadily since election day. Vote counting continues in many states, as election officials sort through provisional ballots, late-arriving mail-in votes and other stragglers. By far the largest chunk of uncounted ballots remains in California, some 4 million as of Tuesday , compared with about 10.5 million statewide that had\u00a0been counted. By law, officials in California count mail-in ballots that arrive up to three\u00a0working days after the election so long as they were postmarked by election day \u2014\u00a0a leeway that most states don\u2019t allow and all but\u00a0guarantees a slower count. With Clinton beating Trump by almost 2-1 in California, her national margin will almost certainly grow and is likely to surpass 2 million. But although Clinton has racked up similarly large majorities in some other Democratic strongholds, she lost where the race was close, accounting for her defeat in electoral votes. Out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, 34\u00a0were blowouts, with the contest decided by 10 points or more, according to data compiled by Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. Of the 17 closer contests, 10 fell Trump\u2019s way. Trump tweeted this week that if the election had depended on the popular vote, not the electoral college, he would have campaigned differently and won the popular vote. On the flip side, many Democrats argue that if the country abolished the electoral college system, which awards votes to the winner of each state, Clinton would have won. Armand Emamdjomeh Both claims are inherently unprovable. A different campaign run under different rules would have yielded different results. California\u2019s vote differs so much from the national pattern for two main reasons: Nonwhite voters, a group that is heavily Democratic,\u00a0make up a significantly bigger share of the state\u2019s electorate than the national one. Moreover, the state\u2019s white voters are more likely to define themselves as liberals and identify with Democrats than are whites in the rest of the country. In California, white voters made up about 56% of the state\u2019s electorate, the USC/LA Times survey indicated. Clinton carried those white voters 55% to 40%, blacks by 84%\u00a0to 13%,\u00a0Latinos by 73%\u00a0to 22% and all other voters by 57%\u00a0to 35%, the survey found. By contrast, a separate national post-election poll by SurveyMonkey found\u00a0whites made up 75% of the electorate across the country. Clinton lost to Trump among white voters nationally by 17 percentage points, the poll found.\u00a0Her margins among blacks and Latinos nationwide were roughly similar to those in California, given the error margins for both surveys: 90%\u00a0to 8% among African Americans and 67%\u00a0to 28% among Latinos. Nationally, about a quarter of whites identified\u00a0themselves as liberal or very liberal, while 42% called themselves conservative or very conservative and 35% called themselves moderates, the SurveyMonkey poll found. In California, whites split roughly into thirds: liberal or very liberal, conservative or very conservative and moderate, the poll found. Consistently through the campaign, Trump was strongest with blue-collar whites \u2014\u00a0those who did not graduate from college. California\u2019s white population has fewer non-college-educated members than in most states, and they are less conservative. Nationally, Trump won blue-collar whites 64%\u00a0to 32%; in California, the split was just nine points, the poll found. Among white college graduates, the SurveyMonkey national survey showed\u00a0Clinton winning by 10 points, while in California, her margin was much larger, 69%\u00a0to 26%. Clinton won among both men and women in California \u2014 with men by 16 percentage points and women by 39 points, the poll found. By contrast, she won women\u2019s votes nationally by 14 points and lost among men by the same margin, the SurveyMonkey national poll found. This is America's state of mind on election day Open link Looking ahead to the new administration, roughly two-thirds of California voters said that they wanted Democrats in Congress to compromise, rather than try to block Trump\u2019s agenda. And three-quarters said they wanted Trump to compromise rather than stand his ground and block the Democrats\u2019 agenda. But that professed desire for compromise could be misleading. Among Republicans, only 35% said Trump should compromise, while 63% said he should stand his ground. Republicans by 94%\u00a0to 4% wanted Democrats in Congress to compromise. Democrats showed a similar, although slightly more tempered, desire for the other side to do most of the compromising. They divided almost evenly on whether Democrats in Congress should compromise with Trump. But by 97%\u00a0to 3%, they said Trump should compromise with Democrats. Perhaps not surprisingly, the state\u2019s voters weren\u2019t hugely optimistic about the prospects. Only 15% said they thought it \u201cvery likely\u201d that Trump would be able to \u201cwork effectively with the Democrats in Congress.\u201d Another 25% said that was somewhat likely, but 59% thought it unlikely. Republicans, reflecting their faith in the man they voted for, were more likely to say they expected him to work effectively with Democrats, with 81% saying they thought that was at least somewhat likely. The poll also showed how much more focused Trump\u2019s voters were on a few key issues than were Clinton\u2019s. Among voters who sided with Trump, 40% in California and 46% nationwide listed jobs and the economy as their top issue, and 19% statewide and 13% nationally cited immigration. Clinton voters were more divided, with 25% in California and 30% nationwide listing jobs and the economy. Environmental issues, healthcare and foreign policy each were listed by about one in eight Clinton voters in California as their top issue.\u00a0 The poll\u2019s estimates of how the vote divided nationally and in California generally matched\u00a0the exit poll taken Tuesday for the major television networks and the Associated Press with one big exception: The SurveyMonkey national poll showed\u00a0a whiter electorate with fewer college graduates.\u00a0 This year, the exit poll showed the white share of the national\u00a0electorate shrinking to 70% from the 72% that the exit poll found four years ago. That would continue\u00a0a trend of a declining white vote. The SurveyMonkey poll, by contrast, indicated that the white share, and especially the share of the voters who were whites without college degrees, went up slightly.\u00a0 Which numbers are right won\u2019t be known for sure until next year when the Census delivers its findings on who voted. In the past, the Census has found a whiter and less-educated electorate than the exit polls. The SurveyMonkey\u00a0finding, however,\u00a0is more consistent with county-level voting data that show\u00a0lower turnout in many heavily minority areas, especially African American neighborhoods of major cities, and a strong vote for Trump in areas of the Midwest with large numbers of blue-collar white voters. A whiter electorate than expected might also\u00a0explain why polls of battleground states underestimated Trump\u2019s\u00a0vote: Polling models tended to assume the electorate would resemble the one from four years ago. The USC/L.A.\u00a0Times statewide post-election survey has an error estimate of 3 percentage points in either direction for the full sample, larger for subgroups. It was conducted Nov. 9\u00a0to -11 among 2,294 registered voters who said they had voted. Voters were selected from among the roughly 3 million who participate daily in SurveyMonkey polls, and the results were weighted to match Census figures on basic demographics as well as the overall vote. The national survey, using the same methodology,\u00a0was conducted among 99,377 registered voters who said they voted\u00a0and has an error estimate of 0.2\u00a0percentage points in either direction for the full sample.\u00a0 Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian was defeated by Republican Dennis Richardson in his bid to be Secretary of State. Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! It's the first time a Republican has been elected to a statewide office in Oregon since 2002. So consider this \u2013 Avakian was too liberal for what is arguably one of the most liberal states in the country. Avakian, a passionate advocate for the LGBTQIA crowd, was thrust into the national spotlight when he declared war on a Christian bakery in 2013. Aaron and Melissa Klein, the owners of Sweet Cakes By Melissa, declined to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple\u2019s ceremony. The Kleins, who are devout Christians, explained that participating in a same-sex wedding would violate their deeply-held religious beliefs. Click here to get your \u201cI\u2019m Politically Incorrect\u201d t-shirt! Avakian launched a very public and very ugly assault on the Klein family \u2013 alleging they had discriminated about the lesbian couple. They faced boycotts and picket lines and other wedding vendors were threatened with similar action if they did business with Sweet Cakes. The family\u2019s young children received death threats and the store\u2019s\u00a0 social networking platforms were overrun by militant LGBT activists posting obscene and profane messages. The Kleins were eventually ordered to pay $135,000 in \u201cemotional damages\u201d to the lesbians. They were also forced to shutter their retail location \u2013 and eventually shut down their family bakery. \u201cThe goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is to rehabilitate,\u201d Avakian told The Oregonian in 2013. Avakian was just as ruthless in his attacks on a Portland bar that turned away transgender patrons.\u00a0 The owner of the Twilight Room Annex did not want his establishment to be known as a \u201cgay bar.\u201d The bar was slapped with a $400,000 judgment and was forced to shut down. The Kleins are represented by First Liberty Institute, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent religious liberty law firms. They are appealing the fines levied by Avakian\u2019s office. \u201cWe will never know if Mr. Avakian\u2019s unprecedented attack on religious liberty played a role, but we are hopeful that there is a path toward justice,\u201d attorney Hiram Sasser told me. \u201cEveryone\u2019s beliefs deserve respect and tolerance even if some disagree with those beliefs.\u201d Sasser said Americans should have the freedom to live according to their own conscience without the force of government being used to punish those who disagree with government officials like Avakian. \u201cPerhaps this will serve as a point of reflection for government leaders that the people of Oregon and indeed most Americans believe in tolerance and respect and the dignity of each person to live their lives according to the dictates of their own consciences,\u201d Sasser said. Voters saw Avakian for who he really was \u2013 an anti-Christian bully with no regard for the U.S. Constitution. Nobody likes a bully \u2013 especially a liberal bully.

He will be the host of 1A, the new show taking over the time slot currently held by The Diane Rehm Show. Stephen Voss/Courtesy of WAMU As longtime public radio talk show host Diane Rehm retires, her midday slot will be filled with a new show called 1A, NPR member station WAMU announced Wednesday. The new live two-hour show \u2014 with a name reminiscent of a newspaper front page, as well as the First Amendment \u2014 will be hosted by Joshua Johnson, co-creator and host of the radio series Truth Be Told about race in America. 1A will launch at the start of the new year, with the first episode airing Monday, Jan. 2 at 10 a.m. On the radio and as a podcast, the show will seek to build on Rehm's \"legacy of civil dialogue and analysis,\" WAMU writes. Diane Rehm Finds New Life In The Profound Challenge Of Being Alone As The Two-Way reported nearly a year ago , when Rehm's retirement was announced, the Peabody Award-winning Diane Rehm Show reaches more than 2.4 million on-air listeners each week: \"Rehm, 79, began her career at WAMU as a volunteer in 1973; six years later, she took over hosting duties of its midday show, which was then called Kaleidoscope. It was renamed for its host in 1984. \"For years, Rehm has hosted her show as she also fought spasmodic dysphonia, which her website describes as 'a neurological voice disorder that causes strained, difficult speech.' Complications and treatments for that disorder have sometimes forced her to take time off from the show.\" Earlier this year, before the host who would succeed her had been chosen, Rehm spoke with the public media podcast The Pub about what sort of show she hoped would follow hers. \"I have held this microphone for 37 years, and it seems to me that it was time to turn it over to someone else, to a younger person with fresh ideas, with a fresh outlook as to what this program might become,\" she said . \"This 10-to-noon real estate in public radio is extraordinarily valuable, and whatever might come next will be fresh and new, and will draw new listeners, perhaps younger listeners.\" Article continues after sponsorship Challenging The Whiteness Of Public Radio Johnson, the incoming host of 1A, spent more than five years as the morning news host for member station KQED in San Francisco and teaches podcasting at the University of California, Berkeley, journalism school. \"My professional passions have always centered on creativity, exploration and service,\" he said in a press release announcing the new show. \"This moment in history demands these attributes of us. It's a chance to tell stories more creatively, to explore ideas beyond our own, and to refocus on serving others.\" \"At this moment, our country needs a fresh voice that addresses the wonderful diversity of our nation,\" Rehm said in that release. \"Joshua Johnson represents America's future and is the right host at the right time.\" If you want to put a voice to the name, you can listen to Joshua Johnson guest hosting The Diane Rehm Show this fall. 1A, like The Diane Rehm Show, will be produced at WAMU in Washington, D.C., but the station writes that the show will be \"in touch with communities across the country.\" Here's more from WAMU on the new show: \"The show will take a deep and unflinching look at America, bringing context and insight to stories unfolding across the country and the world. ... With a name inspired by the 1st amendment, 1A will explore important issues such as policy, politics, technology, and what connects us across the fissures that divide the country. The program also will delve into lighter subjects such as pop culture, sports, and humor. ... The show will act as a national mirror \u2014 taking time to help America look at itself and to ask what it wants to be.\" WAMU also notes that the show is launching \"at a time of deep national reckoning.\" Tracie Powell, founder of All Digitocracy and a senior fellow at the bipartisan Democracy Fund, agrees that the divisive post-election climate poses a unique challenge for the media in general, and especially for a new show such as 1A. Is There A #PubRadioVoice That Sounds Like America? \"Right now more than ever, we're delving into some really hard issues and really hard questions,\" Powell says. \"Hearing from people all across the country is really important.\" And she says that while there's soul-searching in the media about the need to talk to and about the working class, \"we need to understand that the way we talk about the working class encompasses black, Hispanic and Latino working class as well.\" \"This is a moment in time for more diverse voices to be in public radio,\" she says. \"More diverse voices are present on social media but they need to be amplified. So this is the way to amplify one of those voices \u2014 and if Joshua will allow a lot of other voices to be amplified, that's even better.\" \"Those are huge shoes to fill, but it's an exciting opportunity,\" Powell says.

United Airlines is trying to woo budget airlines' passengers with new \"basic economy\" fares that will go on sale early next year. Tribune news services Contact Reporter United Airline fliers will soon get the chance to buy cheaper fares on some of the airline's flights. But as good as that sounds, those tickets will come with strict rules that might not make it appealing for some passengers. The airline's new fare option, disclosed Tuesday, is called Basic Economy and limits what bags you can bring on board and doesn't allow you to choose your seat. United said Basic Economy fares will cost less than its regular economy class, but declined to say by how much. The new fares are expected to go on sale early next year for flights taking place in the spring. At first, Basic Economy will only be available for U.S. flights between certain cities. The airline will continue to offer its regular economy fares, as well as Economy Plus with more leg room and its first class options. Here's what you need to know about Basic Economy fares: NO SEAT CHOICE Your seat will be automatically chosen for you when you check in. That means you'll likely be stuck with the seat that other economy passengers didn't want -- so be prepared to squeeze into a middle seat. And if you plan to fly with friends or family, and want to sit next to them, Basic Economy is not for you. The airline said it's unlikely you'll be able to sit together. Also keep in mind, Basic Economy passengers will be the last to board the plane. NO CARRY-ON BAGS Carry-on bags that need to be stuffed into the overhead compartments won't be allowed on the plane. Basic Economy fliers can only bring a bag on board that fits under the seat, like a purse, laptop bag or backpack. If you bring anything bigger, you will be charged a fee and the bag will be checked in. That's much different from regular economy fliers who can still bring a carry-on aboard for free, as well as a small bag. NO TICKET CHANGES Once you buy a Basic Economy ticket, it can't be changed or refunded. If you do need to switch flights, you'll lose the money you paid and have to buy another flight. That's much different from United's other fare classes, which allow fliers to make changes for a fee. SAME INFLIGHT SERVICE Basic Economy fliers will get free snacks or drinks if they're offered on the flight, just like other economy passengers. They'll also be able to buy meals or WiFi access, if it's available. Associated Press ",

    "text": "[ After purge, Trump claims transition going \u2018smoothly\u2019 ] There is a no-fly zone over Trump Tower, and the police have barricaded sidewalks near the building, creating a maze for those wanting to enter. Inside there are security checkpoints where bags are scanned, and visitors are wanded. Although Trump says he wants to get rid of gun-free zones on his first day in office, weapons are banned in his tower. Trump has a history of using this public space for his own financial gain, and he was fined in 2006 and 2015 for setting up kiosks to sell his own merchandise, according to the Associated Press. Months into Trump\u2019s campaign for president, he continued to operate two kiosks in the lobby, where he sold campaign merchandise alongside Trump-branded gear. Those pop-up shops vanished by the spring, and in late May, New York City officials investigated whether Trump was blocking members of the public from the atrium when he held news conferences and primary-night celebrations. As soon as that happened, Trump stopped hosting formal events here. Now the Trump Tower atrium is busier than ever. When the doors open to the public at 8\u00a0a.m., there is usually a swarm of reporters waiting to get inside. They spend the day sitting on a row of metal benches set up across from the elevators, watching who is coming and going, interviewing possible Cabinet members and trying to keep tabs on the president-elect, who rarely leaves. There are rules of decorum: no sitting on the ground, and no putting your feet on the benches or standing on them to take a photograph. Most reporters were on their feet all of Tuesday, trying to determine who was attending Trump\u2019s casting call. First came the campaign workers turned transition staffers. Trump\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., arrived holding a pair of athletic shoes. Deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner rolled in with a suitcase. Beyond pleasantries, none wanted to talk to reporters. Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrived at Trump Tower for talks about the transition from President Obama\u2019s administration to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Nov. 15 in New York. (The Washington Post) [ Trump dumps his press pool again, raising flags about future access ] Then came the potential Cabinet members. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has advised Trump for months, strolled in and chatted with a few reporters about how this is \u201csuch an exciting time.\u201d He jumped into a packed elevator when the questions turned to his possible role in the administration. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group partner who is advising Trump, walked up to reporters and said he is helping the president-elect prepare to \u201cget the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan.\u201d But he demurred when asked about rumors that he is in the running for treasury secretary: \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment.\u201d Whenever there was a lull in the traffic, a janitor wearing a bow tie and dinner jacket would rush in to mop the marble floors, which were especially difficult to keep clean that day as rain poured. At one point, security personnel put up a red velvet rope to better corral the ever-growing group of reporters. As the day wore on, more and more tourists arrived, taking photos of the media and asking who famous might be there that day. Two tourists from Belgium hung around for nearly an hour but left when told the media had not laid eyes on Trump since late last week. Two other tourists from Italy provided unsolicited political punditry. At 11:28\u00a0a.m., Pence\u2019s motorcade pulled up outside the Trump Bar long after its expected arrival time. Out came the vice president-elect, his wife and an entourage of aides and security. Pence waved but did not say anything. When he left more than six hours later, he said just four words: \u201cGreat day! Great day!\u201d [ Here are the people the rumor mill says Trump might pick for Cabinet spots ] At lunchtime, the food court in the building\u2019s basement \u2014 reached using the famous escalator that once carried Trump down to his announcement speech in June 2015 \u2014 was packed with police officers, journalists, tourists and a few people who actually work in the building. As the afternoon progressed, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg stopped by to let reporters know that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the transition process or anything happening upstairs but that everything is going \u201cgreat, great.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a great president,\u201d Kellogg said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great team. He\u2019s got great people.\u201d As Kellogg listed everything that is great, Peter Thiel \u2014 a libertarian Silicon Valley billionaire who leads a venture capital firm \u2014 sneaked into the lobby and quietly got on an elevator without the media noticing. Soon there was another lull, and a bow-tied man vacuumed the carpet, while a mother from Alabama and her two daughters asked reporters for directions. Fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger was spotted, although he has an office in the building and was probably headed there. Then, just before 4\u00a0p.m., Maples \u2014 Trump\u2019s second wife who barely seems to have aged since they divorced in 1999 \u2014 was spotted at the Starbucks on the second floor, taking photos with people who recognized her. Soon, she was in the elevator, presumably headed to see Trump. Less than 30\u00a0minutes later, she was back in the lobby and walking quickly toward the Trump Bar. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Do we always bat 1,000? Not necessarily,\" Trump Communications Director Jason Miller told reporters gathered at Trump Tower on Wednesday. \"Last night probably was an example of where we could have been [in] a little bit better communication, but again, our goal going forward is to give you guys the best information in a timely fashion.\" Play Donald Trump Ditches Press, Steps Out for Dinner 0:47 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161117000427if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/809998403809\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump flouted years of tradition Tuesday night when he left Trump Tower without letting the reporters covering him that day know, and after his press secretary had told media his day had ended and not to expect any more movements from the president-elect. He visited a restaurant with his family, and the first indication the public was given of his plans was from a tweet posted by a Bloomberg reporter who happened to be dining at the same restaurant. NBC News was able to post a reporter at the restaurant after making a reservation to get in, and saw the Trump family, heavily guarded by Secret Service, finish their meal before Trump departed with a promise to the restaurant to lower their taxes. The president's movements are a matter of both national interest and national security, and since the creation of the White House press pool he typically has a member of the press with him at all times, even if they're held slightly apart from his activities, in case anything newsworthy happens to him. The White House Correspondents Association, the group that organizes the White House press pool, issued a statement from President Jeff Mason declaring it \"unacceptable for the next president of the United States to travel without a regular pool to record his movements and inform the public about his whereabouts.\" In the statement, Mason said they were \"pleased to hear reassurances by the Trump transition team that it will respect long-held traditions of press access at the White House and support a pool structure.\" \"But the time to act on that promise is now. Pool reporters are in place in New York to cover the president-elect as he assembles his new administration. It is critical that they be allowed to do their jobs,\" he said. Play ",

Marco Rubio meets with Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas Cuban-American leaders and human rights activists within the island nation are hoping that the incoming Trump administration will scale back President Obama\u2019s efforts to restore relations between the two countries, measures they say emboldened the communist regime and brought the U.S. little in return. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that a top priority for him next year will be to roll back sweeping changes President Obama implemented that significantly eased trade and travel restrictions. Rubio, like many Cuban-Americans who have opposed the normalization of relations, said Obama\u2019s overtures to the Cuban government have not yielded the hoped-for reforms. \u201cBy any objective measure, President Obama\u2019s unilateral policy changes have failed, and they are not in the best interest of the American people or the people of Cuba,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cRolling back President Obama's one-sided concessions to the Castro regime, a key campaign promise shared with President-elect Trump, will be a top priority for me next year.\u201d Rubio met on Tuesday with Guillermo Farinas, one of Cuba\u2019s most prominent human rights activists, during the dissident\u2019s visit to Washington D.C. Farinas, who has been jailed numerous times by Cuban authorities, has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration\u2019s surprise decision two years ago to normalize relations with the Cuban government after more than a half-century of hostilities between the two nations. Farinas and other dissidents, as well as some international human rights organizations, say the Cuban government continues to oppress its critics. Farinas went on a month-long hunger strike earlier this year after he was detained and beaten by Cuban authorities when he asked about a fellow dissident who had been arrested. Farinas, who was in New York Wednesday to meet with Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told FoxNews.com Obama\u2019s U.S.-Cuba policy betrayed the cause of human rights. \u201cI have faith that President Trump will be better for the people of Cuba and press the cause of freedom and democracy,\u201d Farinas said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say no one can possibly be worse than Barack Obama has been for our cause.\u201d During the GOP primary, Trump signaled support for thawed relations, provided the Cuban government reformed its approach to human rights. After he won the nomination, Trump addressed the issue again in Miami, assailing Obama\u2019s approach to Cuba. \u201cAll of the concessions Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,\u201d he said, adding that he intended to \u201cunless the Castro regime meets our demands.\u201d Top officials of the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), one of the oldest and most influential anti-Castro organizations, say they are lobbying members of Trump\u2019s transition team for a meeting with the president-elect. \u201cWe want Donald Trump to understand the reality of the situation faced by Cubans in Cuba,\u201d CANF co-founder Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Hernandez, a Bay of Pigs veteran, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe want a U.S.-Cuba policy that will bring democratic results.\u201d Other Cuban-American groups pressed Trump before he sealed the nomination. Brigade 2506, Miami-based veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion, endorsed Trump for president, the first endorsement in the organization's 55-year history. \u201cFor Donald Trump, it was a great honor to be recognized by the brigade,\u201d said Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cHe was deeply moved by it. This is an important issue to him, he has said you can\u2019t negotiate with human rights.\u201d Rubio is not the only lawmaker waiting to see what Trump will do regarding Cuba. Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton and also sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, told FoxNews.com that he does not know quite what to expect from a Trump administration. \u201cIt depends on which Donald Trump shows up,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cThe Donald Trump who said earlier in his campaign that he thinks it was good to engage Cuba, or the Donald Trump toward the end of the campaign who said he\u2019d consider rolling back much of what Obama did unless there\u2019s advantage for the Cuban people.\u201d Elizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

This would bring the transition more in line with Trump's campaign-trail pledge to \"drain the swamp\" of veteran politicians and special interests in Washington. That was the explanation given for the firing of at least one top foreign policy official, Matthew Freedman. A campaign official said Freedman was let go because he works as a lobbyist. But if Pence's directive is fully implemented, it could result in the exit of at least nine current aides, and likely more, according to an organizational chart for the operation obtained by Politico .

Freedman's firing is the latest of a string of shakeups that have plagued Trump's transition process over its first week, beginning with the announcement that Pence would be replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as head of the transition team. Christie was removed, sources told NBC News, because he was seen as insufficiently loyal to Trump during the campaign, and because Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner continues to hold an old grudge over Christie's prosecution of his father when Christie was New Jersey District Attorney. With Christie's demotion came former Rep. Mike Rogers' departure from the team, in what one source described as a \"Stalinesque purge\" of Christie loyalists. Trump spokesman Jason Miller denied Kushner's involvement in staff turnover, while spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway denied any reports of transition turmoil. But speaking on CNN following his departure, Rogers identified the challenge for the transition team as \"some confusion going on, uh, about a chain of command coming out of\" Trump's New York headquarters.

The former has been named chief strategist and the latter chief of staff. \"It doesn't work in a company. Could you imagine having two or three CEOs trying to make a decision? Just the chaos that it creates in an administration just won't work,\" he said. \"You've gotta keep this machine going, and it takes somebody very decisive who can make that decision. The more complicated you make that, I think the worse it gets. Competing and conflicting factions plagued Trump's campaign, causing near-constant turmoil that often overshadowed his message on the trail. That seems to have carried over to the transition process, as campaign loyalists jockey behind the scenes for plum spots in his administration. Perhaps the most prominent clash is the battle for secretary of state, which former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has made clear he'd prefer. But because of his work consulting for foreign governments, Giuliani faces questions over clear conflicts of interest. Already some Republicans have indicated he'd have trouble getting confirmed \u2014 including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who said he'd oppose the former mayor as well as the other reported contender, former UN ambassador John Bolton. Play ",
