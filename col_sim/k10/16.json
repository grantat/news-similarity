An image taken from a news helicopter video shows police responding to a shooting at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City on Tuesday. (KWTV) Associated Press A Southwest Airlines employee was shot outside Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport on Tuesday and died after police closed the sprawling complex to search for his killer. Oklahoma City police identified the victim as Michael Winchester, 52. A hometown wasn't listed. The airline said it was helping police officers with their investigation. Police have not detained a suspect in the shooting. \"It is with great sorrow that Southwest Airlines confirms that a Southwest employee who was injured during a shooting incident today at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City has died from injuries,\" the airline said in a statement. It said it would cancel flights out of the city for the remainder of the day even if the rest of the terminal reopened. Police and airport officials closed the complex after the 1 p.m. shooting and directed that people in the terminal take shelter. At late afternoon, officers said the agency would begin moving people outside of the building, which handles 7,000 to 8,000 passengers daily for Alaska, Delta, Southwest and United airlines. The airport is also a major transfer center for federal inmates, but its terminal is in a separate building. A jet carrying inmates to the transfer site was allowed to land while the rest of the airport was shuttered. Video from a television station helicopter showed what appeared to be a pool of blood near the bottom of a ramp leading from the airport's departure area. Two ambulances and a firetruck stood by. Oklahoma City Police Capt. Paco Balderrama initially said police had received reports of a possible second victim, but no one had been found by late afternoon. No other details of the shooting were immediately available. After the airport suspended operations, maps posted at the airport tracking website FlightAware showed that one plane was diverted to the Wiley Post Airport in the northwestern part of the city while two commercial flights from Chicago's O'Hare Airport were directed to Tulsa, about 100 miles away. \"There are going to be some delays for flights until we have further information,\" airport spokeswoman Karen Carney said. She referred other questions to police. All streets were blocked off surrounding the airport and everyone should avoid the area, Balderrama said. Some people were allowed to leave the grounds after police checked their vehicles. Carney said that police believe the shooting was an isolated incident, but that precautionary measures were still appropriate.

By Peter Holley November 15 at 3:33 PM Follow @peterjholley In this Feb. 4, 2014, file photo, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck speaks at a news conference at LAPD headquarters. (Reed Saxon/AP) Donald Trump has pledged to begin deporting millions of undocumented immigrants as soon as he takes office next year . For now, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has no plans to help him do it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to maintain the same posture we always have,\u201d Beck told KNX 1070 Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t make detentions or arrests based solely on status, whether that\u2019s immigration status or any other status.\u201d \u201cIf the federal government takes a more aggressive role on deportation, then they\u2019ll have to do that on their own,\u201d he continued. [ Legal decision could resonate most in immigration epicenter of Los Angeles ] Beck called any effort to arrest and deport people a \u201cmonumental task\u201d and estimated that there are 500,000 undocumented residents in the city of Los Angeles alone. \u201cThis is a population we police by creating partnerships, not by targeting them because of their immigration status,\u201d he added. \u2014 Chief Charlie Beck (@LAPDChiefBeck) November 14, 2016 Since the earliest days of his presidential campaign, Trump has made immigration enforcement a central pillar of his controversial message to voters. He has promised to build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, labeled undocumented immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and pledged to aggressively deport millions of people. In an interview \u00a0that aired Sunday, the president-elect told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl that he would deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants who \u201chave criminal records.\u201d \u201cWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,\u201d he said. [ Donald Trump plans to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants ] Stahl had pressed Trump about his campaign pledge to deport \u201cmillions and millions of undocumented immigrants.\u201d Trump told her that after securing the border, his administration would make a \u201cdetermination\u201d on the remaining undocumented immigrants in the country. \u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about \u2014 who are terrific people. They\u2019re terrific people, but we are going to make a determination at that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut before we make that determination \u2026 it\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.\u201d According to the Washington Post Fact Checker , Trump likely gets these estimates from\u00a0a Department of Homeland Security fiscal 2013 report \u00a0saying there were 1.9 million \u201cremovable criminal aliens.\u201d However, that figure includes undocumented immigrants and people who are lawful permanent residents, or those who have temporary visas. As for how many of those people are illegally present noncitizens, there are conflicting figures from the think tank Migration Policy Institute and the Center for Immigration Studies.\u00a0In a fact check, The Post rated Trump\u2019s figures \u201cTwo Pinocchios,\u201d noting that federal immigration enforcement data is \u201cnot always transparent or reliable.\u201d \"60 Minutes\" aired the first extensive interview with President-elect Donald Trump Nov. 14. Trump said up to 3 million people who are \"criminal\" and undocumented could be deported or incarcerated. (CBS 60 Minutes) Already, under President Obama\u2019s orders, an increasing percentage of those deported were people with criminal records, according to DHS . In fiscal 2015, 91 percent of \u201cremovals and returns\u201d were people previously convicted of a crime, compared to 86 percent in fiscal 2014 and 67 percent in fiscal 2011. If there was one location in the United States in which Trump could make the largest dent in the country\u2019s undocumented population, it would be sprawling Los Angeles County, where citizens and noncitizens have lived side-by-side for decades. Almost a quarter of the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants live in California, according to the Public Policy Institute of California . With an undocumented population of nearly 815,000, according to PPIC, Los Angeles County has more undocumented residents than any county in the state. Though estimates vary, experts calculate that more than 1.6 million \u00a0illegal immigrants live in Texas, making it second only to California in the size of its undocumented population. The LAPD has spent decades avoiding a significant role in the enforcement of federal immigration policies, even as the city\u2019s undocumented immigrant population swelled. Following a special order by then-chief Daryl Gates in 1979 that stopped officers from inquiring about someone\u2019s immigration status, the Los Angeles Times reported , the LAPD has for decades managed to remain outside the contentious immigration debate. In a subsequent interview with the L.A. Times, Beck reiterated that working with the Department of Homeland Security on deportation is not the department\u2019s job. \u201cI don\u2019t intend on doing anything different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody\u2019s immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts. That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.\u201d Unveiled in 1979, \u201c Special Order No. 40 \u201d directed LAPD officers to \u201cnot initiate police action\u201d in an effort to ascertain someone\u2019s legal status. Officers were instructed to notify the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service after arresting someone \u201cfor multiple misdemeanor offenses, a high grade misdemeanor or a felony offense\u201d or someone who \u201chas been previously arrested for a similar offense.\u201d \u201cThe Los Angeles community has become significantly more diverse during the past several years with substantial numbers of people from different ethnic and sociological backgrounds migrating to this City,\u201d the order states. \u201cMany aliens, whether from Latin American, African, Asian or European countries, are legal residents. Others are undocumented and are residing in the City without legal sanction.\u201d Since Beck became police chief in November 2009, the Times reported, the department has gone even further to remove itself from playing a role in deportations. Officers no longer hand people \u201carrested for low-level crimes to federal agents\u00a0for deportation and [have] moved away from honoring federal requests\u00a0to detain inmates who might be deportable past their jail terms,\u201d the paper reported. [ Despite Trump\u2019s threat to cut federal funding, mayors pledge to protect undocumented immigrants ] Beck told the Times that his command staff has met with community leaders and has delivered a consistent message when asked about immigration enforcement: \u201cThis is the same LAPD you had Monday, a week ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not changed because of the election on Tuesday. We have the same principles. We have the same values,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not going to change the way that the Los Angeles Police Department enforces the law.\u201d The Times reported that Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti also reiterated that police would continue to enforce Special Order 40. \u201cOur law enforcement officers and LAPD don\u2019t go around asking people for their papers, nor should they,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not the role of local law enforcement.\u201d Though Trump has threatened to withhold federal tax dollars, mayors of U.S. cities across the country have promised to protect their residents from deportation. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio even left open the possibility of deleting a database with the names of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants living in New York. He was joined in opposition by Chicago\u2019s Rahm Emanuel and Seattle\u2019s Ed Murray, both of whom have pledged to resist efforts to deport their residents. \u201cSeattle has always been a welcoming city,\u201d Murray said Monday, according to ABC News . \u201cThe last thing I want is for us to start turning on our neighbors.\u201d MORE READING:\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck at a news conference in October. Nick Ut/AP hide caption toggle caption Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck at a news conference in October. Nick Ut/AP A report released by the Los Angeles Police Department on biased policing found the city is not alone in failing to follow up on accusations of unfair profiling by its officers. It was requested by the city's five-member civilian police commission in September after the department released documents showing the LAPD had upheld none of the 97 allegations of racial profiling by its officers in the first half of 2016. LAPD Reports Shooting 38 People In 2015; A Third Of Cases Involved Mental Illness The Los Angeles Police Department is the third-largest municipal police force in the U.S., with about 9,900 sworn officers. It serves about 3.9 million people, according to the report. The report , titled Prevention and Elimination of Biased Policing, was dated Nov. 15, but was released last Friday after Mayor Eric Garcetti requested residents be allowed to review it before a meeting of the commission on Tuesday. The report begins by acknowledging that: \"While the Department has significantly improved over the past decades, there is much work to be done to maintain and improve the level of public trust that is so essential for effective policing, especially with communities that have been subjected to historical discrimination and disadvantage.\" It goes on to compare the LAPD to police departments in Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and Philadelphia. The report found only three of the departments \u2014 in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle \u2014 have \"confirmed procedures specifically used for biased policing investigations.\" Moreover, only three of the departments studied \u2014 San Diego, San Jose and Washington, D.C. \u2014 ever disciplined an officer over an allegation of racial profiling during the years for which data is available, which in most cases goes back to 2012. Article continues after sponsorship The report also summarized the findings of a survey conducted earlier this year which asked about 2,000 adults living in the city about their fear of crime, their trust in police and their satisfaction with police services. That survey found the majority of Los Angeles residents strongly or somewhat approve of the LAPD's work, but that the percentage of black people who disapprove (about 32 percent) was significantly higher than the rate among white people (about 14 percent). Asked whether LAPD officers \"treat people of all races and ethnicities fairly,\" nearly 60 percent of black people disagreed with the statement, nearly twice the rate of white people. In LA, Renewed Focus On Training Police On When To Shoot, And When Not To In a rare move, the civilian police commission for Los Angeles devoted its entire weekly hearing on Tuesday to the findings of the report. The hearing was held at Los Angeles City Hall to make room for members of the public who wished to hear comments from community organizations the commission had invited to express opinions about the findings in the report. At the hearing, Police Chief Charlie Beck called for the survey to be replicated before reforms are made based on the results. \"These results are important to us,\" he said, but added he needed more information \"to see whether meetings like this, to see if programs such as community safety partnership ... to see whether that makes a difference. As a baseline, it's hard to judge this because its the first of its kind.\" Multiple representatives of community groups spoke during the hearing, and many of the comments addressed people's personal experiences interacting with officers. \"LAPD needs to change their reputation in my community,\" 19-year-old Alfonso Aguilar of South Los Angeles told the commission. When he first arrived at the hearing, Aguilar was \"so nervous to enter a room with so many police\" he walked out and splashed water on his face, t weeted Kate Mather , a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who spoke to Aguilar after the hearing. The Los Angeles chapter of the Black Lives Matter organization posted a video on Twitter of people shouting \"no justice, no peace\" outside the room where the hearing was held. ",

The website quotes Shelby County authorities as saying that the child is in critical condition at an undisclosed hospital. The report also says his adoptive parents, Richard and Cynthia Kelly, have been charged with aggravated child abuse. Bond for each is set at $1 million. The investigation began Sunday when Helena police were notified of the boy\u2019s arrival at the hospital.The website reported the boy weighed only 55 pounds, but investigators would not confirm that information to\u00a0 CBS affiliate WIAT. According to arrest warrants, the couple is accused of denying food, nourishment and medical care to the boy, who was \u201csubjected to forced isolation for extended periods of time.\u201d The boy was severely malnourished, dehydrated, was experiencing shock and was \u201cclose to death\u201d when he was admitted to the hospital, Helena Police Chief Pete Folmar told reporters. He remains \u201cgravely ill,\u201d Folmar said. Folmar said it\u2019s the most disturbing case many of his investigators have seen in their careers. \u201cYou just struggle to wrap your head around it,\u201d he said. Two young adults, 19 and 21, one of whom is an adoptive sibling, were also living in the home. Folmar said they are employed and there is \u201cno harm\u201d to them, and said they are not being charged in connection to the case. \u201cThe victim continues to get medical care and we at the Helena Police Department wish him a speedy recovery and our prayers are with him,\u201d police said in a statement released on Facebook. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(WBBM / Handout) Phil Rosenthal Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune As a Cubs fan till the day he died in 1984, Steve Goodman might well have appreciated the bittersweet deal: Months before the Cubs\u2019 first World Series title since 1908 made his 32-year-old \u201cGo Cubs Go\u201d a surprise hit, his family reportedly sold away the publishing rights to his songs. Goodman\u2019s family can take solace in hearing his voice woven into the collective memory of the Cubs finally ending more than a century of frustration and they did retain his share of royalties as songwriter. But, as the Associated Press reported, their payday as the song unexpectedly has zoomed up the charts isn\u2019t what it would have been had they held on to the publishing rights a little longer. It has not been reported, however, who acquired the rights to Goodman\u2019s extensive catalog or at what price. Goodman wrote and performed a number of popular songs over his career before his death at age 36 from leukemia . Even with its recent sales and streaming bump, \u201cGo Cubs Go\u201d is just one component of an extensive catalog.

Earlier this month, eight children in five counties across the state were diagnosed with the condition. A spokeswoman for the Washington Department of Health confirmed the three possible AFM cases reported in Tacoma, Seattle and Spokane were being investigated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Two children are still hospitalized, while one child was treated at Seattle Children's Hospital and released, according to the department spokeswoman. What Does the Future Hold for Youngest Double Hand Transplant Patient The debilitating AFM syndrome affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. Historically, the condition has been caused by a variety of infections, including the polio virus. The condition often causes the spinal cord to be inflamed, which can in turn cause temporary or permanent paralysis. Earlier this month, the CDC confirmed that eight children in Washington had developed the AFM syndrome. Both federal and state officials are still looking for a cause of the condition. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations Erin Kelly , USAToday 6:28 p.m. EST November 15, 2016 x Share Donald Trump told 'The Wall Street Journal' that he may retain certain parts of the Affordable Care Act, a shift in tone since he promised to repeal it during his campaign. USA TODAY NETWORK House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., left, walks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. (Photo: AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Congressional Republicans are poised to act quickly next year to repeal tens of billions of dollars in environmental regulations and other federal rules issued by the Obama administration during its final seven months in power. As soon as Donald Trump won the presidential election last week, GOP lawmakers began scrambling to research the approximately 180 regulations that have been finalized since mid-May and may be eligible for repeal under a rarely used law called the Congressional Review Act. Republicans\u00a0can undo any of those regulations they don't like if they act fast after Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20. \"I'm sure there will be a dirty dozen,\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., when asked how many regulations he expects to be targeted. Issa has a bill before the House this week that would allow the new Congress to repeal multiple regulations at once rather than having to vote on them one at a time. Among the likely targets: a rule from the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial trucks and buses and a rule from the Labor Department to raise the salary threshold for workers eligible for overtime pay from $455 a week to $913 a week. 'Just scrap' Obama energy rules, Trump adviser says \"It all depends on how aggressive Republicans want to be,\" said Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at American Action Forum, a non-profit think-tank that describes itself as center-right. \"The law they're using is a pretty blunt instrument.\" It also depends on how soon Congress adjourns its \"lame duck\" session, which began Monday. The new Congress, which will convene\u00a0Jan. 3, will be able to count back 60 days from the final legislative day of the current Congress to find regulations \u00a0eligible to be repealed. Congress has taken so much time off \u00a0for elections and political conventions this year that the House\u00a0has\u00a0been in session less than 50\u00a0days from May 17 through\u00a0Tuesday. Lawmakers are\u00a0scheduled to work, at most, 14\u00a0more days this year before they adjourn. The earlier Congress adjourns, the further back in time lawmakers can go to target the 2016 rules they don't like. Some regulations \u00a0finalized in May, including the overtime pay rule, may be left intact if Congress waits all the way until its scheduled end-date of Dec. 16 to adjourn. \"Every day we're in session, we're burning one of those days,\" Issa said. The new Congress will have 45 legislative days to repeal any eligible rule it doesn't like. The Congressional Review Act of 1996, which has been used successfully only once in 20 years, speeds up the repeal process by requiring only a simple majority to undo regulations. That means Senate Democrats can't mount a filibuster to stop Republicans from acting. Trump is likely to sign legislation that would\u00a0repeal Obama administration rules. Obama, not surprisingly, vetoed four resolutions passed by Congress to overturn his regulations. Batkins, like Issa, predicted that the new Congress will leave the majority of the regulations intact. Batkins has compiled a list of 180 regulations that took effect from May 17 through last week. \"I don't anticipate the Republicans going after dozens of regulations,\" he said. \"Some of the rules are designed to fix something on a plane, for example. That's not the kind of thing they want to repeal. There are roughly 20 to 30 regulations that might be considered controversial.\" The House is scheduled to vote this week on Issa's Midnight Rules Relief Act, which would amend the Congressional Review Act to allow Congress to repeal multiple regulations at once. Issa said his bill, approved by the House Judiciary Committee in September, would help rein in costly last-minute regulations by presidents of either party. \"Regulations shouldn't be done this way,\" Issa said. \"Do it open, do it right, and do it early.\" The White House issued a veto threat on Issa's bill Monday, calling it unnecessary. Issa said he will offer the legislation again early next year if Obama vetoes it. ",

Ortiz , USA TODAY Sports 7:06 p.m. EST November 15, 2016 Dave Roberts saw his Dodgers club improve after losing ace Clayton Kershaw to a back injury. (Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports) In his first year running a club at any pro level, Dave Roberts led the Los Angeles Dodgers to one fewer victory than they had the season before. For that, he was deservedly named the National League\u2019s Manager of the Year on Tuesday, garnering 16 first-place votes and 108 points. The injury-decimated Dodgers overcame a midseason eight-game deficit in the standings to claim their fourth consecutive NL West title as Roberts\u2019 upbeat attitude and team-first approach spread through a clubhouse previously regarded as fractured. Indians' Terry Francona voted AL manager of the year His steady guidance as a rookie earned him top managerial honors over two veteran skippers, the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Joe Maddon (8 first-place votes, 70 points) and the Washington Nationals\u2019 Dusty Baker (4 first-place votes, 66 points), who had won the award three times each. On the surface, Roberts merely accomplished the same feat as his predecessor, Don Mattingly, who guided L.A. to the West crown each of the previous three seasons. However, Roberts faced a much higher degree of difficulty. The Dodgers were beset by an array of injuries to their rotation, losing staff ace Clayton Kershaw for 2\u00bd months and fellow starters Hyun-Jin Ryu, Brandon McCarthy, Alex Wood and Brett Anderson for even longer stretches. Scott Kazmir missed nearly all of September as well, and the Dodgers were forced to constantly improvise as they wound up using 31 pitchers. Through it all, Roberts remained a picture of positive thinking, refusing to let the team indulge in self-pity. He also found a way to deal with mercurial outfielder Yasiel Puig, who was banished to the minors for a month before being recalled. \u201cYou always want to remember what it\u2019s like to be a player,\" Roberts told MLB Network, \"and becoming a coach and a manager, to have your manager reach out and physically put hands on you every day, I think it sends a message that your care, you\u2019re thinking about them.\u2019\u2019 When the San Francisco Giants faltered after entering the All-Star break with the majors\u2019 best record, the Dodgers pounced and overtook them despite Kershaw\u2019s absence. By the time the three-time Cy Young Award winner returned Sept. 9, Los Angeles was ahead by five games and well on the way to a 91-71 record. Our picks for MLB MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year Baker also took over a splintered clubhouse, one that had been further poisoned by the Bryce Harper-Jonathan Papelbon altercation late in the previous season. Under Baker, the once-underachieving Nationals went 95-67 to run away with the NL East. The Cubs, who wound up winning their first World Series since 1908, enjoyed their best season in more than a century as Maddon led a youth-filled squad to the majors\u2019 best record at 103-58. *** ",

    "text": "5 Utah Students Stabbed in Boy's Locker Room; Teen Detained By brady mccombs and lindsay whitehurst, associated press OREM, Utah \u0097 Nov 15, 2016, 7:12 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Utah High School Shocked by Sophomore's Stabbing Spree 0 Shares Email As a group of boys at a Utah high school changed Tuesday morning into gym clothes for physical education class, a straight-A student pulled out a knife in the locker room and stabbed five of his classmates, sending the injured running for their lives and covered in blood, police said. The 16-year-old suspect with no record of disciplinary trouble also stabbed himself in the neck and was cornered by school workers until a police officer assigned to Mountain View High School got to the locker room and subdued him with a Taser shot. The five victims are all expected to survive, hospital officials said Tuesday afternoon. The two most seriously injured were in critical but stable condition, according to Utah Valley Hospital. The suspect was treated and released following the attack that spread fear and panic among students who described a gruesome scene immediately after the stabbings. Orem police posted a letter online they said was from the parents of the teen, apologizing. They said none of the victims had done anything to hurt their son and said the stabbings were not racially or ethnically motivated. \"We are at a loss to express how deeply sorry we are for the pain and injury caused,\" the letter says. Police said the knife used in the attack had a 3-inch blade but they did not identify the suspect who remained in custody by name because of his age. School district spokeswoman Kimberly Bird said the suspect was a new sophomore student who was previously homeschooled. There were no indications he was having problems or being bullied, she said. Investigators are talking to students who witnessed the attack and who knew the suspect as they try to determine a motive, said Gary Giles, the police chief in the city of Orem about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City where the attack happened. \"Is it a fight? Is it somebody who is upset with somebody? Is there more to it than that?\" Giles said. \"I don't have those answers.\" In the mayhem immediately after the attack, Junior Karen Martinez said she saw three victims run from the locker room toward the school's central office, one suffering from a head wound and another with a neck injury. One had blood running down the back of his shirt, she said. \"It was awful,\" said Martinez, her eyes filled with tears. \"It was so terrifying. I didn't know any of the kids but still it was like an awful feeling to see all those kids getting hurt.\" Eduviges Sanchez had just dropped her son off at the school when she saw a student outside with a blood gushing from a large cut in the side of his neck. Student Paxton Ransom was in the locker room when it happened. He saw blood on the floor and thought it was fake until he looked around the corner and saw someone on the ground who had been stabbed. He ran away and hid with other students in the school's the weight room, texting his mother \"There's been a stabbing but I'm ok.\" She joined hundreds of parents who rushed to the school to find out if their children were safe, letting him go back to classes after giving him a hug. The school, which has 1,300 students, was put on lockdown after the stabbings for about an hour until police determined there was no danger for students. Some parents took their children home and others allowed them to finish the school day. The school has a large Latino population and is the most diverse among Alpine School District's nine high schools, Bird said. Orem is a city of about 94,000 residents with a higher portion of Latinos than the state average. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert's children attended the school years ago, and he tweeted that \"It's a community close to our hearts. My prayers are with the students and staff.\" The school plans to investigate if the suspect had had been acting in a way recently that should have been addressed by school officials prior to the attack, Bird said. The school bans weapons, but doesn't have metal detectors or other security procedures to check students each day, she said. It's unlikely they'll implement any of those now, either, because they don't want to make the school feel like a prison, Bird said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Whitehurst reported from Salt Lake City. 0 Shares ",

First Lady Michelle Obama at an event at the White House on Nov. 14. (Manuel Balce Ceneta / Associated Press) Associated Press The mayor of a West Virginia town resigned Tuesday amid fallout from a racist\u00a0post on Facebook about First Lady Michelle Obama , an official said. Joe Coleman, the town recorder in Clay, W.V., said that Mayor Beverly Whaling's resignation is effective immediately. Whaling earlier apologized for her response to a post made by Clay County Development Corp. director Pamela Ramsey Taylor after Republican Donald Trump 's election as president. Taylor's post said, \"It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\" Whaling responded: \"Just made my day Pam.\" Taylor told WCHS-TV on Monday night that she was put on leave. Clay's town council planned to discuss the issue at a previously scheduled meeting Tuesday evening. The post, first reported by WSAZ-TV , caused a backlash and prompted calls for Taylor and Whaling to be fired. The post was shared hundreds of times on social media before it was deleted. The Facebook pages of Taylor and Whaling couldn't be found Monday. In a follow-up Facebook post captured in screenshots, Taylor asked people not to share her original message and said it was in \u201cno way\u201d intended to be racist. She said she was \u201creferring to my personal opinion of the attractiveness, not the color of the skin.\u201d She also apologized for \u201cany hurt my post may have caused,\u201d while defending her right to express an opinion.\u00a0 Clay County Sheriff Garrett Samples told WSAZ that threats had been made against Taylor and Whaling, as well as other county workers. The nonprofit Clay County Development Corp. provides services to elderly and low-income residents in Clay County. It is funded through state and federal grants and local fees. It is not affiliated with the town of Clay, which is about 50 miles east of Charleston. According to the nonprofit organization\u2019s tax filings, in 2013 Taylor earned nearly $80,000 in reportable compensation as executive director. Owens Brown, director of the NAACP\u2019s\u00a0West Virginia chapter, is among those calling for the removal of both women. \"I feel so it's unfortunate that people still have these racist undertones,\" Brown said. \"Unfortunately, this is a reality that we are dealing with in America today. There's no place for these types of attitudes in our state.\" African Americans make up about 4%\u00a0of West Virginia's 1.8 million residents, according to the U.S. census. About 77%\u00a0of Clay County residents supported Trump in the Nov. 8 election. In 2012, President Obama received 31%\u00a0of the county vote when Republican Mitt Romney easily carried the state. Last week in Kentucky, Republican Dan Johnson defeated incumbent Democrat Linda Belcher in Bullitt County in a race for the state House of Representatives despite a series of Facebook posts by Johnson that depicted President Obama and his wife as monkeys. Republican officials, including likely new House Speaker Jeff Hoover, had called on Johnson to drop out of the race. But Hoover declared last week that Johnson would be \"welcome in our caucus.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump , nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) More than 150 University of Illinois at Chicago students walked out of classes on Nov. 15, 2016, to protest the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Patrick M. O'Connell Chicago Tribune Students troubled and angered by Donald Trump 's victory in the presidential election gathered Tuesday on the campus quad at the University of Illinois at Chicago to denounce the businessman. At the lunchtime rally, several hundred students listened and chanted as a series of speakers lambasted Trump as racist, misogynist, divisive and dangerous for the United States. \"It is easy to say 'Not my president,' but in reality the damage has been done,\" student organizer Joe Padilla told the diverse crowd of backpack-wearing students via megaphone. \"So what we are to do now is not to reject all those who voted for Donald Trump but three things: educate, agitate and organize!\" Students at campuses across Chicago walked out of classes Nov. 15, 2016, to protest the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Padilla, 21, a junior from Downers Grove who is studying history and teaching, urged students to sign a petition to make UIC a sanctuary campus for students in the U.S. without legal permission. He also expressed alarm at what he called an increase in hate crimes nationwide in the days since Trump was elected. \"Now more than ever we need to reject hate, intolerance, discrimination and intimidation,\" Padilla said. The demonstration was nestled in a UIC quad near one of the student centers and a classroom building, so it did not affect city streets, unlike the protests last week near Trump Tower, in the Loop and on Lake Shore Drive. A few UIC campus and Chicago police officers looked on from afar. Student Robin Penn heard about the rally by word of mouth and decided to take a few minutes to attend. Penn, a 21-year-old education major from Logan Square, said the policies of the Green Party and Jill Stein were more closely aligned with her views, but she ended up voting for Hillary Clinton. Trump, she said, represents the opposite of what the country should stand for and \"is for everything I'm completely against.\" \"It's important so the world knows we're not OK with this,\" Penn said. Later Tuesday afternoon at the University of Chicago , a similar sized group of students held a rally on the main quadrangle. ",

    "text": "By James Hohmann November 15 at 10:08 AM Follow @JamesHohmann President Obama listens to a question during a news conference in the Brady press briefing room at the White House yesterday. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Barack Obama has deluded himself with the misguided hope that Donald Trump will not even try to follow through on many of his biggest campaign promises. He is consoling himself with the hope that, if he does, the new president will be measured, self-restrained and respectful of custom. That he will \u201cstudy \u2026 deeply\u201d and \u201clook at the facts.\u201d That logic and reason, not emotion or ideology, will drive him above all else. The lame-duck president has convinced himself that Republicans probably won\u2019t go through with repealing Obamacare when they realize just how hard it will be. Ditto with the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. \u201cReality has a way of asserting itself,\u201d Obama reasoned. \u201cI also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately he\u2019s pragmatic in that way.\u201d -- Is Obama really that na\u00efve? Probably not. He is just wallowing in a state of denial and has resorted to wishful thinking as a coping mechanism. It is a natural psychological condition that afflicts most human beings grieving a major loss, at least for a time. Presidents are not immune. For a little over an hour yesterday afternoon, Americans saw a 55-year-old who has not come to grips with just how big a blow Trump\u2019s victory is to his legacy and his party. He rationalized. He downplayed. He justified. He minimized. With all the trappings of the presidency still his, it hasn\u2019t fully sunk in yet. And it might not for 66 more days, when Trump gets sworn in on the West Front of the Capitol \u2014\u00a0and Obama begins living as a civilian in Kalorama. -- Trying to project reassurance, circumspection and a sense of continuity, Obama came across at times as both nonchalant and almost ambivalent about the results. He expressed confidence in how hard it is to move the levers of power. \u201cThe federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It\u2019s an ocean liner,\u201d he said. But with the stroke of a pen Trump could instantly undo much of what Obama has pushed with through executive action during the second term. And the new president will have Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. -- Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, in her 1969 book \u201cOn Death and Dying,\u201d identified the five stages of grief as denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Obama is clearly still in stage one. Obama waves as he leaves the White House, bound for Europe. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) -- Other Democrats have already progressed further along in their recovery over the past seven days. The protesters chanting \u201cnot my president\u201d in the streets every night are angry (stage two). The liberals who won\u2019t stop talking about how Hillary Clinton won the popular vote are in the bargaining phase (stage three). Many more went right into depression (stage four), almost to the point of being inconsolably paralyzed by it. A bunch of Democratic groups and lobbying firms scheduled parties around Washington this week, assuming folks would be in a mood to celebrate. But several events that took place last night were sparsely attended, since so many movers and shakers just want to sit in their basements and drink alone. Meanwhile, the intensifying debate over who should chair the Democratic National Committee\u00a0has forced acceptance (stage five) in some quarters. -- The Republican establishment already had to work through this grieving process vis-\u00e0-vis Trump in the spring. Pretty much everyone in the GOP reached the acceptance phase by Election Day. Obama speaks. (Andrew Harnik/AP) -- Obama is a textbook case of denial right now. The president allowed himself to hear what he wanted to hear during his 90-minute sit-down with Trump last Thursday. His successor somehow managed to both reassure and flatter him. Perhaps Trump privately told him that he was not serious about many of his priorities and stressed that they are merely opening bids in a negotiation. It is also possible that the same confirmation bias that\u00a0caused so many in the mainstream media to tune out all the signals that Trump was on the verge of pulling off the biggest political upset since at least \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d has now apparently convinced Obama that his successor is not actually about to massively roll back many of his proudest achievements, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. (Trump may not be ideological, but his administration will be full of committed movement conservatives who are focused on systematically unwinding the regulatory state that Obama built up. And Trump\u2019s advisers are already sketching out plans to use the budget reconciliation process to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act.) Taking questions from reporters for the first time since the election, before boarding Air Force One for his flight to Athens, Greece, Obama declared that he will reassure U.S.\u00a0allies that Trump never actually believed what he said about NATO. Never mind that, in the hours before he said this, the president-elect was on the telephone with Vladimir Putin \u2014 the single biggest threat to the transatlantic alliance \u2014 pledging to improve \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d relations and agreeing that their aides will set up a face-to-face meeting . -- What a difference a few days makes. Last week, making his closing argument against Trump, Obama told audiences: \u201cWho you are [and]\u00a0what you are does not change once you become president. It magnifies who you are. You have more power \u2026 so folks will enable you to be more of who you are. It will shine a spotlight on who you are.\u201d Yesterday, he took the opposite view: \u201cThis office has a way of waking you up. My advice to the president-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that.\u201d \u201cOf course I\u2019ve got concerns,\u201d Obama allowed later, when another journalist asked basically the same question that had already been asked three times. \u201cThere are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.\u201d But he pointedly declined to say whether he still believes Trump is unqualified to be president. In fact, when pressed, Obama praised his \u201cgregarious\u201d successor whom \u2014\u00a0behind the same podium in the same briefing room \u2014\u00a0he once called \u201ca carnival barker.\u201d Trump checks out Paul Ryan's balcony at the Capitol last week. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty) -- The outgoing president spoke as if a guy who channeled Jean-Batiste Colbert on the campaign trail will become an Adam Smith-like acolyte of open markets once he gets briefed on how \u201ca global supply chain\u201d actually works. \u201cWhen it comes to trade, I think when you\u2019re governing, it will become increasingly apparent that \u2026 it\u2019s not as simple as it might have seemed,\u201d Obama said. On the Iran deal, he explained: \u201cMy suspicion is, is that when the president-elect comes in, and he\u2019s consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts.\u2026 When you\u2019re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you\u2019re more likely to look at the facts. That is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris agreement.\u201d \u201cDo I think that the new administration will make some changes? Absolutely,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they\u2019re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us.\u201d As Politico\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere notes , \u201cThis is precisely the kind of argument that Republicans in Congress have felt so patronized by over the last eight years, and one that is completely out of whack with the shake to the system delivered by Trump\u2019s campaign, which racked up few political debts to anyone as he claimed victory.\u201d President Obama boards Marine One on the South Lawn last night.

Half the country is exultant because Trump has promised to undo everything Obama has done over the past eight years. The other half of the country is alarmed that a new age of bigotry and inwardness has seized the country. \u2026 This has been Obama\u2019s pattern. At times when passion is called for, he\u2019s cerebral and philosophical and taking the long view \u2014 so long that it frustrates those living in the present.\u201d -- Obama conveyed a similar message during two conference calls with supporters after the news\u00a0conference. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, progress doesn\u2019t follow a straight line.\u00a0It zigs and zags, and sometimes it moves forward and sometimes it moves backwards or moves sideways,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, as a consequence, I think it is fine for everybody to feel stressed, sad, discouraged for a while, but I\u2019m giving you like a week and a half to get over it.\u2026 By next week and Thanksgiving \u2026 you\u2019re going to have to be in a more positive place.\u2026 So don't mope.\u201d Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

(Joshua Roberts/Reuters) -- Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani is the leading candidate for secretary of state, the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal says on A1. \"I will NOT be attorney general,\" Rudy said at an event last night. Trump aides have also considered former U.S. ambassador John Bolton as a contender, but the close relationship between Giuliani and Trump was a \u201cmajor consideration,\"\u00a0 per Damian Paletta . \"For Mr. Trump, it is a choice between a longtime friend and ally in New York, Mr. Giuliani, and a hawkish conservative diplomat, Mr. Bolton, who called last year for the U.S. to bomb Iran. A final decision could be several weeks away \u2026 and other candidates could still emerge.\"\u00a0Personnel deliberations are likely to quicken today, when newly installed transition team chairman Mike Pence arrives in New York from Orlando, where he met last night with Republican governors. The former New York mayor said last night that Trump will likely focus much of his early foreign policy strategy on destroying the Islamic State, setting aside more vexing problems in the Middle East and elsewhere to focus on the militant group. \u201cISIS, short-term I believe, is the greatest danger and not because ISIS is in Iraq and in Syria, but because ISIS did something al-Qaeda never did \u2014 ISIS was able to spread itself around the world,\u201d Giuliani said, speaking during a Monday evening appearance at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council gathering. He also signaled strong interest in potentially serving as Trump\u2019s secretary of state, going into \u201cgreat detail\u201d about how his foreign policy views overlap with those of the president-elect.

Bush's former national security advisers, who unlike many other Bush alums shrewdly refrained from criticizing Trump during the campaign.

The Trump International operates out of the Old Post Office Building, which is owned by the federal government.

That email is being sought by a prominent Democratic labor lawyer who says he wants to expose waste in the Republican administration.

Neither camp has spelled out the details of their future relationship, Paul Farhi writes . \u201cBut even if Bannon and the website sever all ties, they will face an unusual, and awkward, situation: Bannon would be the former executive of a media organization that openly supported his political patron who will serve the president in a senior capacity while his media organization continues to cover him and his new boss.\u201d Adding yet another layer of entanglement:\u00a0one of Breitbart\u2019s primary financial backers is billionaire hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, whose daughter, Rebekah, is part of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team. \u201cThey were the house organ for Trump and will obviously remain so,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, former Breitbart editor at large.

From Karoun Demirjian : \u201cThe former head of Breitbart news, Bannon has published stories taking aim at Muslims, Jews, women and African Americans, as well as making his own allegedly anti-Semitic statements. But Republicans seem unwilling to judge Bannon on that track record \u2014 or even accept that he bears responsibility for the more incendiary headlines \u2026\u201d \u201cDid he write it? Give me something that he wrote,\u201d said Rep.

Under the site\u2019s founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, accusations of \u2018racism\u2019 were dismissed as \u2018cultural Marxism.\u2019 The attacks lobbed at Bannon, one plumbing [a] 2007 divorce record for evidence of anti-Semitism, resemble the ones that failed to stop Trump\u2019s rise. There is even talk of more Breitbart reporters joining Bannon at the White House, in roles that do not require Senate confirmation.\u201d \u201cBannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds,\u201d white nationalist thinker Richard Spencer wrote last night on Twitter. \u201cBannon is not a \u2018chief of staff,\u2019 which requires a \u2018golden retriever\u2019 personality. He'll be freed up to chart Trump's macro trajectory.\u201d -- In an interview with the\u00a0 New York Times , Bannon rejected what he called \"ethno-nationalist\u201d tendencies of some in the movement, saying he believes his enemies are misstating his views and the views of many Trump supporters: \u201cThese people are patriots,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love their country. They just want their country taken care of. ...\u00a0It\u2019s not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, aren\u2019t bad guys \u2014 racists, anti-Semites. But that\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d\u00a0 -- The over-the-top praise for Priebus is a sign of how far the media has lowered the bar for Trump, Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias argues. \u201cTrump\u2019s elevation to the presidency has people worried about everything from the collapse of America\u2019s democratic institutions to the spectacle of violence in the streets. But it\u2019s worth recalling that any presidency also features a range of more or less banal crises in which the fate of the nation and the world is nonetheless at stake. Can Trump really tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran without completely destablizing the Persian Gulf, for example? I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m sure that Trump is not sure, and I\u2019m frankly skeptical that Priebus is the right person to figure it out. It\u2019s great that Trump has decided to make the premier digital popularizer of white nationalism the second most important person in his White House rather than the first. But the presidency is still a really big job that Trump has no relevant experience for. More to the point, the country needs people who can help Trump actually run the government.\u201d -- Analysis: Less than a week into Trump\u2019s transition, and\u00a0 The New Yorker\u2019s John Cassidy argues that he has already pulled a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d from rhetoric espoused during his populist campaign: \u201cTo sum up, this is the prospect we are facing. A populist but semi-engaged President who is less interested in governing than in soaking up adulation at big rallies. (He might hold more of them even though the campaign is over...). Meanwhile, his cronies and members of the permanent establishment make many of the actual decisions, which will largely benefit the already rich, including the ruling family. Debt mushrooms as El Presidente approves prestige construction projects but not the taxes needed to pay for them. And skilled propagandists, like Bannon, whip up nationalist fervor to keep the masses diverted from what is really going on. We\u2019ve seen this movie before, many times. But not here in the United States.\" Trump protesters walk through downtown Santa Ana, Calif. (Ana Venegas/\u00a0AP) AMERICA IS DIVIDED: -- A Michigan police officer is under criminal investigation after he was spotted barreling by a \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d rally in a pickup truck adorned with Confederate flags. He was suspended and has now resigned.\u00a0( Lindsey Bever ) -- Chaos erupted on the sprawling greens of Brown University after students began tearing up and snapping in half American flags that were set up for a Veterans Day ceremony. The move prompted a counter protest from other students, who staged a sit-in to protect the remaining flags. ( Susan Svrluga ) -- More than 300 students at Baylor University gathered to walk to class with a girl who said she was shoved off the sidewalk and called the n-word by a fellow student, who declared he was \u201cjust trying to make America great again.\u201d ( Cleve R.

That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.\u201d ( LA Times ) -- A social studies instructor who teaches at a school for recent immigrants shared some of the heartbreaking letters he received from students after Trump\u2019s victory in a Post op-ed . \u201cI\u2019m worried that this country is not going to be any better than my country,\u201d said one female student from Afghanistan. \u201cNobody listens to women in my country, and now the president will do the same here?\u201d Said another student from El Salvador: \u201cAll my dreams can fall down because of a decision that people made last night. I don\u2019t understand how a person who says bad things, that hurt people, is the head of a country \u2026 I have faced many troubles in order to come here. I don\u2019t know how but I have to continue.\u201d -- Trump\u2019s proposed deportation plans could have potentially severe consequences for the U.S. economy, according to a newly-published National Bureau of Economic Research analysis, which offers the first detailed estimates of how a mass deportation policy would affect specific industries. From Wonkblog\u2019s Max Ehrenfreund : \u201cUnsurprisingly, the greatest number of undocumented workers \u2014 1.3 million \u2014 were employed in leisure and hospitality, followed by the construction sector, which employed 1.1 million. These two sectors were followed by professional and business services, which \u2026 included nearly 1 million undocumented workers. If all undocumented workers were immediately removed from the country, [researchers] forecast a decline of 9 percent in agricultural production and declines of 8 percent in construction and leisure and hospitality over the long term.\u201d And relative to the overall economy, the effect would be a decline in manufacturing output of $74 billion over the long term.

Even in Massachusetts, a locus of progressive politics, the days surrounding [Trump\u2019s] victory on Tuesday have seen reports of incidents grounded in racial, ethnic, and religious bias. Even before the election, ugly graffiti appeared at the top of Mount Tom, a rocky peak on the Connecticut River. On Friday, after reading about the anti-Semitic and racist messages on the mountain, a small group climbed to the top with buckets and brushes to scrub away the hateful messages.

Both men have said in the past week that action to repeal the Affordable Care Act, secure the southern U.S. border and cut taxes are among their shared priorities. That show of unity has mostly quieted two groups of Republicans that have been vexed by how Ryan has handled Trump.\u201d Several members made clear that, although Trump\u2019s victory may have eased the internal party tensions that threatened Ryan\u2019s speakership, it has not eliminated them entirely: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him what he wants to change \u2014 what\u2019s going to be different the next two years\u2026?\u201d said Freedom Caucus co-founder Rep.

The goal was to see firsthand the place that perhaps more than any other has climate scientists worried about melting ice and rising sea levels. The idea was that the secretary, being the highest ranking U.S. official ever to visit Antarctica, would then take that experience back to the international climate meetings now underway in Marrakech, Morocco, where he is slated to speak this week on the dangers of a warming planet. Somewhere along the way, though, the election of [Trump] sort of shattered that thought glacier \u2014 leaving Kerry with a more complicated message, by any stretch. When Kerry reaches Marrakech this week and addresses the world, he will indeed have seen firsthand what few others ever will. But the political ground will have entirely shifted since he left.\u201d Gwen Ifill speaks in 2012. (Frederick M.

[But some] professors from the Psychology Department \u2014 and other academic departments \u2014 did not agree with the use of this quote. Their letter to Sullivan argued that in light of Jefferson\u2019s owning of slaves and other racist beliefs, she should refrain from quoting Jefferson in email communications.\u201d \u201cFor many of us, the inclusion of Jefferson quotations in these e-mails undermines the message of unity, equality and civility that you are attempting to convey,\u201d the email said.

By REUTERS on Publish Date November 15, 2016. Photo by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed ATHENS \u2014 President Obama , in some of his strongest language since Donald J. Trump \u2019s election last week, on Tuesday warned against the rise of nationalistic tribalism, apparently a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Stephen K. Bannon , a hard-right nationalist, to a top position. \u201cI do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an \u2018us\u2019 and a \u2018them,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks came in an hourlong news conference in Athens on his final trip overseas as president. He had come to Greece partly to bolster Greek hopes of further debt relief from its European partners, which will meet on Dec. 5 to consider giving this ailing nation another pass on its mountain of debt. But Mr. Trump\u2019s election last week subverted Mr. Obama\u2019s top foreign policy priorities, and he seemed to have arrived in Athens in a reflective mood. On Monday, just hours before he flew across the Atlantic, Mr. Obama offered conciliatory remarks on Mr. Trump and his coming administration during a White House news conference. He declined on Monday to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Mr. Bannon \u2014 a media executive whose website, Breitbart.com , has promoted white nationalist, racist and anti-Semitic views \u2014 as chief White House strategist and senior counselor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story By Tuesday, however, Mr. Obama seemed to reverse himself, making pointed remarks about the dangers of overturning his administration\u2019s track record on race relations or returning to decades-old forms of bigotry. \u201cIn the United States, we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just for the minority groups that are subjected to that kind of discrimination or, in some cases in the past violence, but because we don\u2019t then realize our potential as a country when we\u2019re preventing blacks or Latinos or Asians or gays or women from fully participating in the project of building American life.\u201d Mr. Obama was unapologetic and unequivocal on his record of inclusiveness. \u201cSo my vision\u2019s right on that issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it may not always win the day in the short term in any particular political circumstance, but I\u2019m confident it will win the day over the long term.\u201d Mr. Obama said that the desire for change was a huge factor in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cSometimes people just feel as if we want to try something to see if we can shake things up, and that I suspect was a significant phenomenon,\u201d he said. He said that while Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and Britain\u2019s surprising vote in June to leave the European Union differed in important respects, the two electoral earthquakes both grew out of dislocations that have resulted from of a rapidly changing and globalizing world. \u201cGlobalization combined with technology combined with social media and constant information have disrupted people\u2019s lives, sometimes in very concrete ways,\u201d Mr. Obama said while standing next to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece. \u201cA manufacturing plant closes, and suddenly an entire town no longer has what was the primary source of employment.\u201d He said the effects can be psychological as well, making people \u201cless certain of their national identities or their place in the world.\u201d \u201cWhen you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders, very unconventional candidates, having considerable success, then obviously there is something there that is being tapped into,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cA suspicion of globalization. A desire to rein in its excesses.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The increasing pain felt by working people had led to a growing suspicion of elites and governing institutions, he said. \u201cAnd that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity and that can be a volatile mix,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama complimented Mr. Tsipras on the political and structural reforms he had pushed through \u2014 reforms that severely damaged Mr. Tsipras\u2019s popularity in Greece. And he said he planned to urge others in Europe to forgive more of Greece\u2019s debt. Mr. Obama will fly on Wednesday to Berlin, where he will spend at least two days in meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and then in a meeting with the leaders of France, Britain and Spain. Mr. Trump has questioned the value of NATO, the bedrock Western military alliance between Europe and the United States. But Mr. Obama said that Mr. Trump had assured him during their Oval Office meeting last week that he remained committed to NATO. Also on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said he believed that \u201cthere is a window in the next few weeks\u201d to resolve the 42-year-old standoff between Greece and Turkey on the island of Cyprus. Turkish troops have occupied the northern third of the island since an invasion in 1974. For his part, Mr. Tsipras again denounced Europe\u2019s decision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to embark on a program of \u201cdisastrous austerity, which made the problems more acute instead of resolving them.\u201d He noted that Greece\u2019s economy at its worst had contracted by 25 percent and that its unemployment rate had peaked at 27 percent.

Reid To Trump: Rescind Bannon Appointment 1:42 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161116014843if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/809658435564\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said President-elect Donald Trump has only \"deepened\" the country's divisions since his electoral victory and called on the Republican to immediately rescind Steve Bannon's appointment to a top White House role. \"President-elect Trump must act immediately to make Americans...feel like they are welcomed in his America,\" Reid said Tuesday on the Senate floor. \"Healing the wounds he inflicted will take more than words, talk is cheap and tweets are cheaper.\" \"But so far, Mr. President, rather than healing these wounds, Trump's actions have deepened them,\" he added. The Nevada Democrat listed off a number of hate crimes that have taken place since last Tuesday's election and accused the president-elect of choosing a \"champion of white supremacists\" to have the most powerful position in Trump's administration. Bannon's appointment as \"chief strategist and senior counselor\" sparked outrage among Democrats and left some Republicans struggling to defend the decision to give the former head of Breitbart News a top post in the new White House. The site has been a hub for the \"alt-right\" movement that has been associated with white nationalism and anti-Semitism. \"If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon...As long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office it will be impossible to take Trump's efforts to heal the nation seriously,\" Reid said Bannon served as chief executive of Trump's successful presidential campaign and, over the weekend, was given his new role alongside Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, who will serve as White House chief of staff. Related: The Alt-Right is Coming to the White House The move resulted in immediate backlash from the Anti-Defamation League and Council on American-Islamic Relations, as well as a slew of Democratic lawmakers. Ahead of Reid's speech, a group of Democratic senators held a press conference Tuesday afternoon alongside a blue \"FIRE BANNON\" sign calling on Trump to reverse his decision in order to sooth fears that his election will unleash a wave of hate against ethnic and religious minorities. \"Quite frankly it's sad that we are having a debate about whether a white supremacist should serve as a senior counselor to the president elect,\" Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said. Several participants noted that Trump had an opportunity to work with Democrats on issues like infrastructure, but stressed that they would not back down on issues related to civil rights and equality. \"President-elect Trump will forever poison the well with Congress and the American people by appointing figures like Steve Bannon, whose stock and trade is hate and violence against the American people,\" Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) said. Members of Trump's campaign have dismissed criticism of Bannon's appointment by pointing to his Harvard business degree and surprise success helping to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. \"The guy I know is a guy that isn't any of those [controversial] things,\" Priebus said on TODAY on Monday. \"Here's a guy who's Harvard Business School\u2026 He's a guy who is very, very smart.\" Andrew Rafferty ",

Barbara Boxer filed legislation Tuesday to abolish the Electoral College that has propelled the Manhattan mogul into the White House. Noting that Hillary Clinton got more votes than Trump but still lost the election, Boxer said it is time to do with an \"outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society.\" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, Dec. 14, 2009. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP \"When all the ballots are counted, Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by a margin that could exceed two million votes, and she is on track to have received more votes than any other presidential candidate in history except Barack Obama,\" said Boxer, who like Clinton is a Democrat. \"This is the only office in the land where you can get more votes and still lose the presidency.\" Boxer also remarked that Trump himself Tweeted in 2012 that the electoral college \"is a disaster for Democracy.\" This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 \"I couldn't agree more,\" Sen. Boxer said on Tuesday. \"One person, one vote!\" Boxer's bill, which calls for an amendment to the Constitution, is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Congress . And there was no immediate comment from Trump's team. But the President-elect has even recently been both for and against the Electoral College. In an interview aired Sunday evening with \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said he was opposed saying, \"I'm not going to change my mind just because I won.\" But on Monday, Trump was Tweeting a different tune. The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! \u2014 Donald J.

    "text": "'He will always be my son': Mother defends former football standout after latest arrest Cliff Harris Cliff Harris, 25, arrested in Fresno County. Cliff Harris, 25, arrested in Fresno County. (Clovis Police Department) Veronica Rocha A former football standout from\u00a0Fresno\u00a0whose NFL prospects were\u00a0derailed by repeated run-ins with the law\u00a0has been arrested once again on suspicion of theft and drug possession. On Saturday, 25-year-old Cliff Harris, a\u00a0former Oregon Ducks cornerback, was taken into custody by a Clovis, Calif., police officer investigating\u00a0a disturbance at a party supply store just after 6:30 p.m. \u201cHarris was booked into Fresno County Jail for theft, possession of a controlled substance, possession of paraphernalia, and revocation of post-release community supervision,\u201d the department said. The episode is the latest in a string of incidents that have foiled the Edison High School\u00a0alum\u2019s NFL ambitions\u00a0and prompted his mother to publish an anguished defense of her son on Facebook.\u00a0 \u201cMany of you will laugh, mock and make jokes\u2026 And it's ok if that's what you want to do..,\u201d wrote Lizette Harris. \u201cRegardless of Cliff going through one of the hardest times of his life, regardless of him fighting through all the demons that's trying destroy him and regardless that he never became that NFL LOCK DOWN CORNER. He will always be my son.\u201d\u00a0 Her\u00a0plea that friends and family pray for her son was made all the more poignant by the release of a booking photographed of a glowering, unkempt Harris that was shared widely on social media.\u00a0 In 2015, Harris was placed on probation for three years and sentenced to a year in jail in connection with setting a grass fire in Fresno. During his sentencing, \u00a0a court-appointed\u00a0psychiatrist told a Fresno County judge that Harris had the degenerative brain disease CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the Fresno Bee reported . Athletes whose heads are\u00a0repeatedly exposed to blunt force trauma and can develop the disease. The judge ordered Harris to continue\u00a0taking psychotropic medication as well as maintain his appointments, according to court records. The Fresno native\u2019s football career began at Edison High School and then continued at the University of Oregon, where he was named an All-American as a kick returner in 2010. The following year however, Harris was kicked off the team after he was stopped by a state trooper for allegedly driving 118 mph on a suspended license. Despite that setback, Harris\u00a0signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles in April 2012, but was released a few months later. At the time, Harris talked about his troubles and told an Eagles reporter, \u201cI was young at the time and I made some young mistakes and I've matured from it.\u201d In January of 2013, he was signed by the New York Jets , but was cut after being arrested on a marijuana possession charge.

(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri) If there's ever been a giant list of things you definitely shouldn't do in a civilized society, threatening to murder the democratically elected leader with a sniper rifle is probably right up there at the top. Apparently nobody told Matt Harrigan, CEO -- well, former CEO, anyway -- of network security firm PacketSled. In an ill-advised fit of blind rage, Harrigan took to Facebook to voice his stance on the future Trump presidency, but rather than providing reasoned, sane arguments to support his feelings, Harrigan simply vowed to murder Trump instead. Harrigan's violent rhetoric was quickly preserved with screenshots and rapidly gained attention on Reddit , where it was brought to the attention of PacketSled. Harrigan, as you might expect, performed one of the quickest reversals in the history of mankind, claiming that it was all a joke and a misunderstanding: \"My recent Facebook comment was intended to be a joke, in the context of a larger conversation, and only privately shared as such. Anyone who knows me, knows that I do not engage in this form of rhetoric with any level of seriousness and the comment most certainly does not represent my real personal views in any regard. I apologize if anything that I said was either taken seriously, was offensive, or caused any legitimate concern.\" Best Regards, Matt Harrigan But threatening to kill the president isn't exactly easy to undo, and his company wasted no time in distancing itself from him. On Monday, PacketSled noted that it is fully cooperating with the Secret Service , should a more in-depth investigation take root: More from BGR ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo It won\u2019t be easy to keep the basic architecture of Obamacare while removing its least popular pieces. Credit Gareth Smit for The New York Times Before Obamacare, it could be hard to buy your own insurance if you\u2019d already had a health problem like cancer. An insurance company might have decided not to sell any insurance to someone like you. It might have agreed to cover you, but not cover cancer care. Or it might have offered you a comprehensive policy, but at some incredibly high price that you could never have paid. Donald J. Trump says he wants to do away with much of Obamacare, but he has signaled that parts of the law that banned those practices are good policy he\u2019d want to keep. \u201cI like those very much,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal last week about the law\u2019s rules that prevent discrimination based on pre-existing conditions. The pre-existing conditions policies are very popular. Nearly everyone has relatives or friends with illnesses in their past \u2014 cancer , arthritis , depression, even allergies \u2014 that could have shut them out of the individual insurance markets before Obamacare, so it\u2019s an issue that hits close to home for many Americans. But keeping those provisions while jettisoning others is most likely no fix at all. Those policies that make the insurance market feel fairer for sick Americans who need it can really throw off the prices for everyone else. That\u2019s why Obamacare also includes less popular policies designed to balance the market with enough young, healthy people. Imagine you\u2019re that patient with cancer. You really want health insurance, and you\u2019re probably willing to pay a lot to get it. If the law requires insurance companies to offer you a policy, you are very likely to buy it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now imagine you\u2019re a young, healthy person without any health problems. Your budget is tight, and health insurance is expensive. You might decide you\u2019ll be fine without insurance, since you can always buy it later, when you\u2019re the one with a pessimistic diagnosis. Before Obamacare, several states tried policies like this, and required insurance companies to sell insurance to everyone at the same price, regardless of health histories. The results were nearly the same everywhere: Prices went way up; enrollment went way down ; and insurance companies fled the markets. Some states hobbled along with small, expensive markets . Some experienced total market collapse and repealed the policies. Prices in those markets typically became so high that they were really a good deal only for people who knew they\u2019d use a lot of health care services. And the sicker the insurance pool got, the more the companies would charge for their health plans. The health law attempts to broaden the pool by offering financial assistance to middle-class people. By limiting how much people can be asked to pay for insurance, the law\u2019s subsidies help make the purchase more attractive for healthier customers. That\u2019s the law\u2019s carrot. Then there\u2019s the stick: The law says that if you don\u2019t buy insurance, and you could have afforded it, you have to pay a fine. That rule is designed to discourage people from gaming the system by waiting until they\u2019re sick. The mandate remains the law\u2019s least popular provision. It\u2019s Not So Easy to Offer Insurance to Everyone Before Obamacare, several states, including New York, required health insurers to ignore their customers\u2019 health histories, but didn\u2019t require individuals to buy insurance. Premiums soared. Average monthly premium in New York 2006 ",

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel greets Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich during a visitation for the late Cardinal Francis George on April 22, 2015, at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy A city-funded economic development group will pay for Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's trip to Rome later this week for the ceremony elevating Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich to cardinal. World Business Chicago is covering costs for the mayor, his wife, Amy Rule, and staff who also are going, Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins said. Collins said \"no taxpayer dollars\" were involved because the group raised private funds for the trip. But World Business Chicago, which has said its financial records are not subject to the state's open records law, got $1.2 million in city funding from hotel tax proceeds this year. That's a contrast with other city and state elected officials, who are either using campaign or personal funds to pay for the trip, which the Emanuel administration said Tuesday includes more than 80 civic, faith, elected and business leaders, along with students from two city high schools. Collins did not respond to a question about how the Rome visit fits in with the group's mission to promote economic development and create jobs in the city. Emanuel serves as chairman of World Business Chicago, and it's not uncommon for the group to send mayors and other city officials overseas to promote the city. In July 2015, Deputy Mayor Steven Koch \u2014 who heads up the mayor's economic development efforts \u2014 led a trade mission to China. Before that, the group sent Emanuel to China in 2013. And World Business Chicago paid for Mayor Richard M. Daley 's trips to China, Moscow and the United Arab Emirates. ",

    "text": "Kirsten Johnson 31 years old \u2022 Minneapolis I was literally undecided until I went into the voting booth. I was a strong advocate for Gary Johnson for most of the race, but I changed my mind after I saw him at a lackluster rally in town. Then Trump came through, and the energy and passion was astounding. He overflowed an airport hangar with 24 hours notice on a Sunday during a Vikings home game. Holy crap. So, in the end, I voted for the economy, against Obamacare and against a corrupt government, just as I was planning to for Johnson. But I also voted for the people, because Trump was the clear choice of the silent majority I eventually became a part of. 2 of 23 Nick Flores 39 years old \u2022 Sacramento, CA I voted for Donald Trump because he will deport illegal immigrants more than Clinton. As a legal immigrant who had to wait 13 years for an immigration visa approval and pass two health screens and an English language proficiency exam prior to entering the United States, I consider it an insult to to cater to criminals who disobeyed immigration laws and cut in front of all law-abiding immigration applicants waiting patiently to be approved. I have never received any government assistance, nor is it my goal to do so. My dignity disallows such a thought. To witness some illegal immigrants gaming the welfare system boils my blood. 3 of 23 Nicole Citro 47 years old \u2022 Burlington, Vt. Donald Trump came to Burlington, Vt. \u2014 Bernie Sanders\u2019s home town \u2014 in December. I stood in line with a few thousand people and was confronted by a few hundred people protesting Trump\u2019s appearance and those supporting him. I was still on the fence, but after that rally I knew without a doubt Trump was going to be our next president. He had tapped into what the everyday Joe \u2014 and Jane \u2014 were feeling but had become PC-shamed from expressing.  As Trump cleared each hurdle during the campaign, and I saw how the media, the establishment and celebrities tried to derail him, my hope began to grow that I would be able to witness their collective heads explode when he was successful. Tuesday night was beyond satisfying to watch unfold. I hope all the aforementioned have learned their lesson. I look forward to watching Trump make good on his plans to make America affordable, make America safe and make America work. I always thought it was great. 4 of 23 Erin Keefe 22 years old \u2022 Manchester, N.H. I am white, I am a woman, I am pro-choice, I am educated, and I voted for Donald Trump. The government needs to be run like a corporation, simple as that. Of course humanitarian issues are of concern to me, as they are to every American. His degrading language toward women bothers me, and his views on global warming are a problem for me. I do not 100 percent love Trump, but I am convinced he can lead this nation. I was part of the silent majority. My friends would bash those who leaned toward Trump and comment on how insane, uneducated and racist his supporters were. I was afraid to speak my mind because of the possibility it might hurt my reputation socially and professionally. I respect everyone\u2019s opinion and vote, and it\u2019s wrong to be ridiculed for supporting someone you have a right to support. I scrolled through my Facebook page on Election Day personally hurt. Friends accused Trump supporters of not loving them because they are gay, a woman, a person of color or an immigrant. My stomach dropped knowing what might happen if someone found out that I supported him and that they thought I did not love them for that. I voted for Donald Trump because he can create change for our country, economy and world. 5 of 23 Deniz Dolun 22 years old \u2022 Boca Raton, Fla. My entire family \u2014 five Muslim immigrants from Turkey \u2014 voted for Donald Trump in Florida because of the Democratic Party\u2019s pandering to Islamism. As people who have actually experienced Islamism in its purest form, back in Turkey, we supported the candidate who promised to help us fight that issue, regardless of any of his other policies. For us, the people of the Middle East, this election was just too important to hand over to someone such as Hillary Clinton. 6 of 23 \u00a0Diane Maus 61 years old \u2022 Suffern, N.Y. On Tuesday, I voted Republican for only the second time in my life. The media did the United States a huge disservice in covering this campaign. As I watched, I got the impression that voting was a mere formality. The commentary was all about how Hillary Clinton was set to get down to business once the pesky election was over. It was obvious watching the election returns on several networks that not one of them prepared for the possibility of Donald Trump triumphing. Why was that?  My vote was my only way to say: I am here and I count. I wish President-elect Trump all the best and have hope that Washington will, in the next four years, actually work for all Americans. 7 of 23 Howard Gaskill 77 years old \u2022 Georgetown, Del. I remember the Clintons from back when they tap danced around the Gennifer Flowers story. Then came Whitewater and then Hillary Clinton\u2019s billing records were nowhere to be found, and then there was Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton looked right at me through the TV screen and said \u201cI did not have . . .\u201d The lies never stopped. Then came the Clinton Foundation, foreign donations and the emails. I have 100 percent Clinton Fatigue. If Bernie Sanders had been on the ballot, I would have voted for him, even though I agree with him on virtually nothing. But he seems to be honest and stands up for his beliefs and not for enriching himself. 8 of 23 Phil McNeish \u00a057 years old \u2022 Roanoke, Va. \u00a0I am an independent voter who leans slightly to the left. I am a small business owner. I am not an uneducated, deplorable redneck. Donald Trump, despite his imperfections, will be the most left-leaning Republican president of all time. Hillary Clinton would have steered the country further to the extreme left, while Trump will be a good mix of left and right. We, in the middle, are weary of partisan bickering. Trump was our best hope of a president willing to compromise. 9 of 23 \u00a0Lori Myers \u00a051 years old \u2022 Houston \u00a0I voted for Donald Trump because the media was so incredibly biased. They were unhinged in their obvious role as the Clinton campaign propaganda machine. The collusion was just too much. \u00a0 10 of 23 Debra Knox \u00a061 years old \u2022 \u00a0Shallotte, N.C. \u00a0I am concerned about my impossibly expensive health insurance and the impact on my family. I am concerned about undocumented immigrants and the Democratic Party\u2019s propensity to give and give to everyone. The middle class is in dire condition. I haven\u2019t had a raise in 10 years. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of four more years heading in this direction. My decision was based on my fiscal needs. 11 of 23 George Erdner 65 years old \u2022 Duluth, Ga. It was time we had a businessman with strong executive skills leading our nation back to capitalism. We must reverse the trend toward socialism, and who better to make that change than a capitalist? 12 of 23 Christopher Todd 53 years old \u2022 Tampa I voted for Donald Trump on the calculated bet that he would nominate conservative Supreme Court justices. The Constitution is a social contract, not a poem to be variously interpreted. If people want to permit gay marriage or abortion for any reason, then make both legal through the legislature, not via an unelected oligarchy rewriting the Constitution. 13 of 23 Mackenzie Gans 28 years old \u2022 Las Vegas We need to focus less on individually placating all the groups that make American wonderful and more on solving issues related to the economy and foreign adversaries.  Tap-dancing around our national debt, our failure to contain Iran and North Korea, and our long-term unemployed citizens helps no one. 14 of 23 James Brady 74 years old \u2022 Tennessee I voted for Donald Trump based on my Christian values. I didn\u2019t know a lot about Trump but I knew too much about the Clintons. This country needs to get back on track with God, to give God praise, honor and glory each and every passing day. He is worthy. I pray for the new administration that will take office in January.  I believe if Hillary Clinton had won the election we would be dead in the water. Too many things she sought to get passed were against any Christian belief for those who are true to Christ. 15 of 23 Helene Berkowitz 37 years old \u2022 Hashmonaim, Israel Unlike most Americans, I know how to compartmentalize and separate my personal opinion of both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and my belief about who is better for the job. I have always said \u2014 years before Trump was ever interested in politics \u2014 that the country should be run like a business. Meaning the United States should be led by someone who knows how to delegate, and understands complex budgets, negotiation and leadership. That is why I voted for Trump.  I don\u2019t need my president to be nice to everyone and to give them a warm, fuzzy feeling. Get a bathrobe for that. I also don\u2019t have to agree with him on every single opinion or policy. I don\u2019t need to be friends with my president; I need him or her to lead the country, provide solutions for our problems and make a stronger and greater United States. 16 of 23 \u00a0Jim Barnacle \u00a066 years old \u2022 \u00a0Harrisburg, Pa. I don't believe Donald Trump is a racist, misogynist or homophobe. I think he will focus on making the economy better for American citizens and businesses. I'm hopeful that he will help our inner cities and help everyone reach their potential. I'm a 40-year veteran of law enforcement, and my two sons are cops as well. My three sons-in-law are in the military. Hillary Clinton convinced me that she does not support my profession or the military. I also believe the Clintons were wrong for accepting so much money for speeches. They were being paid for access, which is wrong. 17 of 23 Daniel Traynor \u00a046 years old \u2022 \u00a0Devils Lake, N.D. Because the part of America that grows your food, produces your energy and fights your wars believes the country needs a course correction. 18 of 23 Laura Johnson 49 years old \u2022 California Because I believe Donald Trump loves America and really wants what is best for all Americans, whether it be health care, jobs or just feeling safe in our country. I want my gay friends, my friends of many races, to be safe in their workplaces and homes and communities. I know that's very important to him. And I could never get past the email scandal and Benghazi with Hillary Clinton. That turned me off for good. My son is in the military. I just couldn't vote for her. I believe Trump is sincere in his love of country and his desire to make it better. I want to give him a chance. 19 of 23 Samantha Styler \u00a021 years old \u2022 \u00a0Gilbert, Ariz. I am a gay millennial woman and I voted for Donald Trump because I oppose the political correctness movement, which has become a fascist ideology of silence and ignorance. After months of going back and forth, I decided to listen to him directly and not through minced and filtered quotes from the mainstream media. 20 of 23 Marc Gratkowski 46 years old \u2022 Scranton, Pa. I favor Donald Trump's ideas on trade, his potential Supreme Court nominees, and his support for inner cities and educational opportunities. The WikiLeaks documents provided the most important reasons for defeating Hillary Clinton: her campaign's vile \"Catholic Spring\" revolution to weaken my church, and her foundations\u2019s links to foreign money, especially from the Uranium One deal and from countries that have provided funding to the Islamic State. But the \u201cCatholic Spring\u201d and her campaign's response to this revelation would have been enough on their own. 21 of 23 Marilyn Weydert 74 years old \u2022 Kenosha, Wis. I voted against Hillary Clinton, and for Donald Trump, because Clinton compromised our national security by putting classified information on a personal email account and allowed people without security clearances to access that information. As a retired federal employee with a security clearance, I have protected classified information. Failure to do so has resulted in prison for many, and rightly so. 22 of 23 Ron Sexton 61 years old \u2022 Tustin, Calif. Donald Trump is willing to be open, to be transparent and to tackle the problems we need handled as Americans. Fix immigration so immigrants can come here legally with full rights and not be disadvantaged. Support the rule of law and secure the border, and process violent criminals correctly. Fix the bad global trade rules. China buys up the United States while Google and Uber fail in China and Apple cannot even protect the iPhone name there. I think Trump is smart and has a chance to do good things for the United States. He is more of a doer than a politician. An inclusive president for all. 23 of 23 Shoanna Crowell 45 years old \u2022 Boston I voted for Jill Stein, which my friends all yelled was a vote for Donald Trump. I don't fully disagree. It was clear early on in the Democratic primary contest that the mainstream media discounted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) even when he was winning states. Then the Democratic National Committee emails came out, and I had proof of what I suspected. The Democrats and the mainstream media had handpicked their candidate and were manipulating us. They felt entitled to shove Hillary Clinton down our throats. I'm glad they didn't get away with it. Close ",

By Karen DeYoung November 15 at 1:26 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Sen. John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent his first shot across the bow of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security plans Tuesday, saying that any attempt to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia is unacceptable. \u201cWith the U.S. presidential transition underway, Vladi\u00admir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States,\u201d McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement released by his office. \u201cWe should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America\u2019s allies and attempted to undermine America\u2019s elections,\u201d he said. [ U.S. accuses Russia of \u2018barbarism\u2019 and war crimes in Syria ] Sen. John McCain has repeatedly come under attack from GOP nominee Donald Trump. Here are just a few of their rocky moments. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) McCain gave tepid support to Trump after the Republican nominating convention, then withdrew it in October after the leak of a 2005 recording revealing Trump making demeaning remarks about women, and then declined to speak about him as he headed toward his own reelection last week. His comments about Russia followed a telephone call between Trump and Putin on Monday and came amid reports of upheaval in the national security transition. In their conversation, the Kremlin said, Putin and Trump agreed that U.S.-Russia relations are \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and vowed to work together to improve them. Trump\u2019s office later said that they had discussed shared threats and challenges, and the long-term relationship between them. In his statement, McCain pointed out that Russia, in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, resumed large-scale bombardment Tuesday in Syria. [ Russian warplanes from Mediterranean carrier join Syria attacks ] \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAt the very least, the price of another \u2018reset\u2019 would be complicity in Putin and Assad\u2019s butchery of the Syrian people. \u201cThat is an unacceptable price for a great nation. When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side [of] those fighting tyranny,\u201d McCain added. \u201cThat is where we must stand again.\u201d Read more: ",

USA TODAY WASHINGTON \u2014 Billionaire casino moguls Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn have joined President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural committee and will help raise the millions needed to pull off the Jan. 20 event. As anticipated,\u00a0longtime Trump ally\u00a0Thomas Barrack\u00a0will serve as the committee's chairman, according to a statement released Tuesday by Trump's transition team.\u00a0Barrack, the founder of Colony Capital, hosted Trump's first big campaign fundraiser and helped establish a super PAC to promote his candidacy. Lew Eisenberg, who helped lead joint fundraising for Trump's general-election campaign and the Republican National Committee, is joining Texas businessman Roy Bailey as finance co-chairmen of the group. Wynn, Adelson and his physician wife Miriam Adelson are among 17 \"finance vice chairs\" announced Tuesday. Others include gambling titan Phil Ruffin, Wisconsin roofing magnate Diane Hendricks, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Florida real-estate developer Mel Sembler and Gail Icahn, wife of billionaire investor\u00a0Carl Icahn. President Obama's inaugural team raised $53 million for his 2009\u00a0swearing-in. No word yet on Trump's budget. ",

(Nov. 15) AP Families reunite outside Mountain View High School after five students were stabbed inside their high school Nov. 15, 2016, in Orem. (Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP) A straight-A Utah\u00a0high school student stabbed five boys in the school's locker room before stabbing himself Tuesday, authorities said. Mountain View High School in Orem was placed on lockdown after the incident, and a suspect was in custody, police said. Orem Police Chief Gary Giles said\u00a0shortly before 8 a.m. local time, a\u00a016-year-old student stabbed five\u00a0students in the locker room and then stabbed himself. Staff members confronted the student, boxing him into a small area, before a school resource police officer already in the building arrived on the scene. Giles said the officer\u00a0jolted the student with a Taser and took him into custody. He said the stab wounds, made with\u00a0a knife with a blade of about three inches,\u00a0were mostly to the neck and upper torso of the victims. \"There are a lot of different things we need to look at for a motive,\" Giles said. \"Was it a fight, is it somebody upset with somebody, is there more to it? And I don't know the answer to that.\" All five victims and the suspect were transported to area hospitals with injuries ranging from critical to fair, though none of the injuries were considered life-threatening, the Alpine School District said. District spokeswoman Kimberly Bird said the suspect was a new\u00a0sophomore student with excellent grades who had been home-schooled prior to this school year. He\u00a0had no prior disciplinary issues, she said. After the lockdown ended, counselors and social workers were made available at the school. Bird said a \"conversation\" about metal detectors at the school would take place in the district. Bird noted, however, that the attack\u00a0could have happened in a parking lot where metal detectors would have no impact. \"We hate the idea of metal detectors in our schools, just for the look and feel, and yet our kids safety is our most important priority,\" she said.\u00a0\"We need to have safe environments and safe schools.\" Mountain View High is a \u00a0four-year school with more than 1,400 students in Orem, a city of 90,000 people about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City.\u00a0After police determined that no further threat existed, and normal activities resumed in the school. \"At this point we are just trying to piece this all together,\" Giles said. \"Hopefully\u00a0at some point within the next few days we will have some answers.

Council member Jason Hubbard issued a brief statement condemning the \u201chorrific\u201d post and said \u201cracial intolerance isn\u2019t what this community is about.\u201d He apologized on behalf of the town to anyone who is offended, including Michelle Obama. Clay County Development Corp. director Pamela Ramsey Taylor made the post following Republican Donald Trump\u2019s election as president, saying: \u201cIt will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I\u2019m tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\u201d Whaling responded: \u201cJust made my day Pam.\u201d Taylor told WCHS-TV on Monday night that she was put on leave. Meanwhile, Whaling issued a written apology to news media outlets saying that her comment wasn\u2019t intended to be racist. \u201cI was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I\u2019m not in any way racist!\u201d Taylor did not return a call seeking comment. The post, first reported by WSAZ-TV, has caused a backlash and prompted calls for Taylor and Mayor Whaling to be fired. The post was shared hundreds of times on social media before it was deleted. The Facebook pages of Taylor and Whaling couldn\u2019t be found Monday. The nonprofit Clay County Development Corp. provides services to elderly and low-income residents in Clay County. It is funded through state and federal grants and local fees. It is not affiliated with the town of Clay, which is about 50 miles east of Charleston. Owens Brown, director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\u2019s West Virginia chapter, is among those calling for the removal of both women. \u201cI feel it\u2019s so unfortunate that people still have these racist undertones,\u201d Brown said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is a reality that we are dealing with in America today. There\u2019s no place for these types of attitudes in our state.\u201d African-Americans make up about 4 percent of West Virginia\u2019s 1.8 million residents, according to the U.S. Census. About 77 percent of Clay County residents supported Trump in the Nov. 8 election. In 2012, President Barack Obama received 31 percent of the county vote when Republican Mitt Romney easily carried the state. Last week in Kentucky, Republican Dan Johnson defeated incumbent Democrat Linda Belcher in Bullitt County in a race for the state House of Representatives, despite a series of posts he put on Facebook depicting President Barack Obama and his wife as monkeys. Republican officials, including likely new House Speaker Jeff Hoover, had called on Johnson to drop out of the race. But Hoover declared last week that Johnson would be \u201cwelcome in our caucus.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

A \"fashion alert\" was initially sent to journalists on Monday by Monica Marder, vice president of sales for Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry. It promoted Ivanka Trump as wearing \"her favorite bangle from the Metropolis Collection\" on the CBS News show. The bracelet costs $8,800 to $10,800. \"Please share this with your clients\u2026\" the email said. As a result, the company was accused of trying to make money off the election results through the interview. Play Is Ivanka Trump's business in trouble? 4:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161115215452if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/794855491942\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> On Tuesday, Abigail Klem, president of the company, said in a statement to NBC News that the \"style alert\" distributed to fashion journalists after the \"60 Minutes\" interview \"was sent by a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol, and who, like many of us, is still making adjustments post-election.\" Klem added: \"We are proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward.\" Related: Donald Trump Granddaughter Arabella Kushner Captivates China A public relations firm representing Ivanka Trump would not comment on whether or not the president-elect's daughter was aware that the email went out in the first place. The interview was not the first time Ivanka Trump used her father's political spotlight to highlight her brand. In July, the former model marketed a blush pink sheath dress she wore at the Republican National Convention. The dress, which retailed at a more affordable $138, quickly sold out. \u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) July 22, 2016 Somewhat ironically, Ivanka Trump insisted that the Trump brand wasn't a priority during the \"60 Minutes\" interview. \"I don't think it matters,\" she responded when host Lesley Stahl asked if the controversial campaign has tarnished the Trump brand. \"This is so much more important. And more serious \u2026That's the focus,\" she added. The president-elect added, \"I think what Ivanka is trying to say, 'Who cares? Who cares?' This is big league stuff ... this is our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing.\" The email about the bracelet, however, underscores the many conflict-of-interest scenarios the president-elect and his business empire may face. For example: The Emoluments clause While Trump wouldn't have any legal obligation to sell or step away from his business interests under the Ethics in Government Act, he could face legal issues under the Emoluments clause in the Constitution, which dates back to 1787. It has since been interpreted by the Department of Justice as banning government officials from accepting any kind of gift from a foreign entity. Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, gave the example of corporations putting the Trump name on a building owned by a foreign company. \"That could be considered as a gift,\" he said. \"If you have a transaction between a Trump entity and a company owned by a foreign government \u2014 that could be grounds for impeachment.\" His children's overall role Trump has said his kids will advise him, not to mention be a key part of his transition team. Federal law bans the president from appointing a relative \u2014 including in-laws like Ivanka Trump's husband Jared Kushner \u2014 to federal agency positions. Still, legally the president could appoint a family member to a non-cabinet, non-federal employee position. That issue was brought up when then-President Clinton asked his wife, Hillary, to lead the health care task force. But critics are already charging the Trumps with nepotism. The blind trust The president-elect has said his business holdings will be placed into a blind trust with his oldest three children in charge. As many critics have pointed out, a trust cannot be blind if you know who's running it and what assets it includes. \"It's hard to see how you keep this wall between you and your children,\" said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"It's hard to imagine that Trump wouldn't know what was going on with these properties, with how they are performing, if money is coming in or not, and decisions on buying new properties. There's not the same degree of ignorance you would have with a blind trust.\" His Washington, D.C., hotel The Republican recently opened a new hotel in Washington D.C. The problem? It's at the Old Post Office building, owned by the federal government and leased to the Trump Organization. The General Services Administration \u2014 which Trump is now in charge of \u2014 is also in charge of his lease. What happens if there's a dispute over this financial arrangement? Will the GSA really make a fuss with the president? Aliyah Frumin ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 At least four congressional investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email use and mishandling of classified information are expected to go forward even after the former secretary of state\u2019s election loss last week, Republican lawmakers tell Fox News. The probes, which cover allegations that Clinton lied to Congress about her email practices in October 2015 and\u00a0that government records were destroyed, are ongoing and not dependent on the election's outcome, two senior Republican senators said. \"I still don't have the information I need,\"\u00a0Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told Fox News. Johnson said the work of his committee, with jurisdiction over government records and the mishandling of classified information, would be careful not to disrupt President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the messages of this election that the public is disgusted when they see double standards, when they think people in high places, high government officials can get away with what ordinary citizens can't,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I just think it\u2019s extremely important to follow this thing through and get all the information. Make it public.\u201d A spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said answers, not the political calendar, are driving investigators. \"Senator Grassley has always followed inquiries through to their logical end, until he feels he's received the answers he needs to be able to satisfy the questions he posed on the public's behalf.\u00a0He performs oversight regardless of which party holds the White House, just as he initiates oversight inquiries irrespective of politics,\" the spokesperson said. While the senators have more latitude to conduct committee investigations, there is an expectation on the House side that leadership will set immediate priorities for the new session. Both the House judiciary and government oversight committees have pending investigations that cover allegations of a quid pro quo between a State Department executive and an FBI official over stripping an email of its classified status in return for coveted slots for the bureau overseas. Congressional sources said lingering questions about the FBI probe into the Clinton Foundation, and pay-to-play allegations, must also be resolved \u2013 though FBI Director James Comey sought to close the book on the email case right before the election, after briefly re-opening the matter. \"We still have some questions because [Comey\u2019s] latest letter narrowed the scope of their investigation to the time that she was secretary of state, but we're also interested in what happened before and what happened after that. It's this huge \u2026 mess that has to be cleaned up. So we would be remiss if we just dismiss it and moved on,\"\u00a0Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d Congressional sources said some committee requests for the State Department are over a year old, and others from the FBI, including for a handful of remaining interview summaries known as 302s, have yet to be fulfilled. \"[The requests] go back probably about a year. I've asked for information on who else, what other high-level administration officials were engaged on these emails,\" Johnson said.\u00a0 President Obama, among others, used an alias to correspond with Clinton on her personal email which resided on a private, unsecured server. During a weekend conference call with top donors, Hillary Clinton blamed Comey for her defeat. Clinton said Comey's decision to reopen the email case 11 days before the election put her campaign on the defense and blunted her ability to make a strong closing argument. While Comey announced two days before the polls opened that he continued to believe there was no basis for criminal charges, Clinton told donors the FBI director's decision reinforced a central Trump campaign theme -- that the system is rigged -- and it drove Trump voters to the polls on Election Day. On CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning,\u201d Clinton\u2019s former Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders said the failure goes beyond the emails. \"It's not a question of what happens in the last week,\" Sanders told Charlie Rose. \"The question is she should have won this election by 10 percentage points. The question is why it is millions of white working-class people voted for Obama, turned their backs on the Democratic Party.\" Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

    "text": "By Catherine Ho November 15 at 3:43 PM Follow @WapoCat Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) addresses supporters in New York on June 23. (Craig Ruttle/AP) Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday took aim at Donald Trump\u2019s inclusion of lobbyists and industry executives on his transition team, blasting the president-elect for going back on a campaign promise to keep special interests out of Washington before he has even stepped foot in the White House. \u201cMr. Trump described himself as a populist taking on the establishment,\u00a0someone who would \u2018drain the swamp,'\u201d Sanders said. \u201cUnfortunately what we\u2019re beginning to see is what I\u00a0feared, which is a lot of what Mr. Trump said to get votes is not what he intends to do as president of the United States.\u201d In a call with reporters, Sanders and Whitehouse urged Trump to adopt or strengthen ethics rules implemented by President Obama aimed at keeping lobbyists and special interests off his transition team and administration. The Obama executive order restricting lobbyists from working in the White House has not always been effective \u2014 the administration later issued waivers to allow some lobbyists in \u2014\u00a0but the order\u00a0is generally cited\u00a0by watchdog\u00a0groups as a positive step toward reducing ethical lapses in the executive branch. The Trump transition team has yet to publicly indicate what ethics rules, if any, apply to the lobbyists and executives now leading policy and federal agency personnel issues on the transition. [ Donors and lobbyists already shaping Trump\u2019s \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 administration ] The corporate lobbyists helping to shape the Trump transition include Steve Hart, a tax lobbyist and chairman of the law and lobby shop Williams & Jensen, who is overseeing the Labor Department; Mike McKenna, an energy lobbyist who is overseeing planning for the Energy Department; and Mike Catanzaro, a partner at the lobby firm CGCN who has represented Halliburton\u00a0and Koch Industries. The transition is also tapping Wall Street veterans and billionaires to influential roles: the executive committee overseeing the transition include Steven Mnuchin, an ex-Goldman Sachs partner who is being considered for treasury secretary, and New York financier\u00a0Anthony Scaramucci. Billionaire and Oklahoma oil executive Harold Hamm, who advised the Trump campaign on policy, is being considered for a Cabinet post. [ Donald Trump narrows candidates to lead Treasury and Commerce, major backer says ] \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re draining the swamp, it looks like they\u2019re pouring the swamp into the transition,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cIf nothing changes, they\u2019ll be pouring the swamp into the Oval Office as well.\u201d During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Sanders and Whitehouse said Trump should implement changes to lobbying laws that\u00a0Trump proposed on the campaign trail:\u00a0a five-year ban on members of Congress and executive branch officials who want to become lobbyists after leaving government, and a lifetime ban on senior executive branch officials from lobbying for foreign governments.

It wasn\u2019t always clear which elements were powering the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d as the movement called itself, and which were being buoyed along.

It had a sports bar, which offered beer for $1 on Thursdays, and a biker bar where, it was said, patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke. Both were filled with Trump voters, little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the Obama administration\u2019s environmental regulations and cheap natural gas. In Williamson, I also saw how Mr. Trump\u2019s message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on Sunday, many Christians glossed over the candidate\u2019s three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. (\u201cIt\u2019s scary, like Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Trump told Howard Stern in 1997.) Photo The Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Mich. The city has the country\u2019s largest percentage of Muslims. Credit Nova Safo/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images It was hard to square, but perhaps that was the lesson: that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election, one in which outrageous rule-breaking might offer a route to success. Around that time, Apple released its seventh iteration of the iPhone, that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every iPhone are the words \u201cDesigned in California. Assembled in China.\u201d As if California is a separate country. And that\u2019s how many in Trump country saw it \u2014 that instead of being part of the iPhone economy, they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas. One thing that I, like many Europeans and other foreigners, had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate self-belief. Mr. Trump, though, traded on pessimism. His slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the country\u2019s military and business, but also scapegoated immigrants, minorities and Muslims. At Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about \u201cthe blacks.\u201d Broad-brush prejudice toward Muslims was openly expressed: Danny Popma, a factory owner in Michigan, told me that children in Dearborn, which has the country\u2019s largest percentage of Muslims, had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks. The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or loutish, there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding twist, a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat categorization: a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami; a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas; a Guyanese doorman in Queens, N.Y. At a rally in the campaign\u2019s final week in Michigan, a Rust Belt state that would prove central to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, I saw how the candidate connected with crowd. When he spoke, it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his ear, listening for the smallest murmur of applause, which he would seize upon and amplify. It reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians I\u2019d seen during my years based in Pakistan.

State-by-state polls suggested that Mr. Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political professionals, including Republicans, dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters. \u201cIt\u2019s like the hunt for the lost tribes of the Amazon,\u201d was how Stuart Stevens, a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, put it early on. \u201cIf you paddle your canoe far enough up the river, and bang your drum hard enough, they will come to the riverbank. But they\u2019re just not there.\u201d Photo Mr. Trump at his final campaign event in Grand Rapids, Mich. The state proved central to his victory. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times But when I mentioned the polls showing Mr. Trump lagging to his supporters, they snorted derisively. Everyone they knew was voting Trump \u2014 colleagues, relatives, children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who hadn\u2019t voted for decades. The polls, they said, were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media \u2014 the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow. At the time, I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the Facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad terms, the Trump supporters were right \u2014 in key states, their votes were undercounted by pollsters. The winning margin in many states, like Michigan, was tight, and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. Daryl, the Uber driver who took me from a Trump rally to the airport, was a case in point: he was an African-American, a registered Democrat, and he did not intend to vote. \u201cNone of them look any good to me,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump, then, benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international readers: Why did so many Americans seem to hate her so much? The answer had many dimensions: Fatigue from her decades in public life, unfinished business from her husband\u2019s time in power in the 1990s, distaste for how she had handled his sexual escapades, outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street bankers, unfiltered sexism. And Mrs. Clinton simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In San Francisco, while I was visiting my brother, one of his friends offered an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting socks for Christmas \u2014 again \u201d he said. \u201cSocks, socks, bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like that.\u201d Mr. Trump, in the end, found the \u201clost tribe\u201d of white voters. They heard his drumbeat, and voted as a bloc like never before. Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning victory echoes jolting changes in Britain, France and other countries where a new brand of right-wing politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of forces, or represented a more fundamental shift, may now be answered under the Trump presidency. ",

    "text": "Potential Pelosi Challengers Could Benefit From Delay of House Democrat Leadership Elections By BENJAMIN SIEGEL Nov 15, 2016, 6:48 PM ET 0 Shares J. Scott Applewhite / AP Photo WATCH House Leader Nancy Pelosi Addresses the Democratic National Convention 0 Shares Email House Democrats are pushing back the elections for their leadership team for the new Congress until after the Thanksgiving holiday, moving to delay voting as the caucus continues to grapple with the unexpected results of last week\u2019s presidential election . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-California, told members during a meeting Tuesday morning that they would delay voting until Nov. 30, according to aides. Democrats were expected to pick up as many as 12-15 seats in the House last week but ended up only gaining six. While Pelosi is still favored to keep her seat, the delay could give potential challengers time to consolidate support in the House Democratic caucus. At least one other Democrat, Rep. Tim Ryan , D-Ohio, has expressed interest in possibly challenging her. Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison Announces Bid for DNC Chair Yesterday, nearly two dozen House members sent Pelosi an email asking her to consider postponing the election. \u201cIt is vital that our Caucus take the time to listen to the American people and learn the lessons from this difficult election,\u201d the letter read. House Democrats\u2019 leadership elections have traditionally been held after Thanksgiving. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, who authored the letter, welcomed the caucus vote Tuesday to postpone the leadership votes until Nov. 30. \u201cHouse Democrats must take the time to reflect on the message the American people sent us last Tuesday. Delaying the vote on leadership positions is the necessary first step to have that conversation.\u201d \"There are some people who are unhappy,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, said in an interview, describing members who think \"we've had a few disappointing election cycles, and that new leadership might help that.\" \"I think Nancy has been a fine leader and she'll continue to be,\" he added. If the ongoing fight for chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee is any indication, it is possible more progressive and populist voices from within the caucus emerge to challenge leadership as well. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, was one of only a handful of lawmakers to back Sen. Bernie Sanders during the presidential primary. He too welcomed a pause before voting, telling ABC News Monday, \u201cLook, we just got hammered. We lost a presidential election we shouldn\u2019t have lost, we picked up far fewer seats than we had hoped, and we\u2019ve got to assess what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it. \"Nobody is blaming leadership for what happened. They worked incredibly hard. But do we want to have a discussion? I think we do.\u201d Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser who has led House Democrats for 12 years, has enjoyed steadfast backing through tough election seasons. In 2010, when Republicans and the Tea Party wave won back the majority in the House, delivering Democrats a so-called \u201cshellacking,\u201d Pelosi kept her seat, defeating former Rep. Heath Shuler, D-North Carolina. Still, one of the realities Democrats are facing after last week is that their message missed the mark with Middle America, specifically working-class white voters in the Rust Belt. Both Pelosi and her whip, Steny Hoyer , come from coastal states, California and Maryland respectively. \u201cFor both our caucus but also more broadly for our party \u2026 we as a party have to do better among all blue-collar working-class voters, yes minorities, but also white, blue-collar voters,\u201d Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pennsylvania, told ABC News Monday. \u201cWe can do a much better job in reaching out to those voters.\u201d A group of over 30 female congresswomen sent their own letter expressing support for Pelosi. During a call with several House Democrats Monday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did not comment specifically on who she believed should lead on Capitol Hill but did seem to caution against infighting, according to Democratic sources. \u201cTwo things we can\u2019t afford to be is discouraged or divided,\u201d she said, according to one Democrat on the call. \u201cThe people we all fought for in this election need champions more than ever.\u201d Progressive Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona, said members want \"an opportunity to sit down\" and discuss the election results and the group's strategy under a President Donald Trump. Pelosi has scheduled a post-election briefing for members Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Top Russian Minister Arrested, Accused of Taking $2 Million Bribe By PATRICK REEVELL Nov 15, 2016, 3:01 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Oct. 10, 2016 file photo, Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, listens to Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev in Istanbul, Turkey. The Investigative Committee said in a statement early Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016, that Ulyukayev was detained late Monday after he allegedly received a $2 million bribe in a sting set by the FSB, the KGB's main successor agency. (Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik, Kremlin File Pool Photo via AP) 0 Shares Email Russia's economy minister has been arrested on corruption charges, the most senior official ever detained under President Vladimir Putin , startling a country that rarely sees top functionaries punished despite rampant allegations of government misconduct. The minister, Aleksei Ulyukaev, 60, was detained on Monday night \u201cin the act\u201d of receiving a $2 million bribe, according to Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, a law enforcement body that handles major cases. Ulyukaev is suspected of soliciting the bribe in return for approving a high profile oil deal. The sting operation that led to his arrest, followed months of surveillance by Russia\u2019s F.S.B. service, investigators said. The Investigative Committee today charged Ulyukaev with extortion and a Moscow court placed him under house-arrest. If found guilty, Ulyukaev could face up to 15 years in jail. The case was immediately seized on by Russian state television as proof that authorities were successfully waging an anti-corruption campaign, while the Kremlin swiftly announced it was following the case closely. \u201cThese are very serious accusations, which demand very serious proof,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that only a court could determine Ulyukaev\u2019s guilt. Peskov said that president Vladimir Putin had been following the investigation from the beginning. The arrest and charging of a serving official of Ulyukaev's seniority is unprecedented since Putin came to power in 1999. Although police raids, asset seizures and enforced resignations are common tools in tussles among the country\u2019s power-brokers, Ulyukaev\u2019s high-profile arrest was seen as exceptional, prompting speculation of a struggle within the elite. It follows a series of arrests and reshuffles that have reshaped the top levels of Russian government this year; Putin has recently replaced his long-serving chief of staff, while overhauling Russia\u2019s security agencies and appointing his former top bodyguard to oversee them. A technocrat, Ulyukaev was tasked with overseeing Russia\u2019s economic development policies, working closely with Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. Not in Putin\u2019s inner circle, Ulyukaev was still known as a seasoned adjunct in the Kremlin system, linked to a more technocratic, economically liberal group clustered around Medvedev, who are often seen as in competition with hard-line isolationists in the government. The arrest prompted immediate speculation beyond the official version. Some observers suggested that Ulyukaev's fall has lifted the curtain on a turf war between different factions in the government and that has played out around the oil deal that led to his arrest. That oil deal has been at the center of a struggle at high levels of the government for months. Top officials sought to block the buyout of regional oil producer Bashneft by Rosneft, the state-controlled energy giant that is headed by a Putin ally and one of the most powerful men in the country, Igor Sechin. Both Medvedev and Ulyukaev had come out against Sechin over the deal, questioning whether Rosneft, already majority state-owned, should be permitted to take part in what was supposed to be a privatization. Opposition to the deal was overruled by president Putin, and the struggle was finally settled last month, with Rosneft agreeing to purchase the state\u2019s 50 percent stake in Bashneft for up to $5 billion, the Financial Times reported. Ulyukaev though is accused of trying to extort Rosneft by threatening to block the deal. Investigators arrested him at 3 a.m. in Rosneft\u2019s Moscow offices, claiming he had sought to take the huge bribe in cash. The Investigative Committee today said the deal\u2019s legality was not in question following Ulyukaev\u2019s arrest. Some Russian observers, though, expressed doubts about the case against Ulyukaev, arguing it made no sense he would have tried to block a deal approved by Putin himself or to extort Sechin. \u201cYou would have to be a lunatic,\u201d Aleksander Shokhin, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said in a radio interview, \u201ca month after the deal was approved legally, politically, to threaten Rosneft with something and to extort $2 million from Igor Sechin, basically one of the most influential people in our country.\u201d Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and opposition activist who has endured political prosecutions, suggested the arrest\u2019s purpose was simple, writing in a blog post: \u201cThey\u2019re doing in such cases what all authoritarian leaders do. Periodically repressing some unexpected character, so as to frighten all the rest.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Donald Trump's transition team loses a key figure as he struggles to find his footing Vice President-elect Mike Pence Drew Angerer / Getty Images Vice President-elect Mike Pence is also in charge of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is also in charge of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Noah Bierman and Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporters The shoot-from-the-hip style that helped Donald Trump win the presidency is now playing out in his transition to governing. An insular group of loyalists and family members are at the helm, giving the public little information. A top establishment figure abruptly departed the transition team. And officials from across the federal government say they have heard nothing from the people who are supposed to take their place two months from now. By Tuesday, a week after his election, Trump\u2019s team had yet to discuss even basic elements of the government handoff with key players at the Pentagon, the State Department and other vital agencies, in large part because of a delay in signing the paperwork dictating the nuts and bolts of the process. \u201cWe are standing by ready to assist,\u201d said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. \"We stand ready,\" said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau. The Trump campaign kept mum throughout the day\u00a0as confidants and family members streamed in and out of Trump Tower in New York, occasionally stopping to speak with reporters cordoned behind a red velvet rope in the lobby, but giving up little before riding the elevator to Trump\u2019s office. Leaks about internal squabbles and personnel moves, many involving close campaign allies competing for top posts, were left to fill the information void. \"No. No,\u201d retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith\u00a0Kellogg, a Trump advisor,\u00a0said when asked about rumors of infighting on the Trump team. \u201cIt\u2019s all been good.\" Armand Emamdjomeh But one of Trump\u2019s most respected links to the Republican foreign policy community, Rep. Mike D. Rogers of Alabama, abruptly announced he was leaving the transition team. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, had been an important\u00a0bridge between Trump and skeptics in his party. Rogers had been a holdover from the transition team assembled by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was replaced as the team\u2019s leader last week by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect. A person close to Rogers called his departure part of an effort to distance the team from Christie.\u00a0 \"Anyone close to Chris Christie got dumped,\" said the Rogers ally, who would not be named discussing internal transition team dynamics.\u00a0\"All the level-headed people are stepping aside.\" Another potential bridge was also cut off when\u00a0Eliot Cohen, a prominent conservative critic of Trump, portrayed himself as walking\u00a0away angrily from an attempt at reconciliation. Cohen, a supporter of the war in Iraq who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s State Department, had organized a letter signed by dozens of former officials denouncing Trump during the campaign. \u201cAfter exchange [with]\u00a0Trump transition team, changed my recommendation,\u201d Cohen wrote on Twitter. \u201cStay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming 'you LOST!\u2019\u00a0Will be ugly.\u201d \u00a0 Trump had insisted during the campaign, contrary to evidence , that he had always opposed the Iraq war. Another potential player in the administration,\u00a0retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, also took himself out of the running for an administration job, according to Terry M. Giles, finance chairman during Carson\u2019s presidential campaign. Christie\u2019s departure was also responsible for the delay in setting up meetings between Trump\u2019s team and the leaders of federal government agencies. Christie had signed an agreement\u00a0with the Obama administration prior to election day that\u00a0set parameters for interactions between White House officials and designated representatives of the president-elect's team. This is America's state of mind on election day Open link That agreement, which is required by federal law and sets the conditions for access to documents, staff and facilities of federal agencies, no longer applied once Christie was removed from his position.\u00a0The White House said it received a new agreement signed by Pence late Tuesday. \u201cThe government is ready for the Trump folks, and the Trump folks need to get moving,\u201d said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that focuses on good governance.\u00a0 Stier said Trump seems to be figuring out how to move from campaigning to governing, one of the stiffest challenges that any president-elect faces, particularly one who campaigned\u00a0as an outsider. The task is enormous, he noted: hiring 4,000 people, implementing policy, learning enough to avoid national security risks, preparing a budget a month after inauguration and preparing for \u201cthings you can\u2019t expect, the asteroids that come in.\u201d \u201cWith two houses of Congress now held by the Republicans, they have to produce\u201d quickly, said\u00a0Martha Kumar, an expert in presidential transitions.\u00a0 Those most affected by Trump\u2019s\u00a0agenda are also anxious about the lack of clarity. Hospital groups, health insurers, consumer advocates and others have been scrambling since the election to learn how the Trump administration and it allies on Capitol Hill will fulfill their pledge to repeal and replace\u00a0the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Industry officials and others say it has been almost impossible to find out what the new administration is planning. Even identifying who is making decisions on what was a signature issue for Trump during the campaign has been a challenge, health sector leaders said. In 2008, President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s team moved faster, signing an agreement to meet with top officials in Bush\u2019s White House four days after he was elected. Eight years earlier, Bush\u2019s transition team could not begin meeting with agency officials for weeks because the result of the 2000 election was in doubt. Kumar and Stier both said that Trump has time to regain his footing. Kumar believes Pence, who served in Congress,\u00a0was a wise choice to lead the effort, given his ties to top lawmakers. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) tried to reassure the public that the effort remained on track\u00a0and that he was in touch with Trump almost\u00a0daily. \"We\u2019re going to do everything we can to help make him be as successful as he's going to be,\" Ryan said. Trump's team tapped Rep.

Mui November 15 at 1:14 PM Follow @ylanmui Steven Mnuchin, national finance chairman of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign, talks with reporters at Trump Tower\u00a0on Tuesday in New York. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) President-elect Donald Trump appears close to filling two key Cabinet positions with veteran investors who have close ties to Wall Street, according to one of his major donors and longtime business partners. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn tweeted Tuesday that he had spoken to Trump and that the president-elect was considering naming his campaign finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, and economic adviser Wilbur Ross to lead the Treasury and Commerce departments. It remained unclear who would receive which title, but Mnuchin has been considered by Trump insiders as a top pick for Treasury and Ross as an option for both jobs. \u201cBoth would be great choices,\u201d Icahn tweeted. \u201cBoth are good friends of mine but more importantly, they are two of the smartest people I know.\u201d [ Adviser on national security leaves Trump transition team ] Mnuchin joined Trump\u2019s campaign in the spring and worked closely with his economic advisers to put together Trump\u2019s proposal to dramatically cut taxes for individuals and businesses. Mnuchin was at the Trump\u2019s team headquarters at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday morning but declined to comment on whether he has been offered a job in the administration. \u201cWe're working on the economic plan with the transition, making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan,\u201d he said. Ross is a venture capitalist who has focused on buying business in distress, including a landmark deal to buy bankrupt steelmaker LTV in the early 2000s as well as a host of manufacturing companies. He was named to Trump\u2019s economic team over the summer. Ross helped map out Trump\u2019s plan for his first 100 days in office. In an interview with Yahoo Finance last week, he played down concerns that Trump\u2019s incendiary campaign rhetoric and pledge to label China as a currency manipulator could launch the country into a trade war. \u201cEverybody says, 'Oh he\u2019s going to slap a 45 percent tariff on everything out of China.' That\u2019s not what he said, and it\u2019s not what he intends,\u201d Ross said. Both Ross and Mnuchin are well-known on Wall Street. Mnuchin followed in his father\u2019s footsteps by joining Goldman Sachs, eventually rising to become chief information officer in 1999. He later founded a private-equity firm, Dune Capital, and led the purchase of now-defunct subprime-mortgage lender IndyMac during the financial crisis. Mnuchin also helped finance blockbuster Hollywood movies such as \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad.\u201d \u201cI really came to admire him for his knowledge of the tax system and his free-market principles,\u201d said Stephen Moore, who also served on Trump\u2019s economic advisory team and is a distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Moore said a final decision on key economic positions was \u201cimminent.\u201d business ",

She called Michelle Obama an \"ape in heels\" in a Facebook post, and has since been put on leave. Time First lady Michelle Obama meets with Melania Trump for tea in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House on Nov. 10, 2016. (Photo: Chuck Kennedy, The White House) The mayor of a small West Virginia town has stepped down and the director of\u00a0a\u00a0non-profit has been placed on leave\u00a0after outrage exploded across\u00a0social media over a\u00a0post-election Facebook post aimed at\u00a0Michelle Obama. \u201cIt will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I\u2019m tired of seeing a Ape in heels,\u201d read the post by Pamela Ramsey Taylor, director of the Clay County Development Corp., according to media reports. The resignation of Clay Mayor Beverly Whaling,\u00a0who reportedly responded\u00a0\u201cJust made my day Pam\u201d to Taylor's Facebook post, was effective immediately, town recorder Joe Coleman told the Associated Press on Tuesday. Taylor told WCHS-TV on Monday that she was put on leave. The post was shared hundreds of times on social media before it was apparently deleted. The\u00a0incident placed\u00a0the tiny enclave\u00a0of Clay \u2013 with fewer than 500 people and named for statesman\u00a0Henry Clay\u00a0\u2013 at the center of a firestorm as racial tensions have flared\u00a0nationwide in the week since the election.\u00a0West Virginians voted overwhelmingly for Republican Donald Trump, and he won\u00a077% of the votes in Clay County. Whaling said her comment was not meant as racist in a\u00a0written apology issued to news media outlets. \u201cI was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I\u2019m not in any way racist!\u201d The non-profit Clay County Development Corp. offers\u00a0services to seniors\u00a0and low-income residents and is\u00a0funded through state and federal grants and local fees. It is not affiliated with the town of Clay. Clay\u2019s town council planned to discuss the issue at a previously scheduled meeting Tuesday evening.

    "text": "Why Trump's Appointment of Steve Bannon Has Raised So Many Alarms By Adam Kelsey Nov 15, 2016, 5:27 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Steve Bannon: In a Minute 0 Shares Email Critics of Steve Bannon -- Donald Trump \u2019s campaign CEO, who is now senior counselor to the president-elect -- have accused him of peddling or being complicit in white supremacy, anti-Semitism and sexism in the articles published on the alt-right website he oversees, Breitbart, as well as in interviews. Bannon's website has lauded the Confederate flag and taken aim at Jewish people and women and Bannon himself has made controversial statements about women and homosexuals. Even though defenders, such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., argue that Bannon shouldn't be held accountable for everything published on the site, critics say that putting Bannon in such a prominent position sets a dangerous precedent. \"There must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump Administration,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. in a statement Monday. Added Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J. today, \"Elevating Steve Bannon... to one of the highest positions in the White House installs a man with fringe and dangerous ideologies just steps from the Oval Office.\" Here is a list of some of Steve Bannon\u2019s statements and Breitbart articles that have raised eyebrows: Donald Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus Defends Steve Bannon as a 'Very, Very Smart Person' \u201cA Bunch of Dykes\u201d During a 2011 radio interview in which he spoke in support of conservative women, Bannon employed a derogatory term for homosexual women while explaining, in his view, why liberals reacted so strongly against Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachmann. \u201cThe women that would lead this country would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children,\u201d said Bannon. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England.\u201d Breitbart Headlines While Bannon has contributed to Breitbart News as a writer, having penned at least 20 articles, he oversaw the website after founder Andrew Breitbart died in 2012. Under Bannon\u2019s leadership, Breitbart has published articles that have received flak due in part to headlines like: \u201cBill Kristol: Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew\u201d \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech, They Just Suck at Interviews\u201d \u201cDoes Feminism Make Women Ugly?\u201d \u201cThe Solution to Online \u2018Harassment\u2019 Is Simple: Women Should Log Off\u201d \"Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage\" \"Donald Trump Would Be the Real First Black President\" Bannon also acknowledged that the alt-right movement, which Breitbart champions, has appeal to white supremacists and anti-Semites, according to an interview he gave to liberal magazine Mother Jones at this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference. \"Are there anti-Semitic people involved in the alt-right? Absolutely,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cAre there racist people involved in the alt-right? Absolutely. But I don't believe that the movement overall is anti-Semitic.\" \u201cBitch Slap the Republican Party \u201d Bannon, speaking in support of the Tea Party, said in a 2010 interview on Political Vindication Radio that what supporters \u201cneed to do is bitch slap the Republican party.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Leninist,\u201d Bannon reportedly told a Daily Beast journalist at a book party in 2014, referring to the revolutionary Russian communist leader. \u201cLenin wanted to destroy the state, and that\u2019s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today\u2019s establishment.\u201d When the Daily Beast reporter emailed Bannon in August 2016, Bannon replied: \u201cI don\u2019t remember meeting you and don\u2019t remember the conversation. And as u [sic] can tell from the past few days I am not doing media.\u201d \u201cThe Fight Club\u201d Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , who would later become a target of scrutiny by Trump supporters due to his lukewarm support for the nominee, bore the brunt of Bannon\u2019s criticism of the establishment in January when he told the Washington Post that he and others at Breitbart \u201csay Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation ,\u201d referring to the mainstream conservative think tank. \u201cWe call ourselves \u2018the Fight Club.\u2019 You don\u2019t come to us for warm and fuzzy,\u201d said Bannon in the Washington Post story. \u201cWe think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly \u2018anti-\u2019 the permanent political class.\u201d Chorus of Critics...and Defenders Trump's choice of Bannon was slammed by politicians and advocates alike, including the Anti-Defamation League . \"It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the Alt Right, a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists - is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'people's house,' said the group's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt. \"We call on President-elect Trump to appoint and nominate Americans committed to the well-being of all our country's people and who exemplify the values of pluralism and tolerance that makes our country great.\" Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, called the move \"alarming.\" Steve Bannon's Breitbart is fringe, homophobic, racist, misogynist & anti-Semitic. His appointment is very alarming: https://t.co/XLZM0TyX3k \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) November 15, 2016 And outgoing, longtime Nevada Sen. Harry Reid expressed his ire over the decision. \u201cSo far rather than healing these wrongs, Trump\u2019s actions have deepened them,\" he said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"In his first official act he appointed a man supported as a champion of white supremacy as his chief strategist in the White House. \u201cIf Trump is serious about unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon. Rescind it. Don' t do it. Think about this. Don't do it.\u201d But many have come to Bannon's defense. \"I see where the outrage is and that doesn't surprise me. Same people who are trying to get past the election results,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said in Washington, DC today. \"Steve Bannon is a Georgetown Harvard MBA grad, a former naval officer, a former Goldman Sachs vice president and really the general, the field general in our successful campaign effort -- a brilliant tactician and serves president elect Donald Trump very well.\" Trump's Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, called Bannon a \"very, very smart person.\" \"I don't know where they're coming from,\" he said of the critics, on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" \"That's not the Steve Bannon that I know.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019s Likud party and other rightist politicians jumped to make hay of the change. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yoav Kish, a Likud member of Parliament, called for the expansion of Israeli sovereignty into the West Bank; Meir Turgeman, the chairman of Jerusalem\u2019s municipal planning committee, said he would now bring long-frozen plans for thousands of Jewish homes in the fiercely contested eastern part of the city up for approval. Aryeh Deri, the interior minister, who is ultra-Orthodox, hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a miracle, asserting it would lessen the influence of liberal, non-Orthodox streams of Judaism popular in America. He added, \u201cWe must truly be in Messianic times when everything will turn out favorably for the people of Israel.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu, whose previous three terms in office all coincided with Democratic administrations in the United States, has been more cautious. Adding to his troubles, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday rejected a government request for a seven-month delay of the demolition of an illegal West Bank outpost built on privately owned Palestinian land. The court-ordered demolition is slated for Dec. 25, and the government had argued for the delay in part to temper a potentially violent settler response. On Sunday, a ministerial committee of rightists within the Likud party and the governing coalition approved a contentious bill to retroactively legalize illegal settlement on privately owned Palestinian land. Prompted by the effort to salvage the Amona outpost, it may be a precursor of things to come. Although the pro-settler camp was promoting the bill long before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the decision was taken, unusually, over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s vehement objections and despite his exhortations for it to be postponed. Tzipi Livni, a centrist former foreign minister and justice minister who now sits in the Parliamentary opposition, denounced the settlement bill, writing on Twitter that it constitutes \u201cmajor damage to the rule of law at home, damage to Israel abroad, and primarily conveys a message that might makes right, when faced with a weak prime minister.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu warmly welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, calling him \u201ca true friend\u201d of Israel. But Mr. Netanyahu has also since instructed his ministers and legislators to be discreet, saying the incoming administration should be allowed \u201cto formulate \u2014 together with us \u2014 its policy vis-\u00e0-vis Israel and the region through accepted and quiet channels, and not via interviews and statements.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Netanyahu endorsed the principle of a Palestinian state in 2009, under American pressure and with caveats. Since then, he has tried to balance between world opinion and his right-wing constituency by declaring support for a solution based on two states for two peoples without going out of his way to advance it. Israeli analysts point out that the Trump campaign has spread contradictory messages. While many here assume that he will have more pressing priorities than the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that he would like to seal an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, calling it the \u201cultimate deal.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s critics on the right, however, assume a Trump administration will at least give Israel a freer hand in areas like settlement construction. They say Mr. Netanyahu will have to decide which side he is on. Acknowledging that Mr. Trump\u2019s positions are not entirely clear, Mr. Bennett, the leader of Jewish Home, said, \u201cWe have to say what we want first.\u201d Amit Segal, a political commentator for Israel\u2019s popular Channel 2 News, said that during the tenures of Presidents Clinton and Obama, Mr. Netanyahu could \u201cdisguise his worldview.\u201d The Obama administration\u2019s sharp condemnation of all settlement activity gave Mr. Netanyahu \u201cthe ultimate excuse\u201d for not building with abandon in the West Bank, Mr. Segal said in an interview, adding, \u201cI am not sure that the right wing, with its appetite, will be prepared to suffer another few years of that.\u201d Asked what Mr. Netanyahu would probably be rooting for, Israelis who generally reflect the prime minister\u2019s thinking said he was unlikely to forswear the two-state solution. \u201cIsrael has its own interest in reaching a negotiated solution with its neighbors,\u201d said Dore Gold, a longtime Netanyahu adviser who recently resigned from his position as director general of Israel\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cThis is not a function of pressure or arm-twisting. Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it clear that this is his goal.\u201d But Mr. Gold suggested that a Trump administration was likely to roll back the demand that Israel withdraw to the 1967 lines and support borders that are more accommodating to Israel. \u201cTrump\u2019s policy paper spoke about Israel having defensible borders, which are clearly different from the 1967 lines,\u201d he said.

Oren, a deputy minister in the prime minister\u2019s office and a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, told Israel Radio: \u201cWe have to ask ourselves what is in Israel\u2019s interests. The interest of the Israelis and, in my view, of the government, is indeed to achieve peace with the Palestinians through direct negotiations, without preconditions, at any time, in order to get to a solution of two states for two peoples.\u201d Gilead Sher, an Israeli former peace negotiator under the left-leaning governments of Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin, noted that although most of the Israeli governments over the past four decades had been right-wing, \u201cnever has one of them annexed one square inch of the West Bank.\u201d Mr. Sher, now a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, is also co-chairman of Blue White Future, an Israeli group advocating a two-state solution, by unilateral means if necessary. Of the rejoicing on the Israeli right, he said, \u201cMost joyful moments are provisional and temporary.\u201d Follow Isabel Kershner on Twitter @IKershner .

Airstrikes had halted in eastern Aleppo but have now resumed. AP hide caption toggle caption AP Civil Defense workers and Syrian citizens inspect damaged buildings after airstrikes hit earlier this month in Darat Izza, western Aleppo province, Syria. Airstrikes had halted in eastern Aleppo but have now resumed. AP Airstrikes pounded the embattled eastern side of Aleppo, which is controlled by rebels, after several weeks of relative calm in the northern Syrian city. The Syrians and their Russian allies have heavily bombed the eastern part of Aleppo, though it was not immediately clear who carried out the renewed attacks. Russia declared a humanitarian pause to the bombings about a month ago. The operation began just hours after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladmir Putin had a phone conversation Tuesday, The Associated Press writes. The two leaders \"agreed on the need to combine efforts in the fight against what the Kremlin called their No. 1 enemy \u2014 'international terrorism and extremism.' \" NPR's Alison Meuse in Beirut told our Newscast unit that Aleppo \"residents have received text messages in recent days, warning them to leave an impending offensive.\" Here's more from Alison: \"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks come after weeks of relative calm but worsening conditions in eastern Aleppo. It says civilians on the besieged, rebel-held side raided warehouses, desperate for food. The U.N. has distributed its last rations. \"In recent days, Syria's army has warned residents to flee through designated corridors and told rebels to surrender. The rebels have vowed to fight on. And a humanitarian worker in Aleppo says they're now shelling the government-held neighborhoods.\" Article continues after sponsorship The uneasy pause started in mid-October, the AP reports, when \"Russia said it would halt weeks of deadly airstrikes to allow rebels and supporters to leave eastern Aleppo.\" However, \"the rebels refused to take up the offer and the United Nations failed to negotiate the delivery of aid into the besieged area.\" \"Our houses are shaking from the pressure. Planes are soaring above us and the bombardment is around us,\" Modar Shekho, a resident of eastern Aleppo, told Reuters. The Observatory said three hospitals have been targeted in the countryside near Aleppo since Monday, though the number of casualties and the extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Russia backs the Syrian regime in the conflict, while the U.S. is allied with rebel fighters. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced the beginning of a \"large-scale operation\" on Tuesday, according to the state-run TASS news agency . It said Russian planes were carrying out strikes in Syria's Idlib and Homs provinces, and did not specifically mention Aleppo, which has seen much of the fiercest fighting in Syria's war. Meanwhile, the United Nations has issued a new report saying food production across Syria is at record lows, as reporter Lisa Schlein told our Newscast unit from Geneva. \"The U.N. warns that farmers in Syria are being pushed to the limit and may be forced to stop farming unless they get immediate help,\" Schlein said, and added that the World Food Programme said \"80 percent of households across Syria are short on food.\" ",

Two sources close to Rogers said he had been the victim of what one called a \"Stalinesque purge,\" from the transition of people close to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who left Friday. It was unclear which other aides close to Christie had also been forced out. The Trump transition did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rogers confirmed his exit in a statement that said that, despite his departure, he planned to continue to \"provide advice and counsel as needed to the incoming Trump administration.\" He and his top aide had been working for months, preparing the groundwork for transition. Two sources close to the situation described an atmosphere of sniping and backbiting as Trump loyalists position themselves for key jobs. \"It was a privilege to prepare and advise the policy, personnel and agency action teams on all aspects of the national security portfolio during the initial pre-election planning phase. Our work will provide a strong foundation for the new transition team leadership as they move into the post-election phase, which naturally is incorporating the campaign team in New York who drove President-elect Trump to an incredible victory last Tuesday,\" Rogers said in the statement. Congressman Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI). Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images, file Rogers was initially seen as a leading candidate for CIA director, but now is likely off the list, a source told NBC News. Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is now a top contender. Rogers' departure follows Christie's demotion from head of the team to a vice-chair, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence taking over for him last week. The purge indicates the emphasis on loyalty \u2014 and significant influence of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, husband of Ivanka \u2014 that characterized Trump's campaign will carry over into his White House. Multiple sources indicated that Christie was demoted because he wasn't seen as sufficiently loyal to Trump, failing to vocally defend him at key moments on the campaign trail. Play ",

While Americans appear to have been motivated at the polls by their anger, the president added, the effects of a Trump presidency are still anyone's guess. \"Time will now tell whether the prescriptions being offered, whether Brexit or with respect to the U.S. election, ends up actually satisfying those people who have been fearful or angry or concerned,\" Obama said. Following the divisive presidential election which saw Trump win the White House, Obama has had to allay fears following the president-elect's previous suggestion that he is willing to abandon NATO allies if other partner nations don't pay more under the military alliance. President Barack Obama reviews the Presidential Guard in Athens, Greece, on Nov. 15, 2016. Yorgos Karahalis / AP But after a meeting with Trump at the White House last week, Obama said Monday he remains \"encouraged\" by him and that he personally reaffirmed a commitment to NATO. Obama's seven-day farewell foreign tour includes traveling Wednesday to Germany to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European heads of state. The outgoing commander in chief will also arrive in Peru later in the week for the Asia Pacific Cooperation summit, which will bring together Pacific nation leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin is among the expected attendees. A Kremlin spokesman reportedly said Putin and Obama may meet on the sidelines of the summit to discuss the ongoing conflict in Syria.

Migrants and refugees have been making dangerous treks to get to the island nation \u2014 seen as a safe haven and entry point into Europe. But the crisis there has been coupled with a difficult climb out of a deep recession that forced a string of unpopular austerity measures. Greek leaders are hoping Obama can help convince their nation's international creditors, including Germany, to forgive some of its soaring debt. Obama praised Greece for being among the five countries of the 28-member NATO alliance who have met a requirement to pay 2 percent or more of their respective country's GDP on their own military defense. The other nations include the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Poland. \"Greece has done this even during its difficult economic times,\" Obama told reporters. \"If Greece can meet this commitment, all of the nations should be able to.\" We warmly welcome in Athens @POTUS Barack Obama.

(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) One person was found shot on the Eisenhower Expressway near Morgan Street on\u00a0Nov. 15, 2016. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Liam Ford Contact Reporter A man\u00a0was injured in a shooting Tuesday afternoon on the Eisenhower Expressway and at least one other man was injured in a resulting crash, authorities said. State police were called to eastbound Interstate 290 at Morgan Street about 3 p.m. because of a single-vehicle crash and found one person shot in the andomen, according to a news release. A 20-year-old man was taken in serious-to-critical condition to Stroger Hospital following the shooting, a Chicago Fire Department spokesman said. A 24-year-old man apparently injured in a related traffic crash also went to Stroger in serious-to-critical condition, while another person, possibly a child, was taken to Rush University Medical Center in fair-to-serious condition. The driver of the vehicle was the shooting victim, and the front-seat passenger suffered a broken leg when the vehicle crashed into the median wall on the expressway, said state police, who could not confirm a third person was injured. Video from the scene showed a black SUV\u00a0that appeared to have crashed into the barrier next to the left lane. The expressway was closed east of Morgan Street for the investigation, with traffic diverted at Racine Avenue, according to state police and the Illinois Department of Transportation .

(Photo: PacketSled screenshot) SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 PacketSled's website boasts complete network cybersecurity with \"3x threat detection.\" But the threat board members detected most recently came from the San Diego-based company's founder, Matt Harrigan, who resigned Tuesday after election night boasts he planned to assassinate president-elect Donald Trump. Harrigan took to his Facebook page Nov. 8 as results confirmed Trump's victory to say \"I'm going to kill the president. Elect,\" according to a\u00a0 Reddit copy of his\u00a0Facebook comments. A friend answered,\u00a0\u201cYou just need to get high.\" Harrigan's response: \"Nope, getting a sniper rifle and perching myself where it counts. Find a bedroom in the White House that suits you\u2026. I'll find you.\" More fake news on the Web \u2014 this time, via Google On Sunday, Harrigan disavowed\u00a0his threat. \"My humble apologies that a flawed joke has become public/out of context. My poor judgement does not represent the views of\u00a0 @ packetsled\u00a0\u2026\" Harrigan's alarming public comments reflect\u00a0the way in which\u00a0social media played\u00a0an often polarizing role in the 2016 election. Passionate voices on both sides of the political divide used services such as Facebook and Twitter to express frustration and worse, while candidate Trump leveraged the platforms to reach his constituents directly. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has said Twitter is taking steps\u00a0to crack\u00a0down on hate speech , from making it easier to report alleged incidents to educating moderators on the type of conduct violates its rules. My humble apologies that a flawed joke has become public/out of context.  My poor judgement does not represent the views of @packetsled \u2026 \u2014 Matt Harrigan (@mattharrigan) November 13, 2016 Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing dissent \u00a0in his own ranks. Employees have formed a secret internal task force to study whether fake news sites that proliferated on Facebook had an impact on the election results, according to Buzzfeed News. Zuckerberg called the notion that such news swayed the outcome \"crazy.\" Grubhub CEO says Trump email 'misconstrued' Tensions around the fraught election's outcome\u00a0have\u00a0also showed up in the workplace. The CEO of Chicago food delivery start-up GrubHub last week sent staff an\u00a0email slamming the \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump\" and supporting employees' rights to make a better life in the U.S.,\u00a0 inviting employees who didn't agree to resign. He later said the statement\u00a0had been misconstrued. Harrigan founded PacketSled in 2013, and over the past years has raised $8 million in venture capital funding. On Monday, PacketSled's board issued a statement on the company website saying it had turned over relevant information to the Secret Service and had placed Harrigan on leave. On Tuesday, Harrigan resigned. \"We want to be very clear, PacketSled does not condone the comments made by Mr. Harrigan, which do not reflect the views or opinions of the company, its employees, investors or partners,\" the company said in an online statement. CTO Fred Wilmot will take over as interim CEO while the board looks at replacement candidates.

The team at this point is not \u201cup and running fully\u201d after \u201cblowing up\u201d the team, beginning with Chris Christie\u2019s recent ouster as the chairman of the transition team.\u00a0 One sign -- personnel announcements that were supposed to be made this week have been put on hold.\u00a0 Members of the transition staff are waiting for further instructions from Trump Tower.\u00a0 For all intents and purposes, Christie no longer has a role in the transition, although formally he was merely demoted to the level of vice chair, a title held by several members of the team. He\u2019s \u201cgone, not involved -- on the sideline,\u201d according to one source, as is ally Mike Rogers . \u00a0 A Republican member of the national security establishment told CBS News\u2019 David Martin that Rogers was forced off the transition team because of his closeness to Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition before he was demoted last week. Trump replaced Christie at the top of the transition team with Pence. The other strike against Rogers, according to Martin\u2019s source, was that he had done his own investigation of Benghazi and found that Hillary Clinton had done nothing wrong. Rick Dearborn, a top aide to Senator Sessions, has filled some of the void left by Team Christie\u2019s departure. His is an operational role inside the transition, researching potential appointees.\u00a0 CBS News reports that Trump can be expected to name a national security team before other posts. The economic team is expected to be named second. Ben Carson will retain his advisory role within the transition but he will not have a job in the administration. Tom Barrack will be named chairman of the inaugural committee as soon as Tuesday. Lew Eisenberg is expected to be finance chair for the inaugural committee, and Ray Washburne will serve as one of the vice chairs. The transition has begun staffing an advance unit that will work through the inauguration. One source told CBS that Mr. Trump is expected to hold rallies in January to build on the election result in an effort to create some resonance with the public and produce a pro-Trump atmosphere about his promises and early initiatives. These rallies -- planning for which is in disarray -- were initially conceived as a seven-state thank-you tour before the inauguration. \u00a0 Cabinet appointments Secretary of State: Rudy Giuliani is pushing \u201chard, hard, hard\u201d for secretary of state, according to a source. He wants it and is the leading contender at this point. However, one source called the speculation a potential ego boost to Giuliani and his appointment has not yet been finalized. Attorney General:\u00a0Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is under consideration.\u00a0 Secretary of Defense: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, is among those being considered. She\u2019s seen as qualified, available and Trump needs to include a woman in his cabinet. Ayotte rescinded her support of Trump during the campaign over the 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video on which Trump could be heard using lewd language about women. Ayotte lost her re-election race against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan. Secretary of Commerce: Ray Washburne, a Texas-based businessman and Republican fundraiser, is under consideration. There is at least one other candidate.\u00a0 Trump and Pence in meetings at Trump Tower Donald Trump has been in meetings with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, as he works on filling out his Cabinet, including top national security posts.

    "text": "Email Both President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have suggested they would like to improve U.S.-Russia relations -- but one top Republican lawmaker is warning Trump about trying another \u201creset\u201d with Russia. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday in the wake of more Russian airstrikes in Syria that the U.S. should not place substantial \u201cfaith\u201d in Putin\u2019s desire to improve relations. \u201cWith the U.S. presidential transition underway, Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cWe should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America\u2019s allies, and attempted to undermine America\u2019s elections. In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump and Putin are \u201cvery much alike\u201d in their worldviews and said Russia hopes \u201cfor their good personal relationship.\u201d Putin and Mr. Trump spoke by phone Monday. McCain added that Putin \u201chas rejoined [Syrian President] Bashar Assad in his barbaric war against the Syrian people.\u201d He cautioned that previous attempts at a Russian \u201creset\u201d -- most recently, that of President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 -- did not work, so there\u2019s little reason to hope a Trump-led effort would have a different result. \u201cThe Obama Administration\u2019s last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAt the very least, the price of another \u2018reset\u2019 would be complicity in Putin and Assad\u2019s butchery of the Syrian people. That is an unacceptable price for a great nation.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Rauner scores big win over union on contract talks Bruce Rauner Gov. Bruce Rauner on Nov. 11, 2016, in Springfield. Gov. Bruce Rauner on Nov. 11, 2016, in Springfield. (Seth Perlman / AP) Privacy Policy An Illinois labor board declared Tuesday that Gov. Bruce Rauner and the state's largest employee union are at an impasse in negotiations, clearing the way for the Republican governor to attempt to impose his terms on a new contract. The unanimous ruling puts an already wobbly state government in uncharted territory. The union has never gone on strike. But that will become an option if Rauner enforces the offer he left on the table. There's still some time, however, for the two sides to plot their next moves. The Rauner administration and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 31 are awaiting a written ruling from the Illinois Labor Relations Board, but spokesman Anders Lindall said the union already anticipates appealing the decision in state court. In the meantime, the union called on the governor not to implement the disputed contract and instead to restart negotiations. \"Nothing coming out of this decision compels the governor to seek to impose (his terms),\" Lindall said. \"He is free to come back to the bargaining table, and we think that in the public interest, in the interest of every Illinoisan \u2026 that he should do that, that he should come back to the bargaining table and join us in doing that hard work of compromise.\" The Rauner administration, meanwhile, suggested the union should \"partner with us as we consider how best to implement the contract.\" \"Today's decision is fair for taxpayers and state employees,\" Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said in a statement. \"As a result of this agreed-to process, the state can now implement its contract, saving the taxpayers more than $3 billion over four years.\" Rauner's last, best and final offer included no across-the-board guaranteed salary increase, but provided for $1,000 bonuses linked to work attendance, a series of new health care options with premiums ranging from $188 per month to $427 per month depending on employee salary, new rules that prevent overtime from kicking in before an employee has worked 40 hours in a week, and reduced holiday pay, among other things. The labor board, which is made up of five political appointees, determined that the parties were at impasse \u2014 a technical stage in negotiations that allows the governor to attempt to impose his final offer. In doing so, the panel rejected a recommendation from an administrative law judge. The judge, citing a failure by Rauner's negotiators to provide AFSCME with information about a number of its proposals, had suggested allowing Rauner to implement his terms on some items while sending the state back to the negotiating table on others. Although the labor board agreed that the state had erred in not providing AFSCME with the requested information, its members were quick to dismiss the judge's two-part solution. Instead, they chose to employ a legal approach suggested by Rauner's lawyers, in which deadlock over a single issue could be considered enough to put a stop to the talks. That issue was subcontracting. It was the first issue the two sides broached in the contract talks, and it was the last issue to come up in January before Rauner's team declared that it would seek the labor board's opinion on impasse. A Rauner negotiator cited the disagreement over subcontracting as a reason for referring the matter to the board. At the crux of that dispute is Rauner's desire to make it easier for the state to subcontract to the private sector for services ordinarily performed by state workers. Rauner's team initially wanted unlimited ability to subcontract, saying it needed flexibility to find cost savings to get the state's finances in order. AFSCME rejected that proposal outright. The Rauner administration came back with a modified proposal for what's known as \"managed competition,\" where the union would compete with private companies in bidding for contracts. The two sides spent months trading language on the idea, discussing it over the course of 21 bargaining days. On the day that the Rauner team decided the talks were deadlocked, AFSCME had proposed adding language requiring that bids from private contractors would have to \"meet the standard of greater efficiency, economy or other related factors\" \u2014 language that the administration already had made clear it opposed. \"Subcontracting was the insurmountable issue that really got to the heart of the beliefs of both parties,\" said labor board member Keith Snyder, a former mayor of Lincoln appointed by Rauner last year. \"Dealing with what the state is trying to deal with in terms of financial crisis, and AFSCME trying to deal with protection of jobs and members' jobs and things like that.\" While the state labor panel is comprised of five people appointed by the governor, Snyder is one of just two who joined the board after Rauner took office. The others were first appointed under past administrations. AFSCME's Lindall criticized the board for going against the recommendation of the administrative law judge. The union spokesman accused the Rauner administration of having \"sabotaged the collective bargaining process\" but reiterated the union's long-held public position that it does not want to go on strike. \"We have long contended that the governor is trying to impose his unfair terms or force state workers, if they don't want to accept those, to go out on strike,\" Lindall said. \"We think that a strike would be harmful to the people of Illinois, and Gov. Rauner's path of chaos and confrontation is not in the public interest.\" The animosity between the governor and AFSCME dates to the 2014 campaign, when candidate Rauner made it known he would be willing to shut down the government and fire public workers if that's what it took to achieve his objectives. His disdain for AFSCME also was apparent in his preferred nickname for the union: \"Af-scammy.\" Rauner's opposition to the union is both ideological and political. AFSCME has long been allied with Democrats in state government, helping fuel their political campaigns with donations and on-the-ground help from its army of members. The union's key function is to negotiate a master collective bargaining agreement that covers roughly 40,000 state government workers and sets the terms for the health benefits offered to current and retired state employees. It's a dynamic that Rauner has derided as a conflict of interest because the union can work to influence the outcome of elections, then sit across the negotiating table from those it helped to elect. Rauner's personal fortune allowed him to self-fund much of his 2014 campaign, and he ran as someone who would not be beholden to organized labor, which he blamed for much of the state's financial woes. That raised the stakes on the contract talks as Rauner set out to make good on the promise that electing an \"outsider\" would make it possible to weaken the union's influence on state finances. From the beginning, AFSCME viewed the contract negotiations as just one piece of a broader Rauner-led assault on union power in Illinois. In one of his first acts as governor, Rauner tried to halt the practice of unions collecting fees from nonunion workers. He also called for banning campaign contributions by unions and called for the creation of \"empowerment zones\" where voters could decide to limit union influence. All of that formed the backdrop for negotiations. AFSCME Executive Director Roberta Lynch's opening remarks on the first day of contract talks made reference to Rauner's past statements about \"corrupt union bosses\" and \"sweetheart deals,\" and she repeatedly questioned whether the state intended to bargain in good faith. For a total of 67 days over the course of nearly a year of contract talks, AFSCME's more than 230 bargaining representatives, led by Lynch, sparred with the Rauner administration's negotiators in meetings that often were overseen by federal mediators. In her 400-page retelling and analysis of the negotiations, Labor Board Administrative Law Judge Sarah Kerley described the talks as \"atypical\" from the start, and marked by a \"battle mindset on both sides of the table.\" Even the process of establishing ground rules for negotiations was contentious and took weeks to resolve. At times, the disagreements turned profane, with Lynch at one point telling a Rauner negotiator to \"get the (expletive) out!\" AFSCME's distrust of the Rauner administration ran so deep that the union spent much of the year waging a parallel effort to take the matter out of Rauner's hands by pushing legislation that would allow an independent arbitrator to step in. Twice, the Democrat-led General Assembly passed legislation allowing for the arbitrator, and twice Rauner vetoed the measure. So by the time Rauner referred the dispute to the labor board in January 2016, two shadows were looming over the talks: the governor's anti-union political stance and the union's efforts to get around him in the midst of negotiations. As is standard in any negotiation, both sides started out with wish lists that were unacceptable to the other side. Rauner wanted to delete a number of provisions in the expired contract, including restrictions on subcontracting and rules for filling positions after layoffs. He took aim at the state workers' 37.5-hour workweek, saying overtime shouldn't kick in until 40 hours had been worked. The administration wanted to freeze wages and institute a merit pay system that would reward high performers with nonpensionable bonuses. And it sought to increase the worker-paid share of health care costs. AFSME wanted a 2 percent pay raise in the first year of the contract followed by 3 percent increases for the following years. The union also wanted to add bereavement leave and expand parental leave for state workers. On health care, the union wanted to add benefits without increasing the cost to workers. In bargaining sessions, the two sides moved slightly, but some lines were clearly drawn. Kerley concluded that there was indeed a deadlock over certain issues, including subcontracting, holiday scheduling and vacation. But she reasoned that there was still room to negotiate on other issues, including wages and health care, since the administration hadn't provided requested information and was seeking to make changes that can't be imposed unilaterally. But Kerley also provided commentary on the process that called into question whether either side had good reason to believe they'd ever reach a deal. \"After weeks and weeks hearing testimony of the parties on the status of negotiations and reviewing the record in this case, I am left with the firm impression that the state felt an urgency to reach a resolution while the union was content to negotiate by infinitesimal increments,\" Kerley wrote in her recommendation to the labor board. \"There is certainly evidence in the record to support that the union did not believe it would reach agreement at the bargaining table. From the very early days of negotiations, the union accused the state of seeking to destroy the union, pointing, in part, to many proposals the state ultimately withdrew.\" AFSCME contends that even given the labor board's ruling, Rauner can't implement all of his contract changes since some, like the merit pay system, would require employees to voluntarily waive their legal rights to have their pay count toward their retirement pensions. The labor board decided to sidestep that issue. In a nod to the likelihood that the contract dispute will land in court, board Chairman John Hartnett declined to let the board weigh in. \"It may be for some other body to determine,\" Hartnett said. kgeiger@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Serena Shim is pictured here in an undated photo provided by her family. It was supposed to be Serena Shim's last assignment inside Turkey reporting for an Iranian news agency when the Lebanese-American journalist died in what her family claims was a \"targeted hit.\" Two years after Shim's October 2014 death, her family is renewing its call for the U.S. government to investigate her case -- claiming the 29-year-old mother from Michigan was deliberately driven off the road in a staged car accident. \"I\u2019ve heard nothing from the State Department or the Turkish government,\" Judy Poe, Shim's mother, told FoxNews.com Tuesday from her home in Harrison Township, a suburb of Detroit. Related Image Expand / Contract Serena Shim Shim, who had reported extensively on the alleged smuggling of ISIS militants across the Syrian-Turkish border, was killed for \"telling the truth,\" according to Poe. Shim was working for Iran's state-owned network Press TV on Oct. 26, 2014 when she riding in the passenger seat of a rental car, driven by her cousin, Judy Irish -- who was 16 at the time --\u00a0in the Turkish town of Suruc, near the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish media outlets initially said Shim died after her car collided head-on with a large cement mixer -- despite traveling along a one-way highway -- and showed photos that appeared to support such reports. But Shim's mother and cousin -- who suffered only a broken nose in the crash -- said they believe the scene was staged to look like an accident. Irish, who blacked out after the car's airbags deployed, said she did not collide head-on with a cement truck. Instead, she said, a truck hit them from behind and ran their car off the road.\u00a0 \"I was driving on a three-lane, one-way highway in the fast lane,\" she told FoxNews.com. \"I could see the semi-truck that was behind me in the middle lane. And he was going very quickly and he sped up in front of me and cut me off, making me crash into him.\" The accident came just days after Shim said she had been threatened by Turkish intelligence services, who accused her of being a spy, according to her mother. Poe, who claims she was in regular contact with Shim, said her daughter had been threatened by Turkish officials after reporting ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth across the Syrian-Turkish border in the back of aid vehicles. \"Turkish officials wanted to speak with her \u2013 they went to her hotel and they went to local shops she had frequented,\" she said. Poe, citing Turkish media reports, said Irish was transported to a refugee hospital some 15 minutes away from the scene. Her daughter, whom she affectionately referred to as \"Sassy,\" was transported to a hospital nearly three hours away -- one where ISIS members were receiving free medical care, Poe claims. \"Initial reports said my daughter had died at the scene,\" Poe said. \"Then they said she died from a heart attack.\" The family also claims that the car pictured in the crash scene photos online is not the one Shim and her cousin had rented. Shim was buried in Lebanon on Oct. 22. \"There was not a single mark on Sassy,\" said Poe, who was able to view her daughter's body inside a Beirut morgue before she was buried. The State Department previously told FoxNews.com it does not conduct investigations into deaths overseas. Turkish media outlets, meanwhile, reported that Shim's cousin was responsible for the crash. An official report obtained by Hurriyet Daily News claimed Irish was the \"sole culprit\" and the truck driver was not in any way responsible. Related Image Shim was born in Michigan and raised in both Dearborn and Livonia, where she graduated from Clarenceville High School. She went on to attend the American University of Technology in Lebanon, where her biological father lives. \"She was a target, without a doubt. She knew too much,\" Poe said of her daughter. In a recording saved on Poe's cellphone, Shim said Turkish officials believed she was a spy but did not indicate for whom. \"She was doing very important work over there,\" Poe said. \"I miss everything about her,\" she said. \"I still can't believe she's not going to walk through the door.\" Advertisement ",

He also notes that some Republicans could withhold support from national reciprocity because of states' rights. \"If you believe in any local autonomy, as Republicans claim to, then the broad version of reciprocity undermines that significantly,\" Winkler says. \"Because a state or city like Los Angeles would no longer be able to control who carries guns in public.\" 2. An end to gun-free military zones At a rally in January, Trump said , \"My first day, there's no more gun-free zones.\" He was talking about schools and military bases. He later clarified his position on schools, saying that school resource officers or teachers should be allowed to carry them. He has not publicly changed his opinion on military bases. Currently, most gun owners on military bases must register their firearm and store it in an armory while on base. The only people who can carry guns while on a military base are on-duty military, state or local police. There have been pushes by the NRA and Republican lawmakers to allow more military personnel to carry firearms on base, following mass shootings at Fort Hood in 2009 and the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard in 2013, but the Department of Defense has not changed its position. Under Trump, it might. \"This is very easy,\" Winkler says. \"Allowing carrying of firearms on military bases is something that the president will probably be able to do through executive order. I believe that [Trump] will.\" 3. Removing suppressors from the National Firearms Act Gun owners can already use suppressors \u2014 or silencers \u2014 in most states, but gun rights groups say that the process to get one is onerous. Suppressors are regulated under the National Firearms Act, which was originally enacted in 1934 following the St. Valentine's Day Massacre to tax the making and transfer of certain firearms. The underlying purpose of the act, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was to \" curtail, if not prohibit, transactions in NFA firearms .\" Gun rights advocates and shooters have long argued that suppressors should not be regulated by the NFA and have made a public health argument for their use: Guns are loud. \"Everybody that you know that's an old shooter is deaf,\" says Michelle Camp, the leader of the Utah chapter of The Well-Armed Woman. \"To have the ability to get [suppressors] easier would be really helpful.\" Winkler says it would take legislative action to get suppressors off the NFA list and that a piece of legislation already exists: the Hearing Protection Act of 2015 , proposed in the House of Representatives. Winkler says he doesn't expect it to be a priority for Congress, but \"if the NRA decides to get behind silencer legislation, I think it will pass,\" he says. Hours after Trump won last week's election, the NRA dropped this tweet: \u2014 NRABlog (@NRAblog) November 9, 2016 4. Revamping federal background check process Nobody is entirely happy with the federal government's current background check process or its database, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Gun control groups argue that there are too many loopholes in it, and many gun rights groups concur \u2014 a rare show of agreement \u2014 though not in the details. The system is supposed to prevent a felon or someone who is mentally ill from purchasing a gun, but it has obstacles like underfunding and inaccurate, out-of-date data. Gun control groups would like to see things in the current system fixed, including the straw purchasing loophole. Gun rights groups say they'd like to find ways to get the system better data to work with. During his campaign, Trump said that he was against expanding background checks and that the current system needs to be fixed. \"Unfortunately, I feel the efforts to 'fix' the background check system will be really efforts to gut the background check system,\" Winkler says. \"To make it less effective, less streamlined, and make it harder for prosecutors to find gun criminals. That's been the NRA's practice with regard to background checks in the past.\" ",

By Juliet Eilperin and Greg Jaffe November 15 at 10:57 AM Follow @eilperin Follow @GregJaffe Speaking in Greece at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, President Obama warned against the sense of \"tribalism\" taking root in the populist movements around the world. (The Washington Post) ATHENS \u2014 President Obama warned Tuesday that Americans and people around the world \u201care going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism, or ethnic identity, or tribalism\u201d taking root amid the populist movements that are gaining currency around the world. Speaking at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras by his side, Obama refrained from criticizing President-elect Donald Trump directly as he discussed the impact of his electoral victory last week. But the president made it clear that he sees a dark side to the kind of populist movements Trump's campaign embodied \u2014 ideals that other conservative leaders are advocating in Europe and elsewhere. \u201cWe are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism, or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them, and I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common, as opposed to those things that separate us and ultimately lead us into conflict,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTake Europe,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe know what happens when Europeans start dividing themselves up and emphasizing their differences and seeing a competition between various countries in a zero-sum way. The 20th century was a bloodbath.\u201d Obama, who made it clear during the course of the hour-long news conference that he did not view the recent U.S. election results\u00a0as a referendum on his own tenure or world vision, suggested that targeting specific racial, religious ethnic groups could backfire. \u201cIn the United States we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along the lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It is dangerous. It is dangerous, not just for the minority groups that are subjected to that kind of discrimination, or in some cases in the past, violence, but because we then don\u2019t realize our potential as a country when we are preventing blacks or Latinos or Asians or gays or women from fully participating in the project of building American life,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my vision is right on that issue, and it may not always win the day in the short term in any particularly political circumstance, but I am confident it will win the day in the long term,\u201d Obama added. \u201cBecause societies which are able to unify ourselves around values and ideals and character, and how we treat each other, and cooperation and innovation, ultimately are going to be more successful than societies that don\u2019t.\u201d [ On his last European trip, Obama confronts the continent's refugee crisis ] The president suggested that a number of factors contributed to Trump's win. \u201cPresidential elections, they turn on personalities, they turn on how campaigns are run, they turn on natural desires for change if you\u2019ve had an incumbent who\u2019s been there for eight years; there\u2019s a temptation to think, \u2018Well, let\u2019s maybe make a change,\u2019 \" he said. \u201cI think there are a whole range of factors involved.\u201d The president said there was \u201ca mismatch\u201d between his own job approval rating, which stood at 56 percent just before Election Day, and Democrats' loss of the White House. \u201cPeople seem to think I did a pretty good job,\u201d he said. But Obama acknowledged that there was a common theme in the recent U.S. presidential election, Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union, and other populist movements elsewhere. \u201cGlobalization, combined with technology, combined with social media and constant information, have disrupted people\u2019s lives, sometimes in very concrete ways,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also psychologically, people are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world. It starts looking different and disorienting.\u201d \u201cAnd there is no doubt that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right, in many countries in Europe. When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders, very unconventional candidates, have considerable success, obviously there\u2019s something there that\u2019s being tapped into,\u201d he said. \u201cI think at times of significant stress, people are going to be looking for something, and they don't always know exactly what it is that they're looking for, and they might opt for change, even if they\u2019re not entirely confident what that change will bring.\u201d Obama had hoped that his visit to Europe would reassure America's allies as he prepared to leave office. But it has been dominated by questions about what a Trump presidency means for the long-standing transatlantic alliance. Tsipras, for his part, thanked Obama for his support over the years and said he was hopeful the U.S.-Greece alliance would remain unchanged. Echoing Obama\u2019s recent remarks, Tsipras warned that it would be difficult for Trump to \u201cradically change the foreign policy of a country such as the United States.\u201d He urged his fellow European leaders to work with the new president, by building \u201cbridges, not walls.\u201d Both Tsipras and Greek President\u00a0Prokopis Pavlopoulos met with Obama on Tuesday, and they pressed him to lobby European Union officials to forgive some of Greece's debt as well as accept some of the refugees now stranded in the country. \u201cWe strive to make all our partners understand that it is our duty to stay on the path of European integration, far from phobic syndromes and lack of solidarity, which can only undermine our common European future,\u201d\u00a0Pavlopoulos said. During the news conference, Tsipras said his government was committed to making institutional reforms. Additional debt relief, he said, would make it more politically acceptable \u201cbecause after seven years, people cannot take any more austerity.\u201d Jaffe contributed to this report from Washington.

Republican Majority Whip Steve Scalise holds a hat from Donald Trump's campaign as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, left, and House Speaker Paul Ryan look on. (European Pressphoto Agency) Lisa Mascaro Paul D. Ryan appears\u00a0to be cruising toward reelection as House speaker, but\u00a0his bold promise Tuesday of a new \u201cdawn\u201d\u00a0for GOP unity \u2014 Republican lawmakers found \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats waiting on their chairs at a morning meeting\u00a0\u2014 does not hide the deep divisions that remain. There\u2019s a clash growing between Donald Trump \u2019s new vision of the Republican Party, which includes increased spending on several fronts, and budget hawks like Ryan and the GOP's small-government Freedom Caucus, whose ideology had previously dominated the party. It\u2019s not just that the president-elect has promised costly big-ticket items \u2014\u00a0beefing up the military, building a wall along the border with Mexico and improving the social safety net, including healthcare. Trump has also shown little interest in Ryan\u2019s signature budget-slashing proposals \u2014\u00a0such as cutting entitlement spending on Medicare and Medicaid \u2014\u00a0which had long\u00a0been central to the GOP\u2019s plan for reducing deficits. Trump names top aides as he begins laying out a White House strategy Nov. 15, 2016, 6:18 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening in Washington right now:Trump's elevation of Stephen K. Bannon to top White... (Lisa Mascaro) In fact, very little of what Trump promised to do during the campaign\u00a0involved cutting government spending. Rather, he spoke of investing in the nation, creating jobs, and he once proudly proclaimed himself \u201cthe king of debt\u201d in his business dealings. Ryan says he now talks to Trump every day, despite their on-again, off-again relationship and warnings that Ryan might face a move to oust him as speaker during Tuesday\u2019s internal GOP vote. Instead, House Republicans unanimously agreed Tuesday to nominate the Wisconsin Republican for another two-year term, rewarding his efforts to unify the party. The final House vote will take place in January. But Ryan\u00a0acknowledged that they are only beginning to work through the details of a unified Republican agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to figure out exactly what bill comes where and how it all adds up,\u201d Ryan said. The first clash may come over Trump\u2019s call for a $1-trillion infrastructure program.\u00a0Even if Trump relies on private investment, as his advisors have suggested, the notion of using government to prime the pump to create jobs stunned many conservatives\u00a0when it received top billing\u00a0on election night. Scope of Donald Trump's falsehoods unprecedented for presidential candidate \u00bb Dan Holler, spokesman at the conservative Heritage Action for America,\u00a0was taken aback as he watched Trump\u2019s victory speech and the president-elect spoke of his\u00a0\u201cbeautiful\u201d\u00a0program for new bridges, roads, airports and schools. To many that sounded more like the dream of big-spending Democrats than the Republican just elected to the White House. \u201cIt would be a mistake to think that\u2019s what the people were clamoring for,\u201d said Holler, whose\u00a0influential group tries to hold the line against spending. \u201cAs if that is the main message of the campaign\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that we need a massive stimulus.\u201d Indeed, a week before election, when most still thought Hillary Clinton would win, GOP officials were preparing to attack the Democratic nominee\u2019s own, much smaller\u00a0infrastructure program as wasteful and unnecessary. On Tuesday, former House Speaker John A. Boehner, himself a casualty of GOP infighting, referred to\u00a0Trump as a friend,\u00a0but also\u00a0\u201cbarely\u00a0Republican.\u201d The battle over spending is just one of the challenges that lie ahead as Republicans adjust to fact that they have now\u00a0achieved\u00a0what they long sought:\u00a0Republican control of the White House and Congress \u00a0for the first time in a decade.\u00a0 Because Trump doesn\u2019t neatly align with any previous strain of the GOP,\u00a0it will only confound\u00a0the job facing\u00a0congressional leaders like Ryan. \u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a learning curve as [Republicans]\u00a0transition from opposing the policies of Democrats to implementing a conservative agenda,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former top aide to Boehner.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no question this is a huge step into the unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are building an airplane while in flight.\u201d In that sense, Trump\u2019s election won\u2019t end the civil war between Republicans on Capitol Hill. In fact, it may only complicate matters by adding a\u00a0new front in their internal battle\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a Republican-led\u00a0White House. To be sure, Trump and\u00a0the party share some\u00a0goals \u2014\u00a0repealing Obamacare, cutting taxes and reducing regulations.\u00a0 And Ryan is trying hard to\u00a0steer the conversation with Trump to the House GOP\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d agenda \u2014\u00a0his blueprint for small-government. (Brian Bennett) He said recently that the effort to repeal Obamacare should also tackle reforms to Medicare and Medicaid. Trump has given nod to the document, but it is unclear how broadly it might be adopted by the new administration. Trump has often spoke of protecting entitlement programs, rather than scaling them back. The possibility for friction between Congress and the White House\u00a0is only made worse by the fact that Trump named as his top strategist\u00a0Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News\u00a0head who previously\u00a0declared war on GOP establishment leaders like Ryan. Also, Trump is facing his own pressure to deliver on election promises. \u201cThe people Trump spoke to, who helped him get elected \u2013 \u2018the forgotten people\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019re going to be looking for results,\u201d said Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist who was a top aide to former Majority Leader Eric Cantor . \u201cThere aren\u2019t excuses anymore. You can\u2019t blame it on divided government.\u201d And at the end of the day, Trump may have the upper hand, given his victory. \u201cIt\u2019s not a power sharing arrangement,\u201d said Craig Shirley, a Republican strategist who has written extensively about President Reagan. \u201cTrump is the head of the party \u2014\u00a0it is his party now.\u201d The\u00a0Trump administration may encounter the steepest resistance from\u00a0the so-called Freedom Caucus, which before Trump was the most powerful insurgent faction inside the GOP, leading the charge against Boehner and in the\u00a0budget wars against Obama administration. Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top White House aides and says deportations will begin immediately \u00bb The caucus of several dozen lawmakers\u00a0was divided over whether to support Trump\u2019s candidacy\u00a0and it\u2019s unclear\u00a0how much of a honeymoon they will give the new president. Already some members who backed Trump are warning that deficit spending may be a bridge too far. \u201cThere\u2019s Democrats and Republicans who believe deficits don\u2019t matter,\u201d said Republican Rep. Warren Davidson, a Trump backer and one of the newest Freedom Caucus members, who took over Boehner\u2019s Ohio district. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the Freedom Caucus that stands for that.\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Penn.), a key moderate, cautioned it was too soon to declare an end to GOP in-fighting. \u201cThe dynamics that we\u2019ve been dealing with all session need to change,\u201d Dent said. \u201cWhether they will change or not is still a bit of an open question.\u201d For the moment, Ryan seems to be navigating between the party\u2019s factions, easily winning Tuesday\u2019s nomination vote in the House GOP conference. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield was elected to serve another term as majority leader. A similar outcome is expected across the Capitol on Wednesday when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky stands for reelection as party leader. Even so, the final vote could still prove difficult for Ryan when the new Congress convenes in January. \u00a0Ryan was slow to embrace Trump. But in the final days of the election, the potential for Republicans to sweep control of the House, Senate and White House drew him in. \u201cI\u2019m not looking backward, I\u2019m looking forward,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m looking for how we make this work for the American people.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

    "text": "Email House Republicans unanimously re-elected Speaker Paul Ryan Tuesday during an internal leadership election ahead of the official election held on the floor in January. His re-election comes nearly a week after Donald Trump declared victory in the presidential election and after some speculation that Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and 2012 vice presidential nominee, wouldn\u2019t want to hold the gavel any longer after the election, especially if he has future White House ambitions. During the campaign, there were tense moments between Trump and Ryan. In early October, for example, Ryan announced that he would no longer campaign for or defend his party\u2019s nominee after the 2005 Access Hollywood tape surfaced showing Trump making lewd comments about women. But after Trump\u2019s shocking win last week, Ryan celebrated and said the president-elect would lead a \u201cunified Republican government\u201d in which it has full control of Congress. Democrats, on the other hand, are struggling to keep their party together and stay unified after their election losses. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, announced Tuesday behind closed doors that leadership elections for her caucus would be postponed until after Thanksgiving on Nov. 30. \u00a0Their elections\u00a0were originally scheduled for Thursday. Ryan has served as speaker since October 2015 after House Republicans debated who should lead their conference after John Boehner\u2019s resignation from the speaker\u2019s chair and Congress. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri CARLO ALLEGRI / Reuters Share advertisement Exit polls show that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender voters overwhelming sided with Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, with 78 percent of the community voting for the Democratic candidate. As the shock of Donald Trump's election victory sinks in, though, many may wonder\u2014just who are the 14 percent of LGBTQ voters who support the Trump-Pence administration? NBC OUT spoke with several gay and lesbian Trump supporters who, together, form a surprisingly diverse sampling of Republican voters. They are black, Latino and white. They range in age from just 19 to nearly 40. They live in Mississippi, Florida, California, New Jersey and the Midwest. They all have one thing in common: They believe that Donald Trump is the best choice for president of the United States. Vice president-elect Mike Pence and Republican president-elect Donald Trump shake hands during his election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. Mark Wilson / Getty Images When asked why they voted for Trump and what they hoped his incoming administration would do to benefit the LGBTQ community, many of these voters echoed each other in their hopes for the future. Most also emphasized that they were less concerned with the LGBTQ-related aspects of the Trump platform than they were with general issues like national security, economy, and the right to bear arms. RELATED: How Trump's 100-Day Plan Could Impact LGBTQ Rights While it's clear that the majority of the LGBTQ community leans liberal\u2014and remains fearful that the Trump-Pence administration will instigate increased discrimination and a step backward for equality\u2014gay Trump voters don't appear to share the concerns of the larger community. In fact, they are thrilled to support a man who many Republicans say is the first truly LGBTQ-friendly GOP president. 'Gun Rights Are Gay Rights' Anaise Hernandez is a 19-year-old college student in Florida who voted for the first time in the 2016 election. She told NBC OUT that she realized she was a Republican after a semester studying Democratic Socialism: \"That changed my perspective on politics.\" Plus, Hernandez added, \"gun rights are gay rights.\" \"After the Pulse tragedy, it's important for the LGBT community to become informed about firearms,\" she said. In this photo taken June 12, 2016, Orlando Police officers direct family members away from a shooting involving multiple fatalities at the Pulse Orlando nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP Vincent Foster, 27, is the president of the Miami chapter of gay conservative group Log Cabin Republicans, which made news this fall for endorsing Trump despite the national organization's decision not to. As a black gay man, he said, he's been called everything from an \"Uncle Tom\" to a \"self-hating f-g\" for his support of Trump. Foster emphasized gun policy as a reason why he\u2014and his chapter\u2014decided that Trump was the best candidate for president. \"Gay men, lesbians and the trans community are being targeted every single day,\" Foster said. \"Gun rights are gay rights. The best way to protect yourself is your Second Amendment right.\" 'Radical Islam' Foster was also attracted to Trump's stated commitment to \"Stopping radical Islamic terror by defeating ISIS and any other group that wants to bring harm to American citizens.\" \"When you have a group that thinks I deserve to be thrown off a building because I'm gay, I want them eliminated,\" Foster said. 'Keeping Jobs Here in America' \"With marriage equality settled, I want to see the Trump administration work to improve the lives of gay families,\" Joseph Murray told NBC OUT. \"I want to see President Trump renegotiate our failed trade deals to create jobs for LGBT families.\" Murray's LGBTrump Facebook page was one of the most visible pro-Trump LGBTQ groups during the campaign, with just under 6,000 followers. Murray, who resides in Mississippi, cited \"sovereignty, trade, immigration and foreign policy\" as his top platform concerns. Juan Hernandez, a 38-year-old Log Cabin Republican in California, told NBC OUT that jobs were among the reasons he voted for Trump. \"I believe in keeping jobs here in America,\" Hernandez said. \"[Trump] is an excellent businessman and know that he will make America great and strong again.\" 'Marriage Equality' New Jersey resident Kathleen Griffin, 39, said her decision to vote Trump was based just as much on Clinton's background as it was on Trump's own statements. Texas marriage plaintiffs, Mark Phariss (grey suit) and Vic Holmes speak at a Human Rights Campaign press conference in Austin, Texas a few days after the SCOTUS ruling on marriage equality in the United States. Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc. / Corbis via Getty Images \"Bill Clinton signed the DOMA bill into to law in 1996,\" Griffin said. \"Hillary's position on gay marriage has flipped flopped as it suited her political ambitions.\" Griffin told NBC OUT she expects Trump to \"leave the marriage equality act intact and continue to support all Americans without prejudice around sexual preference, race or religion.\" RELATED: Trumps Says He's 'Fine' With Same-Sex Marriage Joe Murray also cited Clinton's changing positions as a reason to have faith in the Trump administration. \"While Trump was admitting a gay couple to his club Mar-a-Lago, Hillary was declaring marriage was between one man and one woman,\" Murray said. \"Hillary's support for marriage equality only came after the Supreme Court's decision was inevitable. It was a convenient conversion that carried little political risk.\" 'I Believe in the Wall' \"I believe in the wall,\" said Juan Hernandez of the California Log Cabin Republicans. \"I believe in deporting undocumented immigrants\u2014specifically the people in the criminal justice system, gang affiliates and drug dealers.\" Hernandez also stated support for Trump's national security plan regarding Muslim immigrants: \"I believe in his national security policy and having a vetting system, a strong system in place for bringing in the Muslim refugees and that we should suspend all refugee immigration until one is in place.\" 'Who's to Say [Pence] Won't Evolve ... ?' While all of the LGBTQ Trump voters interviewed for this story expressed faith in Trump's interest in protecting the community, some cited insecurities around Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the Indiana governor whose r eputation was largely built on anti-LGBTQ policies and the fight against marriage equality. Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrives at Trump Tower, November 15, 2016 in New York City. Drew Angerer / Getty Images \"I hope they won't treat us as outcasts and will support us as they do everyone else,\" 29-year-old lesbian Alyx Perna of Mississippi told NBC OUT . \"I feel like we should be more concerned with Pence and his motives against the LGBT community. I believe Trump will continue to support us though.\" Juan Hernandez suggested that Trump's more LGBTQ-friendly leanings could be a shield against Pence's apparent vitriol. He also expressed faith in Pence's ability to transform: \"Who's to say he won't evolve just like the Democrats did?\" \"If Pence begins to change discrimination laws protecting the LGBT community, I will be one of the people [in the] front row to come out and ensure the LGBT community is not harmed,\" Hernandez added. \"Pence had already evolved as he amended his freedom of religion act in Indiana.\" 'Obama Abused His Executive Power' Democratic LGBTQ voters have been blanketing social media\u2014and the phone lines at national organizations like Human Rights Campaign\u2014with fears about Trump's \"100-day action plan.\" In the plan, also called the \" Contract With the American Voter ,\" Trump states his intention of overturning Obama's executive orders and memorandums. That could mean overturning some of the LGBTQ equality orders, such as protecting transgender people as an equal class under Department of Education (DOE) and Health and Human Services (HHS) policy. President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the Brady press briefing room at the White House in Washington, Monday, Nov. 14. Susan Walsh / AP For Joseph Murray, the methodology of the Obama administration was a problem\u2014and he's happy to see some of those orders overturned. \"President Obama abused his executive power, and while LGBT folks may have benefited from those orders, the end does not justify the means,\" Murray explained. \"So long as LGBT folks are treated fairly, which they are, we do not need Obama's orders. Americans deserve equal treatment, not special treatment.\" Juan Hernandez did not specify whether he thought Trump would overturn the DOE and HHS transgender policies, but he \"truly hope[s] that Trump can support the trans community.\" \"Gays and trans [people] are so picked on, there needs to be protection for them with discrimination laws and safe spaces,\" Hernandez said. \"I have faith that the Trump administration will extend their protection of the gay community to the trans [community] as well. It starts from the top.\" \"I'm not concerned with Trump releasing every single one of Obama's executive orders. I don't think that's going to happen,\" Vince Foster said, adding that he did not believe Obama's support for LGBTQ rights was sincere. 'Federally Protected' Status While Trump's 100-day plan did not specifically refer to any LGBTQ-oriented policies, his gay and lesbian supporters expressed hopes that his administration would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in order to ensure LGBTQ Americans are protected from discrimination. Currently, there are no federal protections\u2014leaving the community vulnerable to blatant discrimination in public accommodations across the nation. \"I would love for the LGBT community to be in the same federally protected statute as race, religion and nationality,\" Vincent Foster said. \"That hasn't been a priority on the Republican side or on the Democrat side. I'm a states-rights person, but if all the other minorities are getting that protection, hell, I want them too.\" Anaise Hernandez is also holding out hope for federal protections for the community under Trump, pointing to the president-elect's 2000 interview with The Advocate , where he said, \"I like the idea of amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation. It would be simple. It would be straightforward ... Amending the Civil Rights Act would grant the same protection to gay people that we give to other Americans\u2014it's only fair.\" 'I Have Lost So Many Friends' All of the vocal gay and lesbian Trump voters interviewed for this article said their support has come at a price. Kathleen Griffin said that she's been threatened with violence and has had her sexual orientation questioned by other lesbians because she is a Republican. \"I came out at 19 years old in 1996 when it was not nearly as accepted,\" Griffin told NBC OUT. \"I had my struggles with not being accepted by family and heterosexual friends. Being treated this way by members of the LGBT community makes me feel like an outcast.\" Juan Hernandez said that he often hears \"because I am gay and Latino that I should be a Democrat.\" \"They have personally attacked me verbally and on social media,\" Hernandez said of LGBTQ and Latino Democrats. \"I have had plenty of death threats and name-calling that I should watch my back, that I am not even a citizen, that I am a sp-c and the Republican party will turn their back on me, that I will burn in hell, that I have a target on my back, that they are going to kill me ... I've had it all.\" Joesph Murray's LGBTrump group is often contacted by reporters, but he said that some of the group's members \"are fearful of retribution and would not do media.\" He said that \"hateful\" criticism often appears in the form of comments and posts on the group's Facebook page. \"I have lost so many 'friends' throughout this whole election process,\" Alyx Perna said. \"I understand that most of the LGBT community feels threatened by the new President-elect and his VP, but right now all we can do is wait and see what fight we are in for, if anything at all.\" Follow NBC OUT on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .

    "text": "By Rebecca Shabad CBS News November 15, 2016, 11:22 AM House Democrats, grappling with losses, postpone leadership elections U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) takes part in a news conference after a meeting with representatives from the Chambers Senators and Deputies of Mexico, in Mexico City, Mexico, May 2, 2016. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido Email House Democrats on Tuesday delayed their leadership elections that were slated for Thursday as lawmakers grapple with their election losses and as speculation grows about a bid to challenge their long-time leader Nancy Pelosi. During a closed-door caucus meeting, Pelosi, the House minority leader, announced that her caucus would forgo a vote on Thursday. Leadership elections have instead been rescheduled for after Thanksgiving on Nov. 30, according to an aide in the room, who said that was the original date Pelosi had proposed. Members coming out of the meeting said there was consensus in the room that they needed more time to reflect on the election outcome last week. \u201cFrom my standpoint, I don\u2019t care when the election is. I do care that we have the strongest possible leadership at the table, whoever that may be. But again, we\u2019ve been through hell, and it\u2019s only going to get worse as [Donald Trump] makes his appointments and we have this fight. But we have to see it as an opportunity,\u201d Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues, according to the aide. \u201cThe American people expect us to be united,\u201d said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, the aide said. The announcement from Pelosi to delay the elections comes after a group of Democrats circulated a letter requesting that they be postponed. \u201cIt is vital that our Caucus take the time to listen to the American people and learn the lessons of this difficult election in order to put our Caucus in the best position to fight the potentially dangerous agenda of President-elect Donald Trump and to have a realistic chance of taking back the House in 2018,\u201d said the letter obtained by CBS News. Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Kathleen Rice of New York and Ruben Gallego of Arizona are among the Democrats who signed onto the letter. \u201cWe ask that you postpone leadership elections at least until after the Thanksgiving recess. We feel very strongly that our Members deserve the opportunity to thoroughly discuss the results of the election and analyze how our Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s strategy fell so short of our goals,\u201d the letter said. Rep. Tim Ryan oh Ohio, who has served in Congress since 2003, is reportedly considering mounting a challenge against Pelosi, who has served as House Democratic leader since her party won back control of the House in 2007. As House Democrats scramble to regroup, there is also a race for the next leader of the Democratic National Committee. Progressives are lobbying for Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota who was elected as the first Muslim member of Congress and who announced his bid for DNC chairman on Monday. Other people who have expressed interest are former DNC chairman Howard Dean and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley said he was looking at it closely.

    "text": "How Might Donald Trump's Campaign Affect His Brand? Building resident Linda Gottlieb and several neighbors began the petition after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood video in which Trump talked in vulgar terms about groping women. Along with several other residents, Gottlieb printed leaflets and passed them around the building. The petition read in part: \"Trump's appalling treatment of women, his history of racism, his attacks on immigrants, his mockery of the disabled, his tax avoidance, his outright lying \u2014 all are antithetical to the values we and our families believe in.\" A few people refused to sign, saying they supported Trump, she said. \"I said, 'That's your right to do so, and we all have the right of free speech,' \" Gottlieb said. \"Nobody was forcing anyone to sign. If they wished to, they could.\" Gottlieb said she was \"absolutely thrilled\" by the decision to change the name. \"The residents of the building were overwhelmingly in favor of getting the name down because he and his name do not represent the values that most of us have. And you don't want to walk into your apartment and look at the name of someone with whom you violently disagree,\" she said. The decision to change the name is the latest sign that the bitter presidential campaign may have taken a toll on Trump's celebrated brand. Although Trump himself is a lifelong New Yorker, much of the city supported Democrat Hillary Clinton, especially in Manhattan, about 83 percent of which voted for her. ",

(Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Chicago Police officials hold a press conference in Garfield Park in Chicago on Nov. 15, 2016, to announce that an arrest has been made in the death of 2-year-old Kyrian Knox, whose body parts were found in the park's lagoon. (Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune)\u00a0 Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter A man who was caring for 2-year-old Kyrian Knox in the summer of 2015 \"snapped\" and killed the toddler after the lactose-intolerant boy was fed milk and cried for a whole afternoon, police said. Kyrian's dismembered remains were found in the Garfield Park Lagoon on the West Side on Sept. 5, 2015. Police said in a news conference at the park Tuesday that a 41-year-old man is awaiting murder charges at Area North police headquarters in Kyrian's slaying. He was brought to Chicago on Monday from the Winnebago County Jail, where he was in custody on unrelated charges. The man had made a false missing person report last year claiming that the toddler had disappeared, police said. While the Cook County medical examiner's office ruled Kyrian's death a homicide, Area North Police Cmdr. Kevin said Tuesday that no one has been able to determine exactly how Kyrian was killed. \"Based on third party statements,\" Kyrian ingested milk one day, even though he was lactose intolerant, Duffin said. The toddler then kept crying all afternoon, said Duffin. The man \"kind of just snapped and couldn't deal with it anymore,\" he said. The break in the case came when police late last in 2015 found blood in the man's vehicle, yet the man denied that the toddler had been in the vehicle, Duffin\u00a0said.\u00a0 The blood was tested and this summer, police learned it matched the slain boy, said Duffin. \"Unfortunately, it took several months, I believe it was late July or early August of this year, when it was confirmed to be the baby's,\" he said. The remains of a\u00a0toddler found in Chicago's\u00a0Garfield Park Lagoon over Labor Day weekend in 2015 came\u00a0back as matching the DNA of 2-year-old Kyrian Knox, who was\u00a0reported missing in September\u00a0in Rockford. On Nov. 15, 2016, it was announced that an arrest had been made in the death of Knox. (Chicago Tribune) \"Once we took the vehicle with a search warrant, we...tore out the carpeting and recovered the baby's blood in the vehicle,\" he said. Police believe that Kyrian's remains were dumped in the lagoon because the man has family in the area of the park. \"As a father of a 6-month-old myself, it's hard to fathom why someone would do this to a child,\" said Ald. Jason Ervin, whose 28th Ward includes the park. \"But we are glad that this is the first step in bringing this case to justice.\" Kyrian wasn't reported missing until the foot of a toddler was found in the lagoon on Sept. 5, 2015. More remains were found over the course of two days. In mid-November last year, Chicago police said they were searching for a person of interest to question about the disappearance of Kyrian. Later that month, police said the couple who were last caring for Kyrian were refusing to cooperate in the investigation. At the time, they were not identified as suspects. Kyrian Knox Kyrian Knox is seen in this undated handout photo provided by Rockford Police.\u00a0 Kyrian Knox is seen in this undated handout photo provided by Rockford Police.\u00a0 (Rockford police) Police later said they had received DNA analysis matching the remains of Kyrian, who was reported missing from Rockford in mid-September. The medical examiner's office ruled Kyrian's manner of death was homicide, but the office did not determine a cause of death. Kyrian was believed to be in the care of a family friend before he was reported missing, according to Rockford police. Officials said the child could have been missing since August 2015. The toddler's mother, Lanisha Knox, 24, had moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with a high school friend who also has a 2-year-old. Both women left their children in the care of the high school friend's father who lived in Rockford, an official said. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0(iStock) The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a motley crew of atheists, agnostics and free-thinkers just got a lump of coal in their Christmas stockings. WXXM, the progressive talk radio station in Madison, Wisconsin, has flipped formats \u2013 leaving the uber-liberal city without a place to converse about micro-aggressions, plot protest marches or swap quinoa recipes. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that Liberal Talk \"92.1 The Mic\" will now be called\u00a0 \"92.1 BestFM\" -- \"Madison's Home for the Holidays.\" Yes, good readers -- progressive talk was replaced with around-the-clock Christmas music. Ho! Ho! Ho! Among the shows given the heave-ho as a result of the format change was \u201cFreethought Radio\u201d, a show hosted by the Freedom From Religion Foundation. \u00a0\u201cWe opened up the Wisconsin State Journal the morning after the election to read the remarkable announcement that progressive talk had been banished forthwith on 92.1 FM and replaced with around-the-clock Christmas music,\u201d FFRF co-founder Annie Gaylor said in a statement. Well, if that doesn\u2019t curdle an atheist\u2019s egg-nog I don\u2019t know what will. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the appropriate vehicle for Freethought Radio now,\u201d Ms. Gaylor lamented. The Freedom From Religion Foundation is not a big fan of the Baby Jesus. They make their living by filing lawsuits against towns that display the Nativity Scene and by bullying schools that sing Christmas carols. They\u2019re basically a bunch of godless Grinches \u2013 pillaging and plundering their way through the yuletide season. In 2015 the FFRF filed a federal lawsuit against an Indiana school district \u2013demanding the little Lord Jesus be evicted from a Christmas pageant. That same year, they were successful in banning public school choirs in Portland, Oregon from performing at a Catholic shrine called the Grotto. They also tried to bully the good people of Piedmont, Alabama for making \u201cKeep Christ in Christmas\u201d the theme of the annual holiday parade.\u00a0 But the FFRF\u2019s devious scheme was foiled by some mighty clever thinking. Instead of making it the \u201cofficial\u201d theme \u2013 the town decided to make it the \u201cunofficial\u201d theme. Radio Insight reports the station\u2019s flip to Christmas music will lead to a new format after the holidays. It\u2019s unclear what that format will be \u2013 but it\u2019s unlikely liberal talk will return to the airwaves. Christian \u00a0Examiner \u00a0reports the station's programming was being trounced in the ratings by conservative talk radio giants like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity (a great American and my colleague at Fox News). Let\u2019s be honest \u2013 would you rather listen to Rush and Sean or a gaggle of man-hating feminists in Birkenstocks warbling about the virtues of organic gardening. Progressive talk radio does not make for good talk radio and that\u2019s why WXXM opted to play Jingle Bells instead of blathering atheists. Now that the Freedom From Religion Foundation has been silenced, the citizens of Madison will finally be able to enjoy the holiday season with peace on Earth \u2013 goodwill to men. Christmas really is the most wonderful time of the year! Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

    "text": "Russia Announces Major Operation in Syria By sarah el deeb and vladimir isachenkov, associated press BEIRUT \u0097 Nov 15, 2016, 5:40 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Syria and Defeating ISIS: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Russian missiles pounded opposition targets in Syria on Tuesday, the start of a much-anticipated offensive, while activists reported the resumption of bombing in rebel-held neighborhoods of Aleppo for the first time in nearly a month, apparently by Syrian government warplanes. The Russian blitz began hours after President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump discussed Syria in a phone call and agreed on the need to combine efforts in the fight against what the Kremlin called their No. 1 enemy \u2014 \"international terrorism and extremism.\" Russia said its offensive, using long-range missiles and its carrier-borne jets in combat for the first time on opposition areas in Syria, focused on rebel-held northern Idlib province and parts of the central province of Homs. It didn't mention the besieged eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo. The new offensive was a sharp snub to the Obama administration and its policy toward Syria, and augurs a major escalation in the coming days that would put tens of thousands of civilians in serious danger. Months of negotiations between Moscow and the Obama administration have failed to cement a long-term cease-fire in Aleppo, which has become the focus of the war between President Bashar Assad and rebels fighting to topple him, some of whom receive U.S. aid. Al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate is fighting alongside the rebels, but the Islamic State group has no presence in Aleppo. In announcing the start of what he called \"a major operation,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said it would target positions of the Islamic State group and al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate in Idlib and Homs provinces. Appearing alongside Putin, Shoigu said Su-33 jets from the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov were involved in the operation, marking the carrier's combat debut in Syria. A Russian navy frigate was also launching long-range Kalibr cruise missiles at militant targets, he said. The Russian strikes were aimed at ammunition depots, training camps and armaments factories, Shoigu said, adding that before launching the attacks, military intelligence had thoroughly identified and selected targets, including factories producing toxic chemical agents. \"It's a well-developed, industrial-scale production,\" he said, adding that the strikes will continue. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau criticized Russia for launching the strikes and failing to facilitate aid deliveries to opposition-held areas of Aleppo. \"We strongly condemn the resumption of airstrikes in Syria by the Russians as well as the Syrian regime,\" she told reporters in Washington. \"We've consistently pushed for the provision of humanitarian aid to these civilians suffering under siege. Instead of joining us constructively to reach that goal, Russia again has backed the Assad regime in their ruthless war against the Syrian people.\" Trudeau also condemned reports of attacks on hospitals and a mobile clinic in Syria, saying Washington believes they are a violation of international law. Hours before the start of the Russian offensive on Tuesday, opposition groups said at least three hospitals in rural parts of Aleppo province controlled by the rebels were knocked out of service following direct airstrikes. Russian Defense Ministry Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov denied any airstrikes on hospitals or any other target in Aleppo, calling the allegations and the \"public rhetoric by the State Department ... blatant lies.\" \"The Russian and Syrian air forces haven't conducted any strikes on Aleppo for 28 days,\" Konashenkov said. Opposition activists said strikes Tuesday on opposition-held areas of Aleppo included helicopter-borne barrel bombs like the ones used by the Syrian government in the past, and targeted multiple neighborhoods throughout the day. \"People are scared. The bombardment is intense,\" activist Baraa al-Halaby, who is based in eastern Aleppo, said via text message. By late afternoon, Ibrahim al-Haj, of the Syrian Civil Defense in Aleppo city, said his group had counted 72 air raids in nine neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo. Initial reports said at least seven people were killed and 32 were wounded in attacks that mostly hit residential areas in the besieged city, he said. Sounds of warplanes flying at low altitude could be heard over the phone as he spoke. A resident of rebel-held eastern Aleppo reported more Syrian ground troops were being deployed on the city's edge, saying he feared a major ground operation was looming. Some 275,000 residents are estimated to be trapped in that part of Aleppo. \"There is real preparation (for an offensive) now,\" Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher, said by telephone. Meanwhile, a reporter for Syrian state TV, speaking from government-held western Aleppo, said Syrian troops were preparing to attack eastern parts of the city from nine directions. Four weeks ago, Russia said it would halt weeks of deadly airstrikes to allow rebels and supporters to leave eastern Aleppo. The rebels refused to take up the offer and the United Nations failed to negotiate the delivery of aid into the besieged area. No aid has entered the area since July, and the U.N. and aid groups have warned of depleting supplies. Besides the reported strikes on hospitals in Aleppo province on Tuesday, the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights said another hospital east of the city of Idlib was hit by an airstrike on Sunday. Since Syria's conflict started in 2011, the group said it has recorded 382 attacks on medical facilities and hospitals throughout Syria. Of those, 293 were carried out by government forces and 16 were by Russian warplanes, it said. \"Over and over again, hospitals and emergency rooms are placed in the crosshairs of a conflict that seems endless and unyielding in its cruelty,\" said Elise Baker, research coordinator for the rights group. \"As long as Syria and Russia continue their scorched earth strategy across the country, there are no safe havens.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Isachenkov reported from Moscow. Associated Press writers Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Fields, who delivered the keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show this morning, spoke about Donald Trump for the first time in public since the businessman was elected to become the next president. On the campaign trail Trump frequently criticized Ford for deciding to move the production of small cars from the U.S. to Mexico, leading to a feud between the candidate and the automaker. Trump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and has talked about imposing a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico. \"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Fields said. In September, Fields appeared on CNN to say no jobs would be lost in the U.S. as it moves production of the Ford Focus and C-Max hybrids to Mexico. ",

He often made extravagant demands in return for agreeing to make a speech, including that the private plane that flew him to the engagement be a certain size . Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for her speeches to Goldman Sachs, as well as for contributions Qatar made to the Clinton Foundation, which he claimed betrayed her commitment to women\u2019s and gay rights because of Qatar\u2019s poor record on both. This week, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Mr. Giuliani\u2019s fitness for the job, pointing to his list of paid speeches, his work for foreign governments and his support for the Iraq war. Mr. Trump has long claimed erroneously that he opposed the war. \u201cIt is worrisome, some of the ties to foreign governments, because that was a big complaint about many of us with Hillary Clinton and her ties and the money she received from foreign governments,\u201d Mr. Paul told CNN on Tuesday. Mr. Giuliani defended his firm\u2019s work for Qatar \u2014 which he said included training the Qatari police and analyzing the security of a desalinization plant \u2014 because, he said, it was done under the previous emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani , who abdicated in 2013. Mr. Giuliani said he had consulted the State Department about the contracts and had been told that Sheikh Khalifa was friendly toward the United States. A list of possibilities for key posts in the new administration. Mr. Giuliani said he was one of dozens of prominent Americans who worked for the Iranian opposition group known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, or the M.E.K. \u2014 drawing payments at the same time it was on a State Department list designating it a terrorist organization. He sought to persuade the State Department to revoke its terrorist listing, which the Americans did in September 2012 . \u201cMy ties to them are very open,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cWe worked very hard to get them delisted \u2014 by Hillary Clinton, by the way.\u201d Another Giuliani client, the energy company TransCanada, applied to build the Keystone XL pipeline in the United States, and was rejected last year by President Obama after a recommendation by Secretary of State John Kerry. If it decided to apply again for permission and Mr. Giuliani ended up at the State Department, the application would land on his desk. Mr. Giuliani did not address that issue directly in the interview, saying only that his firm had offered security advice to TransCanada, when it had a partnership to build a natural-gas facility on Long Island Sound. The proposal was turned down. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI\u2019ve done no work on the pipeline,\u201d he said. His other clients have included a long list of prominent American corporations, including Bear Stearns, Uber and CB Richard Ellis, the real estate giant. Under contract with Purdue Pharma , the maker of the often-abused painkiller OxyContin, Mr. Giuliani used his clout with the Justice Department to press the federal authorities to offer a less onerous punishment to the company after allegations that security problems at its warehouses might have contributed to black market sales. But it is the lesser-known names that may draw the most scrutiny. TriGlobal Strategic Ventures , a company that aims to \u201cassist Western clients in furthering their business interests in the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union,\u201d according to its website, is among the more obscure clients.

    "text": "Police: Wannabe Weatherman Set Fire to Gain Facebook Views As of Monday, Tennessee firefighters were battling 67 individual blazes burning through 15,914 acres, according to TEMA. A Code Orange Air Quality Alert has been put in place for the Chattanooga, Knoxville, Great Smoky Mountains and Tri-Cities areas. In a Code Orange alert, the general public is not likely to be affected by the air quality, but those with heart and lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from the presence of particles in the air. Depending on wind direction and proximity to the wildfires, some areas in Chattanooga may have higher air quality concentrations in the Code Red category, which will have wider health impacts on the general population and cause more serious effects on sensitive groups. Some Tennessee schools have been forced to close. There is so much smoke that firefighters could not reset the smoke alarms because they would just continue to go off, said Dr. James Jones, Director of Schools at Polk County. John Bazemore/AP Photo Firefighters Valarie Lopez, left, and Mark Tabaez work to cool hot spots after a wildfire burned a hillside, Nov. 15, 2016, in Clayton, Georgia. Since Nov. 6, the Tennessee Army National Guard has conducted 476 air-drop missions to fight the wildfires. More than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the country have traveled to the southeast to try and contain the blazes, the U.S. Forest Service told The Associated Press. The fires are extending through seven states -- Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas. An extreme drought is stretching across parts of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina -- with no significant rain in sight. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said Monday that the wildfires have cost at least $10 million in damage in the state. North Carolina is one of the hardest hit states, with at least 15 active fires smothering more than 45,000 acres of forest as of Tuesday morning. Kentucky has been in a \"state of emergency because of these fires for almost two weeks,\" said John Mura, the director of communications for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. As of Monday, the state was managing two dozen fires over 25,000 acres. Police arrested Andrew Scott Lewis on Friday and charged him with setting fires and vandalism that caused more than $250,000 in damage and threatened homes just outside Chattanooga, the AP reported . In Kentucky, a 21-year-old man was arrested in his hometown of Jenkins on Friday after police said he admitted to starting the wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook. Johnny Mullins was charged with second-degree arson and is an aspiring weatherman, according to the AP. A teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky, was also arrested and charged with arson last week. Tennessee State Police Matthew Ryan Wallace, 27, left, and Charles Edward Martin, 50, were both arrested for arson on separate incidents in connection with wildfires in Tennessee. And two more men have been arrested today in connection with the wildfires, Tennessee officials said. At least seven arson arrests have been made in the last 20 days. State agriculture investigators in Tennessee arrested 27-year-old Matthew Ryan Wallace of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and charged him with igniting a wildfire along a Sequatchie County road on Monday. The felony charge is punishable by up to six years in jail and a $3,000 fine. In Tennessee\u2019s Monroe County, deputies arrested 50-year-old Charles Edward Martin for intentionally setting a fire along a road, officials said. The state arson reward fund has increased to $2,500 for tips that lead to an arson arrest and conviction. ABC News' Michael Edison Hayden and J.J. Gallagher contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Dave Roberts becomes the first Dodger to be selected manager of the year since Tommy Lasorda in 1988. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) Bill Shaikin Contact Reporter The interview was over but the camera still focused on Dave Roberts . As he took off his headset, his wife Tricia walked into the picture and planted a big, triumphant, nationally televised kiss on her husband, the newly crowned National League manager of the year. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get some ribbing,\u201d Roberts said with a laugh. He wasn\u2019t sure how much ribbing. He said he had about 200 unchecked text messages. Those were the spoils of victory. On Tuesday, Roberts became the first Dodgers manager to win the award since Tommy Lasorda in 1988, the last year the Dodgers appeared in the World Series . Every other NL West team has had a manager win the award since then. Roberts, who never had managed at any level, made runners-up out of Joe Maddon and Dusty Baker , each a three-time manager of the year. Roberts won with 16 first-place votes. Maddon, who led the Chicago Cubs to the World Series championship, finished second with eight votes. (Voting was conducted before the postseason.) Baker who led the Washington Nationals to the NL East championship, was\u00a0third with four votes. The Miami Marlins\u2019 Don Mattingly , whose divorce from the Dodgers created the vacancy that Roberts filled, finished fifth in the voting. Terry Francona, who led the Cleveland Indians to the World Series, was selected American League manager of the year, with Jeff Banister of the Texas Rangers second and Buck Showalter of the Baltimore Orioles third. Dodgers have become baseball\u2019s ultimate modern franchise.\u00a0They have an oversized front office that is heavily dependent on analytics.

The Dodgers have become baseball\u2019s ultimate modern franchise.\u00a0They have an oversized front office that is heavily dependent on analytics. Many of their starters can\u2019t pitch into the sixth inning. They have replaced everyday players with platoons. Monday offered longtime fans a welcome return of... (Dylan Hernandez) In Roberts\u2019 debut season, the Dodgers got within two victories of the World Series, as close as they have gotten since 1988. \u201cWe came up short in the sense of winning a world championship,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cbut I\u2019m proud of the way our group battled adversity all year.\u201d When Mattingly left, Dodgers minor league director Gabe Kapler was widely considered the favorite to replace him. But, as ownership urged the front office to expand its search to external candidates, Roberts dazzled the Dodgers in interviews and emerged atop a field of nine. None of the three finalists \u2014 Roberts, Kapler and University of Nebraska coach and former Angels outfielder Darin Erstad \u2014 had managed in the major leagues. Roberts neither hid nor objected to the fact that the front office was heavily involved in daily decisions, but he established trust with his players by checking in with every player\u00a0every day. \"I think the players really saw the authenticity in me from day one of spring training ,\u201d he said. With the Dodgers setting a major league record by putting 28 players on the disabled list, and with the front office prone to making a roster move for even the slightest of advantages on any given day, the Dodgers\u2019 media notes listed 206 transactions this year,\u00a0an average of more than one per game. Roberts was left to deal with the human fallout\u00a0virtually on a daily basis. He said he gained the most confidence when he removed pitcher Ross Stripling from a no-hitter in his major league debut,\u00a0with five outs to go,\u00a0and endured 24 hours of scrutiny and second-guessing only to grow more confident in his decision. \u201cFor me to be able to say I would do the same thing over again surprised me, in a good way,\u201d Roberts said. Roberts was challenged by the two-month absence of ace Clayton Kershaw . The Dodgers had fallen eight games behind the front-running San Francisco Giants in the NL West, but Roberts trusted his players rather than call a team meeting to remind them of the obvious stakes. Roberts invested heavily in building a personal relationship with temperamental outfielder Yasiel Puig , but the manager was not shy about calling out Puig when the Dodgers demoted him to the minor leagues in August. Roberts also empowered the veteran leadership of Kershaw, Adrian Gonzalez, Chase Utley and Justin Turner . Turner said he respected Mattingly but said he saw something special in Roberts. \u201cI loved playing for Donnie. I thought he was awesome,\u201d Turner said in August. \u201cHe was just really nonconfrontational. He didn\u2019t enjoy, it seemed like, taking care of things right away. I think some things lingered too long and ended up turning into bigger things and issues. \u201cIn his mind, he wanted the players to take care of it, and police ourselves, which is fine to an extent. We try to do that now. But bigger things don\u2019t happen when Dave takes the initiative. Myself, Adrian, Chase, Kershaw, whoever, we don\u2019t have to worry about ending it. We can just worry about playing, which makes it nice for us.\u201d ",

By Robert Costa November 15 at 11:19 AM Follow @costareports Donald Trump, right, talks with Ben Carson during a break in a Republican presidential debate in September. Despite being rivals in the GOP primaries, Carson has become a close confidant of the president-elect. (Mark J. Terrill/AP) Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to President-elect Donald Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. \u201cThe way I\u2019m leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,\u201d Carson said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. \u201cI want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area.\u201d Carson, who is Trump\u2019s most high-profile African American supporter, has been under consideration for several positions in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, including secretary of health and human services. Carson said he has made his decision clear to Trump in several private conversations in recent days. \u201cI\u2019ve said that if it came to a point where he absolutely needs me, I\u2019d reconsider. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the situation with these positions,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that if some people and the media are going to hate him, then he\u2019s going to need allies on the outside to be there, to be there to move the country forward. I don\u2019t care about a position.\u2019 He added with a chuckle, \u201cHaving me as a federal bureaucrat would be like a fish out of water, quite frankly.\u201d Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump for president in March, but hasn't been a great surrogate in televised appearances since then. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) When asked whether he was formally offered a specific post, Carson said, \u201cI was offered things, there's no question about that. I don't want to go into the details.\u201d Carson said he expects to continue public speaking and media appearances and visiting with Trump, especially when the president-elect travels to Florida, where Carson lives most of the year. \u201cHe's just around the corner from where I am,\u201d Carson said, referring to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Armstrong Williams, Carson\u2019s business manager, said, \u201cTrump is a brother to Dr. Carson and they\u2019ve formed a formidable bond. I\u2019ve never seen Dr. Carson agonize so much over something. But it\u2019s what\u2019s best for everyone.\u201d Williams said that Carson will continue to work with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the transition and to share policy and personnel suggestions. Carson noted that he has a strong working relationship with Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's controversial pick to be chief strategist at the White House. Bannon is \u201ca very smart and wise counselor,\u201d Carson said. \u201cHe's the big-picture person.\u201d Carson\u2019s decision to not accept a Cabinet post was first reported by Circa , a news website.

U.S. Trade Representative A top candidate may be tech leader Peter Thiel. Last month, in a speech at the National Press Club, Thiel said, \"Free trade has not worked out well for all of America. ... We've lost tens of thousands of factories and millions of jobs to foreign trade. The heartland has been devastated.\" Thiel is a billionaire who made his fortune as an entrepreneur, hedge fund manager and venture capitalist. He is best-known as the founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. Another name in the hopper is Dan DiMicco , who joined Nucor Steel as a metallurgist and rose to become the chief executive. In his retirement, he has been serving as a senior trade adviser to Trump. He agrees with Trump that the government should get much tougher on trade enforcement . Commerce Secretary Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross' name comes up often. He made his fortune by restructuring \"distressed\" companies using borrowed money. He may be best-known for his 2002 efforts to roll together several American steel companies into International Steel Group. He cut costs and employees, and then in 2005, sold the business to Mittal Steel, headquartered in The Netherlands. Who Benefits From Donald Trump's Tax Plan? Other names kicking around include Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue; former Missouri Republican Sen. Jim Talent; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; and Lewis Eisenberg, who co-founded the private equity firm Granite Capital International Group and was chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Labor Secretary The name that comes up most often is Victoria Lipnic , a lawyer who has served on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since 2010. She is a Republican who was appointed by President Obama. During President George W. Bush's administration, she served as assistant secretary of labor for employment standards. Trump Won Their Vote. Now They Want Him To Meet Expectations Housing And Urban Development Several names are being floated for this position. Leading candidates include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, an attorney with expertise in real estate law, and former House Rep. Rick Lazio of New York. In the 1990s, Lazio was chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. Another possibility is Pam Patenaude, president of the J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America's Families. During the George W. Bush administration, she served as HUD assistant secretary for community, planning and development. Trump Names Wall Street And Real Estate Titans As Economic Advisers Agencies The federal government has many agencies that can have an enormous impact on the economy, and all will get new appointees.

    "text": "Got it By Lexi Browning and Lindsey Bever November 15 at 8:14 PM Follow @lindseybever A non-profit director in Clay, W.Va., is facing backlash after reportedly posting a Facebook message about first lady Michelle Obama. \"It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels,\" the post reportedly said. (WSAZ NewsChannel 3) CLAY, W.Va. \u2014\u00a0The mayor of this tiny West Virginia town has resigned amid a firestorm over racist comments about Michelle Obama, according to Clay officials. Mayor Beverly Whaling, who had commented approvingly on a Facebook post comparing the first lady to an ape,\u00a0turned in her letter of resignation Tuesday. Joe Coleman, the town recorder, said Whaling\u2019s resignation was effective immediately. The mayor\u2019s resignation came one day after\u00a0the director of a local, government-funded nonprofit was removed from her position over a Facebook post. After Donald Trump\u2019s election as president, Pamela Ramsey Taylor, director of the Clay County Development Corp., took to social media to comment on the upcoming shift from Obama to Melania Trump, writing: \u201cIt will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\u201d NBC affiliate WSAZ \u00a0reported that Whaling, the mayor, then replied, \u201cJust made my day Pam.\u201d The comments were later deleted \u2014 and both women\u2019s Facebook pages were eventually removed, according to local reports \u2014 but images of Taylor\u2019s post and the mayor\u2019s response had already gone viral. Taylor told ABC affiliate WCHS \u00a0that she was put on leave; but a representative of Clay County Development Corp., a nonprofit that receives state and federal money,\u00a0said Monday that the board \u201cremoved\u201d Taylor from her position as director and appointed Leslie McGlothlin to take her place. When asked by The Post how to contact Taylor, the nonprofit representative said he did not know because Taylor no longer worked there. McGlothlin did not respond to a request for comment. Joshua Shamblin, a former Clay council member, said Tuesday that \u201cthe county is sorry that this has been placed upon everyone instead of just the few who made hurtful remarks.\u201d He added that local officials were \u201cshocked\u201d by the incident but were prepared to move forward. Other Clay residents who attended\u00a0a previously scheduled council meeting Tuesday night expressed similar shock. Tina Goode, a town clerk, said \u201cit wasn\u2019t right, what was posted. We\u2019re not like that. They are good women, and I don\u2019t think they meant anything by it. We\u2019re not a racist town.\u201d She added that she thought Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters were responsible for making the post go viral. [ A man in KKK robes waved a Trump flag at a bonfire in Connecticut, police say ] Katie Payne, a 16-year-old African American student said she was surprised by the reaction, because \u201cnormally when people say things like that around here, it\u2019s swept under the rug.\u201d Katie\u2019s grandmother, Doris Neal, said the incident was \u201cdisgusting,\u201d but not the first time something like this has happened. \u201cKatie\u2019s come home several times with complaints of [peers\u2019] racist remarks. One time, when she ran for student body president they teased her about buying watermelons. Katie\u2019s always been distinguished.\u201d Lish Greiner, a native of Parkersburg, W.Va., who now lives in Belfre, Ohio, drove two hours to attend the meeting. \u201cI came tonight to say that I refuse to tolerate any hate and hateful rhetoric. Any person in a position of power should not be able to spread this hateful rhetoric,\u201d she said. The town\u2019s sheriff, Garrett Samples, didn\u2019t think the post was meant to be prejudiced. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a joke, but it was stupid [to post]. I\u2019ve never heard either of them say anything racial before. I know Miss Taylor better.\u201d The mayor\u2019s resignation followed intense criticism, with more than 150,000 people signing an online petition \u00a0calling for the Whaling\u2019s termination. Whaling apologized in a statement sent Monday to The Washington Post, writing:\u00a0\u201cMy comment was not intended to be racist at all. I was referring to my day being\u00a0made for change in the White House!\u00a0I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I\u2019m not of any way racist! \u201cAgain, I would like to apologize for this getting out of hand!\u201d Taylor could not be reached for comment, but WSAZ reported that she issued an apology. She also told WSAZ that the heated public response to her Facebook post had become\u00a0a\u00a0\u201chate crime against me,\u201d explaining that she and her children had received death threats. Taylor said she is planning to file a lawsuit against people who have slandered or libeled her, according to the news station. [ Police officer who drove with Confederate flag at \u2018Love Trumps Hate\u2019 rally resigns ] The station reported that Taylor said she understood why her post may have been interpreted as racist, but that was not her intention. She said she was referring to her own opinion about the first lady\u2019s attractiveness, not about the color of her skin,\u00a0according to the news station. There is a long and ugly history of comparing black people to primates. \u201cIn the 19th century and well into the 20th, popular media from movies to fiction to political cartoons frequently portrayed blacks as more simian than human,\u201d social psychologists Phillip Atiba Goff and Jennifer L. Eberhardt wrote in the Los Angeles Times . \u201cIt was an association that provided cover for slavery itself, as well as anti-black violence. Lynchings in the United States were often justified by relying on this dehumanizing association, and it surfaced in the Rodney King controversy in Los Angeles: LAPD Officer Laurence Powell had referred to a black couple as \u2018something right out of \u201cGorillas in the Mist\u201d \u2018 moments before he was involved in the King beating. \u201cLike nooses, the \u2018N-word\u2019 and white sheets, referring to blacks as apelike is among the most violent and hurtful legacies of our nation\u2019s difficult racial past.\u201d Racist primate memes have surfaced repeatedly around the Obamas. Several years ago, the Awl catalogued them in a piece called \u201cPrimate in Chief: A Guide to Racist Obama Monkey Photoshops.\u201d The town of Clay,\u00a0outside of Charleston,\u00a0has approximately 467 residents, according to a 2015 census estimate. The estimated population of Clay County is\u00a08,910. Two-tenths of 1 percent of Clay County\u2019s residents are African American, according to census data .\u00a0More than\u00a0three-quarters of the presidential votes cast in the county went to Trump. Bever reported from Washington.\u00a0This post has been updated. Read more: ",

Got it President-elect Donald Trump listens as President Obama talks to the media in the Oval Office of the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller November 15 at 6:14 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump, who clashed with leading Republicans throughout his campaign, faced growing tumult in his national security transition team on Monday as key members of his own party appeared to question his views and personnel choices. Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), a respected voice on national security thought to be a leading candidate to run the CIA, was among those pushed out of the team over the past two days, two individuals with direct knowledge said, in a series of moves that have added to the anxiety across the upper ranks of U.S. intelligence agencies. The changes came as Trump met Tuesday with incoming Vice President Mike Pence to discuss Cabinet and top White House personnel choices. Pence last week replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) as head of Trump\u2019s overall transition efforts, and Christie\u2019s associates \u2014 who had been Trump\u2019s link to the GOP mainstream for months \u2014 now find themselves losing influence. [ It\u2019s not just the Cabinet: Trump\u2019s transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees ] A number of Christie allies have been told they were no longer in line for top posts, according to several people familiar with the transition, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Paul Farhi discuss the appointments by President-elect Donald Trump of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus as chief of staff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Also on Tuesday, perhaps the most influential Republican on national security matters, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), weighed in on Trump\u2019s efforts to work with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, saying any efforts to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia are unacceptable. McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman who had a difficult relationship with Trump during the campaign, issued a statement blasting Putin as \u201ca former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America\u2019s allies and attempted to undermine America\u2019s elections.\u2019\u2019 A former U.S. official with ties to the Trump team described the ousters of Rogers and others as a \u201cbloodletting of anybody that associated in any way on the transition with Christie,\u201d and said that the departures were engineered by two Trump loyalists who have taken control of who will get national security posts in the administration: retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Rogers had no prior significant ties to Christie but had been recruited to join the Trump team as an adviser by the New Jersey governor. At least three other Christie associates were also pushed aside, former officials said, apparently in retaliation for Christie\u2019s role as a U.S. prosecutor in sending Kushner\u2019s father to prison. Rogers\u2019 departure adds to the list of positions for which the Trump team is struggling to find suitable candidates, and came as Eliot Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump among former GOP national security officials during the campaign, blasted Trump\u2019s transition team for its treatment of perceived foes. Now operating below Pence on the transition team, the people said, are advisers who are close to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) \u2014 himself a top Trump associate known for his hardline views on immigration \u2014 and former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon. Bannon\u2019s recent appointment as chief White House strategist was denounced by advocacy groups and Democrats, who accuse him of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynist views. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday, in his first speech on the Senate floor speech since Trump\u2019s victory, that the president-elect should retract Bannon\u2019s appointment, calling the latter a \u201cchampion of white supremacy\u201d whose hiring undermines Trump\u2019s call for national unity following the election. 1 of 22 What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington View Photos Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders. Caption Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders. Nov. 10, 2016\u00a0 President Obama talks with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cBy placing a champion of white supremacy a step away from the Oval Office, what message does Trump send?\u201d Reid said. \u201cI say to Donald Trump, take responsibility. Rise to the dignity of the office of the president of the United States instead of hiding behind your Twitter account. ... Show America that racism, bullying and bigotry have no place in your White House.\u201d Inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, where the president-elect is planning his government, the shift is seen as a clear signal that Trump will govern more in line with the populist, hardline campaign he ran, the people said. In another surprising development on Tuesday, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. \u201cThe way I\u2019m leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,\u201d Carson said in an interview. \u201cI want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area.\u201d Carson, who is Trump\u2019s most high-profile African American supporter, has been under consideration for several positions in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, including secretary of health and human services. Adding to the uncertainty, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared to take himself out of the running for attorney general. Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney and a top Trump adviser, had been considered a leading candidate for the prestigious post. \u201cI won\u2019t be attorney general,\u201d Giuliani said Monday at a Wall Street Journal event. Cohen, meanwhile, drew widespread attention for his tweet. \u201cAfter exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They\u2019re angry, arrogant, screaming \u201cyou LOST!\u201d Will be ugly,\u2019\u2019 tweeted Cohen, who served from 2007 to 2009 as counselor to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He was a driving force behind an open letter last spring \u2014 eventually signed by 122 Republican national security leaders \u2014 who opposed Trump\u2019s candidacy. Cohen, who last week had urged career officials to serve in Trump\u2019s administration, said in an interview that a longtime friend and senior transition team official had asked him to submit names of possible national security appointees. After he suggested several people, Cohen said, his friend emailed him back in terms he described as \u201cvery weird, very disturbing.\u201d \u201cIt was accusations that \u2018you guys are trying to insinuate yourselves into the administration\u2026all of YOU LOST.\u2019\u2026it became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls,\u201d said Cohen, who would not identify his friend. Cohen also said the transition official was \u201ccompletely dismissive\u201d of concerns raised about Trump\u2019s appointment of Bannon, who Trump\u2019s advisors have strongly defended. His friend\u2019s email conveyed the feeling that \u2018we\u2019re so glad to see the bicoastal elites get theirs,\u2019\u201d added Cohen, who described the response as \u201cunhinged.\u2019\u2019 Trump transition officials had no immediate comment Tuesday, but Jason Miller, a senior transition communication adviser, told reporters Monday night that Trump and Pence know the urgency of filling key positions. \u201cObviously, inauguration day is not getting further away. And people need to get going. This is an absolute top priority understood by the president-elect and the vice president-elect,\u201d Miller said. Some political observers were also stunned to hear that Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, an adviser to Trump, was being considered as a candidate for agriculture secretary in the new administration. Miller was widely criticized for recently calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cc\u2013t\u201d on Twitter. He later placed blame for the tweet on a \u201cthird-party vendor\u201d who he said would be removed from his campaign staff. As for the president-elect, Trump jumped back on Twitter on Tuesday morning to argue about his expected loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Trump was known for his incendiary tweets during the campaign, but has tweeted only sporadically since his victory. \u201cIf the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y., Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily,\u201d Trump wrote at his personal account, @realDonaldTrump. Six minutes later, Trump changed his tone and defended the electoral college, where his victory was secured. The system is \u201cactually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!\u201d he wrote. Amid the widespread uncertainty, coordination between Trump\u2019s transition team and the Obama White House is now on hold until Trump\u2019s team signs a key document, the Associated Press reported. The document, a memorandum of understanding smoothing interaction between the two teams, has yet to be signed by Pence, who recently replaced Christie as head of Trump\u2019s transition planning. White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the Obama administration is working with Trump advisers to get the document signed. Some of Trump\u2019s biggest campaign fundraisers and super PAC donors were rewarded Tuesday with seats on his presidential inaugural committee, which will be headed by investor Thomas Barrack Jr., a Trump business associate who hosted the candidate\u2019s first fundraiser in May. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam \u2013 who together gave at least $11.2 million to his campaign and allied super PACs, making them Trump\u2019s biggest donors -- were named as finance vice-chairs. Other major financial backers on the committee include New York financier Lew Eisenberg, who headed the Republican National Committee\u2019s joint fundraising effort with the campaign; Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks, who gave at least $1.9 million to support Trump; and Laurie J. Perlmutter, the wife of Marvel Entertainment chief executive Isaac Perlmutter, who gave $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC days before the election. Other major campaign fundraisers were also give slots, including New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Dallas executive Roy Bailey, Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard, New York financier Anthony Scaramucci, Florida developer Mel Sembler, Dallas investor Ray Washburne and former RNC finance chairman Ron Weiser. Casino mogul Steve Wynn, who declined to say during the campaign which candidate he was backing, also secured a spot. The cascading developments followed a telephone call Monday between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they agreed that relations between their countries were \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement. Moscow said the two men discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about \u201ca settlement for the crisis in Syria\u201d and agreed that their aides would begin working on a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump\u2019s office later said that Putin had called to \u201coffer his congratulations\u201d and that they had discussed shared threats and challenges, \u201cstrategic economic issues\u201d and the long-term relationship between the two nations. The president-elect spoke admiringly of Putin during the campaign, praising him as a stronger leader than President Obama and saying the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria. Those views put Trump at odds with many GOP defense hawks, who are uniformly suspicious of Moscow and have denounced Russian actions in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Syria. The offer of cooperation could also immerse Trump in a deep controversy with the Pentagon, where military and civilian leaders have strongly opposed collaboration with Russia, particularly in Syria. Protests, meanwhile, continued for a sixth straight day in major cities and on college campuses over last week\u2019s election results, in which Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Tsering Topgyal/AP The dating app Tinder has made a change that it hopes will make the experience more inclusive for transgender and gender non-conforming people. Previously, users had to identify either as a man or a woman. Now, the company says people can now select a gender description from a much wider array of options. They can also choose for their profile to appear in search categories that best match their identity. \"Starting today, no matter how you identify, you can express your authentic self on Tinder,\" the company says in a blog post . \"We haven't had the right tools to serve our diverse community in the past, but that changes today.\" To Catch Someone On Tinder, Stretch Your Arms Wide \"This was done in part as a response to difficulties transgender people had with the app,\" as NPR's Andrew Limbong tells our Newscast unit. He adds that \"Tinder is pretty up front about how it messed up by only including two genders in the first place.\" In its promotional materials for the update, the company features transgender users saying that other users would unfairly report them. It's been a long-standing problem. As The Advocate explained, \"There is no system in place to prevent someone from being 'wrongfully banned,' which results in an environment where trans people can, and reportedly are, being repeatedly banned,\" the magazine added. Tinder is now asking people who were wrongfully removed from the app because they were reported to get in touch so that they can be reviewed and reinstated.

    "text": "Email HONOLULU -- A new report says cities nationwide are enacting more policies that criminalize homelessness. The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty said Tuesday many cities have banned living in vehicles, camping in public areas and panhandling. The center says policies that criminalize homelessness harm communities because they create barriers to employment, housing and education. Honolulu is among a handful of cities named in the report\u2019s \u201chall of shame\u201d for what the authors call bad policies. The report says Honolulu issued more than 16,000 warnings to people violating its sit-lie ban since it was enacted in Waikiki in 2014. Honolulu officials say the ban is necessary so people can safely use public sidewalks and because tourists and residents complained. Denver, Dallas and Puyallup, Washington, also were criticized for criminalizing policies. In Portland, Oregon, in August, the mayor announced the end of pilot program that allowed homeless people to sleep on the streets undisturbed by law enforcement, saying it created confusion because some believed it legalized public camping, but defended his overall approach. \u201cThe \u2018safe sleep\u2019 policy was well intended, but it created a lot of confusion and maybe some accidental or deliberate misunderstandings,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt was never intended to legalize (street) camping.\u201d The mayor\u2019s office told CBS affiliate KOIN at the time it would work with experts on other ways to help those homeless people. The mayor said he realized it\u2019s unrealistic to get every homeless person off the street, so enforcement would be compassionate. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Oklahoma City police officers gather information from vehicles leaving Will Rogers World Airport, Tuesday, Nov. 15 2016, in Oklahoma City. (Photo: Steve Gooch, AP) Authorities temporarily shut down Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport after a fatal shooting of an airline employee Tuesday afternoon. The gunman was later found dead. The Oklahoma City Police Department sent out an initial Twitter message saying one victim, Michael Winchester, 52, was shot at the airport at 2:12 p.m. ET. Two hours later, police confirmed that Winchester, a former punter for the University of Oklahoma Sooners football team from 1984 to 1986, had died. Southwest Airlines confirmed that Winchester was an airline employee. He is also the father of an NFL football player, James Winchester, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. \u201cIt is with great sorrow that Southwest Airlines confirms that a Southwest Employee who was injured during a shooting incident today at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City has died from injuries. We continue to work with the local authorities investigating this incident. As a result of the police investigation, local flight operations have been halted,\" the statement said. \"The Southwest Airlines Family is deeply saddened by the passing of our Southwest Family Member, and we extend our heartfelt sympathies and support to his family and Southwest Co-workers at this time.\u201d Police said the suspect in the shooting was later found dead in a pickup truck in an airport parking garage.\u00a0Police Capt. Paco Balderrama says the suspect, who has not been positively identified, appears to have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Balderrama said police believe the shooting was a premeditated attack. The airport handles between 7,000 and 8,000 passengers daily for Alaska, Delta, Southwest and United airlines. The airport is also a major transfer center for federal inmates, but its terminal is in a separate building. A jet carrying inmates to the transfer site was allowed to land while the rest of the airport was shuttered. \"There are going to be some delays for flights until we have further information,\" Will Rogers Airport spokeswoman Karen Carney told AP. She said she thinks that the shooting is an isolated incident. Joe Castiglione, director of athletics for the University of Oklahoma, tweeted, \"Our hearts are truly heavy for the entire Winchester Family. Mike was a former Sooner student athlete as was his son James/daughter Carolyn.\" Video from a television station helicopter showed what appeared to be a pool of blood near the bottom of a ramp leading from the airport's departure area. Two ambulances and a firetruck stood by. Streets around the airport were\u00a0closed to traffic and citizens were warned to stay clear, according to local media reports. Flights at the airport were\u00a0suspended \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d the airport said via Twitter at 2:42 p.m. ET. All arrivals/departures suspended until further notice. @OKCPD continues to investigate. 495 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fWwSrn ",

    "text": "Nov 15 2016, 6:11 pm ET Keeping Trump Tower Safe Will Be an 'Unprecedented Challenge' by Cynthia McFadden, Anna R. Schecter and Tracy Connor Share advertisement Trump Tower has long been a magnet for millionaires, a mecca for tourists, and a monument to one man's need to put his name on everything. Now that its owner-occupant has been elected president, the 58-story glass tower smack-dab in the heart of Manhattan is something new: a headache for the Secret Service and the NYPD. And with Donald Trump reportedly thinking about commuting between his Fifth Avenue penthouse and the White House, it could turn into a full-blown migraine. \"It's an unprecedented challenge,\" said William Bratton, who was New York City's police commissioner until two months ago. \"You are in one of the busiest cities in the world, on one of the busiest streets in the world, and one of the most well-known buildings in the world.\" People are screened by security before Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrives at Trump Tower in New York for meetings with President-elect Donald Trump November 15, 2016. TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP - Getty Images Jonathan Wackrow, who was a Secret Service agent on three presidential details, said he has no doubt the agency and the NYPD can meet the challenge. \"Trump Tower will be secure. Period. That's not even a question,\" he said. \"The bigger issue here is the impact that those security measures will have on the people of New York.\" Other presidents have used retreats \u2014 the compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, or the ranch in Crawford, Texas, for the Bushes \u2014 but they were in easily protected locations. Trump Tower, on the other hand, has hundreds of tenants in 263 apartments, according to its website. That's on top of 26 floors of offices and a five-story public atrium with stores ranging from Starbucks to Gucci. Trump has not left the building since Thursday, and SWAT teams, barricades and sand-filled trucks are already fixtures \u2014 along with protesters. The sky above it is a no-fly zone until the inauguration at least. \"It's like living in the White House,\" said resident Rachel Adjmi Kaimowitz, who voted for Trump but isn't thrilled about all the new security in her building. \"It's distracting, it's nerve-wracking, it's a big problem.\" Law enforcement agencies are meeting this week to discuss plans for securing the skyscraper going forward. Possible scenarios include closing lanes on Fifth Avenue, home to Tiffany's and other world-famous retailers, NBC New York reported . A woman under an umbrella pulls her suitcase on Fifth Avenue by police barricades outside the Trump Tower building in New York, Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016. Richard Drew / AP New Yorkers can also expect to see restrictions on the side streets, bomb-sniffing dogs on the sidewalks and security booths popping up around the building, Bratton said. When there are large demonstrations, a section of Fifth Avenue may be shut down altogether, he said. All of it takes money, but how much is unclear. A senior NYPD official said the costs will be \"very significant.\" and another source estimated the price tag will be tens of millions of dollars. In a statement, the Secret Service said it has a long relationship with the NYPD \"involving large-scale complex security operations.\" \"We will continue to apply creative problem solving with our partners to achieve the highest level of security with the least amount of public impact,\" the agency said. Kaimowitz is already thinking of getting far away from Trump and his tower. \"Every time you have guests that come in you have to have them check in at a certain area and there's Secret Service all over,\" she said. \"I'm renting now and I'm considering not renting when my lease runs out. I think the people who own apartments are probably anxious to sell but they're not going to find anybody.\" But Frederic Bouin, 57, who has been living in the tower since 1990, has no complaints about the security lockdown. \"It's great,\" he said. \"It's the most secure building in the world.\" Cynthia McFadden ",

    "text": "Nov 15 2016, 1:15 pm ET Facebook, Google Crack Down on Fake News Advertising by Alyssa Newcomb advertisement Facebook and Google want to cut off fake news websites where it hurts: the pocketbook. Both tech giants are taking aim at display advertisements, one of the big ways fake news websites can make money. Fake news has been at the center of a national discussion over the past week, with some accusing Facebook of swaying voters by allowing misinformation on its widely read News Feed, such as the viral post that incorrectly stated the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump. Another post claimed actor Denzel Washington \"backs Trump in the most epic way possible.\" People are silhouetted in front of a screen projected with a Facebook logo. DADO RUVIC / Reuters Many Americans \u2014 62 percent to be exact \u2014 get some news from social media, according to the Pew Research Center. Of that group, 18 percent say they do so \"often.\" But Zuckerberg said the amount of fake news on Facebook is minuscule \u2014 though it's not always easy to separate fact from fiction. Some websites post incendiary headlines and have internet addresses that, at first glance, may trick readers into thinking they're reading a story from a legitimate news outlet. \"Fake news has become more predominant because the barriers to creating a website and articles are much lower,\" Thales Teixeira, a professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in the \"economics of attention,\" told NBC News. A fake news story posted by \"American News\" on Facebook suggests that Denzel Washington is supporting Donald Trump. via Facebook Some register a domain name similar to a legitimate news outlet but add a different suffix, hoping readers won't notice and will think it's a reputable news source. \"What has happened with Facebook is they have reduced the exposure of the brand, who wrote the article,\" Teixeira said. \"An article is one in a million. Giving back a little prominence [to major news outlets] is one way to reduce this issue.\" Although Facebook has always had a policy banning misleading advertisements, the social network made it clearer this week by specifically stating that fake news sites don't meet its criteria for publishers. Related: It Won't Be Easy To Fix Facebook's Fake News Problem \"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook representative told NBC News. \"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\" While Facebook has felt the most heat for the fake news issue, Google is also working on a policy update to ensure its advertising network doesn't serve ads on fake news sites. \"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" a Google representative told NBC News. Facebook Under Fire Mark Zuckerberg has publicly addressed the fake news issue and its possible influence on the election twice over the past week. In a Facebook post on Sunday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated that although News Feed isn't perfect, it would be \"pretty crazy\" to say it swayed the election. Related: What Does Zuckerberg Say About Claims Facebook Influenced the Election? With less than 1 percent of stories being deemed \"hoaxes,\" and only a portion of those political, Zuckerberg said it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\" \"We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further,\" Zuckerberg wrote. News Feed relies on various signals, including user feedback, to determine which posts may contain inaccurate information and to then reduce their distribution. While it's unclear what concrete steps Facebook plans to take in addition to this, Zuckerberg said they'll have to walk a delicate path moving forward to ensure they're not stifling differences of opinion. \"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,\" he wrote.

James Dale Ritchie in a driver's license photo. Anchorage Police Department \"The gun was unloaded on this officer,\" Police Chief Chris Tolley said at a briefing late Tuesday morning. Salao and Sgt. Marc Patzke returned fire, and Ritchie died at the scene, said Tolley, who described both officers as heroes. Salao remained hospitalized Tuesday after two emergency operations, said police, who would say only that he was out of intensive care and was \"recovering.\" Ballistics tests later showed that Ritchie's gun, a Colt Python .357 revolver, was also used in two double homicides and in a fifth killing in Anchorage this year, Tolley said. The bodies of the four victims of the double homicides were all found along bike trails, while the fifth victim's bicycle was stolen by his killer, police said. \"It is just heartbreaking,\" Tolley said.

Because of the heroic actions of these Anchorage police officers, they have made sure that this individual will not hurt any one of you or any one of the citizens in Anchorage.\" Authorities have remained mum on speculation about a possible serial killer, but in August, they issued an unusual advisory warning residents to steer clear of \"isolated areas like our parks, bike trails or unoccupied streets\" after dark. More than 100 residents met with Tolley and Mayor Ethan Berkowitz in late September about the killings, NBC station KTUU reported. \"Are we actually safe?\" one attendee asked, according to the station, adding: \"It doesn't feel safe.\" Alex Johnson ",

    "text": "Google, Facebook Move to Block Fake News From Ad Services By Paul Blake Nov 15, 2016, 3:58 PM ET 0 Shares Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images WATCH Google, Facebook Work on Measures to Ban Fake News 0 Shares Email Facebook and Google made clear on Monday that they will not broker advertisements for inclusion on websites and mobile apps that the internet giants have determined display fake or misleading news after some have raised questions about whether either company may have played a role in the presidential election. Both Facebook and Google, however, stopped short of agreeing to prevent the spread or appearance of such content in users\u2019 newsfeeds or in search results on their own platforms. The announcements come after months of widespread concern over the rapid increase of fake, wrong or misleading news articles on the internet. Facebook and Google generate money primarily through advertising shown on their own websites and pages. But they also broker and manage advertisements for display on third-party websites and applications. Revenues generated through this arrangement are split between the tech companies and the owners of the websites or applications. Now, Facebook and Google are clamping down on which third-party sites and apps they will allow to be part of this business model. Facebook says the move to call out fake news sites was done to clarify its previous policy. Facebook said in a statement: \u201cWe do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.\u201d \u201cWhile implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,\u201d the company added. \u201cOur team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\u201d Google said it would now \"restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.\" \u201cWe've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,\u201d Google said in a statement. In an interview with the BBC that was released on Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about fake news showing up in Google search results. He told the British broadcaster that his company was undergoing \u201ca learning moment\u201d and that it will \u201cdefinitely work to fix it.\u201d He acknowledged that fake news could have affected some people\u2019s votes and possibly the election outcome in some areas, noting the narrow margins by which candidates won in certain places. As the dissemination and consumption of news have shifted increasingly to online platforms where the costs and barriers to entry are lower, it has allowed websites that offer fake or misleading news to proliferate, causing consternation among those in politics and the media. On Monday, BuzzFeed reported that a \u201crenegade\u201d group of Facebook employees had \u201cformed an unofficial task force to question the role their company played in promoting fake news in the lead-up to Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US election last week.\u201d Defending his company, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Saturday that \u201cof all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\u201d \u201cOverall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,\u201d he added. \u201cIdentifying the \u2018truth\u2019 is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\u201d The tech CEO said that the company had to be careful about injecting itself into the filtering of content. \u201cAn even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Rudy Giuliani Emerges as Contender for Secretary of State By JUSTIN FISHEL Nov 15, 2016, 4:54 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Rudy Giuliani: In a Minute 0 Shares Email Former New York City mayor and fierce Donald Trump campaign surrogate Rudy Giuliani has emerged as a contender for secretary of state, a Trump transition team insider told ABC News. While he has also been under consideration for attorney general, aides told ABC News that he has said he would prefer a position as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Giuliani has spent most of his career in domestic politics and would be considered an outsider among the foreign service officers who walk the halls of the State Department. But Giuliani\u2019s experience as the mayor of New York City during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and his subsequent foray into security politics falls right in line with Trump\u2019s most urgent foreign agenda item: combating Islamic extremism and ISIS. \u201cISIS, short-term, I believe, is the greatest danger,\u201d Giuliani said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday. \u201cAnd not because ISIS is in Iraq and in Syria but because ISIS did something al-Qaeda never did \u2014 ISIS was able to spread itself around the world.\u201d Defeating ISIS might seem like a job for the Department of Defense, but the top diplomat plays a role in building alliances to defeat terrorist organizations. Secretary of State John Kerry has spent much of the past year meeting with leaders of the many foreign countries with interests in Syria and Iraq, including Arab League nations, European Union members, Russia, Turkey and Iran. Many of those countries have conflicting agendas. Trump has not revealed his strategy for defeating ISIS on the battlefield, insisting that he doesn\u2019t want to tip off the enemy. However, he has said he would be inclined to let Russia and its ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad lead the fight against ISIS in Syria. That would be a stark contrast from Barack Obama\u2019s policy. Giuliani also told The Wall Street Journal that while he would be willing to reset relations with Russia and China, a projection of U.S. military force has been missing from the relationship. \u201cRussia thinks it\u2019s a military competitor. It really isn\u2019t,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt\u2019s our unwillingness under Obama to even threaten the use of our military that makes Russia so powerful.\u201d A failed attempt to restart relations with Russia worsened with its annexation of Crimea and Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria, which often targeted U.S.-backed rebel forces. Trump seems willing to abandon those opposition forces, saying no one really knows who they are. 5 Major Foreign Policy Challenges Facing President-Elect Donald Trump Giuliani also said Trump could undo the Iran nuclear deal, Kerry\u2019s signature policy achievement. The next president \u201ccan disavow it, as a matter of law, like that,\u201d Giuliani said, snapping his fingers. In reality, walking away from the deal or renegotiating it with the six nations that signed it would be complicated and time consuming. It is, however, entirely possible to undermine the deal and get Iran to walk away from it, setting up a recipe for a military standoff should Iran continue to pursue a nuclear weapon. Unqualified? Not surprisingly, anti-Trump forces are already saying Giuliani is unfit to serve as secretary of state. Correct the Record, a political action committee that supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, says that Giuliani \u201chas little foreign policy knowledge and almost zero formal diplomatic experience\u201d and that \u201cinstead of fighting for American interests, he\u2019s spent the past 15 years making money off deadly dictators and sworn enemies of this country.\u201d The website questions some of Giuliani\u2019s business dealings with the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, an anti-Iranian group that was formerly designated a terrorist organization with a complex background and strong lobbying arm in Washington, an oil company owned by Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, a Serbian nationalist party and other organizations . Early Career Rudolph William Louis Giuliani (born May 28, 1944, in New York City) graduated from Manhattan College in the Bronx in 1965 before graduating magna cum laude from New York University Law School in 1968. He stayed in New York to do a clerkship for Judge Lloyd MacMahon, a U.S. district court judge for the Southern District of New York before moving to Washington, D.C., to work for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Giuliani would bounce between New York and D.C. several times \u2014 to New York for four years at a private practice, then back to D.C. to launch a political career. In 1981, Giuliani served as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s associate attorney general. Two years later, he was appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he did his clerkship. For six years, Giuliani earned a reputation as a tough U.S. attorney fighting drugs, violence and organized crime in the city. He prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including that of Wall Street trader Ivan Boesky, and indicted 11 heads of organized crime in the Mafia commission trial. David McNew/Getty Images Republican presidential nomination hopeful, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, talks to the reporters as he campaigns, July 24, 2007, in Riverside, California. Mayor of New York Despite a failed run for New York mayor in 1989, Giuliani ran again as the Republican candidate in 1993 and won. He went on to serve two terms and cement his place in the city\u2019s history. Giuliani worked to reform the New York City welfare system by requiring able-bodied people to work or perform community service to receive payments. The welfare-to-work initiative caused welfare rolls to drop more than 50 percent during his eight years in office. With his appointee Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, Giuliani aggressively tackled the city\u2019s crime problem. By the time Giuliani left office, the violent crime rate had fallen 56 percent, according to PolitiFact. Robberies plummeted by 67 percent. Murders fell by nearly two-thirds. Some critics point to data from the U.S. Justice Department that show New York City crime rates began to drop in the years before his mayoralty, saying the declines were part of a broader trend also seen in Chicago, San Diego, Miami and other cities. Others have criticized the tactics used to achieve those results \u2014 tactics like stop and frisk, which raised concerns about racial profiling but which Giuliani continued to defend as recently as this September. But Giuliani is best known for his leadership in the aftermath of the attacks against the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11. He was on the scene minutes after the second plane hit, and he coordinated rescue operations. \u201cTomorrow, New York is going to be here, and we are going to rebuild, and we are going to be stronger than we were before,\u201d he said in a late-night news conference on the day the towers fell. His approval rating grew dramatically after the attacks as he worked to restore American confidence, and he became known affectionately by his supporters as America\u2019s mayor. But some New York City firefighters and Sept. 11 family members later said they believed Giuliani capitalized on the attacks for political gain. Giuliani was named Time magazine\u2019s 2001 person of the year, with an article titled \u201cMayor of the World.\u201d Robert F. Bukakty/AFP/Getty Images PHOTO:New York Governor George Pataki, left, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, center, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, tour the site of the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 12, 2001 in New York. Personal Life In 2000, Giuliani ran against Hillary Clinton for the U.S. Senate while still serving as mayor. A diagnosis of prostate cancer caused him to withdraw from the race. At the time, his personal life was thrust into the spotlight when his extramarital affair with Judith Nathan became public. Weeks after he learned of his cancer diagnosis, Giuliani announced he was separating from his second wife, Donna Hanover, with whom he had two children. His first wife, Regina Peruggi, whom he married in 1968, was his second cousin. Giuliani married Nathan in 2003. 0 Shares ",
