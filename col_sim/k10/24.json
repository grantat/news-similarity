President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrive at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse, Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016 in Bedminster, N.J.. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) Greg Miller, Adam EntousThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump has received two classified intelligence briefings since his surprise election victory earlier this month, a frequency that is notably lower - at least so far - than that of his predecessors, current and former U.S. officials said. A team of intelligence analysts has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won. Vice President-elect Mike Pence , by contrast, has set aside time for intelligence briefings almost every day since the election, officials said. Officials involved in the Trump transition team cautioned against assigning any significance to the briefing schedule that the president-elect has set so far, noting that he has been immersed in the work of forming his administration, and has made filling key national security posts his top priority. But others have interpreted Trump's limited engagement with his briefing team as an additional sign of indifference from a president-elect who has no meaningful experience on national security issues and was dismissive of U.S. intelligence agencies' capabilities and findings during the campaign. A senior U.S. official who receives the same briefing delivered to President Barack Obama each day said that devoting time to such sessions would help Trump get up to speed on world events. \"Trump has a lot of catching up to do,\" the official said. Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a senior member of Trump's transition team, dismissed the issue, saying that Trump has devoted significant attention to security matters even while meeting with world leaders and assembling his administration. \"National security is Donald Trump's No. 1 priority and I think he's taking it very seriously,\" Nunes said in an interview. \"Look how many leaders he's met with, how many phone calls he's done, positions he's filled. People who are being critical need to get a life.\" Trump was given an initial briefing within days of his election victory, and took part in a second session with senior U.S. intelligence analysts Tuesday in New York before he departed to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. Trump turned other briefing opportunities away. Donald Trump 's repeated refusal to accept the judgment of intelligence professionals that Russia stole files from the Democratic National Committee computers in an effort to influence the U.S. election. ... Former senior U.S. national security officials are dismayed at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump 's repeated refusal to accept the judgment of intelligence professionals that Russia stole files from the Democratic National Committee computers in an effort to influence the U.S. election. ... (Dana Priest, Tom Hamburger) A spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, the office that oversees the production of the daily presidential brief, declined to comment. Spokesmen for the Trump transition did not respond to requests for comment. The President's Daily Brief, as the classified document is known, is designed to provide a summary of key security developments and insights from all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as an update on covert programs being run overseas by the CIA. It is typically delivered each morning by intelligence analysts selected because of their experience and expertise for the prestigious job. The contents are among the most closely guarded secrets in Washington, but it is likely that recent versions of the brief covered developments including the resumption of Russia's bombing campaign in Syria and the disruption of an alleged Islamic State terrorism plot in France. The briefings have for decades been made available well before Inauguration Day to newly elected presidents as a way of deepening their understanding of foreign developments. Spy agencies are also eager to cultivate a relationship with the executive who will serve as their most important customer and set their priorities for the next four years. Former intelligence officials and experts said that presidents-elect have adopted varied approaches to how and when the daily brief is delivered, but that Trump is getting fewer than most at this stage. Tribune news services Donald Trump has received his first classified intelligence briefing, meeting with national security officials for more than two hours on Wednesday. The celebrity businessman became entitled to the briefings once he officially became the Republican nominee for president. The briefing was delivered... Donald Trump has received his first classified intelligence briefing, meeting with national security officials for more than two hours on Wednesday. The celebrity businessman became entitled to the briefings once he officially became the Republican nominee for president. The briefing was delivered... (Tribune news services) \"His pace is not as frequent as most recent presidents-elect, but it is not unprecedented over the decades-long scope of these briefings,\" said David Priess, a former CIA officer and PDB briefer during the George W. Bush administration. After his election in 2008, President Obama took part not only in regular intelligence briefings but also scheduled \"deep dives\" on key subjects including Iran's nuclear program and covert CIA operations, including the accelerating campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan. \"During the transition, President Obama was an avid consumer of intelligence,\" said retired Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, who was CIA director when Obama was elected. President George W. Bush's first briefing was delayed until Dec. 5 because of the Florida election recount. But Bush, whose father had served as CIA director, asked for daily briefings for the remainder of the transition. President Bill Clinton got his first post-race briefing on Nov. 13, 1992 - 10 days after the election. He received daily intelligence briefings almost every working day of the rest of the transition time in Little Rock \"The last three presidents-elect used the intelligence briefings offered during the transition to literally study the national security issues that they would be facing and the world leaders with whom they would be interacting as president,\" said Michael Morell, former deputy CIA director, who supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the campaign. \"The president-elect is missing out on a golden opportunity to learn about the national security threats and challenges facing our nation,\" Morell said, \"knowledge that would be extremely valuable to have when he takes the oath of office and when he steps into the Situation Room for the first time.\" Richard Nixon was the first president-elect to be offered the PDB after his win in 1968, but he is regarded by many as among the newly elected commanders in chief most hostile toward the CIA, routinely spurning agency analysts. Priess, author of \"The President's Book of Secrets,\" said Nixon refused to sit down with CIA briefers during the transition. To try to get the document to Nixon, intelligence officials resorted to dropping sealed copies of the PDB each morning with Nixon's secretary. After Nixon's inauguration, his aides returned the briefing books still in their unopened envelopes, Priess said. Nixon, however, met several times during the transition with then-CIA Director Richard Helms, and had significant background in global affairs and U.S. intelligence capabilities, having served eight years as vice president to Dwight D. Eisenhower. Trump has yet to meet with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper or other top intelligence officials - aside from an unofficial meeting with embattled Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, who is rumored to be a top candidate to replace Clapper. Trump has greeted a parade of other officials auditioning for Cabinet positions, but also met with Indian business partners, television news anchors and figures in the entertainment industry. ",

    "text": "Nell Greenfieldboyce The good news for those worried that the U.S. will lose its leadership role in confronting climate change: President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday , \"I have an open mind to it. ... I do have an open mind.\" At a meeting Tuesday with New York Times journalists and executives, Trump said he thinks \"there is some connectivity\" in terms of human activity causing climate change. However, he went on to say that \"it depends on how much\" connectivity. \"It also depends on how much it's going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now.\" Then he noted that he also finds the climate issue interesting because \"there are few things where there's more division than climate change.\" Climate researchers would not agree, at least when it comes to the science. Despite what contrarians maintain, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is warming the planet, with potentially devastating effects to the environment. And the United Nations did just manage to hammer out the landmark Paris climate change agreement, which went into force earlier this month. Now the future of that accord is in doubt. During the campaign, Trump promised to dismantle the Paris Agreement; he told the Times on Tuesday that \"I'm going to take a look at it.\" On climate change, Trump says he is also thinking about \"how much it will cost our companies\u201d & the effect on American competitiveness. \u2014 Mike Grynbaum (@grynbaum) November 22, 2016 It seems unlikely that Trump \u2014 who has called global warming a hoax perpetrated by China \u2014 has dramatically changed his views on climate change. Consider that on the same day he was informing the Times that he's open-minded, Trump formally announced that Myron Ebell would lead his transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency. Article continues after sponsorship That's a telling pick for those who've been watching debates over climate and energy. Ebell was one of seven people whose faces were recently featured in an activist campaign labeling them \"Climate Criminals.\" He directs the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. It's one of the few conservative, free-market groups that's been an accredited non-governmental organization at the United Nations' climate meetings. Ebell has long questioned mainstream climate science and has argued against any need to rein in greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. In a blog post Tuesday, he wrote : \"There is serious scientific debate about the magnitude, rate, and potential impacts of global warming, and the policies appropriate to address it. And, I believe that we should pursue energy policies based on the scientifically-supported view that abundant energy makes the world safer and the environment more livable, as well as the humanitarian view that affordable energy should be accessible to those who need it most, particularly the most vulnerable among us.\" Ebell said he and his colleagues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute agree that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that concentrations are increasing as a result of burning coal, oil and natural gas, and that this means the global temperature is likely to rise. \"Where we disagree with global warming alarmists is whether this amounts to a crisis that requires drastic action,\" he wrote. Indeed, Ebell suggested that climate change could be a boon for the world. While there could be long-term challenges, he also noted that: \"There is much evidence that the mild global warming that has occurred since the end of the Little Ice Age in the mid-nineteenth century has been largely beneficial for humanity and the biosphere. Earth is greening, food production has soared, and human longevity has increased dramatically.\" NPR reached out to the EPA to see what, if anything, Ebell has started to do at the agency. A spokesperson replied that \"EPA is now in contact with the president-elect's transition representatives and will begin to brief those individuals.\" In a fact-sheet released by the Obama administration earlier this month, the White House said the briefings would include \"organizational charts, budget materials, briefings on key agency priorities and areas of responsibility, and other materials describing the essential functions of that agency.\" ",

(Photo: Alejandro Ernesto, European Pressphoto Agency) The startup cruise line that grabbed headlines this year by launching voyages from Miami to Cuba will cease sailings by the summer of 2017. Miami-based Fathom will return its single ship, the 704-passenger Adonia, to British line P&O Cruises, which previously operated the vessel, according to a statement from Fathom's parent company, Carnival Corp. Fathom just began operations in April. Carnival Corp. launched Fathom with a bold mission to operate social impact-focused cruises , initially to the Dominican Republic. The company later widened its mission to include the Cuba sailings, which began in May . Cuba cruises on hold at Royal Caribbean While the Cuba sailings were popular, the social impact-focused trips to the Dominican Republic never caught on. The trips revolved around volunteer activities such as teaching English in schools, helping to cultivate cacao plants and building water filtration systems. In announcing\u00a0plans for Fathom in 2015, Carnival Corp. said the line\u00a0would cater to\u00a0an under-served market of consumers who want\u00a0to have a positive impact on people's lives. The company cited research that said it was a sizable and growing market. Carnival Corp. spokesman Roger Frizzell told USA TODAY that Fathom will continue as an entity that operates social impact-focused shore tours in the Dominican Republic. The tours will be available to passengers on ships operated by other Carnival Corp.-owned brands. The company also may expand the social impact-focused shore tour operation\u00a0to other destinations beyond the Dominican Republic. Carnival Corp. hopes to continue Cuba sailings beyond next summer with other brands. Frizzell said the company already has requested approval from the Cuban government for other brands to sail there beginning in June 2017. Fathom's Cuba sailings were \"extremely successful,\" Frizzell said. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "US Applications for Unemployment Aid Rose Last Week By paul wiseman, ap economics writer WASHINGTON \u0097 Nov 23, 2016, 11:54 AM ET 0 Shares Email More Americans sought unemployment benefits last week. But jobless claims remain at low levels, showing that most American workers enjoy job security. THE NUMBERS: The Labor Department says applications for jobless aid rose by 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000. They had fallen the previous week to the lowest level since 1973. The less-volatile four-week average slid by 2,000 to 251,000. The overall number of people collecting unemployment checks was 2.04 million, down more than 6 percent from a year earlier. THE TAKEAWAY: Applications for unemployment benefits are a proxy for layoffs. They have stayed below 300,000 for 90 straight weeks, longest streak since 1970. KEY DRIVERS: Economists had expected the claims numbers to bounce back after falling the previous week to the lowest level since 1973. That drop might have been exaggerated by problems adjusting the numbers to account for the Veteran's Day holiday. Claims at such low levels show that employers are confident enough in the economy to hold onto their workers. The U.S. unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, close to what economists consider full employment. Workers last month enjoyed the biggest pay raises in seven years, another sign the job market is healthy. Still, hiring has slowed. So far this year, the economy is generating an average of 181,000 jobs a month, down from 229,000 a month in 2015. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is facing more potential conflicts of interest than any other Oval Office occupant in U.S. history. And the billionaire businessman\u2019s response is: So what? Trump shrugged off any hypothetical entanglements that could occur due to his worldwide real estate enterprise and asserted the law stood with him during a meeting with The New York Times on Tuesday. \u201cI mean, I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d Trump said . \u201c\u2026And I understand why the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest now, because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest.\u201d TRUMP REVERSES COURSE ON CLINTON, DEFENDS BANNON According to a Congressional Research Service report issued in October, Trump is right. \u201cBecause of concerns regarding interference with the exercise of constitutional duties, Congress had not applied [criminal penalties for conflicts of interest] to the President,\u201d the report stated. \u201cConsequently, there is no current legal requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.\u201d Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 The present model assumes the president will be tried in the court of public opinion before he takes office. \u201cIn other words, the current regulatory scheme suggests that any potential conflicts will be addressed by the electorate at the ballot box,\u201d the report stated. The majority of previous presidents \u2013 Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush \u2013 have voluntarily \u201cdivested\u201d any financial assets. President Obama did not, however, because his assets were tied up in Treasury notes and mutual funds he did not control, according to the report. Trump told The Times he is beginning to take steps to separate a President Trump from the Trump organization. He noted that he\u2019s \u201cgreatly reduced\u201d signing checks and meetings with contractors and other interested parties. But Trump is acutely aware that he has no legal obligation to build a metaphorical wall between himself and his business. \u201cIn theory, I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don\u2019t care about my business.\u201d Though he\u2019s been president-elect for fewer than three weeks, already several controversies involving potential conflicts have bubbled up \u2013 and mostly petered out. Trump met last week with three Indian real-estate executives who are involved in building a Trump apartment complex in Mumbai. Trump said it was merely a congratulatory meeting and the men simply took a photo. During a Nov. 12 conversation with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Trump allegedly brought up the topic of wind farms, the building of which Trump had previously tried to stop because the structures obstructed the view at one of his Scottish golf courses. \u201cI might have brought it up,\u201d said Trump, who then detailed his long-time opposition to windfarms due to their effect on the bird population and because he said most are manufactured in Germany or Japan. After Trump spoke with the President of Argentina by phone after the Nov. 8 election, a report emerged from the country saying Trump brought up the topic of obtaining permits for an Argentinian office complex he\u2019s been trying to build. Both Trump and President Mauricio Macri denied the report and the source of the rumor later said he was joking. The Trump International Hotel which opened in October in Washington, D.C. is, Trump admits, \u201ca hotter brand than it was before.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d he told The Times. What will truly serve as a check on any potential conflicts, Trump said, is the chance he has to serve the nation and govern effectively. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it\u2026\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Got it President-elect Donald Trump named Betsy DeVos as his nominee for education secretary. Here's what you need to know about the conservative activist and billionaire donor. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Robert Costa and Emma Brown November 23 at 4:08 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @costareports Follow @emmersbrown President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday selected two prominent Republican women for Cabinet-level positions, adding diversity to an inner circle that was already coming under fire for being composed mostly of white men. In a potentially controversial choice, Trump intends to nominate billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos for education secretary, turning to a conservative activist who has forcefully pushed for private school voucher programs. Her nomination is expected to face strong opposition from public school advocates, who oppose her efforts to funnel taxpayer dollars from public to private and religious schools. [ Trump picks billionaire Betsy DeVos, school voucher advocate, as education secretary ] \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families.\u201d Hours earlier, Trump had announced that he will fill the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations slot with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a rising Republican star and daughter of Indian immigrants who has virtually no foreign policy experience. Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) was nominated to be President-elect Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. Here's what you need to know about the rising Republican star. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Haley\u2019s nomination marked Trump\u2019s first female appointment to a Cabinet-level post after his initial selections, such as attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions and incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn, had been older white men. Though Trump was elected with strong support from white working-class voters, people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s thinking said he wanted to announce both women\u2019s appointments before Thanksgiving to show that his Cabinet will be diverse. The decision to nominate DeVos, who met with Trump last weekend, was made in the past 48 hours, the people said. They added that DeVos benefited from strong support in the conservative movement and among conservative political donors. But DeVos immediately drew scathing opposition from the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union. \u201cBy nominating Betsy DeVos, the Trump administration has demonstrated just how out of touch it is with what works best for students, parents, educators and communities,\u2019\u2019 NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said in a statement. \u201cShe has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education.\u2019\u2019 DeVos tweeted that she is \u201chonored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable.\u201d DeVos \u2014 whose husband, Dick DeVos Jr., is an heir to the Amway direct-sale fortune \u2014 is a Michigan power broker and major donor to conservative causes and candidates around the country. Her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, one of the most profitable private security contractors during the Iraq War. DeVos and her family supported Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the GOP presidential primaries, and she was never an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. \u201cI still have reservations about him as a person,\u201d she told The Washington Post in July at the Republican National Convention, which she attended as a Michigan delegate. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet She has been closer to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who as governor of Indiana pushed to expand that state\u2019s voucher program into the nation\u2019s largest. She also has close ties to many Republicans in Washington, and her nomination was greeted with enthusiasm by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate education committee and frequent critic of what he viewed as the Obama administration\u2019s federal overreach on education, called her \u201can excellent choice.\u201d But others said her nomination heralded an intent by the Trump administration to dismantle the nation\u2019s public schools by draining them of students and resources. \u201cBetsy DeVos is everything Donald Trump said is wrong in America: an ultra-wealthy heiress who uses her money to game the system and push a special-interest agenda that is opposed by the majority of voters,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. The Rev. Barry W. Lynn \u2014 executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an organization that has long raised concerns about funneling tax dollars to religious schools \u2014 called her nomination \u201can insult to public education.\u201d Haley, also a former Trump critic, is generally considered a mainstream Republican, with views on military and national security matters that fall within the GOP\u2019s hawkish mainstream. \u201cGovernor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cShe will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\u201d Haley, who has accepted the offer, said she is \u201chonored that the president-elect has asked me to join his team and serve the country we love.\u2019\u2019 Her words represented a sharp departure from the campaign, during which she also initially backed Rubio for the GOP nomination and lambasted Trump as \u201ceverything a governor doesn\u2019t want in a president.\u201d [ As U.S. ambassador to U.N., Nikki Haley would face world\u2019s most intractable conflicts ] Trump is considering another prominent former rival and mainstream Republican, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, for secretary of state, though some Trump advisers are reportedly pushing back against that and backing other candidates, such as former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Haley\u2019s selection, also seen as an effort to reach out to establishment Republicans unsettled by Trump\u2019s surprise victory, came amid indications that he was slowing down transition planning to spend Thanksgiving with his family. The president-elect flew Tuesday night to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, where he will spend the holiday and weekend. Trump aides declined to provide details of his schedule over the next few days, saying in a conference call that Trump\u2019s family prefers keeping the holiday private. The aides said Trump planned to announce another Cabinet-level nominee later Wednesday but would not elaborate. One possibility is another former Trump rival, Ben Carson, who could be named secretary of housing and urban development. Carson tweeted Wednesday that \u201can announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again,\u2019\u2019 though he declined to be more specific. Trump had tweeted Tuesday that he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d Carson for the HUD post. [ Ben Carson is a candidate for HUD secretary, Trump says] Carson, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination before backing him, told Fox News: \u201cIt certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine, and I\u2019ll be thinking and praying about it seriously over the holiday.\u201d Haley, 44, who is serving her second term as governor, has worked on trade and labor issues and traveled abroad as governor, including to Europe. She is considered a novice in international affairs, but her home state senator, Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), appeared to be trying to buck up her foreign policy bona fides in a statement praising Haley on Wednesday. \u201cAs Governor of South Carolina she has recruited and dealt with some of the largest international business firms in the world. Her husband was a member of the South Carolina National Guard who served a tour of duty in Afghanistan,\u201d Graham said. \u201cGovernor Haley and her family fully understand what is at stake in the war against radical Islam. I know she will be a valuable ally to President-elect Trump.\u201d Haley, who met with Trump Thursday at Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower, grew up in a small South Carolina town and was elected governor in 2010 as a tea party reformer. But she has since been viewed as part of the GOP establishment. Haley is championed by party officials as a bright young leader \u2014 and she has called herself one of the those fit for a \u201cBenetton commercial.\u201d Yet she rarely if ever challenges the deeply conservative policy doctrines that have dominated the GOP for decades. Business-friendly and establishment-friendly in recent years, she is a former state lawmaker who railed against cozy business relationships within government and did not always click with her party\u2019s leadership. Her breakout moment on the national stage came with her widely praised handling of last year\u2019s slaying of a prominent minister and eight parishioners at a historic African American church in Charleston. Haley choked back tears at a news conference, saying the \u201cheart and soul of South Carolina was broken.\u2019\u2019 She was at the forefront of the subsequent debate over whether the Confederate flag should still fly on statehouse grounds, insisting that the legislature remove it. After the flag came down, she told The Washington Post that she has two teenage children and that \u201cI just couldn\u2019t look them in the face and keep that flag up.\u201d [ How U.S. presidents choose American ambassadors ] For Trump, Haley\u2019s ability to build relationships with prominent wealthy donors and figures such as Romney while maintaining her credibility as a populist-sounding, Sarah Palin-endorsed executive of a southern state may be a revealing window into how she is up to the task of navigating the swirling spheres of influence in Turtle Bay If confirmed by the Senate, Haley would be replaced by South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, a top Trump ally. His ascension is seen inside of Trump\u2019s inner circle as a welcome consequence of her departure, the person said \u2014 a way to promote them both. During the campaign, Haley was critical of some of Trump\u2019s proposals, such as his temporary ban on Muslims\u2019 entry into the United States. When she gave the GOP response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address this year, Haley criticized the \u201cangriest voices\u201d within national politics and their \u201csiren call\u201d to voters, a line widely seen as a not-so-subtle shot at Trump\u2019s campaign. But when she visited Trump last week, Haley told reporters that she never disliked Trump despite her past comments. \u201cHe was a friend and supporter before he ran for president, and was kind to me then. But when I see something I am uncomfortable with, I say it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we met, it was friends who had known each other before.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Chattanooga police say an elementary school bus crash killed five children and sent at least 23 people to area hospitals. Tribune news services Contact Reporter A school bus driver had no drugs or alcohol in his system when he careened off a road and smashed into a tree, killing five elementary schoolchildren, police said Wednesday. Chattanooga Police Sgt. Austin Garrett said a toxicology test was performed on Johnthony Walker, 24, the bus driver now in jail on five vehicular homicide charges. Federal authorities said Walker left the designated bus route and had driven onto a curvy road while carrying 37 children on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School. Police said he was driving well over the posted 30 mph limit when he lost control of the bus and slammed into a tree. Six children remain in the hospital. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart says it's unclear why driver Walker left the designated route and drove the bus down Talley Road. \"One of the things we're exploring is A, has he done it before, and B, if so, why?\" Hart said. At least five children were killed and many more injured when a school bus crashed in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Nov. 21, 2016. He said Walker, who has no criminal record in the state, had taken on a second job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center, and part of the agency's investigation will look at whether fatigue played a role in the wreck. The NTSB will also bring in a specialist to analyze video and audio recordings from the bus's interior cameras that were damaged in Monday's wreck. Police disputed one woman's claim that the driver asked the children if they were \"prepared to die\" just before the wreck. Jasmine Mateen, whose 6-year-old daughter was among the dead, said one of her two surviving children who were on the bus told her about the driver's remarks. Garrett, however, said at a Wednesday press conference: \"I want to be very clear on this. No witness we have spoken with has that information or provided it directly to our investigators.\" He added that investigators have not yet interviewed the children on the bus and asked anyone with additional information to bring it to police. Three of the children killed were in fourth grade, one in first grade and another in kindergarten, said Kirk Kelly, interim superintendent of Hamilton County schools. A makeshift memorial to them grew up around a telephone pole, with stuffed bears, flowers and dozens of balloons. (Tribune news services) Their families remembered them as fun, happy children taken much too soon. D'Myunn Brown liked to play little tricks on grown-ups. The 6-year-old would snatch a cellphone, hide it, then giggle and bat his big brown eyes. \"That's what made him so pretty, and he was as sweet as he could be,\" said his great-grandmother, Winifred Bray. \"I'm still numb. I still can't believe he's gone.\" LaFrederick Thirkill remembered his 9-year-old cousin, Cordayja Jones, as a girly-girl who liked dressing up and giving hugs. Thirkill is the principal at Orchard Knob Elementary, where Cordayja attended before changing schools to Woodmore Elementary. She was a polite little girl, he said. Even though he was her cousin, she called him \"Mr. Thirkill\" when she saw him in the hallways. \"I remember her as just a kid who always smiles,\" he said. Chattanooga school bus crash Mark Humphrey / AP Workers stand by a tree\u00a0 Nov. 22, 2016, at the site of a deadly school bus crash in Chattanooga, Tenn. Workers stand by a tree\u00a0 Nov. 22, 2016, at the site of a deadly school bus crash in Chattanooga, Tenn. (Mark Humphrey / AP) School officials repeatedly declined to answer questions Wednesday about whether they received complaints about the driver. School Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran said their focus is on \"giving our families and students the support that they need in this tragedy.\" Walker was involved in another bus accident only two months ago, police said. In September, he was driving the bus into a blind curve when he crossed over the center line and hit an SUV, according to a police report. No one was injured, and the damage to both vehicles was minor. He was not cited for any violations. Hamilton County School District spokeswoman Amy Katcher referred all questions about his performance and that of other drivers to the company that manages them, Durham School Services. The bus company did not respond to questions about its safety record or Walker's employment history. Durham CEO David A. Duke released a video statement expressing condolences to the families and pledging to work with investigators. A mother and 8-year-old son, who was injured in the crash, filed a lawsuit against Durham on Wednesday, attorney Herbert Thornbury confirmed. He said the boy suffered minor injuries, watched his best friend die and has been crying uncontrollably ever since. The lawsuit contends the boy may be permanently injured, sustained pain and suffering and will incur medical and other expenses as a result of the wreck. Based in Warrenville, Illinois, Durham operates about 13,700 vehicles across the U.S. and has nearly as many drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The company has had 346 crashes over two years, including three resulting in deaths and 142 with injuries, federal figures show. During that period, it had 53 incidents involving unsafe driving violations. Associated Press ",

    "text": "Scenes of Panic as Hundreds of Iraqis Flee Mosul By brian rohan and qassim abdul-zahra, associated press MOSUL, Iraq \u0097 Nov 23, 2016, 2:02 PM ET 0 Shares Email They came by the hundreds \u2014 men, women and children fleeing the battle for Mosul, some bloodied and crying out for help. So large was the crowd on the road that Iraqi troops initially ordered them back, worried that an Islamic State suicide bomber could be hiding among them. Mosul's residents are fleeing in growing numbers as Iraqi forces push deeper into the country's second largest city, and the battle-hardened extremists are fighting for every block, exploiting the dense urban terrain and using civilians as human shields. On Wednesday the tide of displaced people reached the Samah district, where Iraqi medics treated dozens of wounded, including at least six soldiers. At one point, four children and a man from the same family were rushed into the station, bleeding heavily as their relatives wailed in grief. A mortar round had slammed into the inner courtyard of their home. A few minutes after being brought to the aid station, a 16-month-old girl with a head wound was pronounced dead. Then the main rush came \u2014 hundreds of civilians racing forward on a dirt road. The troops ordered them to halt, saying they had intelligence that IS might send suicide bombers disguised as civilians. One of the men raised his shirt to show that he wasn't armed, saying he was desperate for food. Mosul, which fell to IS in the summer of 2014, is still home to more than 1 million people. Fearing a mass exodus, authorities have urged residents to stay inside their homes. But the presence of civilians has prevented the U.S.-backed Iraqi forces from using overwhelming force, slowing their advance and prolonging the city's agony. The U.N. says at least 68,000 people have fled the fighting in Mosul, including 8,300 over the past four days. Later on Wednesday, Iraqi soldiers arrived from the front lines with a man who was bound and hooded. They said they had caught him burning tires to help the militants hide from airstrikes and the drones that buzzed overhead. Trembling, the man said he had been forced to aid the extremists. Black Humvees carried wounded soldiers back from the front. The body of a special forces soldier killed in combat was wrapped in a blanket on the hood of a vehicle. The Iraqi military does not release official casualty figures, but field medics say dozens of troops have been killed and wounded since the Mosul operation began last month. Mortar rounds, artillery and gunfire rang out throughout the day, punctuated by occasional booms from airstrikes that sent plumes of smoke into the air. A pre-dawn airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition struck a bridge across the Tigris River, which divides the city in two, leaving only one crossing intact and disrupting IS supply lines. It was the second bridge to be struck this week, and two other bridges were destroyed by airstrikes last month. Until now, most of the fighting has been on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Iraqi forces are expected to use pontoon bridges when they reach the river. A spokesman for one of several state-sanctioned Shiite militias meanwhile said they had seized a road to the northwest of Mosul linking the city to Raqqa, the de facto capital of the IS group's self-styled caliphate. The militias have been converging on Tal Afar, an IS-held town west of Mosul that had a Shiite majority before falling to the extremists in 2014. \"We have cut off Tal Afar from Mosul and we cut off Mosul from Syria,\" Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for the Hezbollah Brigades, told The Associated Press. Elsewhere in Iraq, more than a dozen small-scale attacks in and around Baghdad killed at least 31 people and wounded 103, according to police and health officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. IS still regularly targets the capital despite suffering a series of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country over the past year. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Abdul-Zahra reported from Baghdad.

Matt Dunham/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt Dunham/AP A photograph of Jo Cox, the 41-year-old Labour lawmaker who was fatally shot and stabbed in June, was among tributes in London's Parliament Square following her death. Matt Dunham/AP A British jury sentenced a white supremacist to life in prison for the murder of Parliament member Jo Cox. The brutal killing of the pro-Europe lawmaker shocked the country ahead of the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. Cox, a 41-year-old mother of two, was shot and stabbed in June. Thomas Mair was arrested and charged shortly after the slaying, as The Two-Way reported . British Member Of Parliament Shot And Killed; Suspect Arrested The evidence against Mair, a 53-year-old gardener, was \"overwhelming,\" The Guardian reported . \"[W]itnesses to the attack included people who had known him all his life,\" and \"the incident was also captured on CCTV, as was his escape,\" the newspaper added. Mair did not enter a plea and did not attempt to defend himself during the trial, as the BBC reported . \"Before sentencing, Mair asked to speak to the courtroom but the judge declined, saying he had already had an opportunity,\" according to the broadcaster. Here's more: \"Judge Mr Justice Wilkie said the murder was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism, associated with Nazism. \"He said the aggravating feature was the premeditation and planning over weeks, in which he researched his intended victim, the past assassination of a serving MP and matricide, knowing Mrs Cox was the mother of young children.\" Mair was also convicted of grievous bodily harm because he stabbed an elderly man who was attempting to help Cox during the attack in the village of Birstall, according to Reuters. Article continues after sponsorship A jury found Thomas Mair, a man with white supremacist views, guilty of murdering Labour lawmaker Jo Cox a week before the U.K.'s Brexit referendum. AP hide caption toggle caption AP Investigators found evidence of extreme right-wing beliefs in Mair's apartment and during a search of his online activities, the Guardian said, which \"showed him to be obsessed with the Nazis, notions of white supremacy and apartheid-era South Africa.\" When asked his name during his first court appearance in June, Mair used the opportunity to proclaim, \"Death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\" During today's proceedings, the slain Labour lawmaker's husband, Brendan Cox, said their family was not motivated by retribution. \"We have no interest in the perpetrator,\" he said in a statement to the court. \"We feel nothing but pity for him; that his life was so devoid of love that his only way of finding meaning was to attack a defenseless woman who represented the best of our country in an act of supreme cowardice.\" ",

Illini Asset Recovery co-owner Jim Ford told KTRK-TV that after repossessing the Buick from Stan and Pat Kippling, he pulled over to call the bank in order to see if he could pay it off for the couple.\u00a0 \u201cI drove about a block. I called the bank and said, \u2018Hey. How about if I just pay this thing current right now?\u2019\u201d Ford said, according to CBS Chicago .\u00a0 He ended up starting a\u00a0 GoFundMe account , which paid for the car in full within hours. The newly paid-off car was returned to the Kipplings on Monday. Ford said the couple reminded him of his late grandparents.

Donald Trump taps South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as U.N. ambassador \u201cGovernor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country,\u201d President-elect Trump said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cShe is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\u201d The Trump transition team cited Haley\u2019s work as South Carolina governor as the reason for her nomination. In the team\u2019s announcement of Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, they note that as governor, Haley has \u201cled seven overseas trade missions and successfully attracted jobs and investment through negotiations with foreign companies.\u201d 7:39 a.m. ET President-elect Trump has offered South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley the post of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and she has accepted, a CBS News source confirms. The story was first reported by The Post and Courier and The Washington Post. Haley would, in effect, be the voice of the Trump administration at the 193-nation world body, if she is confirmed by the Senate, reports CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk.\u00a0 Tuesday, Nov. 22 Trump appears to back away from some campaign promises during NYT meeting; Romney remains serious contender for secretary of state;\u00a0 9:16 p.m. ET\u00a0Ben Carson told Fox News\u2019 \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto\u201d that housing and urban development (HUD) secretary was \u201cone of the offers that\u2019s on the table\u201d from Donald Trump. Carson told Fox that the inner cities are \u201cin terrible shape,\u201d and \u201cit certainly it something that has been a long-term interest of mine and I\u2019ll be thinking and praying about it seriously over the holiday.\u201d Just a week ago, Carson\u2019s friend Armstrong Williams had told The Hill that Carson wasn\u2019t interested in running a government agency because he\u2019s never run a federal agency. Earlier today, Trump had said he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d Carson for the job. I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 In a meeting with the New York Times, Donald Trump appeared to back away from some of the most prominent promises he made during his presidential campaign, notably, whether he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, and whether or not torture should be used in the war on terror . Asked whether he had ruled out prosecuting Hillary Clinton, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just not something I feel strongly about,\u201d Mr. Trump told the room, according to Times media reporter Michael Grynbaum, who live-tweeted the meeting. Mike Pence shakes up Trump transition team Prosecution, he said \u201cwould be very, very divisive for the country,\u201d Mr. Trump told the room, according to Times political reporter Maggie Haberman. \u201cMy inclination for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let\u2019s go forward. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum.\u201d 4:02 p.m. ET\u00a0President Obama has spoken with President-elect\u00a0 Donald Trump \u00a0at least once since their joint meeting at the White House earlier this month, CBS News has learned. \u201cAs President-elect Trump indicated in the Oval Office, he was hoping that he would have the opportunity to consult with President Obama over the course of this transition,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a Tuesday briefing. \u201cPresident Obama has committed to a smooth transition and as a result, they\u2019ve spoken at least once since their Oval Office meeting.\u201d 2:14 p.m. ET\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump has continued his Twitter antics after Election Day -- but most voters think he should shut his account down as president , according to a new poll. The survey, from Quinnipiac, found that 59 percent of U.S. voters say Trump should shut down his personal Twitter account. Just 35 percent said he should keep the account open. Despite their concerns over his social media use, though, 59 percent of Americans say they are \u201coptimistic\u201d about the next four years with Mr. Trump as president, compared with 37 percent who are not. 12:39 p.m. ET\u00a0Mitt Romney impressed Donald Trump so much during their meeting at Bedminster over the weekend, that he became a serious contender for secretary of state, said a source close to the Trump transition, who added a little more insight to what the vice president-elect told CBS News over the weekend. The meeting between the president-elect and the 2012 GOP nominee was initially scheduled as a courtesy visit, and could have been awkward, given the animosity between the two during the presidential campaign. In March,\u00a0 Romney delivered a speech specifically intended to derail Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy , calling him a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d Trump, in turn,\u00a0 labeled Romney a \u201closer\u201d and a \u201cchoke artist.\u201d Yet whatever tension there may have been seems to have dissipated. \u201cTrump enjoyed the meeting,\u201d the source told CBS News. Though Rudy Giuliani has been a leading candidate for secretary of state -- the source said Trump has had his \u201chead wrapped around Rudy Giuliani\u201d for the position \u2013 Trump has reconsidered since his meeting with Romney. Also, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, despite a meeting with Mr. Trump this past weekend, is out of the running for a position as a top adviser or department chief. Christie has been telling supporters he\u2019s \u201cin it for the long run.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019ll serve out his term as governor which ends in January 2018, and await what may come from Bridgegate. Christie, according to the source, wanted to be attorney general. His view is that he\u2019s been a good soldier for Mr. Trump throughout the campaign, once he ended his own presidential bid, and he\u2019ll continue to sit back and be a good soldier in hopes of serving in Trump\u2019s administration years from now.

America Maria Hernandez, who was born in Colombia in 1917 and was brought to the U.S. by one of her daughters in 1988, signed her naturalization certificate and took the oath of allegiance during a ceremony Wednesday in her living room. Surrounded by family members, she smiled and said she was very happy. \u201cI live in New York, the capital of the world,\u201d she said while waiving a small American flag. Hernandez was born in October 1917 in Cordoba, Colombia, but mostly lived in Barranquilla. She had 12 children and now has 22 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren.\u00a0 In this Nov. 23, 2016 photo, America Maria Hernandez, 99, left, is joined by her granddaughter Monica Martinez, center, and daughter Hortensia Martinez as she is administered the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance, in the Queens borough of New York.\u00a0 Richard Drew, AP Hernandez\u2019s daughter Hortensia Martinez, 69, said she brought Hernandez to the U.S. so she could help her take care of her son. Hernandez arrived with a green card arranged by her daughter, who had married a U.S. citizen. Instead of renewing the card, the family asked Hernandez if she wanted to become a U.S. citizen, and she said yes. Hernandez walks with a cane, likes to watch TV and enjoys attending activities at a local senior center at least once a week. Asked on Wednesday what her secret for a long life is, she responded, \u201cBeing well, with my children. They all work. They are all good.\u201d According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 730,000 people became U.S. citizens in the government\u2019s 2015 fiscal year.

Advocates for GOP former presidential nominee Romney, who has international renown from his time running the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games, say his selection would send a signal of reassurance to the country and show flexibility in Trump\u2019s choices for his administration. Some are worried that Giuliani, whose global business interests have drawn scrutiny , could have trouble getting confirmed. But some Trump loyalists like Newt Gingrich say picking Romney would be a big mistake, given his sharp public criticism of Trump. Trump Holds Meetings With Mitt Romney, Michelle Rhee and Others There are voices in the Trump circle suggesting he look at other candidates, such as retired Gen. David Petraeus , who said Wednesday he would be open to a job in the Trump administration. Petraeus is highly regarded by leaders in both parties on Capitol Hill, but his 2015 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information could complicate an appointment. The competing views came to light in ABC News interviews and conversations with multiple officials in the Trump transition, who have spoken on condition of anonymity. Public comments from several Trump associates close to the process have also suggested divides. \u201cNo decision has been made yet on that position, and ultimately that decision will be up to the president-elect. He\u2019s looking at a number of very highly qualified potential choices there,\ufffd? Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Wednesday. Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee have been outspoken advocates for Giuliani and are Romney skeptics. \u201cI think there are huge advantages to Rudy Giuliani. Frankly, I think that if you want someone who is going to go out and be a very tough negotiator for America and represent American interest in the way that Trump campaigned, I think that probably Rudy is a better pick and has the right temperament,\ufffd? Gingrich told reporters at Trump Tower in New York City earlier this week. \u201cNice to have meeting -- but no admin spot; Mitt said Trump was con man; phony. That\u2019s insult to Trump voters,\ufffd? Huckabee tweeted after Trump\u2019s meeting with Romney last weekend. He later deleted the message from his account. \u201cThe only thing that would surprise me more than Donald Trump offering the position would be that Mitt Romney would take it. If he does, I have to question why would he do it, because, I mean, if you don\u2019t believe that the person who offered you a position is a person that you can trust, you think is a fraud, a con man, you have to think, \u2018Boy, his ambition is so great that he would take a position from someone for whom he holds utter contempt,\u2019\ufffd? Huckabee said on Fox News Wednesday. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that makes sense.\ufffd? A representative for Romney did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment on whether he would accept a post in the Trump administration or if he had been offered a job. Miller said several options remain on the table as Trump retreats to his Florida estate for Thanksgiving. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going to drive the president-elect is the judgment and decision-making strength that he looks at with potential applicants to any position, whether it\u2019s this or any other Cabinet-level-type position,\ufffd? he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be looking for things like chemistry, experience, a similar vision in what the president-elect and vice-president-elect are trying to do with this administration, and ultimately whoever the president-elect does pick will be somebody of absolute top caliber.\ufffd? 0 Shares ",

NEA is the largest labor union in the United States.  EPA/MICHAEL REYNOLDS (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA) WASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks after Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the USA\u2019s teachers unions are wondering what happened to their chosen candidate \u2014 and how so many of their members could have voted for her opponent. Despite early and eager endorsements of Clinton by both unions, the nation\u2019s school teachers and other school workers contributed substantially to Trump\u2019s Nov. 8 win. How substantially? About one in five\u00a0American Federation of Teachers (AFT) members who cast a ballot voted for Trump, the union\u2019s leader estimated. Among the larger National Education Association (NEA), which comprises more than 3 million members, more than one in three who voted did so for the billionaire developer, early data show. AFT President Randi Weingarten , whose union represents about 1.6 million teachers and other workers, said some of the reason for Clinton's defeat was timing \u2014 and perhaps sexism. \u201cFrankly I was always concerned about whether the country was ready to have a female president,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was an intensity of hatred that male political figures never get. So I think we\u2019re never really going to understand it.\u201d Most of the USA\u2019s largest labor unions endorsed Clinton as early as 2015, including NEA, AFT, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Despite the support, Clinton won union households nationwide by just eight percentage points, exit polls show : 51% to Trump\u2019s 43%. Clinton carried white, college-educated women, but just barely: 51% to 45%. Among white women without a college degree, Trump won resoundingly: 63% to Clinton\u2019s 34%. In that sense, teachers, who at last count were\u00a0about 82% white and 76% female, actually outperformed other groups when it came to their support for Clinton. Weingarten last week said internal figures show that Clinton earned about 80% of her members' votes,\u00a0in spite of a \u201cvery effective\u201d effort to disparage\u00a0the former secretary of state\u2019s character. At NEA, an aggressive member-to-member campaign and strategic political effort actually did get out the vote for Clinton, officials said: As late as last September, nearly 60% of its members identified as \u201cRepublicans or independents.\u201d At the time, Clinton\u2019s NEA support stood at just 58%. By Election Day, it rose to 65%. NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda , a former Utah teacher, said that despite Clinton\u2019s loss, the union engaged members in \u201crecord levels of activism,\"\u00a0supporting down-ballot candidates and initiatives \"important to students and working families.\u201d Among other efforts, unions defeated a well-funded charter school expansion effort in Massachusetts and helped ensure the continuation of a tax hike \u00a0to fund education in California. NEA's state and national\u00a0political directors met in Nashville last weekend to figure out what comes next, and educators nationwide are waiting to find out who President-elect Trump names as education secretary. On Wednesday, school voucher advocate Betsy DeVos said in a tweet that she would work with Trump to \"make American education great again.\" I am honored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable. \u2014 Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) November 23, 2016 Delegates cheer as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is introduced to speak at the National Education Association (NEA) Representative Assembly in Washington, Tuesday, July 5, 2016. (AP Photo/Molly Riley) \u00a0(Photo: Molly Riley, AP) In a statement, Garc\u00eda said NEA will \u201clisten closely\u201d as Trump lays out his education vision. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard any specifics from the incoming administration about education policies, so we can\u2019t speculate further,\u201d she said. In an interview, Weingarten said she had \u201cno regrets \u2014 absolutely no regrets\u201d about the union\u2019s endorsement of Clinton, adding that Democratic runner-up Sen. Bernie Sanders \u201cwas never tested or vetted by anyone, and frankly we have no idea whether he would have actually been able to get through this crucible \u2026 either.\u201d She added that Clinton \u201chas spent her life fighting for families and children \u2014 and that\u2019s what we spend our life fighting for. Were there mistakes she made? Of course. Were there mistakes we made? Of course. But she is someone who for 30 years has been in the service of the public and incredibly qualified.\u201d Follow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo 1849 CONNECT TWEET 36 LINKEDIN 262 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fRUNd1 ",

    "text": "World's Tallest Waterslide to Be Demolished After Boy Died By jim suhr, associated press KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u0097 Nov 23, 2016, 3:37 PM ET 0 Shares Email A company's announcement that it will demolish its towering Kansas waterslide as soon as investigations into the death of a boy on the ride this summer have concluded was motivated by uncertainty among park patrons, not any pending legal settlements involving the accident, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts and the family that runs it said in a statement Tuesday that the \"Verruckt\" ride at the Schlitterbahn park in Kansas City, Kansas, will be permanently removed from its tower \"once the investigation is concluded and we are given permission by the court.\" The Texas-based company called the move \"the only proper course of action.\" \"Coming up on the holidays, this time of year, it's something we'd like to set to rest,\" company spokeswoman Winter Prosapio told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"When we're allowed to take it down, we will take it down. We have no interest in having it up another hour.\" Billed as the world's tallest waterslide, Verruckt has been closed since Caleb Thomas Schwab died on the ride Aug. 7. The boy was decapitated, someone familiar with the investigation previously told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly about the boy's death. Two women in the raft were injured. Attorneys for the Schwabs \u2014 Caleb's father is Republican state Rep. Scott Schwab \u2014 and the women are independently investigating the accident. No charges or lawsuits had been filed as of Wednesday. Michael Rader, an attorney for the Schwabs, said he had been working with Schlitterbahn and its legal team on a plan to eventually remove the slide, but that it \"cannot be torn down until all investigations and potential litigation has concluded.\" Scott Schwab didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Verruckt, which is German for \"insane,\" featured multi-person rafts that made a 17-story drop at speeds of up to 70 mph, followed by a surge up a hump and a 50-foot descent to a finishing pool. Riders were harnessed with two nylon seatbelt-like straps, one crossing the rider's lap, the other stretching diagonally like a car shoulder seatbelt. The regulation of waterslides and other amusement rides has drawn scrutiny since Caleb's death. Kansas is known for its light regulation of amusement park rides, and the Texas-based company that operates Schlitterbahn lobbied legislators to help ensure that it remained responsible for its own inspections. Kansas requires annual inspections of permanent amusement park rides but allows private inspectors to do the checks. Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts said Tuesday that it has been cooperating with investigators and the victims' families and attorneys, noting that \"in our 50 years of providing an environment for families and friends to gather, we've never experienced this kind of devastating event.\" 0 Shares ",

Police have not yet made an arrest or announced a motive in what they call a targeted attack on 60-year-old victim James Alden. Police said Alden is in stable condition, although the hospital where he was taken says it doesn't have a patient listed by that name Wednesday. Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Sims, who represents the downtown Philadelphia district, said Alden is a member of the LGBT community. Sims is following the investigation to be sure the victim was not targeted over his sexuality. Alden, who works in catering, shares the first-floor apartment near Rittenhouse Square with his partner. The partner told police Alden thought the package contained asthma inhalers that he orders by mail. However, police do not think the package was sent in the mail because it contained an old bar code. Alden suffered injuries to his hands, chest and face. The approximately 10 people evacuated after the 4 a.m. explosion were allowed back home once police finished their work at the scene, a spokeswoman said. 0 Shares ",

So here we are, in a boardroom at The New York Times, over a lunch of salmon and steak, sitting around a giant wooden table with the president elect, posing questions to a man who has mocked, maligned and threatened us for the past two years. What actually happened in that room, when Mr. Trump sat down with the edi t ors, reporters and columnists for The Times on Tuesday? How did it feel? What did we learn about him? And why, after all the taunts and outbursts, was Mr. Trump so civil toward us \u2014 nice, even? In the latest episode of The Run-Up , I reconstruct this extraordinary hourlong session with the president-elect, by using exclusive audio clips from the encounter.

(Nov. 23) AP President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 20, 2016. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 After a long and bruising political campaign, President-elect Donald Trump Wednesday called in a video for the nation to \"speak with one voice and one heart.\" \"It is my prayer, that on this Thanksgiving, we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by a shared purpose and very, very common resolve,\" said Trump, as he looked directly into the camera. The video posted on YouTube came after Trump announced the selection Wednesday of two more Cabinet officials\u00a0\u2014 South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations and Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos as secretary of Education. \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) November 23, 2016 \"We have just finished a long and bruising political campaign,\" Trump said. \"Emotions are raw and tensions just don\u2019t heal overnight. It doesn\u2019t go quickly, unfortunately, but we have before us the chance now to make history together to bring real change to Washington, real safety to our cities, and real prosperity to our communities, including our inner cities. So important to me, and so important to our country.\u00a0 But to succeed, we must enlist the effort of our entire nation.\" This week, Trump has walked back some of his most controversial proposals during the campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, including a call to have Clinton prosecuted for the use of a private email server while secretary of State. In a meeting with The New York Times Tuesday, Trump also said he was reconsidering his call to have terrorist suspects waterboarded after he met with retired Marine general James Mattis, who is under consideration\u00a0to be Defense secretary. Mattis, Trump said, told him he did not find waterboarding valuable in interrogating suspects. Trump backs off support of waterboarding In the video, Trump asked for the support of all Americans to help the nation heal. \"I am asking you to join me in this effort,\" he said. \"It is time to restore the bonds of trust between citizens. Because when America is unified, there is nothing beyond our reach, and I mean absolutely nothing. \"Let us give thanks for all that we have, and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead.\" The president-elect is spending the holiday at his estate Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., before returning to New York over the weekend to resume selecting members of his Cabinet.

    "text": "Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images WATCH The Facebook Revolution Email A spokesperson for Facebook has not explicitly denied a report claiming that the social media company developed a \u201ccensorship tool\u201d that would allow it to \u201csuppress posts from appearing in people\u2019s news feeds in specific geographic areas,\u201d as part of efforts to enter into the Chinese marketplace. A Facebook spokesperson asked about the report, which was published by the New York Times on Tuesday night, told ABC News that the company has \u201clong said that we are interested in China,\u201d and is \u201cspending time understanding and learning more about the country,\u201d but has \u201cnot made any decision on our approach to China.\u201d \u201cOur focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform,\u201d the spokesperson added. The spokesperson refused to be named for this story. According to the Times\u2019 report, which cites three anonymous former or current employees, Facebook has suppressed content on its network in other countries in the past, including in Pakistan, Russia and Turkey. Chinatopix Via AP Chinese paramilitary police personnel patrol along the Bund, a popular tourist attraction in Shanghai, China, Dec. 31, 2015. While the report said that this previous activity was standard practice for U.S. internet companies working abroad, this new tool steps up the approach by \u201cpreventing content from appearing in feeds in China in the first place.\u201d The cited unnamed employees allege, according to the Times\u2019 report, that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u201chas supported and defended the effort.\u201d Reacting to the news, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, issued a statement on Wednesday saying in part: \"That Facebook has been engineering a way to accommodate Communist China's censorship is deeply disturbing.\" \"The promise of technology lies in creating a future that is freer,\" Cotton also said. \"But if Facebook shamefully rationalizes censorship in pursuit of short-term profit, it will be placing its fortunes in a future that is more closed, less prosperous, and much darker.\" The popular social media network has been banned from China since 2009, according to the Reuters news agency . News of the tool comes as the company continues to face pressure from critics who wish to see it take greater steps to address the proliferation of so-called \u201cfake news,\u201d here in the United States. On Saturday, Zuckerberg posted on his own Facebook page a lengthy post saying \u201cwe take misinformation seriously,\u201d but urged caution, saying \u201cproblems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\u201d and \u201cwe need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content,\u201d and \u201cwe do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves.\u201d Last week Facebook was one of two companies that moved to block fake news sites from using its third-party advertisement services -- a decision that could cut off one source of revenue for the fake news sites.

Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) was nominated to be President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the rising Republican star. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) By Robert Costa November 23 at 6:21 PM Follow @costareports South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s journey to the United Nations has struck members of both parties as unlikely: the appointment of a Republican with limited foreign policy experience to a Cabinet-level post. But through the prism of a career bursting with political diplomacy and ambition, it is a natural next step. Haley, 44, who President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday as his nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has long shuttled between her party\u2019s mainstream and its conservative base, maintaining ties to each wing even as she resists being labeled as \u201ctea party\u201d or \u201cestablishment.\u201d And the daughter of Indian immigrants has consistently asserted herself as a voice for both the Republican future and its past traditions. These contradictory signals and blended alliances have made her an ascendant force as well as occasionally inscrutable. She is at once a favorite of the business elite and Mitt Romney and a populist-sounding, Sarah Palin-endorsed Southern executive. [ As U.S. ambassador to U.N., Nikki Haley would face world\u2019s most intractable conflicts ] Haley\u2019s ability to translate those relationship skills and savvy to the U.N. will almost certainly be crucial in her success \u2014 or failure \u2014 in navigating the swirling spheres of influence at Turtle Bay. Not only will she need to explain Trump and his brash foreign policy to the world, but she will be tasked with keeping her place within the president-elect\u2019s at times chaotic orbit and within a Republican Party that has cracks across it. Such a job demands studied knowledge of global politics and statecraft. It also demands nuance and steadiness amid tumult and criticism, which is where Haley\u2019s experience is telling. Her political profile so far is defined more by her steady responses to crisis and competing pressures than by a particular ideology. After the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., last year, Haley made headlines for her calm and poise in the following days and spoke out against hate and racism in the country. She called for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state Capitol and said that such symbols cause \u201churt and pain\u201d even if they are historic. Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Caption President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Chief of Staff\u00a0Reince Priebus President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump\u2019s campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. On race, Haley said in a subsequent remarks at the National Press Club that \u201cblack lives do matter\u201d and called her own party \u201cshameful\u201d in its outreach to minority groups. Before and after that tragedy, she was championed by party officials as a welcome and diverse face \u2014 and she has called herself one of the those fit for a \u201cBenetton commercial.\u201d Yet she rarely if ever challenges the deeply conservative policy doctrines that have dominated the Republican Party for decades. Her relationship with Trump is an example of how she can shrug off lingering conflicts and calmly assert a new reality when necessary. Earlier this year, as Haley delivered the Republican response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union, she warned viewers against the \u201csiren call of the angriest voices,\u201d which was widely seen as an indirect shot at Trump, and she endorsed a Trump rival, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Trump swiped back and called her \u201cweak\u201d on immigration. \u201cI feel very strong about illegal immigration,\u201d he told Fox News at the time. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d But days ago, Haley spoke warmly of her meeting with Trump and told reporters that she has actually always been his friend. To have all of these paths lead to the U.N. seems both odd and oddly understandable. Having already been elected twice as governor, serving alongside Trump offers Haley an opportunity to gain credibility as a global leader without being cast as a \u201cglobalist\u201d or establishment Republican because she will be linked with Trump, who was elevated by the GOP\u2019s grass-roots activists. But she\u2019s not too close. If he struggles in office, Haley can say that she was serving her country, and it\u2019s rare for a U.N. ambassador to be part of any scandal emerging at the White House. Haley also leaves herself positioned for a future run for national office or an elevation to secretary of state or another Cabinet position in the coming years, should there be a shake-up. This is how the governor operates, and it should come as no surprise. She saw as a 30-something state lawmaker an opening for an outsider and woman to win the governor\u2019s office and she took it, winning as a tea-party darling in 2010. Palin campaigned for her and she was celebrated on the right. A year later, as her stock rose nationally, Haley endorsed Romney instead of going with a conservative favorite during the 2012 presidential race. She began to draw rave reviews from corporate leaders for the way she clashed with labor unions over business development projects in her state. But she never went full establishment and never veered too far to the center. When a Senate seat opened in 2012, she tapped then congressman Tim Scott, who is an arch-conservative and African American, underscoring her desire to cultivate a new bench of leaders without losing the party\u2019s hard-line base. When Trump roiled the GOP primaries, Haley was trusted by party leaders and encouraged to speak out against his style of politics, but she did so while rarely mentioning his name. It was a messy jumble of gestures, mostly subtle and confusing. \u201cSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThat is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume.\u201d You might call it diplomatic. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports) COLUMBIA, Mo. \u2014\u00a0A former University of Missouri tutor said she can document at least a dozen instances of serious academic fraud involving men\u2019s and women\u2019s athletes during a 16-month period. Yolanda Kumar told The Kansas City Star that she felt pressured to keep athletes academically eligible, especially football and men\u2019s basketball players. Her allegations come less than a year after the school sanctioned its men\u2019s basketball team for violating NCAA rules. Hours after Kumar posted in her personal Facebook account Tuesday afternoon that she had taken entrance exams and completed entire courses for Mizzou athletes, the university issued a statement announcing its investigation. \"The University of Missouri has received allegations of potential academic rules violations by a former tutor in the Athletics Academic Services area,\"\u00a0the athletics department said in a statement. \"Consistent with our commitment to rules compliance and to operating our athletics program with integrity, we are conducting a review of the allegations.\" Missouri abruptly fires assistant coach Jackie Shipp Of the hundreds of Missouri athletes she has tutored since 2010, Kumar said, 15 involved serious academic fraud. She told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch she felt like she had been \"groomed\"\u00a0over time by her superiors to participate in what she described as \"academic dishonesty.\" The last straw for Kumar involved a male athlete she said needed help during the summer on a core class she was told he needed to graduate. The student passed, she said, \"but he really was struggling with very basic things that my eighth-grader could do.\" The same student was assigned to her in the fall and became depressed after he was unable to grasp basic statistics equations, she said. \"This kid, he has no hope,\"\u00a0Kumar said. \"He\u2019s so lost, and I helped. I helped ruin him. I probably can\u2019t take it all, because it\u2019s not all me. It\u2019s not all me at all, but he was the one who forced me. That was enough. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\" During an 18-minute phone call on Nov. 2 with Mary Ann Austin, the university\u2019s executive associate athletic director for compliance, Kumar came clean about her involvement. Initially it felt good to have provided that information, she said, but she soon realized \"the evil was out of the box and you can\u2019t put it back in.\" Kumar didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages from the Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment. In her Facebook post Tuesday, she said at least two academic coordinators for athletes in revenue-generating sports encouraged, promoted and supported her activities. Kumar resigned her position Nov. 7 prior to a meeting with a member for compliance, general counsel and \"an individual that reports to the chancellor.\" The university\u2019s announcement comes 10 months after it self-imposed sanctions against the men\u2019s basketball program stemming from a sham internship program and impermissible benefits received by players and their families at Tan-Tar-A resort at the Lake of the Ozarks. Third-year basketball coach Kim Anderson\u2019s team was banned from the 2016 postseason and forfeited two scholarships as part of the sanctions that were accepted by the NCAA when it closed the case in August.

Collin Rose, 29, had stopped a bicyclist while investigating car break-ins in a neighborhood near campus when he was shot at about 6:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, police said. Wayne State police are commissioned as Detroit police officers and can take part in off-campus investigations. The suspect, DeAngelo Davis, 31, was arrested late Tuesday after a large-scale manhunt, Wayne State Police Chief Anthony Holt said. Davis, who was previously known to police, was picked up about a half-mile from the scene of the shooting, Holt said. DeAngelo Davis, in red sweatshirt under jacket, is arrested Tuesday night in Detroit in connection with the shooting of Wayne State University police Officer Collin Rose. WDIV-TV Holt said that it hadn't yet been determined why Rose, a K9 officer who had been with the university police for 5\u00bd years, was shot but that it didn't appear that he was singled out for attack. Lawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that would categorize targeting of police and other emergency responders as hate crimes after a San Antonio, Texas, police detective was shot and killed Sunday morning in what authorities said was an attack targeted at law enforcement.

On Wednesday morning, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley accepted Trump's offer to be ambassador to the United Nations, a Cabinet-level position. President-elect Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos shake hands at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in Bedminster, N.J., Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. Carolyn Kaster / AP DeVos, a 58-year-old billionaire philanthropist from Michigan, leads the American Federation for Children, which promotes charter school education. She's married to Dick DeVos, an heir to the Amway fortune, and is the sister to Erik Prince, founder of notorious government-contracted security company Blackwater, now known as Academi. A major GOP donor who gave money to Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush during the primaries, DeVos ultimately supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as the Republican candidate for president \u2014 not Trump. Jeb Bush lauded her nomination, calling her an \"outstanding pick.\" Post by NBC News . \"She has a long and distinguished history championing the right of all parents to choose schools that best ensure their children's success,\" Bush wrote on Facebook. \"Her allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next.\" But the National Education Association, which supports public education causes, criticized DeVos as having a history of supporting policies that hurt students. \"She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education. By nominating Betsy DeVos, the Trump administration has demonstrated just how out of touch it is with what works best for students, parents, educators and communities,\" NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said in a statement. DeVos has spent millions lobbying for voucher programs for private schools, which jibes with Trump's campaign promise to make taxpayer-funded charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools as a hallmark of his education policy. The American Federation of Teachers slammed DeVos' voucher efforts as \"anti-public education.\" \"Betsy DeVos is everything Donald Trump said is wrong in America \u2014 an ultra-wealthy heiress who uses her money to game the system and push a special-interest agenda that is opposed by the majority of voters. Installing her in the Department of Education is the opposite of Trump's promise to drain the swamp,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. Elizabeth Chuck ",

Hillary Clinton's vote total is 64,223,986 (48.1% of the vote), while Trump's is 62,206,395 (46.6%) - a difference of 2,017,591 votes (1.5%).

Of course, presidents are elected by the Electoral College, not the popular vote, and what sunk Clinton's campaign was her performance in the key battleground states, particularly in the Midwest. And by Wasserman's count, Trump beat Clinton in 13 key swing states by a 48.5%-to-46.6% margin. In the non-swing states, though, Clinton is ahead of Trump 48.9%-to-45.6%. Mark Murray ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Emma Brown November 23 at 3:17 PM Follow @emmersbrown Betsy DeVos is hardly a household name, but the Michigan billionaire and conservative activist has quietly helped change the education landscape in many states, spending millions of dollars in a successful push to expand voucher programs that give families taxpayer dollars to pay for private and religious schools. Now DeVos is poised to spread her preference for vouchers nationwide. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named her as his nominee for education secretary, a pick that suggests he aims to follow through with campaign promises to expand the movement toward \u201cschool choice\u201d \u2014 including vouchers and charter schools \u2014 in an effort to break up a public education system that he has called \u201ca government-run monopoly.\u201d Trump\u2019s pick has intensified what already was a polarized debate about school choice. Advocates for such choice see in the Trump administration an extraordinary opportunity to advance their cause on a national scale, whereas teachers unions and many Democrats fear an unprecedented and catastrophic attack on public schools, which they see as one of the nation\u2019s bedrock civic institutions. [ Pence accomplished in Indiana what Trump wants for national education ] Jim DeMint, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, cheered DeVos on Wednesday, saying that \u201cthe school choice movement will have a champion in the Education Department.\u201d American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said that Trump\u2019s pick \u201cmakes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding and destroying public education in America.\u201d Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet As a billionaire Republican power broker with no professional experience in schools, DeVos is an unconventional choice to lead the federal education bureaucracy. And while her views on choice are well known, it is unclear how she would lead a department with responsibilities that sprawl from administering student loans to enforcing civil rights in schools. [ Trump could reverse Obama\u2019s actions on college sex assault, transgender rights ] She has said little about Common Core, for example, and her ties to organizations that support the K-12 academic standards \u2014 including as a board member of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, started by former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2014 raised concern for Trump supporters, who saw her nomination as a sign that the president-elect is wavering on his vehement opposition to the standards. From her Twitter account Wednesday, DeVos linked to a website where she wrote that she had initially believed in the standards but became disenchanted with them as they \u201cgot turned into a federalized boondoggle.\u201d \u201cI am not a supporter \u2014 period,\u201d she wrote. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are hoping that DeVos will shrink the Education Department\u2019s role in public schools and leave more decisions to states and districts. \u201cBetsy DeVos is an excellent choice,\u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, adding that he expects DeVos to stop the Obama administration\u2019s effort to turn the federal government into a \u201cnational school board.\u201d Alexander led a recent bipartisan effort to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act, which shifted power to the states. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Betsy DeVos for education secretary. Here's what you need to know about the conservative activist and billionaire donor. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member of the education committee, said she plans to scrutinize DeVos\u2019s record and ask her about her qualifications, priorities and plans. Murray also said she would press DeVos to explain \u2014 given Trump\u2019s statements about immigrants, women, Muslims and other groups \u2014 how she \u201cwill ensure the safety and respect of all students, of all backgrounds, all across this country.\u201d DeVos, 58, grew up in Michigan, where her father, Edgar Prince, made a fortune supplying auto parts to manufacturers. Her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, one of the most profitable private security firms during the Iraq War. Blackwater came under scrutiny after its guards shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad in 2007. She graduated from Calvin College, a Christian liberal arts school in Grand Rapids, Mich., and married Dick DeVos Jr., an heir to the Amway direct-sales fortune. Together, they founded the Windquest Group, which invests in technology and manufacturing. They wield powerful influence in Michigan, where she is a former chair of the state GOP and he was the Republican nominee for governor in 2006. They also are major donors to GOP candidates and conservative causes nationwide. During the 2016 cycle, they gave nothing to Democrats and $2.7 million to Republican candidates and political action committees, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. The DeVoses also have donated millions of dollars to the arts and to Christian organizations. But they are perhaps most ardent about their support for school choice, leading a movement to promote vouchers and charter schools for years. [ Kennedy Center gets $22.5 million gift from DeVos family ] Betsy DeVos founded and serves as chairman of the American Federation of Children and its associated political arm, a platform she has used to support candidates who endorse vouchers and charter schools and to attack candidates who don\u2019t. Three decades ago, there were no state voucher programs. Now, according to the advocacy group EdChoice, about 400,000 children in 29 states are going to private schools with the help of public dollars. DeVos is working toward a scenario in which \u201call parents, regardless of their Zip code, have had the opportunity to choose the best educational setting for their children,\u201d she told Philanthropy magazine in 2013. Trump has proposed redirecting $20 billion in federal spending toward a grant program for states to expand vouchers and charter schools. He has also said that he wants to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to persuade states to devote another $110 billion toward vouchers \u2014 enough, he has said, for every child living in poverty to have a scholarship of $12,000 toward the school of his or her choice. Research on voucher programs shows mixed results. Several recent studies have found that voucher recipients\u2019 math and reading test scores decline after they transfer from public to private schools. But other studies have found that voucher recipients are more likely to enroll in and complete college. Public school advocates fear that redirecting dollars from public to private schools not only weakens public education but also gives taxpayer support to institutions that don\u2019t have the same obligation to serve all students \u2014 including those in need or who have learning disabilities. [ Quality controls lacking for D.C. school voucher program ] Vouchers also send money to religious schools, a fact that has provoked political resistance and legal challenges. \u201cAmericans are always free to send their children to private schools and religious schools, but raiding the public treasury to subsidize private businesses and religious organizations runs against the public trust and the Constitution,\u201d said Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, adding that Trump\u2019s nomination \u201csuggests he has little regard for . . . the constitutional principle of separation of church and state.\u201d But proponents say families should be allowed to choose where their children learn. \u201cWe cannot rest as a nation until every kid gets a chance to attend a great school,\u201d said Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), chairman of the Congressional School Choice Caucus, in a statement hailing DeVos\u2019s nomination. Trump\u2019s embrace of DeVos shows a willingness to look outside his circle of loyalists.

Osorio/Chicago Tribune) Cook County\u00a0Judge Kathleen Kennedy on Nov 23, 2016, turned back a legal challenge by Fenwick High School to overturn its disputed loss in a football playoff game last weekend. The decision clears the way for Plainfield North High School to play in the Class 7A championship against East St. Louis on Saturday. (Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune) Steve Schmadeke Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A Cook County judge Wednesday rejected a Hail Mary legal challenge by Fenwick High School to overturn its disputed playoff football loss, ruling  that she had no authority to change the outcome of the game. \"Here, as on the playing field, one side wins and one side loses,\" Judge Kathleen Kennedy said in announcing her ruling in a courtroom packed with disappointed Fenwick supporters and students. The decision cleared the way for Plainfield North High School to play in the Class 7A championship game against East St. Louis on Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Champaign. Fenwick, which was vying to play in its first championship football game in the school's 87-year history, had filed the lawsuit Monday after the Illinois High School Association refused to hear an appeal of the heartbreaking loss, citing a bylaw declaring that decisions by officials shall be final. Photos from the Class 7A semifinal game between Plainfield North and Fenwick. Plainfield North won 18-17 in overtime. A mistaken decision by officials with no time left allowed Plainfield North to tie last weekend's game with a field goal in regulation and then win 18-17 in overtime on a two-point conversion. While legal challenges to athletic competitions go back decades, no court has ever overturned the final score of a high school or college game, said Alan Goldberger, a sports law attorney in New Jersey. \"There's lots of perceived injustices that the court cannot address,\" Goldberger said. \"You can't have athletics if everybody is going to court if they feel a call in a game was incorrect. ... It's terrible and it's a bad break ... but children also have to learn \u2014 and parents have to learn \u2014 that there are setbacks in life.\" Near the end of regulation in Saturday's semifinal game, Fenwick was clinging to a 10-7 lead and had the ball at its own 15-yard line. With four seconds left, the Friars' quarterback threw a deep pass on fourth down for an incompletion, seemingly ending the game. But the officials ruled that play to be intentional grounding, a penalty. With no time left on the clock, the officiating crew then awarded Plainfield North one play, allowing the team to score a game-tying field goal. In extra time both teams scored touchdowns, but Plainfield North ran in a two-point conversion, setting off a wild celebration for the Tigers and eliciting anger and confusion from the Fenwick faithful. Several hours after the game, the IHSA issued a statement that stated the officials erred when they gave Plainfield North one final play after the passing penalty. Craig Anderson, the IHSA's executive director, offered \"my sincerest apologies\" to the Fenwick coaches, players and fans. On Monday morning, though, the IHSA board of directors determined that the association's bylaws did not allow a review of Fenwick's appeal. In its lawsuit, Fenwick had asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order, declaring that the game ended when the clock reached zero in the fourth quarter. ",

Anthony Kern tends bar at Blackbird on Nov. 10, 2016. One Off Hospitality, which owns the restaurant, is moving forward with major changes in its pay rules despite a court ruling that puts new Labor Department overtime standards on hold. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Employers that have been preparing for months to comply with a major change to overtime regulations \u2014 raising salaries, implementing time-tracking tools, restructuring promotion ladders \u2014 find themselves in an awkward limbo after a federal judge on Tuesday blocked the change a week before it was to take effect. \"I feel like a student who studied every day only to see the test canceled at the last minute,\" said Michael Santoro, president of Walker Sands, a Chicago-based public relations and digital marketing firm. The rule is delayed while a Texas federal judge considers whether to overturn a signature initiative of the Obama administration meant to put more money in middle-class pockets and prevent employers from overworking employees for free. Under the Labor Department's new overtime rule, finalized in May and scheduled to take effect Dec. 1, employers wouldn't be able to exempt workers who earn less than about $47,500 a year from overtime pay, a big change from the $23,660 threshold that has been in effect since 2004. That would make an estimated 4.2 million salaried U.S. employees newly eligible to get time-and-half for hours worked beyond 40 a week. The threshold would readjust every three years to reflect changes in average wages. (Tribune news services) On Tuesday, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas granted a nationwide preliminary injunction to block the rule's implementation until he decides whether the rule is unlawful. The injunction is a victory for the 21 states that sued the Labor Department arguing the rule is unconstitutional and, because it also applies to government workers, could deplete state budgets. No timeline was given for the judge's final decision. The Labor Department under President-elect Donald Trump could rescind the overtime rule \u2014 no congressional approval is required \u2014 but that wouldn't happen immediately because the agency would have to go through a rule-making process and public comment period that could take a long time. All of this might not matter to frustrated employers that already have made changes, as taking back an employee's raise is no good for morale. \"It's kind of hard to unring a bell,\" said Antonio Caldarone, a partner at Laner Muchin who represents management in wage and hour litigation. \"I don't see (employers) rolling it back or even delaying it.\" Walker Sands had started operating as though the new rule was in effect on Sept. 1, to ensure it was prepared, Santoro said. About a third of his 80 employees are affected by the new rule, most of them entry-level salaried public relations professionals who start at $38,000.

Some hourly workers may have their wages raised while other workers may move from salaried to hourly positions. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) \"When (the rule) was announced, it was a huge deal, it was like the apocalypse happened,\" Santoro said. As the company reviewed its employees' hours it realized the impact wouldn't be as severe as feared, because they weren't working too much overtime on a regular basis. Still, he took pains to comply, upgrading the time-tracking system so that managers got daily input on how many hours employees were working, instead of weekly as it had before. It allowed them to more easily offset long Mondays with short Fridays to keep people to 40 hours a week. Santoro, who didn't adjust anyone's salary and planned to pay overtime when the work warranted it, said the changes forced everyone to be more cognizant of time. The company is holding slightly fewer meetings as a result, and the meetings that do happen seem more productive, Santoro said. Still, the uncertainty of the overtime rule's fate bothers him. \"The majority of good businesses are ready for the change,\" Santoro said. \"We should reward those who properly prepared.\" ",

    "text": "Federal Authorities Investigate Teen's Fatal Shooting as a Hate Crime By ENJOLI FRANCIS Nov 23, 2016, 6:51 PM ET 0 Shares Star West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority William Pulliam, 62, has been charged in the shooting death of 15-year-old James Means. Federal authorities are investigating the slaying as a possible hate crime. 0 Shares Email Federal authorities said today they are reviewing the shooting death of a black teenager in West Virginia as a hate crime. On Monday around 8:45 p.m., according to the criminal complaint, Charleston police responded to a report of a shooting in East Charleston, Kanawha County. According to the complaint, James Means, 15, bumped into William Pulliam, 62, of East Charleston, and the two \"exchanged words.\" Pulliam then went into a store but when he came out and made his way home, he and Means again had a \"verbal dispute.\" Officer Accused of Shooting Unarmed Crash Victim 10 Times Pulliam admitted to shooting Means twice in the stomach with a .380 revolver \"because he felt threatened,\" according to the complaint. Means was taken to a hospital but later died. Pulliam expressed no remorse for the slaying, according to the criminal complaint, which also noted Pulliam said that after the shooting, he'd eaten dinner and visited a friend. \"The way I look at it, that's another piece of trash off the street,\" he said, according to the complaint. He has since denied making that comment. On Tuesday, he spoke to ABC affiliate WCHS-TV in Charleston, saying he feared for his life Monday night and that the shooting had nothing to do with race. Means is black and Pulliam is white. \"I don't care if they're white or black. Nobody is going to do me like that. It doesn't make any difference he's black,\" Pulliam said. Pulliam said that Means and two friends were taunting him that night. \"Believe me, I didn't want to kill anybody but you know, they are not going to kill me,\" he told WCHS-TV. \"I felt my life was in danger. I'm sorry but, I mean, I'm 62 years old. ... I work. I'm a good citizen. I don't do anything to anybody, never have done anything to anybody.\" In an email to ABC News, the U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed that federal authorities had been asked to review whether the shooting falls within the federal hate crimes statute. \"That review is in its early stages, and the fact that a review is being conducted should not be taken as any indication of what the review's outcome will be,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Ruby said. The hate crimes statute \"establishes a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for willfully using a firearm to kill another person because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion or national origin.\" Means' family also spoke out, saying they did not want friends or family to retaliate. \"I'm going to leave everything up to the courts to take care of this man and to do whatever they have to do to make him be punished as well as my son had to suffer and my family had to suffer through this,\" Means' mother, Nafia Adkins, told WCHS-TV . Pulliam faces first-degree murder charges. If found guilty, he could face life behind bars. A preliminary hearing was set for Dec. 1. 0 Shares ",

Kelly of the Marines, the former head of the United States Southern Command, which oversees the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba; David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general who was director of the C.I.A.; or, a particular long shot, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, who could be the lone Democrat in the cabinet after having briefly run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination last year. Choosing Mr. Petraeus, who resigned in 2012 in a scandal over his leaking of classified information, would be somewhat easier after Mr. Trump said he would not pursue a case against Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified emails on a private email server, one person close to the transition said. The debate over secretary of state is a microcosm of the balance Mr. Trump is trying to strike in all of his appointments \u2014 between loyalists who will appeal to his base and more mainstream Republicans, many of whom stridently opposed his candidacy. In Ms. DeVos, Ms. Haley and Mr. Carson, he is trying to appeal to several of these constituencies, from Midwestern ultraconservatives to the diverse society that Republicans have tried to reach, with mixed results. Mr. Trump\u2019s selections could blunt criticism that his early picks came from a homogeneous bloc of older, white men. If confirmed, Ms. Haley would step down as governor and be replaced by the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, who was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. Photo Ben Carson at Trump Tower on Tuesday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Mr. Carson is a familiar face to Americans after a Republican primary campaign in which he briefly rose to the top of the polls. Neither he nor Ms. Haley is particularly experienced for the posts they have been offered. Mr. Carson had even seemed to take himself out of the running for a cabinet position last week, with his friends putting out word that he had concluded he was not qualified to run a vast federal bureaucracy. Some pointed to Ms. Haley\u2019s experience as a legislator and trade ambassador for South Carolina as credentials for the United Nations post. John D. Negroponte, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush who opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, said Ms. Haley was an \u201cintriguing and very good choice.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cShe\u2019s not an ideologue,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll quickly grasp that there are aspects of the United Nations\u2019 work that can benefit the United States.\u201d Ms. DeVos, a former finance chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, won the support of Senator Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Senate Education Committee. He called her an \u201cexcellent choice.\u201d She favors charter schools , which are publicly funded but typically run independently of local school boards and teachers\u2019 unions, and school vouchers, which give students tax dollars to apply toward private-school tuition. Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, criticized the nomination, saying that Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts over the years had \u201cdone more to undermine public education than support students.\u201d \u201cShe has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers \u2014 which take away funding and local control from our public schools \u2014 to fund private schools at taxpayers\u2019 expense,\u201d she said. \u201cThese schemes do nothing to help our most vulnerable students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps.\u201d Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

More than 48 million people across the country are expected to hit the roads, skies and rails for the Thanksgiving holiday -- one that the Transportation Security Administration says could be one of the busiest on record. Transportation and security officials say they are prepared for the rush, but travelers should expect crowds no matter how they travel. Airlines for America , the nation's largest airline trade group, says today is projected to be the third busiest day of the travel period, with 2.55 million U.S. airline passengers. The Sunday and Monday following Thanksgiving could see 2.81 million and 2.64 million passengers, respectively. 3 Thanksgiving Travel Tips to Save Turkey Day So far, flights are generally arriving and departing on time. The airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles are expected to see the highest number of passengers this Thanksgiving travel period. On Wednesday morning, all three are indicating that flights are generally on time. Weather in Houston this morning delayed a small number of flights after the Federal Aviation Administration established a minor ground stop, but that is expected to clear up. Airlines will keep a close eye on winter weather near major travel hubs. If bad weather hits the big cities, it could have a ripple effect across the country. New York City experienced severe wind this week and FAA air traffic controllers will continue to monitor the weather conditions. Generally, when wind speeds reach 30 mph or higher, it is not safe for airlines to land and the controllers must close the runways. When winds reach 55 mph and up, FAA air traffic controllers will clear the tower. Weather is not only a threat to those in the skies; workers on the ground are also at risk. Amid Holiday Fears and Increased Security, NY Man in Terror Arrest According to AAA, 43.5 million Americans are planning a road trip this week.

John Mack, who served on the Board of Police Commissioners for eight years, voiced similar skepticism, saying he doubts the proposal would improve disciplinary reviews at the LAPD. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency sometimes for civilians to go overboard in giving officers the benefit of the doubt in cases of categorical use of force, or [officer-involved shootings], even when the facts and the evidence demonstrate otherwise,\u201d he said. The police union frequently puts its financial might behind its chosen candidates; in 2013, the league spent more than $1.5 million to support Wendy Greuel , who was defeated by Garcetti. Wesson\u2019s proposal was unveiled four months before the March election, which will feature contests for mayor, city attorney, city controller and eight council seats. A Wesson aide said the LAPD proposal was also signed by Councilman Joe Buscaino , a former police officer, and Councilman Curren Price , who represents part of South Los Angeles. The measure will be evaluated by a committee headed by Wesson, with a vote expected by mid-January.

Ryan (R-Wis.)\u00a0has lost no time in teeing up a favorite goal: gutting Medicare .\u00a0 In an interview with Fox News Channel only\u00a0days after the election, Ryan said:\u00a0\u201cObamacare... Bursting with the policymaking power that control of both houses of Congress and the White House gives Republicans , House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)\u00a0has lost no time in teeing up a favorite goal: gutting Medicare .\u00a0 In an interview with Fox News Channel only\u00a0days after the election, Ryan said:\u00a0\u201cObamacare... (Michael Hiltzik) Now, however, as is the case for prescription drugs covered by other programs, the cost to retirees is skyrocketing. The cost of medicine per Medicare beneficiary rose 8.4% annually between 2013 and 2015, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group that focuses on national health issues. That was more than twice as fast as the average 3.6% annual rise between 2006 and 2013, the group said. In a Nov. 3 speech to pharmaceutical executives gathered at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Washington, D.C., Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the recent price hikes on dozens of drugs \u201cunsustainable.\u201d \u201cThe more data that\u2019s revealed,\u201d Slavitt told the executives, \u201cthe more bad actors you find, and I\u2019m telling you now: it\u2019s too many.\u201d At a campaign rally on Jan. 25 in Farmington, N.H., Donald Trump told a crowd of hundreds of supporters that if elected he would seek to allow Medicare to negotiate on drug prices. He said such a change could save billions of dollars a year. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it. Why? Because of the drug companies,\u201d Trump said then. President-elect Trump\u2019s staff did not return emails asking whether he still supported the change. His four-page policy statement on reforming the health system does not mention it. The drug industry vigorously opposes any change. The companies say the current system of depending on insurers to negotiate with manufacturers is working to save on costs. \u201cLarge, powerful purchasers negotiate discounts and rebates directly with manufacturers, saving money for both beneficiaries and taxpayers,\u201d said Allyson Funk, a spokeswoman for the industry\u2019s trade group, known as PhRMA. She said proposals to change the program could end up \u201cdriving up premiums, reducing choice and restricting coverage.\u201d Funk pointed to a recent report paid for by PhRMA that found that actual medicine costs to patients and the government in the program officially called Medicare Part D were 35% below list prices in a dozen categories of widely used drugs.\u00a0The report attributed the cost savings to discounts and rebates negotiated by insurers. Earlier this month, however, Medicare officials released data showing that actual rebates and discounts were far less than those in PhRMA\u2019s report. Officials said the Medicare drug insurers received $16 billion in rebates in 2014, or an average rebate of 17.5% off the list price, and that\u00a0the program\u2019s rebates were generally lower than what private employers\u2019 and other insurance programs received. \u201cPart of the reason for this is that Medicare cannot harness its full purchasing power to negotiate for rebates across all Part D plans,\u201d they wrote in the Nov. 14 report. Medicare\u2019s analysis also showed how the cost to taxpayers\u00a0for\u00a0the drug program is surging as prices continue to escalate. Taxpayers pick up 80% of a beneficiary\u2019s medicine costs once they exceed a certain threshold. Total costs for the Medicare drug benefit above that threshold surged by 85% from 2013 to 2015 to $51.3 billion, according to the report. In 2017, taxpayers will cover\u00a080% of drug\u00a0costs after beneficiaries have paid $4,950 out-of-pocket. The drug that Roberta Solar needs shows how industry competition has failed to hold down some prices. Ursodiol is a generic that has been sold for decades. It was available for a list price as low as 45 cents a capsule until May 2014 when one of the firms \u2014\u00a0Lannett Co. \u2014 raised its price per pill to $5.10. Lannett\u2019s competitors quickly followed with their own price increases, with most offering the drug for about $5 a capsule. ",

The president said the country would keep moving forward, defined by the values and ideals that have been a light to all humanity. \u201cWe have a lot more in common than divides us,\u201d he said. The light-hearted ceremony featured Iowa-raised turkeys Tater and Tot. Tot won the White House Twitter poll, so he was the official recipient of the pardon, but both got a reprieve. Mr. Obama\u2019s own twist on the tradition is the pardoning of two turkeys instead of one, which he\u2019s done since 2009, at the request of Sasha and Malia.\u00a0 At the official pardoning following Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks, Tot flapped his wings, to the delight of the president, who exclaimed, \u201cFreedom! Freedom!\u201d\u00a0 For the Twitter poll on the turkey pardon, the White House blog provided a biography for each bird to help in the decision. Tater\u2019s favorite snack is worms, his favorite song is \u201cMe Too\u201d by Meghan Trainor, he has a \u201cstrong\u201d gobble style, and he walks with a swagger. Whitehouse.gov Tot, on the other hand, prefers tomato slices and is more of a Justin Timberlake kind of bird, who likes \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling.\u201d His walk is described as a \u201crelaxed saunter.\u201d Whitehouse.gov Presidents as far back as Abraham Lincoln have spared turkeys.

The driver, Johnthony Walker, 24, deviated from his designated route before the bus swerved off the road Monday afternoon , investigators said Wednesday. Walker is also charged with reckless endangerment and reckless driving after his bus smashed into a mailbox, a utility pole and a tree on Talley Road. None of the six children who died has been officially identified. Five other children remained in hospitals Wednesday; police wouldn't identify them or provide their conditions. According to an arrest report, witnesses told investigators that Walker was driving \"well above\" the 30-mph speed limit with 37 children from Woodmore Elementary School on board. Related: Speed Eyed in Chattanooga Bus Crash That Killed 5 and Injured 30 Christopher Hart, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a news conference Wednesday that investigators had \"ascertained that Talley Road was not on the designated route for that school bus.\" Johnthony Walker, 24, is charged with five counts of vehicular homicide in Monday's bus accident in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hamilton County Sheriff's Office Hart said that the investigation had just begun and that it wasn't known why Walker \u2014 who received his commercial driver's license only seven months ago \u2014 had left his normal route. Chattanooga police Sgt. Austin Garrett, meanwhile, said at a news conference Wednesday that blood tests conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation showed that Walker had no drugs or alcohol in his system. And he confirmed that Chattanooga police investigated a \"minor wreck\" that involved Walker in September. He gave no details. Investigators are reviewing video from multiple angles recorded from the front, back and side of the bus, he said. Garrett then addressed news reports that Walker allegedly asked his passengers Monday morning \"whether they were prepared to die.\" \"None of the witnesses we have spoken with has that information,\" he said, \"but we have also not interviewed all witnesses yet.\" Rescue officials work at the scene of a school bus crash involving several fatalities in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Nov. 21. Chattanooga Fire Dept via Reuters Specifically, he said, investigators haven't spoken to any of the 32 surviving children on the bus, but he said \"we will in the future.\" The Hamilton County Board of Education confirmed in a statement Wednesday that it had received complaints recently about Walker \"and the way he operated his bus.\" Related: Chattanooga Mom Says She Complained About Driver in Deadly Crash It said the complaints were forwarded to Durham School Services, the private company that is contracted to provide bus services for the school system, for whom Walker worked. Hart, of the NTSB, said Durham was operating under a \"conditional\" federal safety rating, meaning some unspecified problems had been uncovered in the past, but that they had been resolved satisfactorily, in August 2015. He said investigators were going back over Durham's oversight and crash history. In a brief video statement, David A. Duke, the company's chief executive, expressed deep grief and promised to provide any support necessary for the families of the children \"who were taken from their families with so much life that was taken away.\" His voice choking with emotion, Duke said he was a father and grandfather, himself. \"I can't fathom the anguish of the parents whose children were involved in this horrific accident and that involved one of my company's buses,\" he said. \"I'm deeply sorry.\" Alex Johnson ",

Roeder was convicted in 2010 of murdering Kansas abortion provider Dr. George Tiller. Scott Roeder appears in court in Wichita, Kan., on July 7. Roeder was convicted in 2010 of murdering Kansas abortion provider Dr. George Tiller. (Bo Rader / Wichita Eagle) Associated Press \u00a0The man who seven years ago ambushed and fatally shot one of the few U.S. doctors performing late-term abortions was given a more lenient sentence Wednesday of at least 25 years in prison before becoming eligible for parole. At a surprise resentencing hearing, prosecutors withdrew their request that Scott Roeder serve at least 50 years before parole eligibility. Roeder also was sentenced to an additional two years for aggravated assault for threatening two church ushers as he fled. Roeder was convicted in January 2010 of premeditated first-degree murder for killing Dr. George Tiller . On May 31, 2009, Roeder shot Tiller\u00a0 in a Wichita church foyer as the doctor served as an usher. \u00a0 Tiller's murder was among the most notorious acts \u00a0of violence against abortion providers since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized the procedure nationwide in 1973. It alarmed the abortion rights community and came as numerous conservative states, including Kansas, passed restrictions making it harder for women to obtain abortions. The hearing Wednesday came just days before Roeder was set to go before a jury on Monday for what had been anticipated to be a two-week sentencing hearing. Roeder's original life sentence with no chance of parole for 50 years was among many vacated after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that juries, not judges, must decide whether to increase punishment. Roeder, who looked much thinner than at his initial sentencing in 2010, was subdued throughout the proceeding and chose not make a courtroom statement before the judge pronounced his sentence. That was in contrast to the previous sentencing hearing that Roeder used as a forum to espouse at length on his anti-abortion views in an effort to justify his killing the doctor to save unborn babies. Sedgwick County Dist. Atty. Marc Bennett said that the decision not to seek the added time was reached by prosecutors after examining the 58-year-old Roeder's health, his expected life span and the likelihood of whether he would ever be released from prison alive. He did not elaborate on Roeder's health issues. Tiller's family was also consulted, he said.

Ebenhack, AP) President-elect Donald Trump has chosen education reformer Betsy DeVos to become U.S. Secretary of Education. Trump said DeVos is \"a brilliant and passionate education advocate\" who will help him \"reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families.\" Here are five things to know about DeVos: She supports charter schools, private school vouchers and other \u201cschool choice\u201d proposals that Republicans love DeVos, 58, is mostly known as a champion of school choice. In a 2013 interview with the Philanthropy Roundtable , she said, \u201cI\u2019m most focused on educational choice. But, thinking more broadly, what we are trying to do is tear down the mindset that assigns students to a school based solely on the ZIP Code of their family\u2019s home. We advocate instead for as much freedom as possible.\u201d Her organization, the American Federation for Children,\u00a0is\u00a0the 501(c)(4) arm of the 501(c)(3) non-profit group the Alliance for School Choice. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a bitter political rival of Trump, praised DeVos' appointment on Wednesday, saying she is \"an outstanding pick for Secretary of Education ... She has a long and distinguished history championing the right of all parents to choose schools that best ensure their children\u2019s success. Her allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next.\" She drives teachers' unions crazy\u00a0 The American Federation for Children ( AFC ) sounds a lot like the American Federation of Teachers. But it is not a children's union. In fact, the organization, created by DeVos in 2010 and based in Washington, D.C., drives unions crazy. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten on Wednesday called DeVos' pick \"the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education.\" Weingarten added,\u00a0\u201cIn nominating DeVos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding and destroying public education in America. DeVos has no meaningful experience in the classroom or in our schools. The sum total of her involvement has been spending her family\u2019s wealth in an effort to dismantle public education in Michigan. Every American should be concerned that she would impose her reckless and extreme ideology on the nation.\" She is married to the son of one of the founders of Amway DeVos\u2019 father-in-law is Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, whose worth is estimated at $5.1 billion, according to Forbes . She co-founded a Michigan charter school that specializes in aviation DeVos and her husband, Richard M. DeVos Jr., are co-founders of a Michigan charter school built around \u201ctheir passion for both education and aviation. West Michigan Aviation Academy opened its doors in 2010. It is located on the grounds of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, Mich. DeVos' husband's family owns the Orlando Magic basketball team; he ran for governor of Michigan in 2006 Richard DeVos' family bought the franchise in 1991, and DeVos was, for a short time, the team's president. A former member of the Michigan State Board of Education, Mr. DeVos was the Republican nominee for Michigan governor in 2006, running against Democratic incumbent Gov. Jennifer Granholm. During the election, Granholm claimed that under DeVos\u2019 leadership, Amway cut 1,400 jobs in Michigan and shipped them to China. DeVos said Amway had expanded operations to sell products in China, which required them by law to open a Chinese factory. DeVos lost to Granholm by 14 points.

Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Office officials announced Wednesday that William Riley Gaul, a freshman wide receiver, was arrested in connection with the death of Emma Walker.\u00a0 William Riley Gaul, left, and Emma Walker, right WVLT Sheriff\u2019s officials said Walker was found dead of a gunshot wound inside her house Monday morning. Officials said evidence at the scene indicted Gaul fired shots into her bedroom from outside the house while she slept. Walker was a student at Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, where she was reportedly a cheerleader. Maryville\u2019s football roster indicates Gaul graduated from Central High. Jenny Weldon, Walker\u2019s aunt,\u00a0 told the Knoxville News Sentinel \u00a0the girl had ended a romantic relationship with Gaul in recent weeks, but he refused to accept the breakup. \u201cShe had chosen to move on,\u201d Weldon told the paper. \u201cHe refused to accept it. He chose not to accept her wishes.\u201d Weldon described her niece to the paper as \u00a0a\u201cbeautiful soul\u201d who was looking forward to graduating high school so she could begin studying to be a neonatal nurse. \u201cOur student was a wonderful young lady, a cheerleader and honor student with a promising future, whose life was cut too short, too soon,\u201d Central High School Principal Michael Reynolds said in a statement Wednesday released to the paper. \u201cMaryville College is cooperating fully with the Knox County Sheriff\u2019s Department in this investigation. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim\u2019s family and friends and other individuals affected by this tragedy,\u201d Maryville athletic department spokesman Chris Cannon said in a statement. Maryville coach Shaun Hayes said through a spokesman that Gaul has been dismissed from the football program. Maryville already has completed its season. Officials said Gaul was being held at the Knox County Jail on $750,000 bond. A preliminary hearing has been set for Dec. 2. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "(Amina Khan) Scientists had\u00a0long thought that no large earthquakes could occur on a so-called \u201ccreeping\u201d section of the San Andreas fault in San Benito and Monterey counties. Creeping sections of the faults generally produce small earthquakes, like those magnitude 5 or less, but were not thought to produce\u00a0large ones.\u00a0 \u201cLocked\u201d sections of faults, meanwhile, are the ones we generally worry about, gathering stress over decades or centuries, and building strain to be released in a catastrophic\u00a0earthquake someday.\u00a0 Researchers had long believed that the central San Andreas\u2019\u00a0creeping section essentially acted as\u00a0a barrier for the\u00a0fault, dividing it into two sections. Such a division would have meant that the same\u00a0San Andreas earthquake could not be unleashed on both\u00a0Los Angeles County and the Bay Area at the same time.\u00a0 But recent computer simulations show that large earthquakes can sometimes punch through parts of a fault that are creeping. Yet something that is possible is not all that probable.\u00a0 An earthquake that stretches from all ends of the San Andreas fault simultaneously\u00a0is probably not going\u00a0to happen in our lifetime. Such a quake probably happens about every 150,000 years on average, \u201cso it is extremely unlikely,\u201d Page said.\u00a0 Even a relatively shorter\u00a0earthquake on the San Andreas \u2014 from Point Reyes in the San Francisco Bay Area to the Mojave Desert in Southern California \u2014 would likely occur once every 2,500 years.\u00a0 The government\u2019s model, called the Third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, or UCERF3, included earthquakes that were theoretically possible, even though they were not particularly likely.\u00a0 \u201cIt is important to include many possibilities, so we won\u2019t be surprised by an earthquake that occurs but was not included in the model,\u201d Page said. \u201cThere are a lot of \u2018surprising\u2019 earthquakes in seismology. For example, the 2011 magnitude 9 earthquake that hit Japan \u2026\u00a0was not included in the Japanese hazard models at the time. But it still happened.\u201d How strong is \u2018disaster culture\u2019 in earthquake-prone L.A.? \u00bb A magnitude 8 earthquake would particularly threaten large structures, based on the physics of earthquake waves, and could be problematic for large bridges or skyscrapers. A more likely scenario in California\u2019s future would be a 7.8 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault that ruptures from the Salton Sea through the Inland Empire and Los Angeles County. A government estimate of that Southern California earthquake scenario, known as ShakeOut, estimated a death toll of some 2,000 people, 50,000 injuries and $200 billion in damage and other losses. Experts projected that five steel-frame high-rise buildings would collapse, as would 50 brittle concrete buildings, either completely or partially. About 900 unreinforced brick buildings would be irreparably damaged in this scenario.\u00a0 In the Bay Area, scientists are more worried about a magnitude 7 earthquake\u00a0on the Hayward fault, which lies underneath the densely populated cities of Berkeley, Oakland, Hayward and Fremont, and stretches from Silicon Valley to San Pablo Bay.\u00a0 The\u00a0San Andreas fault\u2019s southernmost stretch has not ruptured since about 1680 \u2014 more than 330 years ago, scientists estimate. And a big earthquake happens on average in this area\u00a0once every 150 or 200 years, so experts think the region is long overdue for a major quake.

The trucks are rolling in to protect an expected crowd of three million. As the parade balloons begin to take shape so is the city\u2019s security plan. Metal barricades will line the nearly three mile long route, and canines will sniff for explosives as more than 3,000 uniformed officers watch the crowds. One woman told CBS News she prefers the additional security.\u00a0 \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d she said.\u00a0 New York police officers block traffic from entering 56th Street at 6th Avenue along the Macy\u2019s Parade route, except for residential and business vehicles, a block from Trump Tower, Wednesday Nov. 23, 2016, in New York.\u00a0 Bebeto Matthews, AP Wednesday afternoon, 81 sand-filled sanitation trucks started blocking intersections to prevent a terrorist attack like the one in Nice, France last July. The radical Islamic terror group, ISIS, recently named the parade an \u00a0 \u201cexcellent target\u201d in its online magazine. Along with its network of security cameras, police have established limited pedestrian entrance points, and created a web of street closures around the parade\u2019s final blocks. \u201cNYPD is more than ready to handle anything that is going on around us and to work with everyone to make sure it\u2019s a safe and fun day for everyone who attends,\u201d said NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio.\u00a0 Workers help to inflate balloons for the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016.\u00a0 Seth Wenig, AP Plain clothes officers will also be out here, monitoring the crowd using radiation detectors.\u00a0 One additional security challenge this year, the president-elect\u2019s high-rise residence is just a block from the parade route. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

A weapon has not been recovered and the suspect in custody has not been charged. \"We're trying to put the pieces together,\" he added. Detroit Police Chief James Craig Rose was on duty around 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday when he radioed to say he was investigating possible thefts of navigation systems from vehicles and that he was about to speak to someone on a bike. When other officers arrived on the scene, they found Rose injured on the ground. After the shooting, several dozen armed officers combed the area surrounding the campus hunting for a suspect.

Cary Glazer told The Associated Press he had a physical run-in with the suspect five years ago. Glazer said he was patrolling the campus in 2011 when the man walking in the street swore at him and told the sergeant to get out of the way. Glazer said he got out of his car and the pair struggled until other officers arrived. \"He wanted to fight \u2014 he wanted to fight an officer,\" Glazer told The Associated Press. Wilson said they still don't know what the motive was for the shooting, \"whether it was an ambush or something different.\" He cited four recent incidents around the country in which law enforcement officers were shot, adding, \"That's something that's crossed our minds.\" Wayne State has more than 27,000 students and is located in the heart of Detroit.

    "text": "(Tribune news services) DeVos, from Michigan, told The Associated Press in July, \"A lot of the things he has said are very off-putting and concerning.\" On Wednesday, Trump said of his UN selection: \"Gov. Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country.\" She said she loved her South Carolina post but \"when the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed.\" While Republicans praised Haley's selection, DeVos faced criticism from left and right. The president of the National Education Association, Lily Eskelsen Garcia, said in a statement that for years DeVos \"has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers \u2014 which take away funding and local control from our public schools \u2014 to fund private schools at taxpayers' expense.\" And Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, tweeted, \"Trump has chosen the most ideological, anti-public ed nominee since the creation of the Dept of Education.\" At the same time, some conservatives warned that the longtime Republican donor, who has spent millions of dollars \u2014 along with her husband \u2014 to promote candidates who favor charter schools and school vouchers, also supports the Common Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign. Conservatives already were grappling with Trump's Tuesday concession that climate change may be connected to human activity and his reversal of a campaign vow to pursue a criminal investigation into Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. DeVos addressed criticism head-on, posting a \"Q&A\" statement that said directly about Common Core: \"I am not a supporter \u2014 period.\" \"I do support high standards,\" she said. But along the way Common Core \"got turned into a federal boondoggle.\" Just two weeks ago, Trump shocked the political world \u2014 including many in his own party \u2014 by winning the presidential contest. The billionaire New Yorker has yet to take any formal steps to separate from his international business empire as experts in both parties warn of potential conflicts of interest. Trump will be sworn into office in less than 60 days. Beyond his Cabinet, he must fill hundreds of high-level administration posts. Spokesman Jason Miller said Trump now is focusing on his choice for secretary of state in particular. Among those under consideration: former New York Mayor and Trump loyalist Rudy Giuliani and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, formerly an outspoken Trump critic. After secretary of state, the UN ambassador is the highest-profile diplomatic position, often serving as the voice for U.S. positions on the international stage. As for DeVos, her family has been active in Republican politics for decades, especially as donors. Her husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and a former president of the company. The American Federation for Children Action Fund, which DeVos chairs, and its state-affiliated PACs invested in 121 races in 12 states in the general election, spending spent $210,000 to support \"pro-school choice\" candidates in Oklahoma alone. \"Under her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\" Trump said. DeVos said in her own statement, \"The status quo in education is not acceptable.\" Associated Press ",

DETROIT \u2014\u00a0A police officer who was shot in the head while on patrol near a university campus in Detroit Tuesday night has died, Wayne State University officials confirmed.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a tragedy felt by all of us -- Collin and his family and friends, his fianc\u00e9e, and our campus and community,\u201d WSU said in a statement. \u201cPlease keep Collin and his fianc\u00e9e and family in your thoughts and prayers.\u201d The officer involved in the off-campus shooting is 29-year-old Collin Rose. Please keep Officer Rose in your thoughts and prayers tonight. pic.twitter.com/Zj4mMPpjq3 \u2014 Wayne State Univ (@waynestate) November 23, 2016 Wayne State Police Chief Anthony Holt previously said a suspect is being interrogated in the attack Tuesday evening on 29-year-old officer Collin Rose.\u00a0 Rose was a five-year veteran of the department who worked in the canine unit. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said Rose was on duty Tuesday evening when he radioed to say he was investigating possible thefts of navigation systems from cars and SUVs, and was about to speak to someone apparently on a bike. Officers who arrived on the scene found the officer injured on the ground, Craig said. Detroit Deputy Police Chief Steve Dolunt said Rose\u2019s partner arrived within minutes of the shooting and found \u201ca bicycle laying in the middle of the street,\u201d\u00a0 CBS Detroit reported . Authorities say ambush-style shootings on Sunday left\u00a0 one police officer dead in San Antonio, \u00a0Texas, and another\u00a0 wounded in St. Louis, Missouri, \u00a0underscoring fears in the law enforcement community that the uniform is increasingly becoming a target. But authorities said Wednesday Rose was probably not ambushed.\u00a0 One-third of police officers shot to death on the job this year were purposely targeted by their assailant, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\u00a0 But Holt said that wasn\u2019t the case in Detroit on Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was an ambush,\u201d Holt said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he was specifically targeted\u201d because of his uniform.\u00a0 Dolant said a man considered \u201ca person of interest\u201d was in custody but that it\u2019s unknown whether he was the shooter. Dolunt said the officer was not shot with his own gun and that police were still looking for the weapon used. A Wayne State University sergeant in Detroit says he had a physical run-in five years ago with the person of interest.\u00a0 Sgt. Cary Glazer said Wednesday he was patrolling around the campus in 2011 when a man walking in the street swore at him and told him to get out of the way. Glazer says he got out of his car and the pair struggled until other officers arrived.\u00a0 Glazer says the man \u201cwanted to fight a police officer.\u201d\u00a0 The man was charged with resisting and obstructing a police officer after the incident with Glazer.\u00a0 The person of interest was also charged in 2009 with another alleged assault on an officer,\u00a0 reported the Detroit Free Press . Shortly after the shooting, which occurred around 6:30 p.m., several dozen armed officers were seen in the residential area of Woodbridge within two blocks of the campus in what law enforcement described as a massive manhunt. Police were searching for an African-American man in his 40s with a full beard, a university statement posted on the school\u2019s website said Tuesday night. It added he was wearing a white T-shirt with white and black lettering, a skull cap and a brown jacket. Using that description and talking to residents near the scene, police took the person of interest into custody without incident about three blocks from where the shooting happened, Dolunt said. Wayne State has more than 27,000 students and is located in the heart of Detroit. Wilson said the school employs around 65 officers, some of whom help patrol areas around the campus. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Kushner denies pushing Christie out of Trump transition Dustin Racioppi, The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record 5:20 p.m. EST November 23, 2016 237 Shares Share Get to know Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner. Time Jared Kushner, the influential son-in-law of Donald Trump , did not push New Jersey's governor and his allies out from the president-elect's White House transition effort, he said in a rare interview posted online. Since Gov. Chris Christie was replaced Friday as transition chairman after six months helping to assemble Trump's administration, multiple reports have quoted anonymous sources saying that Kushner, a 35-year-old real-estate developer and owner of the New York Observer, led his ouster. Kushner reportedly harbored ill will toward Christie, who as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey prosecuted Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, in 2004, in a sordid scheme that exposed political corruption by New Jersey's largest Democratic donor and derailed the elder Kushner's nomination as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Charles Kushner's guilty plea of filing of false tax returns, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and retaliating against a cooperating witness was a major victory for Christie in building the resume that he touted during his ascendance to the governorship. Trump: My son-in-law could broker Middle East peace \"It is incredibly humiliating for a man of Mr. Kushner's power and prestige to say in an open court, to say three times, guilty as charged,\" Christie said during a news conference at the time. But in the interview with Forbes \u00a0magazine, published Tuesday, Jared Kushner said any resentments he may have about Christie sending his father to prison were put aside around the time Trump named Christie, a friend since 2002, as his transition chairman. \"Six months ago Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together,\" Kushner said. \"The media has speculated on a lot of different things, and since I don't talk to the press, they go as they go, but I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\" Trump son-in-law Kushner reportedly settling Christie score in transition Reports also have said that Kushner and Trump were unhappy with the progress of the transition under Christie's leadership and that the conviction of two former Christie aides in the George Washington Bridge lane-closure trial earlier this month hurt the governor's standing with Trump. In a radio interview Monday night, Christie called his relationship with Trump \"great.\" He said he talked to Trump about the trial as it unfolded over seven weeks in a federal courtroom in Newark, N.J., \"and I told him what was going on and he believed me.\" Even though Kushner denied playing a role in Christie's demotion from chairman to one of six vice chairmen of the transition, it is still a mystery why the governor and has allies were dismissed. His former chief of staff, Rich Bagger, and top adviser Bill Palatucci were demoted and named advisers while other Christie allies and hires were removed. Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, has been a steady influence on the president-elect throughout his tumultuous campaign and may serve in some capacity in the new administration. Trump: Jared Kushner could help make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. \u2014 Elisabeth Bumiller (@BumillerNYT) November 22, 2016 Trump said Tuesday that Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, is unlikely to work in a formal role but may be involved in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, according to The New York Times , whose editors and reporters tweeted portions of an interview with the president-elect as it happened at the newspaper's headquarters. \"There's a lot of people who have been asking me to get involved in a more official capacity,\" Kushner told Forbes. \"I just have to think about what that means for my family, for my business and make sure it\u2019d be the right thing for a multitude of reasons.\" Follow\u00a0Dustin Racioppi on Twitter:\u00a0 @dracioppi ",

A genealogy website reunited them. (Photo: Carol Lee Stephens/Wild Blossom Photography) KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Every year, especially on Mother\u2019s Day and on her birthday, she wondered about her. Kimberly Sebeck, a\u00a0doula\u00a0and childbirth educator whose life\u2019s work is coaching other women into motherhood, wondered about the one who gave her up \u2014\u00a0young and unmarried, really, was all she knew. Cheri Hahn DeSalvo wondered about the infant daughter she held in her arms for less than an hour. What was her name? Did she pass her in the aisles of the grocery story, at the local ice-cream stand? Was she happy? Did she even know she was adopted? This mother-son love story started with a cute slap Through the years, both women posted on adoption boards and forums and scoured the Internet for clues, knowing virtually nothing except each heart\u2019s longing to find the other. A yearning heart can\u2019t pluck another out of all the thousands in the country, like a needle in a haystack, with only the most basic of details: a scared teenager, a baby girl\u00a0born on Oct. 8, 1972, in a Florida emergency room. But DNA can. Cheri DeSalvo and Kimberly Sebeck pose for a photo session in the Cove at Concord Park. DeSalvo gave Sebeck up for adoption as an infant. A genealogy website reunited them. \u00a0(Photo: Carol Lee Stephens/Wild Blossom Photography) A special gift It was one of Sebeck\u2019s clients who bought her the test from\u00a0Ancestry.com. A history professor with a focus on genealogy, she was shocked her doula knew nothing about her past. A few days before Christmas, she presented Sebeck with a gift bag containing a plastic vial. Sebeck, 44, filled the vial with saliva, mailed it in, and a few weeks later learned her ancestors were primarily French Mediterranean, likely from the Iberian Peninsula. But then Ancestry.com offered another option: You can find out if your DNA is similar to anyone else\u2019s in our files! Sebeck hesitated, then paid for the service. \u201cAnd I had an \u2018extremely close match\u2019 \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s what they call it,\u201d she said, \u201can older man, in his 60s, in South Dakota\u201d Ancestry.com said was \u201ca first cousin or closer.\u201d Sebeck\u2019s adoptive parents were always open about her adoption and gave her as much information as they had about her birth family. But hers was a closed adoption in the 1970s. Her parents were told only that the girl was an unmarried teen; they never even\u00a0saw her. Adoption registries turned up nothing. Kimberly Sebeck and brother Danny Zona. Zona only learned in May that he had a sister and visited her in October when he evacuated his Daytona home during Hurricane Matthew. \u00a0(Photo: Kimberly Sebeck) When Kimberly was 25, she paid a service for \u201cnon-identifying information.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t give me much, but it matched up with the story we had been told: teenage mom, surprise birth, she knew she was pregnant but didn\u2019t get any prenatal care and didn\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d said Sebeck, whose family moved to Tennessee from Florida in 1984. \u201cI was always of the opinion (adoption) was a magical gift. I didn\u2019t know the circumstances surrounding it, so I obviously felt kind of bad about that, but I mostly had a positive spin on it. \u2026 (Growing up), I just made up stories she was a princess.\u201d She tried, on her own, to work out who the man on Ancestry.com might be. \u201cI saw his mother and saved her picture to my computer and said, \u2018I\u2019m related to her,\u2019\u201d Sebeck said. The physical resemblance was obvious. It took her 2\u00bd months to get up the nerve to send the man an email. It said she hoped she wasn\u2019t intruding, listed the few details of her adoption she knew, apologized if her message was shocking or hurtful. On Mother\u2019s Day this year, after celebrating with daughter Andin McLaughlin,\u00a0Sebeck posted a bittersweet message to her Facebook page, lamenting a sometimes-strained relationship with her adoptive mother and knowing nothing about her biological mother. \u201cI'm quite conflicted on Mother's Day,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAll I can say, though, is that I see amazing mothers every day. Ones who struggle. Ones who seem to breeze by. Ones who have heartache. Ones who find the true meaning of mothering in their journey with their children ... . Which is how I feel about my own child. \u2026 I know that my child is worth more than anything. Anything. Being a mother myself ... indescribable.\u201d 'I was swept along' DeSalvo was 15 and pregnant in 1972, and she told only her closest friend, and then only at the end. She hid her pregnancy under then-fashionable\u00a0billowy peasant shirts and hid her \u201chead in the sand,\u201d she said. \u201cI sort of went into a state of denial. \u2026 Looking back now, I\u2019m perplexed.\u201d DeSalvo\u2019s parents learned she was pregnant only after she went into labor and gave birth in a hospital emergency room. She didn\u2019t tell the birth father, her then-boyfriend and \u201cfirst love,\u201d whose family she described as very conservative. Her parents, reeling from the shock, immediately arranged for adoption. \u201cI was swept along \u2026 I did not argue, as I believed it was probably for the best,\u201d DeSalvo said. \u201cMy hope was that she\u2019d find a mom and dad, a good, \u2018normal\u2019 family.\u201d For decades, she clung to scraps of memory from that day, the daughter she held only in the ambulance, riding from the small hospital where she gave birth to another with a labor-and-delivery unit. \u201cI remember her dark hair, lots of it,\u201d DeSalvo said. \u201cHad I been able to name her, she would have been Cassandra Lee or Tara Marie. I remember it was sunny out, and a beautiful Sunday morning. I remember pain, physical and emotional, confusion, and fear of my parents\u2019 reaction. I remember being very drugged and just wanting to sleep.\u201d DeSalvo\u2019s parents, now deceased,\u00a0never spoke of the baby, though DeSalvo believes that had it happened in the modern time, they might have kept the girl and helped their daughter raise her. \u201cWhen I saw her (Facebook) profile picture, I knew she was my daughter \u2014 no DNA test results needed.\u201d Cheri Hahn DeSalvo She married young \u2014\u00a0not to her first boyfriend \u2014\u00a0and had a son two years and seven months after the baby girl\u2019s birth, the joy of pregnancy and motherhood and\u00a0her son\u2019s milestones tempered with an underlying sense of loss. \u201cI always felt so sad that I was not sharing her life and that I\u2019d probably always wonder \u2018What if?\u2019\u201d DeSalvo said. \u201cWhen I\u2019d see a female child approximately her age, I\u2019d wonder if maybe it was her. I\u2019d often wonder about things like her first tooth, her first steps, her first everything. I would sometimes imagine if she had a personality like my son\u2019s, or if she looked like me. \u2026 Every year on her birthday, I\u2019d wonder if she was OK. Where was she? Was she happy?\u201d DeSalvo had never told her son he had a sister, though she told his father and, later, her second husband. She eventually confided to both sisters that she\u2019d given up a baby girl, but she never told her two brothers. Then, in May, her oldest brother forwarded Sebeck\u2019s email to all the siblings, asking if any of them knew what it was about. \u201cI was totally shocked,\u201d DeSalvo said. \u201cI had a ton of emotions run through me: surprise, elation. I never allowed myself to believe it would happen.\u201d Her brothers were supportive. Her son was excited, as was her stepson. Her husband was thrilled \u2014\u00a0for years, he\u2019d tried to get DeSalvo to hire a private investigator to find her daughter, but she was worried about intruding into the life of someone who might not even know she existed. Both DeSalvo and Sebeck were painfully aware not every birth-family reunion has a fairy-tale ending. DeSalvo sat down at the computer and looked up Sebeck. \u201cWhen I saw her (Facebook) profile picture, I knew she was my daughter \u2014\u00a0no DNA test results needed,\u201d DeSalvo said. \u201cI had my brother give her my Facebook page, so she could check me out. \u2026 I waited a day or two, then emailed her Mother\u2019s Day evening.\u201d 'It was like a warm hug' Their first phone conversation was four hours long. In it, they learned one reason they had trouble finding each other: Sebeck\u2019s birth certificate listed the hospital she and DeSalvo were taken to, not the hospital where DeSalvo had actually given birth. Soon \u201cwe were talking every day that she was off work and I was off work,\u201d Sebeck said. \u201cAnd when we talked, it was never less than three hours.\u201d Sebeck\u2019s husband, Derek, a social worker, commented on how alike their voices sound on the phone. They both love animals. They\u2019re voracious readers. Their political and philosophical ideas match, and they both love and use all types of social media. One catch: \u201cWhen she said she didn\u2019t like coffee, I said, \u2018Are you SURE you\u2019re my mom?\u2019\u201d Sebeck said, laughing. \u201cMy main worry was that she\u2019d be angry with me, or that she wouldn\u2019t want a relationship \u2014\u00a0only medical information,\u201d DeSalvo said. \u201cI did worry about her personality \u2014\u00a0would she be racist or something similar? But even so, I would have welcomed contact. Happily, she\u2019s perfect.\u201d In August, with Sebeck unable to leave town because she was on call for births, DeSalvo and her husband made the 13-hour drive from their South Florida home to Knoxville to meet Sebeck, her husband and Andin, 19 \u2014\u00a0DeSalvo\u2019s first grandchild. That was love at first sight on both ends, DeSalvo and Sebeck said. Both husbands videoed DeSalvo's and Sebeck's first reunion. \u201cIt was like a warm hug you\u2019ve been waiting for your whole life,\u201d Sebeck said. \u201cIt could be weird to meet someone who is, essentially, a stranger, yet she didn\u2019t feel like a stranger anymore. It was just amazing. It just felt normal and right.\u201d Both love\u00a0nature, and they spent six days together walking in parks, in the mountains, downtown, eating out or just sitting at Sebeck\u2019s house, talking. One day, Sebeck called a client, a professional\u00a0photographer with whom she\u2019d bartered a session, and asked if she could take photos of their family.\u00a0Photos from that session\u00a0now cover a wall in DeSalvo\u2019s Florida home. Sebeck said her adoptive family was surprised the reunion happened so quickly, but happy for her. DeSalvo said her extended family is excited to meet the lost daughter most of them never knew about. By the time DeSalvo left for home, Sebeck had arranged for a February visit \u2014\u00a0far enough out to plan around babies, Sebeck said. She thought having that to look forward to would make the goodbye easier. Then, when hugging DeSalvo, \u201cI looked down, and I saw that she had the same pinky toes as me,\u201d Sebeck said. \u201cI started bawling my face off.

    "text": "An estimated 1 in 250 Americans lands in the hospital emergency department each year because of a medication-related reaction or problem, a new federal study finds. Among adults 65 and older, the rate is about one in 100, the study authors said. Remarkably, the medicines causing the most trouble haven\u2019t changed in a decade, the researchers noted. Blood thinners, diabetes medicines and antibiotics top the list. These drugs accounted for 47 percent of emergency department visits for adverse drug events in 2013 and 2014, according to the analysis. Among older adults , blood thinners, diabetes medicines and opioid painkillers are implicated in nearly 60 percent of emergency department visits for adverse drug events. \u201cThe same drugs are causing the most problems,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Daniel Budnitz. The study doesn\u2019t tease out what went wrong. The reasons likely vary from one drug to the next, said Budnitz, director of the medication safety program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People on the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin), for example, must have their blood levels checked regularly due to the major risk of internal bleeding. Problems arise when there is insufficient monitoring or dose adjustment of these so-called anticoagulants, or when drug interactions occur, Budnitz explained. Diabetic patients taking insulin run into trouble when their blood-sugar levels fall too low, he added. If they forget to eat or accidentally administer the wrong dose, they can pass out, fall and break a hip, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, often, to do the right thing every single time,\u201d Budnitz said. While medication safety has improved in hospitals, reducing harm from the medicines people take outside of the hospital remains a challenge, the study authors noted. Ninety percent of U.S. prescription spending occurs in outpatient settings, they said. Older patients often have multiple health conditions requiring complex medication regimens prescribed by different clinicians. This makes them particularly vulnerable, the study suggests. Illness such as diabetes and heart disease become more common with age and are treated with drugs commonly linked to emergency department visits, Budnitz explained. Also, \u201chaving chronic illnesses can make adverse events more serious when they do occur,\u201d he said. Michael Cohen, president of the nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication Practices, said it\u2019s important to document trends in adverse drug events. \u201cThey\u2019ve been focusing on opioids, anticoagulants and antidiabetic drugs like insulin or the oral drugs that people take because these are the ones that are most likely to harm people,\u201d Cohen said. Budnitz, along with study lead author Nadine Shehab of the CDC and colleagues, examined data involving more than 42,000 emergency department visits in 2013 and 2014. These cases involved prescription or over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, homeopathic products or vaccines identified as the reason for the visit. Adverse drug events included allergic reactions to medicines, taking too much medication, or a child\u2019s accidental ingestion of a medicine. Twenty-seven percent of trips to the ER for drug-related reactions and other health problems were serious enough to require hospitalization, the researchers found. Roughly one-third of visits to the emergency department for adverse drug events occurred among adults 65 and older in 2013-2014, versus one-quarter in 2005-2006. Older adults also had the highest hospitalization rates. Among kids, antibiotics accounted for 56 percent of emergency visits for adverse drug events among children 5 years and under. For kids ages 6 to 19, antibiotics were the most common drugs followed by antipsychotic drugs (4.5 percent), often prescribed for children with disruptive behaviors, the researchers reported. Overall, an estimated 1.3 million emergency department visits for adverse drug events occurred each year of the two-year study period, Budnitz said. That\u2019s up from about 700,000 visits per year in 2005 and 2006, he said. But \u201cit\u2019s hard to say that the rate changed or didn\u2019t change\u201d because the research team wasn\u2019t able to study how much more these medicines are being used, he explained. Budnitz said new Medicare payment incentives may help reduce future adverse events by encouraging doctors to perform specific requirements, such as having patients on blood thinners participate in anticoagulation management programs. Results of the government-funded study were published Nov. 22 in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Chad Kessler, of the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Carolina, said collaboration is key to reducing these adverse events. \u201cWhen administrators, physicians and other health care personnel as well as the public recognize how large a problem this is, only then can we take the needed steps to remedy this,\u201d said Kessler, co-author of an editorial accompanying the study. \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.

Nikki Haley as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Betsy DeVos to serve as his secretary of Education. On Nov. 23 trump picked South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Betsy DeVos to serve as his secretary of Education. Christi Parsons and Tracy Wilkinson Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump named Cabinet picks Wednesday who would bring some\u00a0gender and racial diversity to his administration, as well as a degree\u00a0of political independence,\u00a0but raised questions about his pledge to seek experience\u00a0in choosing stewards of vast government bureaucracies. Trump\u2019s picks for United Nations ambassador, Republican\u00a0Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, and\u00a0for Education secretary, Betsy DeVos,\u00a0a billionaire advocate of school vouchers,\u00a0were the first two women named in a transition that had been dominated by white, male Trump\u00a0loyalists. Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants. Dr. Ben Carson , who is black,\u00a0also said Wednesday that he was under serious consideration to serve as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The latest\u00a0selections also offer some political diversity and\u00a0could buffer\u00a0Trump from criticism that he was filling out the top echelon of his administration exclusively with people who had backed his campaign.\u00a0 Haley was openly critical of Trump during the Republican primary, endorsing two of his opponents before finally standing alongside the eventual nominee.\u00a0DeVos\u00a0was less outspoken in her reservations but contributed to at least two of Trump\u2019s rivals and went\u00a0into the summer nominating convention telling the Detroit News she wasn\u2019t sure whether to back him. Trump names first women to Cabinet with Haley for U.N., DeVos at Education Nov. 23, 2016, 11:33 a.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration. Here's what's happening right now: Trump tweaks his views on a trio of major issues, complicating... (Christi Parsons) Both are stalwarts of the Republican Party establishment that Trump so vigorously challenged. But Haley and Carson, if he is chosen, would seem to contradict Trump\u2019s statement a day earlier, in an interview with the New York Times,\u00a0 that he valued expertise in stocking his administration. \u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to get the best people \u2014\u00a0not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people\u00a0because that hasn\u2019t been working,\u201d Trump had said. \u201cSo we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not known, but they\u2019re known within their field as being the best. That\u2019s very important to me.\u201d A popular and engaging governor and a rising star in the GOP, Haley, 44, has little background in foreign affairs. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon whose primary credential in housing policy may be that he once lived in tenement housing. Days ago, a senior advisor said Carson thought he lacked the background needed to manage a federal agency. Carson didn\u2019t want to take a position that could \u201ccripple the presidency,\u201d Armstrong Williams, an advisor to both Trump and Carson,\u00a0told the Hill newspaper. HUD is responsible for administering low-income housing assistance, fair-housing laws, housing development and aid to neighborhoods in distress. On Wednesday, however, Carson indicated a change of heart. \u201cAfter serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution, particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\u201d Carson said on Facebook . \u201cAn announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.\u201d DeVos, 58, does have long experience in education policy, advocating for conservative goals and tangling with teacher unions. She and her family \u2014\u00a0 her father-in-law co-founded Amway and has a fortune that Forbes estimated at $5 billion \u2014 are among the nation\u2019s biggest donors to the Republican Party and to conservative\u00a0Christian causes, including opposition to same-sex marriage. She is also a former\u00a0four-time chair of the Michigan Republican Party. \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cUnder her leadership, we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families.\u201d DeVos moved quickly on Wednesday to\u00a0reassure conservatives on one issue \u2014\u00a0the Common Core curriculum standards. She has been an ally of former Republican\u00a0Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who backed Common Core. \u201cMany of you are asking about Common Core,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cTo clarify, I am not a supporter \u2013 period.\u201d\u00a0 Her selection suggests that Trump may make a priority of backing vouchers \u2014\u00a0a longtime conservative goal that he endorsed during the campaign. Voucher programs give tax funds to parents that they can use to pay for private or parochial schools if they find their local public schools unsatisfactory. DeVos has been a leading advocate of their use. Donald Trump spent more than a year promising to build a wall, repeal\u00a0Obamacare and rescind\u00a0 President Obama 's deportation protections for some immigrants in the U.S. illegally. But on Monday, in his first extensive public comments since winning the election, Trump mentioned none... President-elect Donald Trump spent more than a year promising to build a wall, repeal\u00a0Obamacare and rescind\u00a0 President Obama 's deportation protections for some immigrants in the U.S. illegally. But on Monday, in his first extensive public comments since winning the election, Trump mentioned none... (Noah Bierman and Tracy Wilkinson) \u201cThe status quo in education is not acceptable,\u201d DeVos said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we can work to make transformational change that ensures every student in America has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential.\u201d Teacher unions,\u00a0which intensely oppose vouchers, denounced the selection of DeVos. \u201cTrump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding, and destroying public education in America,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \"The sum total of her involvement has been spending her family\u2019s wealth in an effort to dismantle public education in Michigan.\" The selection of Haley\u00a0represented a nod by Trump to more moderate forces in the GOP,\u00a0especially in the realm of global diplomacy. An aide to Trump defended Haley\u2019s credentials,\u00a0saying she had improved the South Carolina economy while engaging in overseas trade and recruitment travel. The move also would give a promotion to one of Trump\u2019s early supporters, South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, who would move into Haley\u2019s job. For Haley, the U.N. post could provide a useful credential if she wants to seek higher office, much as it did for George H.W. Bush, who served as U.N. ambassador in the early 1970s. The announcement of Haley\u2019s selection was somewhat unusual because Trump has not yet announced a secretary of State, the U.N. ambassador\u2019s nominal boss. Aides say he is looking closely at former Republican\u00a0Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, a sharp critic of Trump during the campaign. Some conservatives have attacked that possibility. Former GOP Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, for example, said Wednesday that choosing Romney would be a \u201cbig insult\u201d to Trump\u2019s voters. Trump is also considering one of his most loyal backers, former New York Mayor Rudolph W.\u00a0Giuliani. A Trump aide says the president-elect is spending \u201csignificant time\u201d on that choice. The selection is likely to\u00a0be top of mind as Trump gathers with family at his Mar-a-Lago resort for the Thanksgiving holiday. Times staff writer Joy Resmovits in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

Repeat: not season-ending. For a 2-8 team slogging into the stretch run of a demoralizing season, that certainly qualifies as a newsworthy development, perhaps even a hopeful one. But beyond that prognosis, Fox divulged few specifics regarding Cutler's injury. It's clear the veteran quarterback will miss time. Matt Barkley is preparing to start Sunday at Soldier Field against the Titans . And David Fales, signed off the Ravens practice squad this week, figures to be active as the backup. But Fox wouldn't say how much time Cutler would miss at the minimum. The Bears coach also wouldn't share when Cutler's shoulder injury surfaced during Sunday's loss to the Giants . \"I couldn't tell you,\" Fox said. \"He finished the game. Everybody saw that.\" And when asked whether there was any validity to an NFL Media report that Cutler had torn the labrum in his throwing shoulder, the Bears coach foxtrotted around a direct answer like \"Dancing With the Stars\" champion Laurie Hernandez. \"There are different levels of injury,\" Fox said. \"Tear is kind of a broad term. (Cutler's shoulder) is sore. There is soreness to it. But there are a lot of things in the shoulder that can affect the quarterback. Some of them can be just chronic, old (issues) \u2014 just wear and tear, like pitchers.\" In a week that started with widespread worry that Cutler's season could be over, the Bears will now hold out hope for a December return. In the meantime, they'll turn the offense over to Barkley, a fourth-year pro on his third team preparing to make his first NFL start. Welcome to the weekly Bear Download podcast with Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer. Listen below or subscribe and listen on iTunes | Soundcloud | Stitcher | Google Play Season 2, Episode 14: Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss Jay Cutler's future with the Bears and beyond (2:13 mark), a stupid... (Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer) Barkley's confidence and poise have always been strengths and the 26-year-old quarterback made it clear after Wednesday's practice that he's pushing to keep his opportunity in perspective. \"I don't want to blow this up out of proportion and look back and say 'Woulda, coulda, shoulda,'\" Barkley said. \"If I just give my all right now for this one week, and then move on to the next week right after that, that's how I'll best approach this.\" To be clear, Barkley takes over a massively depleted offense that will be without receivers Alshon Jeffery and Kevin White and tight end Zach Miller. Pro Bowl right guard Kyle Long is on injured reserve. Pro Bowl left guard Josh Sitton figures to remain out through Sunday with a right ankle sprain. And starting right tackle Bobby Massie was limited Wednesday as he works back from a concussion. Amid all that attrition, Barkley's performance should be put in context. He also has a short period of preparation to get in sync with his receivers and line, adding to the degree of difficulty. \"It's all about the chemistry we're building in the huddle and the offense,\" receiver Cameron Meredith said. \"The reps in practice will help as much as anything else. And then the extra work after practice that we put in, we'll go in the film room and talk about plays and talk about where he wants us.\" Needless to say, the Bears would rather not be in this predicament. Barkley will be the 20th quarterback to start for the franchise since the turn of the century and the third this season. This will also mark the seventh time since 2000 that the Bears have needed at least three starting quarterbacks in a season. They did so most recently in 2011 when Cutler was replaced by Caleb Hanie , who was later supplanted by Josh McCown. Still, Barkley's college experience as a four-year starter at USC provided plenty of exposure to big games and pressure-packed moments. And that, Fox said, should help equip him for Sunday's test. \"Matt has been in big spots,\" Fox said. \"He won't blink. \u2026 It's not going to be too big for him.\" ",

Mike Feuer, center, and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck speak about an increase in hate crimes. Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey, City Atty. Mike Feuer, center, and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck speak about an increase in hate crimes. (James Queally / Los Angeles Times) James Queally Contact Reporter As hate crimes surge in California and across the country, Los Angeles law enforcement leaders came together Wednesday to promise they will not let the city fall victim to fear. Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer , LAPD Chief Charlie Beck and Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey spoke about the wide-ranging effects that bias crimes can have on the city and county, urging victims of crimes with a racial or religious motive to come forward immediately. Hate crimes are often underreported. Feuer said victims should not fear speaking to police because of their immigration status. \u201cActs of hate tear at the fabric of who we are as a nation, and we want to send a strong message that no one should be reluctant or afraid to report a hate crime,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us is ever going to re-victimize someone who is either a victim or a witness of a hate crime.\u201d (Barbara Demick) Hate crimes surged in California and across the nation last year, and a spate of bias incidents that followed Donald Trump \u2019s victory on election day have\u00a0also drawn serious concerns from police and human rights activists. Beck said hate crimes have increased in Los Angeles by 19% compared to last year, and the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations reported a 24% increase in bias crimes in 2015. The 483 reported hate crimes in the county marked the largest total since 2011, according to the commission.\u00a0 Bias crimes rose by 7% across the U.S. in 2015, according to FBI data, and crimes deemed \u201canti-Muslim\u201d rocketed by nearly 67%. There were 257 reported bias crimes\u00a0against Muslims last year, compared to 154 in 2014.\u00a0 Beck did not blame the local increase on any particular group, despite concerns that the recent election cycle has mobilized fringe white separatist and nationalist groups . Hate crimes, Beck said, need to be combated swiftly because of the outsize effect they can have on communities that are victimized.\u00a0 \u201cThe fear of other is very, very strong in humanity. ... This cannot stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis cannot be something we allow as a people.\u201d Caption 4 Stories You Can't Miss New York sees a surge of swastika vandalism \u00a0since the election, scientists say they've found a way to give you a little extra warning before an earthquake strikes , the West Nile virus is spreading \u00a0and in some cases the symptoms are dire, and one of Donald Trump's firsts tasks will be nominating a judge to replace Supreme Court justice Scalia .\u00a0 Caption 4 Stories You Can't Miss New York sees a surge of swastika vandalism \u00a0since the election, scientists say they've found a way to give you a little extra warning before an earthquake strikes , the West Nile virus is spreading \u00a0and in some cases the symptoms are dire, and one of Donald Trump's firsts tasks will be nominating a judge to replace Supreme Court justice Scalia .\u00a0 Caption 3 men found shot to death inside Compton park maintenance shed Three men who were found shot to death in a shed in a Compton park appear to have been squatters, sheriff\u2019s homicide detectives said Wednesday.

    "text": "(Tribune news services) The lawsuit contends that \u201cconsumers are lulled into a false belief that the items are healthier than they really are, and thereby encouraging repeat patronage by consumers who are concerned about the nutritional values of the food they eat.\u201d But Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the restaurant chain works \u201chard to maintain transparency around what is in our food, including the nutritional content.\u201d \u201cIn presenting information regarding the calories in our chorizo, it was never our intent to create any confusion,\u201d he said. Arnold declined to comment on the men\u2019s suit, saying \u201ca lawsuit is nothing more than allegations and is proof of nothing.\u201d The lawsuit comes after the Denver-based chain suffered\u00a0a string of misfortune over the past year. Sales slipped after food-borne illnesses linked to Chipotle\u00a0restaurants sickened customers. As result of the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks, the chain closed all of its 1,971 U.S. restaurants in February and offered customers coupons for a free burrito. After the outbreaks, the chain said it planned to spend up to a $10 million to help its suppliers produce safer\u00a0meat and vegetables. Branding itself as a chain that offers \u201cFood With Integrity,\u201d Chipotle says it\u00a0works with local farmers to provide meals free of any genetically modified ingredients. In California, a menu labeling law requires chain restaurants to disclose nutritional content information when an\u00a0item is sold or before an order is placed, or disclose calories on an indoor menu next to the food item on a board. If nutritional charts weren\u2019t confusing enough, the Food and Drug Administration allows up to a 20% margin of error on food labels. Ilana Muhlstein, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Beverly Hills, said that even her clients who have been educated about nutritional value could have been tripped up by the 300-calorie chorizo burrito. \u201cIt is not their fault,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is incredibly, incredibly deceiving.\u201d Chipotle, she said, should have known better, especially since they probably employ dieticians researching nutritional information. Muhlstein\u2019s advice to consumers: \u201cIf it looks too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d ",

Trump noted that this \"long and bruising campaign\" has still left emotions \"raw\" with slow-healing tensions, but urged that in order to spur change, \"we must enlist the effort of our entire nation.\" While his videotaped words seem to act as a rhetorical overture to those still smarting from the presidential result of 2016, the kumbaya tone stands in direct contrast to his more adversarial remarks and actions since winning his long-shot presidential bid. Related: Can Trump Continue to Bypass Press With Twitter in White House? Since becoming president-elect, Trump has used Twitter \u2014 a favorite of his during the campaign \u2014 to defend his business interests in the face of conflict of interest allegations, to attempt to spin coverage of a $25 million settlement in his Trump University fraud cases, to lash out at political foes, and even to turn his nose up at Saturday Night Live, which he himself hosted last November. Additionally, Trump has incited feuds by way of tweet with news organizations, like the New York Times, and the cast of Broadway's Hamilton after they lectured Vice President-elect Mike Pence when he attended a performance last week. Trump and his team have also been slow to adopt a \"protective pool,\" a tradition that spans decades and allows a small group of reporters representing an array of media access to the president-elect, keeping them near in the event of breaking news or national security. Related: Trump Team Issues Handout Video of First 100 Days Plan That tradition was bucked most blatantly in the nascent days of Trump's time as president-elect. He eschewed precedent and barred the pool from flying with him on his plane when he went to Washington to meet with President Obama, and left our nation's capital without alerting the press to his movements. Days later, he ditched the press for a family dinn er , going to Manhattan's 21 Club despite a spokeswoman for his campaign giving a \"lid\" to the reporters assigned to the pool. The lid should have signaled an end to the day's activities for the president-elect. In the time since then, Trump's team has signaled that they are open to a protective pool but the practice has yet to be set up on a permanent basis. The pool did travel to Florida with Trump for Thanksgiving, but did so on a separate plane, which is unusual for president-elects. Separate planes were, however, par for the course for reporters following Trump on the campaign trail. And Trump has been conciliatory in other respects. He backed off campaign trail red meat, de-prioritizing his popular \u2014 but likely illegal \u2014 promise to investigate and jail Hillary Clinton. Related: New York Times Live Tweets Closed-Door Meeting With Donald Trump During an interview Tuesday with the New York Times \u2014 an outlet that hours before he had called \"failing\" \u2014 Trump would not say he was definitively taking the option of investigating his election opponent off the table, but offered that instead he wanted to focus on other things. \"I want to move forward, I don't want to move back. And I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways,\" Trump said in the lunchtime interview Tuesday. Ali Vitali ",

In recent years, Obama's pardoning ceremonies have become something of a spectacle largely because his daughters, Sasha and Malia, seem exasperated by his corny sense of humor. But this year, the Obama's girls broke tradition, skipping the ceremony because \"they were fed up,\" Obama said. \"Malia and Sasha are thankful, by the way, that this is my final presidential pardon. What I haven't told them is that we're doing this every year from now on,\" he said. \"No way I'm cutting this habit cold turkey.\" Instead of the first daughters, Obama's nephews Austin and Aaron Robinson were on hand as two turkeys \u2014 named \"Tater\" and \"Tot\" \u2014 were spared from the dinner table, during Wednesday's ceremony on the White House South Lawn. Tater and Tot will be able to live out their natural lives at the 'Gobblers Rest' reserve at Virginia Tech University. U.S. President Barack Obama reacts after pardoning the National Thanksgiving turkey during the 69th annual presentation of the turkey in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S. November 23, 2016. CARLOS BARRIA / Reuters The tradition of pardoning the TOTUS \u2014 Turkey of the United States \u2014 dates back to 1863, when President Lincoln gave clemency to a turkey, according to the White House Historical Association . Turkeys are native to the United States and were frequently presented as gifts to former presidents as a sign of patriotism, historians said. Obama paused to honor the turkeys who \"didn't get to ride the gravy train to freedom.\" But he closed the ceremony on a more serious note, reminding Americans that Thanksgiving is a symbol of our national strength and unity. \"We have to see ourselves in each other because we've all got family we love and we all have hopes for their future,\" he said. \"We lose sight of that sometimes and Thanksgiving's a good time for us to remember that.\" Play ",

Here's What We Learned Embed Embed \"The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt right.\" Fanatic Studio/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Fanatic Studio/Getty Images \"The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt right.\" Fanatic Studio/Getty Images A lot of fake and misleading news stories were shared across social media during the election. One that got a lot of traffic had the headline: \"FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide.\" The story is completely false , but it was shared on Facebook over half a million times. We wondered who was behind that story and why it was written. It appeared on a site that had the look and feel of a local newspaper. Denverguardian.com even had the local weather. But it only had one news story \u2014 the fake one. Study Finds Students Have 'Dismaying' Inability To Tell Fake News From Real We tried to look up who owned it and hit a wall. The site was registered anonymously. So, we brought in some professional help. By day, John Jansen is head of engineering at Master-McNeil Inc., a tech company in Berkeley, Calif. In the interest of real news he helped us track down the owner of Denverguardian.com. Jansen started by looking at the site's history. \"Commonly that's called scraping or crawling websites,\" he says. Jansen is kind of like an archaeologist. He says that nothing you do on the Web disappears \u2014 it just gets buried \u2014 like a fossil. But if you do some digging you'll find those fossils and learn a lot of history. The Denver Guardian was built and designed using a pretty common platform \u2014 WordPress. It's used by bloggers and people who want to create their own websites. Jansen found the first entry ever for the site was done by someone with the handle LetTexasSecede. Article continues after sponsorship The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction. Jestin Coler, publisher of fake news sites \"That was sort of the thread that started to unravel everything,\" Jansen says. \"I was able to track that through to a bunch of other sites which are where that handle is also present.\" The sites include NationalReport.net , USAToday.com.co, WashingtonPost.com.co. All the addresses linked to a single rented server inside Amazon Web Services. That meant they were all likely owned by the same company. Jansen found an email address on one of those sites and he was able to link that address to a name: Jestin Coler. Online, Coler was listed as the founder and CEO of a company called Disinfomedia. Coler's LinkedIn profile said he once sold magazine subscriptions, worked as a database administrator, and as a freelance writer for among others, International Yachtsman magazine. And, using his name, we found a home address. On a warm, sunny afternoon I set out with a producer for a suburb of Los Angeles. Coler lived in a middle-class neighborhood of pastel-colored one-story beach bungalows. His home had an unwatered lawn \u2014 probably the result of California's ongoing drought. There was a black minivan in the driveway and a large prominent American flag. We rang the front doorbell and a man answered, his face obscured by a heavy mesh steel screen. I asked for Jestin Coler. The man indicated that's who he was. But when I asked about Disinfomedia, he said, \"I don't know what to tell you guys. Have a good day.\" From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg We left Coler our contact information thinking he wasn't likely to talk. But a couple hours later he had a change of heart. He sent us an email and we set up an interview. Coler is a soft-spoken 40-year-old with a wife and two kids. He says he got into fake news around 2013 to highlight the extremism of the white nationalist alt-right. \"The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction,\" Coler says. He was amazed at how quickly fake news could spread and how easily people believe it. He wrote one fake story for NationalReport.net about how customers in Colorado marijuana shops were using food stamps to buy pot . \"What that turned into was a state representative in the House in Colorado proposing actual legislation to prevent people from using their food stamps to buy marijuana based on something that had just never happened,\" Coler says. Post-Election, Overwhelmed Facebook Users Unfriend, Cut Back During the run-up to the presidential election \u2014 fake news really took off. \"It was just anybody with a blog can get on there and find a big, huge Facebook group of kind of rabid Trump supporters just waiting to eat up this red meat that they're about to get served,\" Coler says. \"It caused an explosion in the number of sites. I mean, my gosh, the number of just fake accounts on Facebook exploded during the Trump election.\" Coler says his writers have tried to write fake news for liberals \u2014 but they just never take the bait. Coler's company, Disinfomedia, owns many faux news sites \u2014 he won't say how many. But he says his is one of the biggest fake news businesses out there, which makes him kind of like a godfather of the industry. At any given time Coler says he's got between 20 and 25 writers. And it was one of them that wrote the story in the Denver Guardian that an FBI agent who leaked Clinton emails was killed. Coler says that over 10 days the site got 1.6 million views. He says stories like this work because they fit into existing right wing conspiracy theories. \"The people wanted to hear this,\" he says. \"So all it took was to write that story. Everything about it was fictional: the town, the people, the sheriff, the FBI guy. And then ... our social media guys kind of go out and do a little dropping it throughout Trump groups and Trump forums and boy it spread like wildfire.\" Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016? And as the stories spread, Coler makes money from the ads on his websites. He wouldn't give exact figures, but he says stories about other fake news proprietors making between $10,000 and $30,000 a month apply to him. Coler fits into a pattern of other faux news sites that make good money, especially by targeting Trump supporters. However, Coler insists this is not about money. It's about showing how easily fake news spreads. And fake news spread wide and far before the election. When I pointed out to Coler that the money gave him a lot of incentive to keep doing it regardless of the impact, he admitted that was \"correct.\" Coler says he has tried to shine a light on the problem of fake news. He has spoken to the media about it. But those organizations didn't know who he actually was. He gave them a fake name: Allen Montgomery. Coler, a registered Democrat, says he has no regrets about his fake news empire. He doesn't think fake news swayed the election. \"There are many factors as to why Trump won that don't involve fake news,\" he says. \"As much as I like Hillary, she was a poor candidate. She brought in a lot of baggage.\" Facebook, Google Take Steps To Confront Fake News Coler doesn't think fake news is going away. One of his sites \u2014 NationalReport.net \u2014 was flagged as fake news under a new Google policy, and Google stopped running ads on it. But Coler had other options. \"There are literally hundreds of ad networks,\" he says. \"Early last week, my inbox was just filled every day with people because they knew that Google was cracking down \u2014 hundreds of people wanting to work with my sites.\" Coler says he's been talking it over with his wife and he may be getting out of the fake news racket. But, he says, dozens, maybe hundreds of entrepreneurs will be ready to take his place. And he thinks it will only get harder to tell their websites from real news sites. They know now that fake news sells and they will only be in it for the money. Below are highlights of NPR's interview with Jestin Coler. Interview Highlights Tell me a little about why you started Disinfomedia? Late 2012, early 2013 I was spending a lot of time researching what is now being referred to as the alt-right. I identified a problem with the news that they were spreading and created Disinfomedia as a response to that. The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly false or fictional stories and then be able to publically denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction. What got you engaged in this? My educational background is in political science. I've always enjoyed the ideas of propaganda and misinformation. Then I coupled that with an interest in what makes things go viral. So that led me to finding those groups and ultimately to finding contributors. But it was just something I had an interest in that I wanted to pursue. When did you notice that fake news does best with Trump supporters? Well this isn't just a Trump supporter problem. This is a right wing issue. Sarah Palin's famous blasting of the lame-stream media is kind of record and testament to the rise of these kinds of people. The post-fact era is what I would refer to it as. This isn't something that started with Trump. This is something that's been in the works for a while. His whole campaign was this thing of discrediting mainstream media sources, which is one of those dog whistles to his supporters. When we were coming up with headlines it's always kind of about the red meat. Trump really got into the red meat. He knew who his base was. He knew how to feed them a constant diet of this red meat. We've tried to do similar things to liberals. It just has never worked, it never takes off. You'll get debunked within the first two comments and then the whole thing just kind of fizzles out. How many domains do you own and run? Well, I would say there's somewhere around 25 domains that I am currently managing. National Report has been my bread and butter, where I've spent most of my time. I have people who work with me and for me in developing and maintaining the other sites and social media kind of stuff. (Coler later said not all his sites are fake news.) So I, for the most part, focus on National Report, and a lot of the other stuff is run by other folks on the team. So, you're the publisher of an empire. Well I wouldn't go so far as to call it an empire but, yes, it's several sites (chuckle). How many people do you have writing for you? It comes and goes, and as for actual employed writers, again these guys sort of make their own money through ad code. So I don't say, 'Hey, you have to write 10 stories this week' and this and that. Really, we have a more freeform idea where people, when their creativity strikes them then they can write something. And if they're in a slump then they just go dormant for a while. With that said, at any given time there's probably 20, 25 contributors all over the country. ... Talk about the Denver Guardian. Well, it's kind of as a side project. We have some people working on next steps in the fake news industry, and that came from that whole discussion. We had purchased several domain names that sounded legitimate. ... More local news sort of stories. The idea was to make the sites look as legit as possible so the home page is going to be local news and local forecast, local sports, some obituaries and things of that nature, and then the actual fake news stories were going to be buried off the homepage. We've tried lots of things in the past. The dot com dot co domains were something I toyed in for a while. Those I quickly got away from because you don't get away long with borrowing someone's copyright or trademark. That was something that worked very well from a fake news perspective. People were fooled into the domain name, but that wasn't so much what we were after. So again, the next step was to go after more city type sites. And the Denver Guardian was one of those sites. You're talking about the future of this (fake news business) which looks more insidious because it's more real? That's the way that it's going to be. Not just from where I am. I mean this is probably going to be my last run in the fake news biz, but I can promise you that it's not going to go away. It's even going to grow bigger and it's going to be harder to identify as it kind of evolves through these steps. ... Do you know who wrote the actual FBI Clinton story? I do know who wrote the story, but only through an anonymous pen name. Privacy is something that we take very seriously in our writers' group. The actual reasonings behind that story... it's one of hundreds that have been written about mysterious deaths of Clinton associates or political foes. This one kind of took off more than others, I believe, just because of the nature of the story. The people wanted to hear this. So all it took was to write that story. Everything about it was fictional. The town, the people, the sheriff, the FBI guy. Then, we had our social media guys kind of go out and do a little dropping it throughout Trump groups and Trump forums and boy it spread like wildfire. Why hide your identity? This isn't the safest business to be in, to be honest. Just the number of death threats I've received. I have a beautiful family, a beautiful life. Some of these people that we ... bait is probably the right word \u2014 are often \u2014 let's call them the deplorables, right? They're not the safest crowd. Some of them I would consider domestic terrorists. So they're just not people that I want to be knocking on my door. It seems like National Report is getting spoofier. If you went to National Report today, it's specifically satire. \"Chris Christie nominated to Supreme Food Court.\" \"Sarah Palin Banning Muslims from Entering Bristol Palin.\" They're a little bit more offensive than some people care for their satire. I mean fat shaming and slut shaming isn't something that is normally met with applause. But again, it's a lot more fun in nature. Do you make serious money? It depends on what you would call serious money. I think I do pretty well. Can you say how well? I would rather not. There have been some people who have been reported on recently. The folks in Long Beach that were doing just alright stuff. They were reporting $10,000 to $30,000 a month I think that's probably a relative ballpark. So you're doing as well as those? Yes. You're making money through the ads? Yes. Who do you work with? We have several advertisers. Google was one, although they shut down my account last week. We've replaced them with other advertisers. Can I ask who? There are literally hundreds of ad networks. Literally hundreds. Last week my inbox was just filled everyday with people, because they knew that Google was cracking down \u2014 hundreds of people wanting to work with my sites. I kind of applaud Google for their steps, although I think what they're doing is kind of random. They don't really have a process in place for identifying these things. I happen to know a very successful site that, as of today, of this morning is still serving Google ads. So it seems to be a kind of arbitrary step that they're taking either based on, I don't know if it was my reputation within the industry or specifically the Denver Guardian site that angered them, or I don't know what it is, but back to your question, there's hundreds of people that will work with me. What can be done about fake news? Some of this has to fall on the readers themselves. The consumers of content have to be better at identifying this stuff. We have a whole nation of media-illiterate people. Really, there needs to be something done. Do you consider yourself an entrepreneur? Sure. Are you one of the biggest in the fake news biz? If you look at someone who has specifically sometimes peddled in fictional news then I think that I would probably be considered one of the larger sites. As a liberal, do you have any regrets? I don't. Again, this is something that I've been crying about for a while. But outside of that, there are many factors as to why Trump won that don't involve fake news, right? As much as I like Hillary, she was a poor candidate. She brought in a lot of baggage. You don't feel responsible. I do not. Do you think you would have kept doing it if it wasn't so lucrative? Really the financial part of it isn't the only motivator for me. I do enjoy making a mess of the people that share the content that comes out of our site. It's not just the financial incentive for me. I still enjoy the game I guess. Would you do this all over again? Well, I guess it came to a head here and we're talking about it. It'll be interesting to see what happens moving forward. If I had to, if I knew specifically the Denver Guardian situation, that would have been handled differently. But everything else, as far as the work I've done with National Report, I'm very proud of, and I'm going to continue doing it. ",

Inside his 90-pound armored suit, his body began to overheat. \"The sweat was pouring into my eyes,\" the New York bomb squad technician told NBC News Nightly News anchor Lester Holt. Earlier, the bomb squad had used to a robot to place the device inside a containment vehicle, so that no one else could be hurt if it went off. Now, Hallick's life was on the line as he began to take it apart. Watch Lester Holt on Nightly News for More \"Unequivocally we could say anybody in proximity would receive a very serious if not life-threatening injury,\" said Mark Torre, the bomb squad commander. The New York Police Department bomb squad detectives spoke in an exclusive interview with NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Hold about how they disarmed a terrorist explosive device found in Manhattan in September. The accused bomber, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was allegedly inspired by Osama bin Laden. He was wounded in a shootout with police and has pleaded not guilty. Lester Holt of NBC News (left, in bomb suit) with Det. Jason Hallik of the NYPD bomb squad. NBC News After planning the attacks for months, he set off bombs in New Jersey and in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, authorities say. The bomb that went off in Chelsea injured 31 people and propelled a steel Dumpster more than 120 feet through the air, according to court records. Then state troopers spotted a second device. They took a picture and sent it to the bomb squad. \"[When I] looked at that picture, knowing that we had a confirmed IED explosion on 23rd Street, I realized we had a major problem brewing,\" Torre told Holt. They used a robot to move it to a containment vehicle, out of the range of civilians. But when the bomb squad technicians donned their protective suits and began an operation to disable the device, they knew their lives were at risk. \"Nobody here can ever be paralyzed by fear,\" Torre said. \"But we all have that very healthy respect for the force of explosives and what it can do. So there was a healthy degree of tension. Everybody's very, very focused.\" \"What is that like, when you're literally face-to-face with what you strongly believe is an explosive device?\" Holt asked Hallick, a technician who helped disarm the bomb. \"You want to complete your mission, so you just don't\u2026I just don't think about it,\" Hallick replied. \"I'm so focused on what it is and completing it and finishing it.\" Holt mentioned that another device allegedly planted by the same bomber exploded in New Jersey when a robot was working on it. \"It definitely is a thought in the back of your head, \" Hallick said. \"You had one detonate when they were working on it, and you had one detonate in the actual city. So it is definitely in the back of your mind there when you're working on it that hopefully it doesn't happen to you.\" But you have to put that out of your mind, said Timothy Brady, another bomb squad technician who worked the case. \"One of our things as we're suiting up is talking through the job and what you're going to do, and it helps to push that further in back of your head,\" he said. \"Your family, your kids. You concentrate on what you're doing at the moment. And then, you know, you worry about that stuff when it's all done.\" To give Holt an idea of how they do their jobs, the bomb squad outfitted him in one of their bulky, 90-pound protective suits. \"In that suit that you don't have a lot of dexterity,\" Hallick said. \"But the other thing, it was a pretty hot day. And the sweat was pouring into my eyes.\" Since the Chelsea bombing, the NYPD has seen an uptick in reports of suspicious objects. If one turns out to be real, the bomb squad will be there to disarm it. \"Taking care of it without it detonating on you is a big plus,\" Hallick said. \"To collect the evidence and the perpetrator actually caught? That's a great feeling of satisfaction.\" Added Torre, \"You never want to have a bad day in the bomb squad.\" Ken Dilanian ",

After more than two months of travel, they ended up near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, eventually settling in another part of the state where they set up a village. Within a year, about half had died. \u00a0(AP) PLYMOUTH, Mass. \u2013 \u00a0Archaeologists have pinpointed what they think is the exact spot where the Pilgrims lived in the years after landing in the New World. Every American schoolchild knows the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth in 1620, but exactly where has been elusive. Archeologists from the University of Massachusetts Boston tell The Boston Globe \u00a0they have discovered what is believed to be part of the original settlement, based on the discovery of a calf's bones, musket balls, ceramics and brownish soil where a wooden post once stood. UMass-Boston professor David Landon says the discoveries are compelling evidence that a sliver of the original settlement existed at what is known as Burial Hill. The curator of collections at the Plimoth Plantation says the discovery will \"absolutely change what we understand about that settlement.\" Advertisement ",

The Green Party did not single out any specific evidence of fraud, nor does it need proof of irregularities to call for a recount. Instead, Stein said, \"After a divisive and painful presidential race, reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable. These concerns need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified. We deserve elections we can trust.\" A small but vocal group of scientists and activists have emerged in recent days advocating for a recount on the basis of Trump's wholly unexpected win and concerns about Russian involvement in the election. They note that only a small minority of public polls predicted Trump's success, and though public polls have been wrong before the magnitude of their error this cycle was unprecedented. They also point to evidence Russian hackers infiltrated the Democratic National Committee and potentially a top adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign as evidence of both ability and willingness. Hackers compromised voter records in Illinois and attempted to breach voting systems in a handful of other states prior to the election. Play Scientists call for swing state recounts 1:35 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161124055157if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/815786563780\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Clinton's campaign officials have not commented on Stein's efforts, which hinge on the Green Party's ability to pay for a recount. Stein tells supporters she needs to raise \"over $2 million by this Friday, 4 p.m. central\" in order to put her plan to action. The deadline to file for a recount in Wisconsin is Friday, while the deadlines for Pennsylvania and Michigan are next week. Recounts are costly to conduct, and each state requires various fees depending on the size of the vote lead and how expansive the recount is. A recount wouldn't change the outcome for her. She came in fourth, behind Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, taking a little less than 1.4 million votes overall. But there's a very small chance that a recount in those states could boost Clinton. Trump won Michigan by about 9,500 votes, Wisconsin by 22,500 votes and Pennsylvania by 69,700. Given the relatively wide margin for Trump, and Clinton's narrow advantage in more traditionally blue states like Minnesota, it's unlikely compromised voting machines were to blame. Most political observers agree the more likely reason for Clinton's loss was an unforeseen breakdown in the Democratic turnout machine in key states, and Democrats simply staying home. There was no evidence of any vote tampering on Election Day, and even flipping one state in Clinton's favor wouldn't give her the Electoral College votes needed to win. Related: North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory Files for Recount as Challenger's Lead Grows Last week, two experts advocating for a recount, voting-rights attorney John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, made a phone call to Clinton campaign officials. The voting experts urged the campaign to file for a recount in key states, but their efforts, one person on the call said, were rebuffed. \"While many of us were hoping Clinton's campaign would pursue this, it seems clear they won't, because they said there's no clear proof of fraud\" at the ballot box, which candidates typically cite in calling for a recount, that person said. The source said it was clear the Clinton advisers were also concerned about not disrupting the transfer of power or causing further unrest over the Trump presidency, which has already sparked protests and marches across the U.S. in the weeks since Clinton conceded and Trump became president-elect. But proof of fraud is both \"usually unattainable and also unnecessary\" in many states to file for a recount, the person on the call said, and at the very least it would allay concerns from voters who insist the results of the election don't reflect them. \"There's either a huge subset of hidden voters that didn't tell pollsters how they were going to vote, or something went awry with those voting systems. If we can X out that second option, why not?\" the source said. Alexandra Jaffe ",

Though the pardoning of turkeys is a more recent tradition and the pardoned turkeys aren\u2019t eaten, most of them do not survive past Thanksgiving. Judy Pedersen, public information officer for Frying Pan Park at the Fairfax County Park Authority, told CBSNews.com that the mature turkeys are not wild and are usually too fat and unhealthy to survive.

Bettmann Archive hide caption toggle caption Pitcher Ralph Branca at Dodgers spring training camp in Vero Beach, Fla. Bettmann Archive Ralph Branca, the Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher who gave up the \"shot heard 'round the world\" back in 1951, died Tuesday. Branca was 90 years old and died in his sleep at an assisted living home, his publicist, Diana Baron, said. Branca had a remarkable 12-year career in the major leagues, where he put up a career 3.79 ERA and made the All-Star roster three times. But Branca will always be remembered for one pitch he made during the National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and their crosstown rival New York Giants in 1951. He entered the game as a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth inning and gave up a walk-off home run to Bobby Thomson. Here's the New York Times on the significance of that moment : \"In baseball lore the Thomson homer has been preserved in amber. It sits alongside Lou Gehrig's farewell at Yankee Stadium, Don Larsen's perfect game in a World Series and 'the Catch,' Willie Mays's spectacular over-the-shoulder, warning-track snare of a Series blast at the same Polo Grounds, three years after Thomson's 'shot.' \"It was also immortalized in American literature by Don DeLillo, who opened his 1997 novel, 'Underworld,' with an extended, lyrical re-creation of that Wednesday at Coogan's Bluff, complete with echoes of the radio announcer Russ Hodges's disbelieving call as the ball headed for the fence and sailed over the Dodgers' left fielder Andy Pafko, culminating, as pandemonium erupted, with the joyous, repeated declaration, 'The Giants win the pennant!' \" YouTube In 2001, The Wall Street Journal found evidence that the Giants may have been cheating by placing a telescope in center field to steal pitch signs from opposing teams. Thomson denied he knew what pitch was coming . Article continues after sponsorship Either way, friends said despite that news and the outsize role that pitch played in Branca's life, he was always the consummate professional. \"Ralph always held his head high,\" sportscaster Vin Scully said in a statement. \"He never let that incident define him. He was bigger than that. When he retired five years later in 1956, he did so with his self-respect intact. Some men display heroism in victory. But far more impressive is the display of heroism in loss. Ralph's acceptance of that loss, without rancor or bitterness, is one of the most inspiring examples of sportsmanship I've been privileged to witness.\" Branca is survived by his wife and his two daughters. Correction Nov. 23, 2016 A previous version of this story misspelled Bobby Thomson's last name as Thompson and gave Vin Scully's first name as Vince. ",

GALLAGHER Nov 23, 2016, 6:37 PM ET 0 Shares Steve Perez/Detroit News via AP WATCH Wayne State Police Officer Dies After Being Shot 0 Shares Email The Wayne State University police officer who was shot Tuesday night has died, the university announced today. \"I am saddened to report that a short time ago, Wayne State University officer Collin Rose died from the gunshot wound he suffered while working in the line of duty yesterday evening,\" said Wayne State University President M. Roy Wilson. Wilson asked members of the community to keep Rose and his fianc\u00e9e, as well as all university police officers, in their prayers. \"Our officers mourn with us, but these dedicated, professional men and women continue to serve us courageously, every day,\" he said. \"We can honor Collin\u2019s memory best with our ongoing gratitude and support for all of our officers.\" Michigan police said this morning that they have a suspect in custody after an intensive manhunt. Rose was shot in the head during a traffic stop while patrolling off-campus in Detroit on Tuesday around 7:30 p.m. Investigators are still trying to determine the nature of the stop and what led to the shooting. Wayne State University Police Department Chief Anthony Holt described Rose, a five-year veteran, as an \"excellent officer\" who has received a number of commendations. \"This is a very difficult day for me in my 40-plus years being a member of the Wayne State University Police Department,\" the police chief said. According to the Wayne State University Police Department, the suspect had previous contact with area law enforcement that included allegedly assaulting police officers. \"He is a known person to us,\" Holt told reporters this morning. The shooting took place in an area where there were a number of reported vehicle thefts, according to Detroit Police Department Chief James Craig. It follows a violent weekend around the country; four officers were shot in 24 hours on Sunday. \"I can't sugarcoat this. This is a tragedy of immense proportions,\" Wayne State University President Roy Wilson told reporters this morning. \"All of our thoughts go to the family, to his fellow officers.\" According to Wilson, it has been 36 years since the last time a Wayne State University police officer was shot. \"Many of these officers are younger than 36 and haven't dealt with something like this,\" he said. \"They have a lot to try to take in.\" 0 Shares ",

Erdogan declared Wednesday that an upcoming vote in the European Parliament on whether to freeze membership talks with Turkey is of \"no value\" to his country.(Yasin Bulbul, Presidential Press Service/Pool Photo via AP) 0 Shares Email Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asserted on Wednesday that many in the U.S. and Europe are branding U.S. President-elect Donald Trump a \"dictator\" because he wasn't their favored candidate. Erdogan called on them to respect democracy. Addressing a meeting of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, Erdogan also accused Western nations of calling any leader that did not serve their interests a despot. \"The West will continue to welcome tyrants who have blood on their hands with red carpets and label anyone who criticizes them as a dictator,\" said Erdogan who is frequently criticized for his increasingly autocratic style of governing. \"Are they calling someone a dictator? Then you should think the opposite. That person is good, because (he or she) goes against their interests,\" Erdogan said. Turkey's relations with President Barack Obama's administration have been tense. Ankara has strongly objected to Washington's support fir Syrian Kurdish militia who are linked to outlawed Kurdish rebels in Turkey and perceptions that the U.S. is reluctant to extradite a Muslim cleric who is accused of masterminding a failed coup in July. Erdogan spoke with Trump soon after his election and has said he hopes his triumph would be an \"auspicious\" development. In the televised speech, Erdogan said anti-Trump protesters in Western nations had no respect for democracy or the result of the U.S. election. \"In America they started calling Trump a dictator. In various countries of Europe they spilled into the streets and started saying 'dictator,'\" said Erdogan. \"I thought you were democrats? Why aren't you respecting the results of the ballot box?\" Erdogan added that he was not concerned about Trump's comments on Islam or Muslims, saying the president-elect would \"correct\" them once in office. \"We are used to such things in politics,\" Erdogan said. \"They speak that way today and then they'll correct that wrong,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Her highest-profile trip, perhaps, was a 2014 visit to India, the birthplace of her parents. Her husband, Michael, has served in Afghanistan as an officer in the South Carolina National Guard. Photo Ms. Haley embracing her husband, Capt. Michael Haley, in 2013 after he returned from serving in Afghanistan with the South Carolina National Guard. Credit Rainier Ehrhardt/Associated Press More generally, Ms. Haley has overcome concerns that she would be a one-dimensional insurgent outsider, similar to worries that dog Mr. Trump. Her 2010 campaign was given a major lift by an endorsement from former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the polarizing darling of the Tea Party movement . But Ms. Haley has forged a middle path that embraces the conciliatory racial attitudes favored by the left and the business-friendly ethos of the right. This balancing act faced perhaps its greatest test in June 2015, after nine African-Americans were shot and killed at the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The white supremacist charged in the massacre, Dylann S. Roof, had posed with the Confederate battle flag in pictures. And for years, blacks and liberals in South Carolina had pleaded with the conservatives who dominate the state government to take the flag down from a prominent spot it occupied in front of the State Capitol. Ms. Haley, the first ethnic minority and first woman to be elected as the state\u2019s governor, had previously sided with fellow Republicans, who argued that the flag was not a racist symbol. But the Charleston massacre hit home personally . She had been a friend of State Senator Clementa C. Pinckney, a Democrat and pastor of the church, who was one of the dead. Ms. Haley had a change of heart. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look my son or daughter in the face and justify that flag flying anymore,\u201d Ms. Haley told The New York Times in June 2015. At her urging, and after much passionate debate, the State Legislature agreed to remove the flag. Ms. Haley was born in the small city of Bamberg, S.C., to immigrants from Punjab State in India. She has said the locals in South Carolina were often unsure of her place in what is often a Southern binary of black versus white. When Ms. Haley was about 5, she and her sister entered a Little Miss Bamberg pageant where, traditionally, a black queen and a white queen were crowned. Photo Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, with Ms. Haley during a town hall meeting in 2011 in Greenville, S.C. Credit John Adkisson for The New York Times The judges decided the sisters fit neither category, so they were disqualified. From a young age, Ms. Haley worked for her family\u2019s clothing business, and she eventually received an accounting degree from Clemson University. She was elected to the State House in 2004. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2009, she declared she was running for governor and prevailed despite lingering biases. A Republican state senator at the time called her a \u201craghead\u201d on a radio show. A Democratic state representative said that voters did not consider her a minority, but more of a \u201cnice conservative with a tan.\u201d Ms. Haley, a nimble campaigner who is equally at home among C.E.O.s and denim-clad bikers, easily won re-election in 2014, arguing that her maintenance of South Carolina\u2019s anti-union, low-regulation atmosphere had been the key to an economic comeback. Under her leadership, the state continued looking beyond its boundaries, very often abroad, to attract new industries to replace a fading textile industry. It is a record that might seem at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s skepticism of global trade deals and his promise to subject imports from Mexico and China to steep tariffs. But there are other areas of agreement. In 2014, Ms. Haley criticized federal plans that would force power plants to cut carbon emissions. Also like Mr. Trump, Ms. Haley has weathered accusations of sexual impropriety without suffering at the polls. In her first run for governor, two Republican operatives made separate and unproven accusations that they had sexual encounters with her. She strongly denied the assertions. A few years later, Ms. Haley was among those rumored as a potential running mate for Mitt Romney, then a Republican presidential candidate. She said she could not do it because there was too much to be done at home in South Carolina. But she acknowledged that opportunities sometimes arose. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a planner,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, and I love not thinking about it because the doors open at a certain time.\u201d Richard Fausset reported from Atlanta, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.

It's standard policy for officers to patrol alone, police said, It's also standard policy not to get the dogs \u2014 which are trained for narcotics and bomb sniffing \u2014 out and to use them to control a subject. It is unclear why Rose was in the area, which is off campus. Wayne State police are also sworn Detroit police officers and patrol the area around campus. Police have not said if Rose was responding to a 911 call that the manager of a nearby apartment building said she had made. Betty Evans, manager of the Lincoln Apartments, said she had argued with a man on a bicycle, who didn't live there and called 911 when he wouldn't leave the area. She said she looked outside as an officer arrived to confront the man on the bike. \"He was outside, in front. The officer was trying to get his hands behind his back. We heard a shot and the officer went down, and we heard two more shots,\" Evans said. There also had been a rash of car break-ins in the area the day before. Wayne State University police Chief Tony Holt said he didn't know how that factored into Rose's decision to stop the suspect. The suspect, who is not being named by the Detroit Free Press\u00a0because he has not been formally charged, was arrested late Tuesday night. 1 police officer killed, 2 shot in 3 incidents across USA The suspect is known to the Wayne State police and other area departments. In 2011, he was charged with two charges of felony assault involving a police officer, one causing injury, and pleaded guilty, resulting in a 53-day jail sentence, the records show. There also was an incident in 2014, Holt said, although he didn't have details of that. The shooting is hitting the 65-member police department hard, university President M. Roy Wilson said at a press conference Wednesday. Many Wayne State officers, visibly shaken, gathered in the back and exchanged long hugs with each other at the press conference. Rose was a 2010 graduate of Ferris State University and was one credit short of completing his master's degree in police administration at Wayne State. His first job was with the Richland police department in western Michigan. Rose had worked and done and conducted training all over the state, Holt said. He was also heavily involved in organizing memorials for other slain police officers in the area. Members of many Detroit-area police departments showed up at the hospital following the shooting. People who live near the scene where Rose was shot said the suspect is a regular recipient of meals handed out three evenings per week from the I Am My Brothers Keeper Ministry about a block away. \"He's just eat his food and took off,\" said a man who identified himself as Angelo L. \"(He would) go outside, smoke a cigarette and just vanish. That was it, just like everybody else that comes down there to eat.\" He said he'd seen the man in the area regularly for the past five to six years. Angelo L. said he was familiar with Rose, who would regularly speak with and help people in the neighborhood, and that he feels \"very, very bad for him.\" Follow\u00a0David Jess\u00a0on Twitter: @reporterdavidj 10131 CONNECT TWEET 36 LINKEDIN 55 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ghiGbb ",

The hub employs more than 2,400 people and handles about 160,000 pieces of mail and packages a day. The Enquirer/Meg Vogel ABX Air cargo pilots and their supporters picket Nov. 22, 2016, outside DHL Worldwide Express in Erlanger, Ky. (Photo: Carrie Cochran, The Cincinnati Enquirer) CINCINNATI\u00a0\u2014 A federal judge ordered a halt Wednesday to\u00a0a strike that had grounded more than 75 air-freight flights the day before and threatened speedy package delivery just before the start of the holiday shopping season. Judge Timothy Black of U.S. District Court here granted a temporary restraining order at about 5 p.m. ET to ABX Air and its parent company,\u00a0Air Transport Services Group of Wilmington, Ohio, against about 250 pilots represented by the Airline Professionals Association, International Brotherhood of\u00a0Teamsters Local 1224. The pilots must return to work immediately. The\u00a0union said\u00a0ABX Air had violated its contract for two years by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments because the company doesn't have enough staff to meet the growing demands of online retail. \"To date in 2016, pilots have been scheduled to cover over 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off,\" the union said in a statement Tuesday. Pilot strike could delay Amazon, DHL shipping ABX is a contractor to DHL Worldwide Express, which employs 2,400 at its North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Ky., just outside of\u00a0Cincinnati. It operates about 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 for DHL. Grounded flights affected as many as 20,000 individual customers for each aircraft, court documents said. And through the strike lasted less than 40 hours, ABX Air said it stranded 1.3 million pounds of packages. Online spending in November and December is expected to increase 11% this year to $91.6 billion as customers increasingly shun brick and mortar stores to shop from their phones and computers, according to an October forecast from Adobe Systems Inc.

Newt Gingrich addresses the press following his visit with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on Nov. 21, 2016 in New York City. \u00a0(Photo: Kevin Hagen, Getty Images) Some conservatives are not in love with the idea\u00a0of Mitt Romney being appointed President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of State. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and 2016 presidential candidate Mike Huckabee made their objections to the former Massachusetts governor clear in public statements since rumors of him becoming the leading contender for the job surfaced. Romney tops Trump's picks for secretary of State, Wall Street Journal reports Huckabee told Fox News Wednesday that picking Romney \"would be a real insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard. That\u2019s what I think he has to stop and consider.\" Similarly, Gingrich expressed doubts about a potential Romney State Department's ability to \"represent the kind of tough-minded America-first policies that Trump has campaigned on.\u201d \u201cI can think of 20 other people who would be more naturally compatible with the Trump vision of foreign policy,\" Gingrich added during a Fox News interview Tuesday night. Their other main objection is that the 2012 GOP candidate was a leading Republican voice against Trump as the party's nominee, and he leveled several brutal attacks on the businessman during the campaign, saying his \u201cpromises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,\" and calling him a \"fraud.\" \"I\u2019m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just go after him from the standpoint of \u2018I disagree with his policy on immigration, I disagree with his policy on taxes.\u2019 He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor.\u2019\u201d Huckabee said the only way Romney \u201ccould even be considered\" for secretary of State is if \u201che goes to a microphone in a very public place and repudiates everything he said\" about Trump being unfit for the presidency. Gingrich questioned Romney's loyalty and the wisdom of choosing someone as \"actively hostile as he\u2019s been.\u201d \u201cI think the vast majority of Trump supporters will initially be very unhappy and will be reminded of the things Romney said,\u201d Gingrich said.

By Greg Miller and Adam Entous November 23 at 8:40 PM Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump has received two classified intelligence briefings since his surprise election victory earlier this month, a frequency that is notably lower \u2014 at least so far \u2014 than that of his predecessors, current and former U.S. officials said. A team of intelligence analysts has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, by contrast, has set aside time for intelligence briefings almost every day since the election, officials said. Officials involved in the Trump transition team cautioned against assigning any significance to the briefing schedule that the president-elect has set so far, noting that he has been immersed in the work of forming his administration, and has made filling key national security posts his top priority. But others have interpreted Trump\u2019s limited engagement with his briefing team as an additional sign of indifference from a president-elect who has no meaningful experience on national security issues and was dismissive of U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 capabilities and findings during the campaign. A senior U.S. official who receives the same briefing delivered to President Obama each day said that devoting time to such sessions would help Trump get up to speed on world events. 1 of 43 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 22, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with New York Times Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr.,\u00a0right, editors and reporters at the Times\u2019s office in New York. Hiroko Masuike/New York Times via AP Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cTrump has a lot of catching up to do,\u201d the official said. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a senior member of Trump\u2019s transition team, dismissed the issue, saying that Trump has devoted significant attention to security matters even while meeting with world leaders and assembling his administration. \u201cNational security is Donald Trump\u2019s No. 1 priority and I think he\u2019s taking it very seriously,\u201d Nunes said in an interview. \u201cLook how many leaders he\u2019s met with, how many phone calls he\u2019s done, positions he\u2019s filled. People who are being critical need to get a life.\u201d Trump was given an initial briefing within days of his election victory, and took part in a second session with senior U.S. intelligence analysts Tuesday in New York before he departed to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. Trump turned other briefing opportunities away. A spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, the office that oversees the production of the daily presidential brief, declined to comment. Spokesmen for the Trump transition did not respond to requests for comment. The President\u2019s Daily Brief, as the classified document is known, is designed to provide a summary of key security developments and insights from all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as an update on covert programs being run overseas by the CIA. It is typically delivered each morning by intelligence analysts selected because of their experience and expertise for the prestigious job. The contents are among the most closely guarded secrets in Washington, but it is likely that recent versions of the brief covered developments including the resumption of Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria and the disruption of an alleged Islamic State terrorism plot in France. During a Facebook Live discussion, Washington Post national security correspondent Greg Miller explained how the intelligence community views the Obama administration and President-elect Donald Trump. (Priya Mathew/The Washington Post) The briefings have for decades been made available well before Inauguration Day to newly elected presidents as a way of deepening their understanding of foreign developments. Spy agencies are also eager to cultivate a relationship with the executive who will serve as their most important customer and set their priorities for the next four years. Former intelligence officials and experts said that presidents-elect have adopted varied approaches to how and when the daily brief is delivered, but that Trump is getting fewer than most at this stage. \u201cHis pace is not as frequent as most recent presidents-elect, but it is not unprecedented over the decades-long scope of these briefings,\u201d said David Priess, a former CIA officer and PDB briefer during the George W. Bush administration. After his election in 2008, President Obama took part not only in regular intelligence briefings but also scheduled \u201cdeep dives\u201d on key subjects including Iran\u2019s nuclear program and covert CIA operations, including the accelerating campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan. \u201cDuring the transition, President Obama was an avid consumer of intelligence,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who was CIA director when Obama was elected. President George W. Bush\u2019s first briefing was delayed until Dec. 5 because of the Florida election recount. But Bush, whose father had served as CIA director, asked for daily briefings for the remainder of the transition. President Bill Clinton got his first post-race briefing on Nov.\u00a013, 1992 \u2014 10 days after the election. He received daily intelligence briefings almost every working day of the rest of the transition time in Little Rock [ Intelligence community is already feeling a sense of dread about Trump ] \u201cThe last three presidents-elect used the intelligence briefings offered during the transition to literally study the national security issues that they would be facing and the world leaders with whom they would be interacting as president,\u201d said Michael Morell, former deputy CIA director, who supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the campaign. \u201cThe president-elect is missing out on a golden opportunity to learn about the national security threats and challenges facing our nation,\u201d Morell said, \u201cknowledge that would be extremely valuable to have when he takes the oath of office and when he steps into the Situation Room for the first time.\u201d Richard Nixon was the first president-elect to be offered the PDB after his win in 1968, but he is regarded by many as among the newly elected commanders in chief most hostile toward the CIA, routinely spurning agency analysts. Priess, author of \u201cThe President\u2019s Book of Secrets,\u201d said Nixon refused to sit down with CIA briefers during the transition. To try to get the document to Nixon, intelligence officials resorted to dropping sealed copies of the PDB each morning with Nixon\u2019s secretary. After Nixon\u2019s inauguration, his aides returned the briefing books still in their unopened envelopes, Priess said. Nixon, however, met several times during the transition with then-CIA Director Richard Helms, and had significant background in global affairs and U.S. intelligence capabilities, having served eight years as vice president to Dwight D. Eisenhower. Trump has yet to meet with Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. or other top intelligence officials \u2014 aside from an unofficial meeting with embattled Adm. Mike Rogers , the director of the National Security Agency, who is rumored to be a top candidate to replace Clapper. Trump has greeted a parade of other officials auditioning for Cabinet positions, but also met with Indian business partners, television news anchors and figures in the entertainment industry.

By Greg Jaffe November 23 at 7:00 AM Follow @GregJaffe On the campaign trail he complained that they had been \u201creduced to rubble.\u201d At other moments he suggested that he might have to fire them all. Now that Donald Trump is president-elect, a parade of retired four-star generals has been making its way through Trump Tower and the mogul\u2019s New Jersey golf course. Trump\u2019s sudden infatuation with the military\u2019s top brass is part theater, part necessity and possibly a view into how he will govern. But it also raises a bigger question: What does Trump, whose military experience consists of military boarding school and multiple draft deferments, understand about the country\u2019s general officer corps? At least six former generals are being considered for as many as four top positions in a Trump administration \u2014 a concentration of military brass that foreign policy experts said is unprecedented in the recent history of the United States. In their charcoal-gray suits and short haircuts, they look like any other business executives. But these former officers, most of whom have spent their adult lives in the military and much of the past 15 years at war, are unlike the people Trump has encountered in corporate boardrooms. They are also unlike the politicians and political operatives who have dominated his life since he declared his intention to run for the White House more than a year ago. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u201cHe\u2019s going to find them a strange and alien life form,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan. \u201cThey are motivated by different things. They have their own ethos that is different from business executives or entertainment people, and right now I think he\u2019s entranced by that.\u201d The generals enjoy enormous public respect, and their plain-talking style and deep overseas experience could help add luster to Trump\u2019s Cabinet. But the generals, if chosen for top jobs, could quickly feel put out by Trump\u2019s sometimes chaotic style, his tendency to repeat untruths and his controversial views on Islam , torture , America\u2019s treaty obligations and the laws of war. When Trump talked about generals on the campaign trail, it was often to disparage them as political pawns of President Obama. \u201cI know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me,\u201d Trump said last year, using an acronym for the Islamic State. In other moments he has lavished them with over-the-top praise. \u201cThey\u2019re so much braver than me,\u201d he said at a rally last fall in North Carolina. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done what they did. I\u2019m brave in other ways. I\u2019m financially brave.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s ideal of generalship frequently seems frozen in amber, harking back to his high school days at New York Military Academy. He regularly heralds the toughness of such World War II luminaries as Gen. George S. Patton and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, both of whom suffered major career setbacks for bucking authority. Trump has praised the ruthlessness of Gen. John \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Pershing, citing an apocryphal story in which Pershing is said to have ordered his men to dip 50 bullets in pigs\u2019 blood and kill 49 Muslim terrorists in the Philippines during the early 1900s. One survivor was supposedly set loose to warn the others. \u201cFor 25 years, there wasn\u2019t a problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOkay? Twenty-five years, there wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d Retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis is emerging as a potential favorite for President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of defense nominee. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s favorite former general seems to be Jim \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, a former Marine commander and favorite for defense secretary, whose hard-edge rhetoric in Iraq and Afghanistan has made him into something of an Internet meme. \u201cBe polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet,\u201d he famously told Marines in Iraq. After their meeting in New Jersey this week, Trump tweeted that Mattis was \u201cA true General\u2019s General!\u201d and \u201cthe real deal.\u201d [ How Trump naming Mattis as Pentagon chief would break with 65 years of U.S. history ] Among Pentagon insiders Mattis is also known for his intensity, smarts and ability to build strong bonds with allies in the Middle East and Muslim world. There are many reasons \u2014 both practical and political \u2014 that Trump finds generals so attractive. His focus on senior officers to fill out top foreign policy positions, such as director of national intelligence and secretary of defense, reflects the president-elect\u2019s finely tuned understanding of the country and his base. \u201cTrump loves generals so much because America loves the generals,\u201d said Phil Carter, an Iraq veteran and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t pick any of them, just meeting with them in public reflects glory on Trump.\u201d Because the generals are not creatures of Washington, Trump sees them as fellow outsiders and kindred spirits. Most have spent their lives leading soldiers, sailors and Marines and can speak with a simplicity and directness that Trump appreciates and often seems to emulate. And unlike a large percentage the Republican Party foreign policy establishment, the vast majority of retired generals did not sign letters opposing his candidacy. \u201cThey aren\u2019t part of the foreign policy swamp,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Despite the military\u2019s appeal, Trump may be surprised by the generals on matters of style and policy. Some of the fiercest resistance to enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, came from the military during the Bush administration. Trump has said he backs such measures and admitted in a Tuesday interview with the New York Times that he was taken aback when Mattis disagreed with him. Trump\u2019s campaign trail talk of temporarily banning Muslims or forcing them to register with the U.S.government is certain to draw resistance from most senior military officers, including those who have cycled through interviews with Trump in recent days. Although retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, has described Islam as a threat to the United States, his views have alienated him from most generals and many of his former military mentors. [ Trump\u2019s security picks deepen Muslim worries about an anti-Islamic White House ] \u201cI don\u2019t think a single one of the generals, with the exception of Flynn, will buy into Trump\u2019s view of the Islamic world,\u201d Barno said. \u201cAll of them will reject the notion that Islam is the problem or that Muslims are the problem.\u201d Trump\u2019s vision of ruthless battlefield commanders pursuing an implacable foe misses a lot about the modern general. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have certainly involved a lot of fighting and killing, but generals have also spent an inordinate amount of time worrying about winning over civilians, wooing fickle tribal elders and managing sensitive allies. They view alliances, such as NATO , as sacrosanct. Trump has said that the United States may not defend NATO allies who do not \u201cpay their bills.\u201d \u201cWar involves fighting, but so much more,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. James Dubik, who oversaw the training of Iraqi forces in Baghdad from 2007 to 2008. The biggest difference between Trump and his generals could come in the realm of managing risk. Most generals spent decades methodically working their way through a massive bureaucracy with its own unique set of politics, customs and byzantine policies. They survived and in many cases thrived in a culture that rewards conformity over the brash, go-it-alone approach that has characterized Trump\u2019s career. \u201cThere are a lot of bold and bright colonels who never made general,\u201d one former military officer said. Trump\u2019s unprecedented courtship of the brass also raises some troubling questions for a country built around civilian control of the military. For years, top U.S. officials have been pushing allies where the military dominates the highest levels of government, such as Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey, to cede more authority to civilians. A general-heavy Trump administration could undermine that message. \u201cThis is a way that less-democratic governments conduct themselves,\u201d said Kathleen Hicks, a senior official in the Obama administration and the Pentagon and an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign. It also upends decades of tradition. \u201cCivilian control is so fundamental to the character and the way we think about the United States,\u201d said Jim Thomas, a former top official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should be preserved at all costs.\u201d The generals, though, may have the toughest adjustment when it comes to serving in a Trump administration. Most are accustomed to working through big staffs and often rigid chains of command, a stark contrast to the improvisational nature of Trump\u2019s campaign and to how he seems to be putting together his Cabinet. \u201cRight now Trump is interviewing the generals, but they are also interviewing him,\u201d Barno said. \u201cThey must be wondering, \u2018Am I going to have to compromise my values and beliefs to work in this administration?\u2019 That\u2019s going to be a very tough question they all have to ask.\u201d Read more: ",

We deserve elections we can trust.\" Stein and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, hope to raise over $2.5 million -- the money needed to fund recounts in the three states -- by Friday, the deadline to file in Wisconsin. As of late Wednesday night, more than $2 million dollars had been raised, according to the campaign website . Stein received 1 percent of the votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump won Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump leads in Michigan by about 10,000 votes and the state certifies the results on Nov. 28. Stein won 1 percent of the national vote, a little over 1 million votes, for president. However, the campaign said the purpose of filing for a recount is \u201cmore than the results of this one election,\u201d and that it\u2019s more so about \u201cprotecting our democracy and ensuring\u201d voters can have \u201cconfidence in reported results.\u201d 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Sports Josh Norman and Dez Bryant (Photo: Evan Russell, USA TODAY Sports) Thanksgiving is here and with it a three-game NFL appetizer to start Week 12. First place is on the line in the NFC North as the Detroit Lions, per tradition, open this week's slate by hosting the Minnesota Vikings, who lost to this team in Week 9. Next up, the Dallas Cowboys look to run their league-best record to 10-1, while extending their franchise-record nine-game winning streak by putting further distance between themselves and the surging Washington Redskins. Finally, Thursday night offers a matchup between two .500 teams\u00a0\u2014 the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts\u00a0\u2014 in what could be a de facto elimination game, at least in terms of the AFC wild-card race. Sunday's action is capped by the Kansas Chiefs' visit to the Denver Broncos, a game flexed into the Sunday night slot and another contest with important playoff ramifications. The Green Bay Packers head to Philadelphia to end the week as they and the Eagles struggle to remain relevant in the NFC. PHOTOS: Week 12 NFL games ranked by watchability Posted!
