    "text": "Judge Orders Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby to Stand Trial for Manslaughter By JULIA JACOBO Nov 29, 2016, 4:49 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Medical Examiner's Report in Tulsa Police-Involved Shooting Released 0 Shares Email A judge has ordered the Tulsa police officer who shot and killed a 40-year-old black man in September to stand trial for manslaughter, according to the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office Officer Betty Shelby appeared in court for a preliminary hearing Tuesday, where Judge Deborrah Ludi-Leitch said there was enough evidence for her to stand trial after reviewing police helicopter and dashcam video from the scene, according to the district attorney's office. Shelby\u2019s defense team was not surprised with the judge\u2019s ruling because \u201cthe evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to the state\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s a presumption that the state\u2019s evidence will be stronger when presented at trial,\u201d according to attorney Scott Wood. On Sept. 16, Shelby shot and killed Terence Crutcher after she came across his SUV, which was parked in the middle of a two-lane roadway with the engine still running. Crutcher ignored dozens of commands Shelby gave him, Wood told ABC News after the incident. The officer then shot Crutcher as he allegedly tried to reach his arm into the open driver's side window, Wood said. Tulsa Police Department Video released by the Tulsa Police Department shows the moments before 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was shot by a police officer Friday night. Police video from the scene showed that Crutcher had his hands up walking towards an SUV as an officer points a gun at him. Then he appears to lower his hands before the shooting, according to video. The Crutcher family has maintained that the window was closed. Police said he was high on drugs at the time and acting erratically. The medical examiner found that he had PCP in his system. ",

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images Elaine Chao arrived at Trump Tower last week to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. On Tuesday, he announced she was his pick to lead the Department of Transportation. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump ran an insurgent, anti-establishment campaign, but the latest addition to his prospective Cabinet is about as establishment as it gets. Elaine Chao, whom Trump picked Tuesday to head the Department of Transportation, worked in both Bush administrations, has ties to the conservative Heritage Foundation, has sat on numerous corporate boards and spent several years running the United Way of America. She also happens to be married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration \"Secretary Chao's extensive record of strong leadership and her expertise are invaluable assets in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure in a fiscally responsible manner,\" Trump said in a statement. \"She has an amazing life story and has helped countless Americans in her public service career. I am pleased to nominate Elaine as Secretary of the Department of Transportation.\" Chao is the latest Trump pick who would very likely have shown up in any Republican administration-in-waiting, along with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, longtime GOP fundraiser and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos, and Georgia Rep. Tom Price. (Trump's picks for U.N. ambassador, education secretary and health and human services secretary, respectively.) The growing number of establishment Republicans in the Cabinet \u2014 who could be joined by 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a candidate for secretary of state \u2014 are a sharp contrast to Trump's initial wave of appointments. Those were headlined by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who previously ran the controversial right-wing news site Breitbart, which has ties to the white nationalist \"alt-right\" movement. Chao was President George W. Bush's labor secretary, an appointment that made her the first Asian-American woman ever appointed to a Cabinet position. (Chao was also the only member of Bush's Cabinet to serve throughout his entire eight-year term.) She worked as a deputy transportation secretary during President George H.W. Bush's administration. Article continues after sponsorship Other candidates Trump was considering to head the Department of Transportation included Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta, one of the handful of congressmen to enthusiastically endorse his campaign in its early stages. Correction Nov. 29, 2016 A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to Nikki Haley as President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be U.N. secretary. Haley is actually his choice for ambassador to the U.N. ",

    "text": "Nov 29 2016, 7:08 pm ET Steven Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross Expected as Trump's Picks for Treasury, Commerce Heads by Alexandra Jaffe advertisement President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name his former campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary and investor Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary as early as tomorrow, a top transition source confirms to NBC News. The picks will add two billionaire businessmen to a cabinet that's thus far largely been filled out by Washington lawmakers and political insiders. On Wednesday, Trump announced plans nominate of Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price as head of Health and Human Services, and Elaine Chao, who was Labor Secretary under George W. Bush, as Transportation Secretary. Trump is expected to pick former adviser Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary. JEWEL SAMAD / AFP - Getty Images In contrast, Mnuchin and Ross, though active in political fundraising, have no government experience. Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, ultimately rising to partner before leaving to start his own hedge fund and launching a production company that bankrolled Hollywood hits like Avatar and American Sniper. Then a relatively unknown banker, Mnuchin became Trump's finance chairman in May and helped the real-estate mogul raise millions for his campaign. Related: Elaine Chao to Be Named Trump's Transportation Secretary As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would oversee the nation's financial regulations, monetary and tax policy. Trump has pledged on the campaign trail to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform act and cut the corporate tax rate, but Mnuchin kept a low profile during the campaign and his own policy views are unclear. During confirmation hearings, however, he could face questions over his role in running a bank that reportedly foreclosed on tens of thousands of homeowners in California following the housing crisis. Both Mnuchin and Ross are a longtime Democratic donors, but they each came out early in support of Trump during this election cycle. The president-elect recently called Ross \"my friend for a long time.\" The Commerce secretary typically serves as the government's liaison to the business world and oversees a vast bureaucracy, including the Census Bureau, the Patent Office and implementation of the nation's trade laws. Trump appears with investor Wilbur Ross at the clubhouse of Trump International Golf Club, in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, in November. PETER FOLEY / EPA That may explain in part why Trump is expected to select Ross for the role \u2014 like the president-elect, Ross has been an outspoken critic of free trade agreements, telling CNBC earlier this year that they're harmful to average Americans. \"I think there's a big difference between the impact of trade agreements on corporate America and the impact on Mr. and Mrs. America,\" he said. \"Corporate America has adjusted to them by investing lots of capital offshore. \u2026 What we're doing is we're exporting jobs and importing products, instead of exporting products and keeping jobs.\" Ross also fits the profile that Trump previously said he wants in his administration: A business leader, Ross made billions restructuring failed companies and was known particularly for his work in the coal and steel companies \u2014 two industries that Trump promised to revive on the campaign trail. But that work could pose challenges for him in a confirmation hearing as well \u2014 Ross was implicated in the 2006 Sago mine disaster in Sago, West Virginia, that resulted in the deaths of a dozen miners due in part to overlooked safety concerns. The mine was owned by a subsidiary of one of Ross' companies, and he acknowledged at the time having been aware of potential safety issues in the mine. Alexandra Jaffe ",

The half-cylinder-shaped shelter began being moved toward the reactor on a system of hydraulic jacks two weeks ago and reached its destination Tuesday, a significant step toward liquidating the remains of the world's worst nuclear accident , 30 years ago in what is now Ukraine . Workers will now begin dismantling unstable parts of the original cover, the so-called sarcophagus, which was built over the reactor shortly after the explosion to contain radiation.

Mui and Philip Rucker November 29 at 5:48 PM Follow @ylanmui Follow @PhilipRucker President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation\u2019s finances, according to people familiar with the matter. Mnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) joined Trump\u2019s whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he has never worked in politics and that he donated to Democrats in the past. He quickly earned Trump\u2019s trust as he worked closely with the Republican National Committee to raise substantial amounts of money in a short period. On policy issues, he was instrumental in crafting the details of Trump\u2019s proposal to overhaul the tax code. \u201cHe\u2019s an expert on finance issues,\u201d said Stephen Moore, who worked with Mnuchin as an adviser to the president-elect on the campaign trail. \u201cHe clearly, like Donald Trump, understands that the number one goal for this administration is going to be to grow the economy and get jobs.\u201d Mnuchin would be the latest wealthy investor to join what is already shaping up to be an extraordinarily well-off Cabinet. Trump also is expected to nominate industrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department. Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos was named as Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary last week. Mnuchin made his fortune on Wall Street, first at the storied New York investment bank Goldman Sachs and then as the head of his own private-equity fund. His close ties to an industry he would be in charge of regulating have the potential to complicate his confirmation and could undermine Trump\u2019s populist message. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet While on the stump, the president-elect frequently lambasted big banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs in particular \u2014 and advocated the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall legislation that once separated retail and investment banks. In addition, Mnuchin was deeply involved in running a bank that had been at the heart of the subprime housing bust, eventually selling it for billions of dollars in profit. \u201cSo much for draining the swamp,\u201d said Adam Hodge, communications director for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cTrump is already heading into office as the most corrupt, conflicted and unpopular president-elect in history, and now he\u2019s breaking his signature promise to the voters who elected him.\u201d As treasury secretary, one of Mnuchin\u2019s top priorities probably would be shepherding Trump\u2019s tax plan through Congress. Trump has advocated cutting the corporate tax rate to 15\u00a0percent and streamlining individual tax rates into three brackets. Although Republican lawmakers have expressed enthusiasm for reform, there remains substantial debate over how to tackle corporate profits overseas, among other issues. In addition, key GOP senators are advocating for a more bipartisan approach that probably would require complex negotiations with Democrats. \u201cI think he\u2019s extremely knowledgable about taxes,\u201d Moore said. But, he added, \u201cMost members of Congress don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d [ With Treasury pick come possible conflicts ] In news interviews, Mnuchin has said he was not previously close to Trump, but the two move in the same circles of big-money financiers, willing to take big risks in the face of improbable odds. Trump\u2019s campaign was just the latest big bet in Mnuchin\u2019s varied career in the upper echelons of finance, which has stretched from New York to Hollywood. Working at Goldman Sachs was a family affair for Mnuchin. Before he worked at the Wall Street giant, his father, Robert Mnuchin, spent more than 33 years at the bank. His brother, Alan, was a Goldman Sachs\u2019 vice president. 1 of 12 ",

USA TODAY Cuba's President Ra\u00fal Castro, left, Cuba's Vice President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, center, and First Vice President of the Council of State Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, right, applaud during an extraordinary session at the National Assembly in Havana, Cuba on March. 29, 2014. (Photo: Ismael Francisco, AP) The death of longtime Cuban ruler Fidel Castro has spawned many questions about future leaders and the direction of the communist country. His brother, Ra\u00fal Castro, who officially took over as president in\u00a02008, has overseen modest economic reforms and\u00a0the warming of relations between the United States and Cuba. He has said he\u2019ll step down in 2018. So what comes next?\u00a0A cluster of Cuban officials, from aging revolutionaries to career bureaucrats, are jostling to fill the void. They include: Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, 56. Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s designated successor is first vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers \u2014 Cuba's highest executive body. \u00a0The former minister of higher education is seen as a career bureaucrat adept at navigating Cuba\u2019s dense and treacherous political minefields. He\u2019s the first person born after the 1959 revolution to hold such a senior position. Cuban dissidents stay quiet this week, but not out of respect for Castro Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, 86. One of five vice presidents of the Councils of State and Ministers and second secretary of the Cuban Communist Party. Machado fought alongside Fidel and Ra\u00fal in the guerrilla war in the Sierra Maestra and is seen as one of Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s closest confidants. He's a\u00a0hard-line communist ideologue and old-guard revolutionary. Ramiro Vald\u00e9s, 84. Another veteran revolutionary, Vald\u00e9s is a member of the powerful Politburo and vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers. He fought alongside Fidel Castro at the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953, which sparked the revolution, and was a founding member of the 26th of July Movement started by Fidel. As Interior minister, Vald\u00e9s oversaw secret police organizations and gained a reputation for the ruthless suppression of dissidents. Bruno Rodr\u00edguez, 58. Foreign minister and member of the Politburo with a long career in politics. Under his watch, Cuba re-established relations with the U.S., as well as had a rapprochement with the European Union. He presided over the 2015 re-inauguration of the Cuban Embassy in Washington\u00a0last year, making him the nation's first foreign minister to visit the U.S. capital\u00a0since the Cuban revolution. At an April gathering of Cuba\u2019s communist elites, leaders decided to maintain the party\u2019s hard line, with Machado and Ra\u00fal Castro holding on to the top levers of power. But with Fidel gone, Ra\u00fal Castro may be emboldened to push through further reforms, including age and term limits on party members, allowing an opening for younger leaders, said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who closely follows\u00a0Cuba.

Steven Mnuchin at Trump Tower in New York this month. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AFP-Getty Images) Ylan Q. Mui, Philip RuckerThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation's finances, according to people familiar with the matter. Mnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) joined Trump's whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he had never worked in politics and that he had donated to Democrats in the past. He quickly earned Trump's trust as he worked closely with the Republican National Committee to raise substantial amounts of money in a short period. On policy issues, he was instrumental in crafting the details of Trump's proposal to overhaul the tax code. \"He's an expert on finance issues,\" said Stephen Moore, who worked with Mnuchin as an adviser to the president-elect on the campaign trail. \"He clearly, like Donald Trump, understands that the number one goal for this administration is going to be to grow the economy and get jobs.\" The president-elect scored an early victory Tuesday night when air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier announced that it would reverse plans to move one of its factories from Indiana to Mexico. The company, which is owned by United Technologies, said about 1,000 U.S. jobs would be preserved. Trump's tough talk on trade during his campaign helped cement his populist appeal. But Trump - a real estate developer famous for his flashy style - appears to be staffing his Cabinet with advisers who also have amassed extraordinary wealth. Trump is expected to nominate industrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department, and Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos was named as Trump's pick for education secretary last week. Mnuchin made his fortune on Wall Street, first at the storied New York investment bank Goldman Sachs and then as the head of his own private-equity fund. His close ties to an industry he would be in charge of regulating have the potential to complicate his confirmation and could undermine Trump's populist message. (Tribune news services) While on the stump, the president-elect frequently lambasted big banks - Goldman Sachs in particular - and advocated the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall legislation that once separated retail and investment banks. In addition, Mnuchin was deeply involved in running a bank that had been at the heart of the subprime housing bust, eventually selling it for billions of dollars in profit. \"So much for draining the swamp,\" said Adam Hodge, communications director for the Democratic National Committee. \"Trump is already heading into office as the most corrupt, conflicted and unpopular president-elect in history, and now he's breaking his signature promise to the voters who elected him.\" As treasury secretary, one of Mnuchin's top priorities probably would be shepherding Trump's tax plan through Congress. Trump has advocated cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and streamlining individual tax rates into three brackets. Although Republican lawmakers have expressed enthusiasm for reform, there remains substantial debate over how to tackle corporate profits overseas, among other issues. In addition, key GOP senators are advocating for a more bipartisan approach that probably would require complex negotiations with Democrats. (Tribune news services) \"I think he's extremely knowledgeable about taxes,\" Moore said. But, he added, \"most members of Congress don't know who he is.\" In news interviews, Mnuchin has said he was not previously close to Trump, but the two move in the same circles of big-money financiers, willing to take big risks in the face of improbable odds. Trump's campaign was just the latest big bet in Mnuchin's varied career in the upper echelons of finance, which has stretched from New York to Hollywood. Working at Goldman Sachs was a family affair for Mnuchin. Before he worked at the Wall Street giant, his father, Robert Mnuchin, spent more than 33 years at the bank. His brother, Alan, was a Goldman Sachs vice president. Mnuchin spent 17 years at the bank, rising from its savings-and-loan business to mortgage-backed bond trading before becoming the bank's chief information officer in 1999. Mnuchin is a \"very smart guy,\" Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said this month. \"He was a very senior guy at a very young age at Goldman Sachs,\" he said. Blankfein said that Mnuchin reported to him when he ran the fixed-income division but that they haven't spoken much in recent years. \"I'm sure he stayed just as smart as he was when he was at Goldman,\" he said. After leaving the bank, Mnuchin worked for famed billionaire investor George Soros - a well-known Democratic donor. He then founded his own private-equity fund, Dune Capital Management. Among its most notable investments was the purchase of IndyMac from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Dune led the consortium of investors who bought the failed subprime lender for about $1.6 billion, and Mnuchin oversaw the rebuilding of its business as chairman of the renamed OneWest. (A member of Trump's economic advisory team, John Paulson, was also part of the investor group.) Under Mnuchin, the bank more than doubled its branches and increased its assets. But it also faced criticism from advocacy groups who complained about aggressive foreclosure tactics. At one point, activists marched to Mnuchin's home in the Bel Air area of Los Angeles to protest its treatment of customers. As treasury secretary, Mnuchin would be responsible for the Trump administration's response to the aftermath of the housing bust. A crisis-era program that helps homeowners refinance their mortgages, for example, is not scheduled to end until next year. He also would head the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees some of the country's largest financial institutions. \"Putting a Wall Street CEO in charge of his administration's oversight of Wall Street is dangerous and even more proof that Donald Trump is only interested in protecting corporations at the expense of working families,\" said Jessica Mackler, head of American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic political action committee. In 2014, OneWest was sold to financial services firm CIT Group for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin is on CIT's board of directors but is not involved in day-to-day operations. He owns about $100 million in company stock, according to compensation research firm Equilar. After moving to California with the purchase of IndyMac, Mnuchin also became involved in financing Hollywood films. Dune Capital invested in several blockbusters, including \"American Sniper,\" \"Gravity,\" \"Avatar\" and \"Life of Pi.\" The Washington Post's Renae Merle contributed to this report. ",

    "text": "Obama Not Sending Presidential Delegation to Fidel Castro's Memorial Service, but 2 US Officials to Attend By John Parkinson Nov 29, 2016, 1:09 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Cuba's Possible Future After Fidel Castro 0 Shares Email President Barack Obama is not sending a presidential delegation to former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro \u2019s memorial service Tuesday evening, but two senior administration officials will attend the remembrance, according to the White House. \u201cThe president has decided not to send a presidential delegation to attend the memorial service today,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top U.S. diplomat to Cuba, will attend the service. \u201cThose of you who have been following this story closely over the last couple of years know that Mr. Rhodes has played a leading role in crafting the normalization policy that President Obama announced about two years ago,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cHe has been the principal interlocutor with the Cuban government from the White House in crafting this policy and implementing it successfully.\u201d Cubans Bid Fidel Castro Farewell, Pledge Loyalty to System Earnest said that Rhodes was already planning to travel to Cuba this week, so in addition to the meetings with Cuban government officials and with officials at the U.S. Embassy that he had on his schedule, he will attend the memorial service. When pressed about why Obama did not formalize a presidential delegation, given that two U.S. officials will attend, Earnest said, \u201cSo much of the U.S. diplomatic relationship with Cuba is quite complicated.\u201d \u201cThere are many aspects of the U.S.-Cuba relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime, but we continue to have some significant concerns about the way the Cuban government currently operates, particularly with regard to protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cSo we believe that this was an appropriate way for the United States to show our commitment to an ongoing, future-oriented relationship with the Cuban people and this was an appropriate way to show respect, to participate in the events that are planned for this evening, while also acknowledging some of the differences that remain between our two countries,\u201d he added. Castro\u2019s funeral is on Sunday, but no U.S. officials are expected to be present for that ceremony as part of a presidential delegation. Earnest indicated he was uncertain whether any U.S. officials will attend in an unofficial capacity. Obama made a historic visit to Cuba in March but did not meet with Fidel Castro, instead meeting with his brother Raul Castro , the country\u2019s current president. The Associated Press ",

    "text": "Donald Trump Expected to Pick Goldman Sachs Veteran Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary By Arlette Saenz Nov 29, 2016, 9:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Chao, Price Tapped for Trump's Cabinet, Secretary of State Still Up in the Air 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name billionaire, hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs alum Steven Mnuchin as his pick for treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, senior Trump transition sources confirmed to ABC News. Mnuchin was a long-time Democratic donor and served as national finance chairman for Trump's presidential campaign . He currently serves as co-founder co-CEO and chairman of Dune Capital Management. Mnuchin previously worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, where he rose to become partner. When he left Goldman, he founded RatPac Dune Entertainment, which financed several films, including \"Avatar\" and the X-Men movies. The selection of Mnuchin as Trump's pick for treasury secretary, which requires Senate confirmation, marks the first major economic post filled by Trump. If confirmed to the position, this would be Mnuchin's first foray into the public sector. During the campaign, Trump said he would dismantle the Obama administration's 2010 banking regulations known as Dodd-Frank, which Mnuchin has indicated should be re-examined. \"We're not taking a position on whether we support that or don't support it. We're saying a lot of things need to be looked at. We think Dodd-Frank needs to be looked at. Obviously there is an important concern of protecting depositors,\" Mnuchin said in a July interview with CNBC . Democrats were quick to pounce on Trump's decision to pick Mnuchin to run the Treasury Department. \u201cSo much for draining the swamp. Nominating Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary -\u2013 a billionaire hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs alumnus...is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington,\" Adam Hodge, communications director for the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. \"Trump is already heading into office as the most corrupt, conflicted, and unpopular president-elect in history, and now he\u2019s breaking his signature promise to the voters who elected him.\u201d Mnuchin previously donated to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's Senate and presidential campaigns. This is a developing story. Please check back in for updates. ABC News' Alana Abramson contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Vehicles drive through fog and light snow Oct. 17 on westbound Interstate 80 near Soda Springs. (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press) Joseph Serna Contact Reporter California\u2019s northern Sierra Nevada mountain range, home to some of the state\u2019s largest reservoirs, had the wettest first two months of the water year since 1984, the National Weather Service said Tuesday. Between October and November, the eight measuring stations along the northern range received an average of 18 inches of precipitation, or about 200% above average for the first two months of the state\u2019s water year, said meteorologist Eric Kurth of the National Weather Service in Sacramento. That amount of snow and rain in two months has only been seen 11 times in the region since record keeping began, Kurth said, and nearly every time the northern Sierra Nevada ended the water year with above average rainfall. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see such a strong correlation. We are early, it\u2019s certainly not a guarantee,\u201d Kurth said. \u201cBut it\u2019s interesting how many times that early wet start has led to a wet ending.\u201d The lone exception was 1984-85, which also happens to be the last time there was this much precipitation in the northern Sierra Nevada, Kurth said. The heavy precipitation came mostly in October, when storms soaked Northern California. The Sierra Nevada\u2019s eight-station index recorded more than 12 inches of precipitation, or about four times the average for October, Kurth said. While the milestone may be a good omen for the water year ahead, it\u2019s also highlighted more short-term, positive impacts on California. On Nov. 3, the U.S. Drought Monitor reported that about a quarter of California was out of drought conditions, the best outlook the state has had since spring 2013, when 64% of the state was considered in \u201cmoderate drought\u201d or worse. The U.S. Drought Monitor relies heavily on precipitation levels and soil moisture to assess conditions, state water officials said. For that reason, an unusually wet October, such as the one Northern California experienced, would show some areas as having escaped drought. In the meantime, much of the Southland remains parched as the state enters\u00a0a sixth year of drought. The southern Sierra Nevada range has received about 88% of its average precipitation for the first two months of the water year while the central region has received about 139%, according to the latest data available from the Department of Water Resources.

The nearby town of Pigeon Forge was also threatened. \"There was fire everywhere. It was like we were in hell. Hell opened up,\" a resident named Linda Monholland told the AP. On Tuesday morning, the extent of the destruction was becoming clear; overnight, the fire damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Gatlinburg, according to the state's emergency management agency.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park was closed Tuesday. A wind advisory remained in effect for the area through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service , fanning not only the Chimney Top Fire but dozens of other blazes burning in eastern Tennessee, eastern North Carolina , Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, Florida and Alabama.

    "text": "Gingrich calls Trump tweet about vote fraud a big mistake Susan Page , USA TODAY 2:46 p.m. EST November 29, 2016 x Share 50th Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich discusses Trump's possible appointment of Mitt Romney as Secretary of State with USA TODAY Washington bureau chief Susan Page. USA TODAY Former House speaker Newt Gingrich on USA TODAY's Capital Download (Photo: Sean Dougherty, USAT) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Former House speaker Newt Gingrich calls Donald Trump a potentially transformative president. But he shouldn't have sent out that tweet alleging election fraud. In an interview Tuesday with Capital Download, Gingrich, a free-wheeling Trump adviser who is a vice-chairman of his transition team, described the president-elect as a leader who is poised to disrupt the regular order in a way no commander in chief has done since Andrew Jackson in the 19th century. But he also said that Trump's biggest misstep in the three weeks since he won the White House was to post on Twitter Sunday a complaint asserting widespread voter fraud, and in an election he won. \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide,\" Trump wrote, \"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" \"The president of the United States can't randomly tweet without having somebody check it out,\" Gingrich told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. \"It makes you wonder about whatever else he's doing. It undermines much more than a single tweet.\" Does he see any evidence of millions of illegal votes? \"No,\" Gingrich says. The former House speaker, who led a political disruption of his own when Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1994, says the best thing Trump has done so far is to name campaign chairman Steve Bannon and Republican national chairman Reince Priebus to his top White House staff. \"You have a very hard-line conservative warrior as your chief strategist and you have a really sophisticated manager of the establishment as your chief of staff,\" he says. That said, Gingrich is caustic toward another potential Trump appointment, of Mitt Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. Trump and Romney were slated to meet Tuesday for a second time, reportedly to discuss the role of secretary of State for the GOP's 2012 nominee, who was perhaps Trump's fiercest Republican critic during the campaign. \"I think it's outrageous,\" Gingrich says. \"Romney said vile and vicious things. Romney opposed him all the way up to the election. In my judgment, Romney will be a very high risk ... because I think Romney has zero interest in the Trump revolution and every interest in re-establishing his own credentials.\" While he views former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as a better choice, Gingrich says House Speaker Paul Ryan \"is very strongly in favor of Romney\" and that Priebus is \"pretty strongly\" in favor of him. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, however, has warned of a grassroots revolt if Romney is named to the Cabinet's top job. When he met with Trump last week, Gingrich says, \"He commented, 'This is really a bigger job than I thought.' Which is good. He should think that.\" As president, Gingrich went on, \"you have war and peace, you have enormous powers ... and it all comes down to the Oval Office and it all comes down to you.\" He argues\u00a0that Trump, who hasn't held a news conference since July, should feel no obligation to hold any as president, suggesting instead he solicit questions from the public to answer. \"The news media so totally disgraced itself in this election, if I were Trump I would just say no,\" Gingrich says. \"And if the White House Correspondents Association doesn't like it, I'd say, 'Fine, disband.'\" Gingrich says the political world hasn't yet come to grips with the sort of fundamental change the election of \"the most insurgent president in American history\" could bring. He describes Trump as \"one-third Andrew Jackson in disruption, one-third Theodore Roosevelt in sheer energy, and one-third P.T. Barnum in selling all the time.\" But he says Trump might need to occasionally curb his instincts. \"He should tweet, but he ought to have an editorial board in-between the first draft and sending it,\" he suggests\u00a0\u2014 not an idea Trump seems likely to accept. \"But he shouldn't give it up, and he shouldn't give up being Donald Trump. He got elected being this unique, charismatic, entrepreneurial guy who breaks lots of rules. ... If he starts getting to be normal, he'll cease being Donald J. Trump.\" ",

President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, seen here on Nov. 19, 2016, in New Jersey. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Air conditioning company Carrier Corp. said Tuesday that it had reached a deal with President-elect Donald Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence planned to travel to the state Thursday to unveil the agreement alongside company officials. Trump confirmed the meeting on Twitter late Tuesday, promising a \"Great deal for workers!\" Trump spent much of his campaign pledging to keep companies like Carrier from moving jobs overseas. His focus on manufacturing jobs contributed to his unexpected appeal with working-class voters in states like Michigan, which has long voted for Democrats in presidential elections. The details of the agreement were unclear. Carrier tweeted that the company was \"pleased to have reached a deal\" with Trump and Pence to keep the jobs in Indianapolis. A transition official confirmed that the president-elect and Pence, who is ending his tenure as Indiana governor, would appear with Carrier officials Thursday. The official insisted on anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the trip ahead of an official announcement. Trump said last week that he was \"making progress\" on trying to get Carrier to stay in Indiana. In February, Carrier said it would shutter its Indianapolis plant employing 1,400 workers and move its manufacturing to Mexico. The plant's workers would have been laid off over three years starting in 2017. United Technologies Electronic Controls also announced then that it planned to move its Huntington manufacturing operations to a new plant in Mexico, costing the northeastern Indiana city 700 jobs by 2018. Those workers make microprocessor-based controls for the HVAC and refrigeration industries. Carrier and UTEC are both units of Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. \u2014 which also owns Pratt & Whitney, a big supplier of fighter jet engines that relies in part on U.S. military contracts. In a September debate against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Trump railed against Carrier's plans. \"So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this,\" Trump said. \"We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States.\" Carrier wasn't the only company Trump assailed during the campaign. He pledged to give up Oreos after Nabisco's parent, Mondelez International , said it would replace nine production lines in Chicago with four in Mexico. He criticized Ford after the company said it planned to invest $2.5 billion in engine and transmission plants in Mexico. ",

Nov. 29, 2016, in Nashville, Tenn. Lacy Atkins / The Tennessean Amy O'Neal, center, of North American Stamping Group in Portland, Tenn., will share the winning $420 million Powerball prize with 19 co-workers. The group was introduced in Nashville on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016, as the winners of the Saturday, Nov. 26, 2016, drawing. (Photo: Lacy Atkins, The Tennessean) NASHVILLE\u00a0\u2014 A group of 20 co-workers from an auto parts manufacturing\u00a0plant in Tennessee claimed the $420.9 million Powerball jackpot Tuesday. When Steve Huffman's check engine light\u00a0popped on in his car, he would have been in financial trouble. However, it's no longer a concern for the 54-year-old Westmoreland, Tenn., resident. \"I don't have to get frantic about that anymore,\" Huffman chuckled to a group of reporters at the Tennessee Lottery headquarters in Nashville on Tuesday after learning he'd become one of the state's most recent millionaires. Huffman is one of 20 co-workers from a Portland, Tenn., company who entered an office pool over the weekend and won the Powerball jackpot. $420M Powerball ticket sold in small Tenn. city The winners, from 13 different cities in Tennessee and Kentucky, work together at North American Stamping Group where they primarily handle sales and quality control at the auto parts manufacturing plant. Tennessee Lottery officials said\u00a0the winning ticket, which matched all six Powerball numbers drawn Saturday, was sold by Smoke Shop Inc. Owner Joyce Gregory in Lafayette, Tenn. \u2014 a city of about 5,000 residents that is about 60 miles northeast of Nashville. \"I am really tickled. ...\u00a0It's really going to help our town,\" said Gregory, who scored $25,000 just for selling the winning ticket. Tennessee Lottery President and CEO Rebecca Hargrove said the cash value of the jackpot is worth $254 million which equals just more than $12.7 million for each person before taxes. \u201cYou never think you're going to win this lottery, but you do it for fun.\u201d Amy O'Neal, member of self-dubbed 'The Tennessee 20' The winning numbers: 17-19-21-37-44; Powerball, 16; Power Play, 2. The ticket is the 200th ticket sold by the Tennessee Lottery worth $1 million or more and the win marked the second-largest prize for the Tennessee Lottery. The first was the $528.8 million prize won by a Munford, Tenn., family in January as its share of the largest lottery jackpot ever. They were one of three ticket holders to claim the $1.6 billion jackpot. Three of the 10 largest Powerball\u00a0prize payouts and one of the largest MegaMillions pots\u00a0have happened this year, according to the\u00a0 Multi-State Lottery Association , an affiliation of the lotteries that sell Powerball and MegaMillions tickets. The District of Columbia,\u00a0Puerto Rico the U.S. Virgin Islands and 44 states offer the Powerball game, in which\u00a0players choose the first five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and the\u00a0Powerball from a pool of 26\u00a0red balls. \"You never think you're going to win this lottery, but you do it for fun,\" \u00a0Amy O'Neal said of the winning group self-dubbed \"The Tennessee 20,\" who have been playing the lotto for eight years. The group, she said, buys $120 worth of tickets every Wednesday and Saturday to support education and the state. O'Neal, who lives in Lafayette and bought the ticket for the group, said she didn't check the ticket Saturday night. Thinking it was a million in one chance to win, she went to bed. Here are Saturday\u2019s $420M Powerball numbers The next morning, her son learned the ticket was purchased in Lafayette. He and her husband immediately woke her to the news. \"They were shaking me and shaking me. ... I went in and grabbed my tickets. It was the third one,\" O'Neil said. \"I just started screaming. I had to look again, I thought I was in a dream.\" O'Neal said when she alerted her colleagues they didn't believe her at first. \"They were like, 'Oh my gosh, Amy, shut up, we're not going to work today.' Everybody was just screaming. Just the joy.\" O'Neal also thanked God, gave props to President-elect Donald Trump and also asked people to pray for the Great Smoky Mountains, Gatlinburg and for all those suffering because of this week's wildfires hammering East Tennessee. \"We're in a joyful situation but there is also a sad situation,\" she said. Huffman, whose 18-year-old daughter attends Belmont University and whose 21-year-old son is a U.S. Marine serving overseas, called his winning co-workers a group with a heart of gold. \"All these people have always had a heart to help people and be there for people ...\u00a0 we can do that if we don't have any money,\" Huffman said, nearly breaking into tears. \"Now we can do more and help more. There's going to be a lot of people blessed.\" Follow Natalie Neysa Alund on Twitter:\u00a0 @nataliealund ",

The state Department for Children and Families had not decided as of Tuesday whether it would appeal last week\u2019s ruling by Shawnee County District Judge Mary Mattivi. The department sought to force William Marotta to pay child support for the girl born in December 2009. Marotta answered a Craigslist ad from the same-sex couple. Kansas law says a donor providing sperm to a doctor for insemination isn\u2019t legally a father, but the two women didn\u2019t use a physician. The women later separated. Mattivi ruled the woman who didn\u2019t give birth is the girl\u2019s second parent. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Mitt Romney. The men, joined by incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, met for dinner at Jean-Georges restaurant located in the Trump International Hotel and Tower off Columbus Circle in midtown Manhattan. The exclusive restaurant, which has received three Michelin stars, has a dinner menu featuring a variety of meat, fish and pasta dishes. I was allowed in to see President-elect Trump, @Reince and Mitt Romney eating dinner. pic.twitter.com/bITd35PRWy \u2014 Hunter Walker (@hunterw) November 30, 2016 The group dined on garlic soup with thyme and sauteed frog legs as well as diver scallops for appetizers. Priebus and Trump had steak and Romney had lamb chops. \"I\u2019ve had a wonderful evening with President-elect Trump,\" Romney said after the meeting. \"We had another discussion about affairs throughout the world and these discussions I have had with him have been enlightening and interesting and engaging. I have enjoyed them very, very much.\" \"He won the general election,\" he added. \"And he continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\" Romney\u2019s first audience with Trump was less than two weeks ago in Bedminster, NJ. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee called the meeting with Trump a \u201cvery thorough and in-depth discussion.\u201d \"We had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance,\u201d Romney told reporters upon leaving Trump National Golf Club on Nov. 19. Trump Holds Meetings With Mitt Romney, Michelle Rhee and Others According to senior sources, Romney is one of several contenders being considered for secretary of state. But not all of Trump\u2019s advisers appear enamored of a Romney pick due to his criticism of Trump during the campaign. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, for example, has publicly expressed concerns about Romney on Twitter and in television interviews. \"I think that there was the Never Trump movement and then there was Gov. Romney,\" Conway said Sunday in an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.\u201d Romney spoke out against Trump in February, arguing that the reason Trump wouldn\u2019t release his tax returns at the time was because there was a \u201cbombshell\u201d in them. \u201cI think there\u2019s something there,\" Romney said of Trump's tax returns in an interview with Fox News. \"Either he\u2019s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn\u2019t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay.\u201d In an interview with NBC in March, Romney went even further, declaring: \u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m going to do everything within the normal political bounds to make sure we don\u2019t nominate Donald Trump. I think he would be terribly unfit for office.\u201d But Romney\u2019s strongest rebuke of Trump by far was in an impassioned speech he delivered to the University of Utah that same month. \u201cDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\u201d Romney said, adding, \u201cIf we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.\u201d Romney also derided one of Trump\u2019s biggest campaign trail selling points: \u201cA business genius he is not,\u201d he said. \u201cHis promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,\u201d Romney said. \u201cHe's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.\u201d But back in 2012 when he was running for president and Trump endorsed him, Romney was singing a different tune. Julie Jacobson/AP Photo Donald Trump greets Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, after announcing his endorsement of Romney during a news conference, Feb. 2, 2012, in Las Vegas. \u201cBeing in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement,\u201d Romney said then at a news conference in Las Vegas. He added that Trump \u201chas shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs for the American people.\u201d In an interview with The Boston Globe this past March, Romney said he believed he had an obligation to speak out against Trump after months of remaining silent. The final straw for Romney was what he said was Trump\u2019s slow move to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. \u201cIf Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement,\u201d Romney tweeted in March. If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 3, 2016 During the campaign, Trump called the former 2012 Republican nominee a \u201c failed candidate \u201d and a \u201c choke artist .\u201d He also dismissed Romney\u2019s March speech as \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cirrelevant,\u201d and said the length of the speech was \u201cridiculous.\u201d Romney has never revealed who he voted for in the 2016 general election (he was also critical of Hillary Clinton). However, once it was clear Trump was president-elect, Romney posted on Twitter, \u201cBest wishes for our duly elected president: May his victory speech be his guide and preserving the Republic his aim.\u201d Best wishes for our duly elected president: May his victory speech be his guide and preserving the Republic his aim. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) November 9, 2016 Jonathan Karl, Katherine Faulders, John Santucci, Devin Dwyer and Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Nov 29 2016, 7:30 am ET Welcome to 'the Most Toxic Place in America' by Ronan Farrow and Rich McHugh Share 'America's Chernobyl': Inside the most toxic place in the nation 7:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161130010221if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/819787843950\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Athletic 35-year-old men who have never touched cigarettes are not supposed to come down with a debilitating lung disease usually linked to smoking. But Seth Ellingsworth of West Richland, Washington, says he got sick in an instant last year, when he briefly inhaled a strange odor at his job at the nearby Hanford Nuclear Site. \"I started having breathing problems,\" said Ellingsworth, \"and it hasn't gone away since.\" The father of four, who has reactive airway disease and is now unable to work, wore a nebulizer mask and gasped for air as he showed NBC News all the medicines he's forced to take. \"This is a corticosteroid. This is a pill I take, it's Zafirlukast. This is prednisone. This is a bronchodilator.\" Seventy years ago, the Hanford Site produced plutonium for America's nuclear arsenal. Today, it's run by the Department of Energy through its contractor, Washington River Protection Solutions. The contractor is managing a $110 billion cleanup of 56 million gallons of chemical and nuclear waste, stored in 177 underground tanks \u2014 a task that's expected to last the next 50 years. Seth Ellingsworth says he became sick as soon as he inhaled bad-smelling fumes at Washington's Hanford Nuclear Site, where he worked. Seth Ellingsworth But the tanks are leaking, and the vapors they emit contain toxic and radioactive chemicals known to cause cancer as well as brain and lung damage. Just this year, 61 workers have been exposed, and some nuclear experts have called Hanford \"the most toxic place in America\" and \"an underground Chernobyl waiting to happen.\" The DOE has acknowledged in nearly 20 studies conducted over the past 24 years that there is a safety risk to workers at Hanford. Just two years ago, a report found toxins in the air \"far exceeding occupational limits\" and a \"causal link\" between vapor exposure and lung and brain damage. The DOE has also said that the site \"cannot effectively control\" dangers and gives workers \"no warning.\" Campus Undercovered: Why ADHD Drugs Are the Hottest Study Aid on College Campuses But critics say the DOE still isn't doing enough to act on its own findings, and continues to put workers at risk. Local neuropsychologist Brian Campbell says he has evaluated 29 people at Hanford with both respiratory and cognitive symptoms, including \"some of the worst cases of dementia that I've seen in young people, which we do not anticipate.\" Dr. Campbell said the DOE doesn't want to acknowledge the injuries. \"More likely than not,\" said Campbell, \"I think it's caused by the exposure they had at Hanford.\" Nuclear reactors line the riverbank at the Hanford Site along the Columbia River in January 1960. The N Reactor is in the foreground, with the twin KE and KW Reactors in the immediate background. The historic B Reactor, the world's first plutonium production reactor, is visible in the distance. United States Department of Energy When NBC News put out a call for current and former Hanford workers who believe they were exposed to toxic materials, more than 20 volunteered to talk to us. Eleven of them sat down with NBC News for a group interview. Diana Gegg was one of several former workers who said they have dementia: \"I have shaking on the right side of my body.\" Lonny Poteat said he had been diagnosed with \"pretty bad\" nerve damage. \"Sometimes the pain gets so great,\" said Poteat, \"I just pass out.\" Campus Undercovered: College Students Say Drunkorexia Is More Than a Buzzword Mario Diaz said he was losing his memory and struggling to breathe, and became emotional when he said he's no longer able to do things with his family. \"The worst part is showing up for work out there and getting pasted because they didn't tell us,\" said Diaz. \"They weren't forthright in sharing what they know.\" The workers told us that \"over and over,\" the Department of Energy and the contractor on site told them the readings for harmful materials were safe. \"We're told daily that it's safe,\" said a man who currently works at Hanford. \"[That] there's nothing to worry about.\" Ronan Farrow with current and former workers from the Hanford Nuclear Site. NBC News \"They're a bunch of liars,\" said a female employee. Former workers also said that in the past they were almost never allowed to opt for protective gear, like the supplied air tanks recommended by many experts. \"They wouldn't let you have it,\" alleged a former worker. Several told us they were discouraged from seeking safety equipment, and threatened with losing work if they insisted. The DOE says it has no tolerance for retaliation. The Hanford Challenge, a local watchdog group, says that at least three deaths have a documented link to exposure at Hanford, including Gary Sall's. Sall died in 2011 after descending into dementia, which was diagnosed as \"work-related.\" Some Washington state officials are now intervening, including Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib, who has pledged to investigate and called the federal government's response \"an absolute scandal.\" \"When you think about the risk not only to workers but also to our water supply,\" Habib told NBC News, \"it's like a Stephen King novel. This is something that I think everyone in the country should be thinking about.\" Attorney General Bob Ferguson is taking an even more unusual step \u2014 suing the federal government. Said Ferguson, \"They've known for decades. It's been going on year after year, report after report. Ferguson said he considered the federal government's lack of action \"unforgivable.\" \"And to be candid, they have to live with themselves on that,\" said Ferguson. \"I ask the question all the time, 'How many more workers have to get sick at Hanford before they do something about it? How many?' Please ask them. I really want to know.\" NBC News asked a DOE official that very question during a visit to Hanford. The DOE granted us rare access to the highly restricted site, and an interview with Deputy Assistant Secretary Mark Whitney. Whitney, who has since left the DOE for the private sector, said that all Hanford workers who have been referred to medical evaluation to date have been returned to work. NBC noted that many workers who have not returned to work are seriously, even terminally ill, and asked Whitney if the DOE maintains that these illnesses are not related to on-the-job exposures. \"I wish we had a more complete understanding of those circumstances,\" said Whitney. \"A lot of effort the last couple years has gone into strengthening our efforts to deal with the potential vapor exposure issue.\" NBC then showed Whitney a copy of Diana Gegg's medical assessment, in which doctors say her serious, possibly terminal illnesses are a direct result of her exposure at Hanford, and asked him for comment. Said Whitney, \"I'm not a medical professional and can't provide a qualified medical opinion.\" Whitney says the DOE is \"strengthening communication\" with Hanford workers, and in 2016 invested $50 million in improving air monitoring. At Hanford, however, a subcontractor who was monitoring the air next to a set of waste tanks refused to tell NBC News what kind of readings he was getting. \"Sorry, but I'm not allowed to discuss that,\" said the subcontractor. Whitney said the DOE has taken more than 170,000 measurements of the breathing zones in Hanford's tank farms, and never found measurements higher than the permitted occupational exposure limits. NBC, however, has documents showing DOE readings from Hanford in 2009 that are far in excess of occupational limits. Mercury was measured at 473 percent above limits, and ammonia was measured at 1800 percent above limits \u2014 and workers were not told. \"I'm not aware of what workers were told or were not or those readings,\" said Whitney. \"Potentially those measurements were taken at the top of a 20 or 40-foot stack where workers would not be.\" But a DOE study from 2014 found a significant risk of dangerous exposure at that distance from the source of vapor. \"Clearly, almost 30 percent of this concentration \u2026 might by highly irritating even under very brief exposures occurring over 30 feet from the source.\" Susannah Frame, investigative reporter at Seattle NBC affiliate KING, says the risk goes beyond workers at the site, and includes the risk that a tank could explode and contaminate a large area. That risk was originally raised by a government nuclear board. Said Frame, \"If you care about people that are doing the work of this country that is needed so that we don't have a nuclear disaster, you should care about Hanford. \" \"Our lives don't matter,\" said Seth Ellingsworth. \"Our health does not matter. We are simply a business decision. It costs more money to protect us than to fight us, to deal with us being sick.\" Washington River Protection Solutions, the contractor that runs Hanford for the DOE, has now reached an agreement with workers' unions to provide air tanks to all workers. Experts told NBC News that the masks can help \u2014 but that they can also be withdrawn by the government at any time. They also say it doesn't solve the broader safety problems underscored by 24 years of DOE studies about the risks of working at Hanford. Ronan Farrow ",

    "text": "A man in Tennessee recorded video of his drive through a remarkable Tennessee wildfire. Rain had begun to fall in some areas, but experts predicted it would not be enough to end the relentless drought that has spread across several Southern states and provided fuel for fires now burning for weeks in states including Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina . CBS Knoxville affiliate WVLT-TV reports at least 14,000 people had been evacuated as of Tuesday morning, and structures including a 16-story hotel remain on fire. So far, few injuries have been reported. The storms appeared to be taking aim at the nearly 28,000-acre Rough Ridge Fire in north Georgia and the nearly 25,000-acre Rock Mountain Fire that began in Georgia and then spread deep into North Carolina . In Gatlinburg, Tennessee, officials said hundreds of homes and other buildings, including a 16-story hotel, were damaged or destroyed by flames. Emergency officials ordered evacuations in downtown Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge and in other areas of Sevier County near the Smoky Mountains while crews continue to battle the blaze, which also had crept to the edge of the Dollywood theme park. No deaths have been reported, though several people were injured, emergency officials said. Fires Burning Now...based on a map from TN Dept. of Agriculture / Forestry https://t.co/yUhHE45Mla #local8wx pic.twitter.com/oqDqGFTG1H \u2014 Local 8 News (@wvlt) November 29, 2016 Officials say there are about 1,200 people sheltering at the Gatlinburg Community Center and the Rocky Top Sports Park. Several other shelters have opened to house those forced from their homes. TV broadcasts showed residents streaming out of town just as rain started to wet roads. Workers at an aquarium evacuated because of the wildfires were concerned about the thousands of animals housed there. Ryan DeSears, general manager of Ripley\u2019s Aquarium of the Smokies, told WBIR-TV the building was still standing and all workers had been evacuated late Monday. However, he said workers were anxious to return to check on the well-being of the 10,518 animals. The rain forecast \u201cputs the bull\u2019s-eye of the greatest amounts right at the bull\u2019s-eye of where we\u2019ve been having our greatest activity,\u201d said Dave Martin, deputy director of operations for fire and aviation management with the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. The projected rainfall amounts \u201creally lines up with where we need it,\u201d Martin said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re all knocking on wood.\u201d After weeks of punishing drought, any rain that falls should be soaked up quickly, forecasters said. It will provide some relief but won\u2019t end the drought - or the fire threat, they said. Drought conditions will likely persist, authorities said. The problem is that rainfall amounts have been 10 to 15 inches below normal during the past three months in many parts of the South, authorities said. \u201cI think we racked up deficits that are going to be too much to overcome with just one storm system,\u201d said Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. \u201cI would say it\u2019s way too early to say \u2018Yes, this drought is over,\u2019\u201d Svoboda said. \u201cDoes it put a dent in it? Yes, but we have a long ways to go.\u201d Troopers walked into areas of Gatlinburg, Tn that were surrounded by fire to remove those who were trapped by flames. pic.twitter.com/9r2lkAVy19 \u2014 TN Highway Patrol (@TNHighwayPatrol) November 29, 2016 The rain also brings danger because strong winds at the leading edge of the storms can topple trees and limbs that can kill and injure firefighters, he said. In Mississippi, trees were reported downed in nearly 20 counties across the state. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts of more than 50 mph were reported and more than 2 inches of rain fell in some areas. Power outages peaked at more than 23,000 statewide in Mississippi. Powerlines downed by winds sparked grass fires in four counties, said Greg Flynn, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The storms moved across Alabama on Monday night and fell on Georgia during the overnight hours. High wind warnings were issued for mountainous areas in northern parts of Georgia. In South Carolina, the stormy forecast was giving hope to firefighters battling a blaze in the northwest corner of the state. The South Carolina Forestry Commission hopes to contain the Pinnacle Mountain fire by the middle of next week. More rain was expected Tuesday night and Wednesday morning in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

As Colombian investigators tried Tuesday to pin down the cause and retrieve the bodies, Brazilian President Michel Temer declared three days of national mourning and his countrymen braced for a series of wrenching funerals. The plane operated by LaMia which crashed on approach to Medellin, Colombia, on Monday night. MATT VARLEY / Reuters, file Meanwhile, in a show of sportsmanship, the Colombian club Atl\u00e9tico Nacional that the Brazilians were flying down to play in South America's second biggest soccer tournament asked organizers to award the doomed team the title. Founded in 1973 and based in the city of Chapeco (pop. 210,000), Chapecoense was little known outside of Brazil until Monday, when their chartered plane crashed around 10 p.m. ET while on its way from Santa Cruz in Bolivia to Medellin's international airport . Operated by LaMia, the plane was about 18 miles from its destination when for reasons still unclear it went down in a mountainous jungle area, killing 75 of the people on board, said Gen. Jose Acevedo, who heads the local police force. Wreckage of the LaMia jet on Tuesday. Luis Benavides / AP Foul weather conditions were reported at the time of the crash and rescue operations were suspended overnight due to heavy rain. \"We are working fast, in part to relieve the pain of the families of these victims who came to play a sport, but found death here in Colombia,\" a spokesman for Colombia's national Risk Management and Disaster Unit said after removing 50 of the bodies. Alfredo Bocanegra, the head of Colombia's civil aviation agency, said that communication with Bolivian officials suggested the plane was experiencing electrical problems. Investigators were also checking reported claims by a cabin crew member who said the plane had run out of fuel.

A doctor told Colombian TV that Ruschel was being operated on after suffering multiple injuries to his limbs and a lumbar spine fracture.

NELSON ALMEIDA / AFP - Getty Images Officials initially put the number of survivors at five \u2014 but police told NBC News that Zampier was found alive some time following the other group. \"What was supposed to be a celebration has turned into a tragedy,\" Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez said from the search and rescue command center. In addition to players and coaches, several journalists were among the 72 passengers and nine crew members on board the jet.

Guillermo Ossa / Reuters Local radio said the same plane had transported Argentina's national squad for a match earlier this month in Brazil, and had previously had also flown Venezuela's national team to competitions. Chapecoense had played for years in Brazil's lower leagues before breaking out in 2014 and making it into the soccer-mad country's top Serie A league. Last week, the team qualified for the Copa Sudamericana finals \u2014 the equivalent of the UEFA Europa League tournament \u2014 after defeating Argentina's San Lorenzo squad.

MARCIO CUNHA / EPA They were considered the underdogs. \"The Brazilian soccer family is mourning,\" Brazilian soccer legend Pele said in a statement. \"This is a tragedy.\" Chapecoense' s best-known player was Cleber Santana, a midfielder whose best years were spent in Spain with Athletico Madrid and Mallorca. The team's coach, Caio Junior, had previously managed some of Brazil's biggest clubs, Botafogo, Flamengo and Palmeiras among them.

It centered on a protester who had burned a flag outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas as part of a political demonstration against Reagan administration policies. The protester, Gregory Johnson, was charged under a state law that criminalized desecrating the flag and appealed his conviction. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The majority ruled that Mr. Johnson\u2019s act was symbolic speech protected by the Constitution, effectively striking down state laws against flag desecration across the country. In response, Congress swiftly enacted a federal law against such desecration, but in 1990 the same five-justice majority struck it down , too. Just one of the justices who participated in the flag-burning cases, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, is still on the court today; he sided with the majority that struck down the bans. Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February and whose seat Mr. Trump will get to fill because Republican senators refused to hold a hearing for President Obama\u2019s nominee for the vacancy, was also in the majority. After the 1989 decision, supporters of a flag-burning ban tried to enact an amendment to the Constitution to make an exception to the First Amendment, but it twice fell short in the Senate . The issue flared again a decade ago. In 2005, Hillary Clinton, a senator from New York at that time, co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act . Arguing that desecration of the symbol \u201cmay amount to fighting words or a direct threat to the physical and emotional well-being\u201d of onlookers, the bill would have banned flag burning if abusing the symbol was \u201cintended to incite a violent response rather than make a political statement.\u201d The crafters of that bill sought to frame it as a compromise and an alternative to an amendment, saying \u201cthe Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by free and democratic nations.\u201d But Congress did not act on the legislation. The following year, when the Senate again tried to approve a constitutional amendment to empower Congress to ban flag desecration and it fell one vote short of the necessary two-thirds majority, Mrs. Clinton was among those who voted against that measure .

(Photo: Michael Patrick, Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel) KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Flames tore through the Great Smoky Mountains, killing at least three people, scorching hundreds of homes and businesses and sending more than 14,000 fleeing from the resort towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. Tourists and residents scrambled Monday night and early Tuesday to outrun the blaze, which was pushed from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into the towns by wind gusts of almost 90 mph. Drivers navigating narrow mountain roads shot video footage showing flames swooping in from the shoulders of the roadway at the height of the evacuation. Wildfires have ravaged the Southeast throughout the month, and the acrid haze of smoke has settled in across the region. But emergency responders seemed blindsided by the intensity of the wind-whipped flames Monday night. A Gatlinburg fire official said more than 20 fire calls came within 15 minutes at the peak of the chaos. As day broke Tuesday, the extent of the damage came into grim focus. Buildings were reduced to charred shells, and many beloved tourist destinations reported heavy damage or complete destruction. The devastation grabbed the attention of millions of people across the globe who have memories of vacations spent in the mountains of the country's most visited national park. Tennessee wildfires threaten resort towns of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge The center of Gatlinburg\u2019s tourist district escaped heavy damage, but \"it's the apocalypse\" on either side, said Newmansville Volunteer Fire Department Lt. Bobby Balding. Although rooms at the Dollywood theme park and resort were evacuated as a precaution, Dolly Parton said Tuesday that the area had been spared. At shelters, hundreds of survivors wondered how much they had lost. Shari Deason and her boyfriend scooped up their 14-month-old son, William, when the evacuation order came, but they left everything else behind at the Bedrock Motel \u2014 even William\u2019s diapers. \"I don't know if we've got a room to go back to,\" Deason said. \"I don't know if we've got anything to go back to.\" Posted!

    "text": "Nov 29 2016, 2:46 pm ET Donald Trump Proposes Two Illegal Responses to Flag Burning by Ari Melber advertisement As the incoming head of the federal government, Donald Trump's words matter. When a president-elect advocates two blatantly illegal punishments for Americans engaged in free speech, as Trump did Tuesday morning, it is significant. Trump's unusual statement has an immediate impact on civic norms and the political climate, regardless of whether one views it as a ploy for attention or a deliberate step towards illegally cracking down on free speech. \"Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag,\" Trump wrote on Twitter, \"if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\" There are no criminal consequences for flag burning, however, because the Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag burning is a type of political expression. That means it is protected from government punishment by the First Amendment, regardless of what Congress or the president thinks. Legal experts say it's not a close call. \"This is protected speech,\" said Columbia law professor David Pozen. \"The Supreme Court struck down flag burning laws.\" Related: Analysis: Why Trump's Reliance on Debunked Theories Raises Concern While Trump's remarks did not cite any actual acts of flag burning, the topic was a major legal and political controversy in the late 1980s. The issue came before the Court twice, in fact, because Congress and state legislatures separately tried to ban flag burning. Pozen, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and Judge Merrick Garland, emphasized the flag cases are settled law. \"It's very hard to imagine the Court overturning them now,\" he tells NBC News. While it is flatly unconstitutional to jail a citizen for burning the flag, Trump's suggestion of stripping citizenship in response is even more extreme. Asked if such a punishment has been contemplated for acts of political dissent, constitutional law professor Frederick Lawrence told NBC News, \"First time I've ever heard of it.\" \"It's disturbing to suggest we should punish speech we disagree with,\" said Lawrence, a visiting professor at Yale Law School, adding that it is especially concerning coming from \"the ultimate head of the federal government.\" Related: Can Trump Continue to Bypass Press With Twitter in White House? It is unconstitutional to strip citizenship for most crimes, and the Supreme Court has overruled attempts to do so for more grave matters than flag burning. In a broad 1958 ruling, the Supreme Court held that the government could not revoke citizenship as punishment for desertion. \"The deprivation of citizenship is not a weapon that the Government may use to express its displeasure at a citizen's conduct, however reprehensible that conduct may be,\" wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren. The case struck down such an effort as a violation of the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, noting the repressive instinct to strip citizenship is a \"form of punishment more primitive than torture.\" The only way an American citizen can lose citizenship, under federal law, is by taking explicit action to \"voluntarily\" show intent of \"relinquishing\" citizenship. Examples include formally declaring allegiance to another state, renouncing citizenship before a U.S. consular officer while abroad, or taking violent action to overthrow or \"levy war against\" the United States.

(Photo: Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports) The outcome of the Ohio State-Michigan showdown had a significant impact on the\u00a0College Football Playoff picture. The overtime loss by the Wolverines became\u00a0Washington's gain as the Huskies moved into the No. 4 spot in the playoff committee's rankings Tuesday. Alabama continues its stranglehold on the top has it has for each of the last five weeks. Following the Tide are Ohio State and Clemson. The Wolverines, previously in the third spot, dropped to fifth Rounding out the top 10 are Wisconsin, Penn State, Colorado, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. The last weekend of the season should clarify things. Washington and Colorado will meet in the Pac-12 title game, Wisconsin and Penn State square off for the Big Ten championship, Clemson faces Virginia Tech with the ACC crown on the line and the winner between\u00a0Oklahoma and Oklahoma State will capture\u00a0the Big 12. Ohio State might have the strongest resume of all the contenders with wins against Oklahoma and Wisconsin on the road, plus the\u00a0win against Michigan. But\u00a0the Buckeyes won't be able to enhance its position with the committee after missing the Big Ten title game. College Football Playoff committee chairman Kirby Hocutt seemed to downplay the possibility of the Buckeyes getting passed by either\u00a0Penn State or Wisconsin. In the case of the Nittany Lions, which beat Ohio State, Hocutt said there is significant separation between the teams.\u00a0He added the committee doesn't \"look ahead\" to the possibility of Penn State winning the conference champion in its ranking. Clemson looks to be in good shape to make the field should it win. The same with Washington. But if either or both should lose that would likely open the door for Big Ten champion or possibly Colorado. The current rating seem to indicate the Big 12 will miss the playoff for the second time in the three years of the system. Oklahoma and Oklahoma State are behind four Big Ten teams and the two Pac-12 teams playing this weekend. Also noteworthy in the rankings is Florida State being one spot ahead of Louisville at No. 12. That likely indicates the Seminoles will head to the Orange Bowl if Clemson wins the ACC. Virginia Tech would take the spot if it wins. No. 18 Western Michigan is two spots ahead of Navy for the Group of Five berth. The Broncos and Midshipmen play in their respective conference championship games this weekend. If they both win, it's possible the committee will wait until Dec. 10 \u2014\u00a0when Navy faces Army \u2014 to determine who gets the nod. The top four teams in final ranking of the committee on Dec. 4 will play in the College Football Playoff. The semifinals will take place on Dec. 31 at the Peach Bowl and\u00a0Fiesta Bowl.

    "text": "By John Wagner November 29 at 6:48 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner It came across Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed early Tuesday morning, seemingly out of the blue: a demand that flag burners should face consequences, including jail and maybe even the loss of their citizenship. The Republican president-elect\u2019s tweet rattled civil liberties and legal experts, who were quick to note that the Supreme Court ruled long ago that flag desecration is considered free speech and that it is unconstitutional to punish someone by stripping their citizenship. But whatever Trump had in mind, the president-elect\u2019s outburst underscored a key aspect of his three-week-old transition: He is continuing to cater to his base \u2014 the largely white, working-class voters that propelled him to the White House \u2014 with relatively few overtures to the majority of voters who cast ballots against him. \u201cTrump won rural America, where support of the flag is a big issue,\u201d said Scott Reed, a longtime Republican strategist who served as Bob Dole\u2019s campaign manager in 1996. \u201cA lot of those homes that had Trump signs out front were also flying American flags. This is clearly part of his base politics.\u201d The same dynamic will play out Thursday when Trump kicks off a \u201cThank You Tour\u201d with a campaign-style rally of supporters in Ohio. Aides have suggested the tour will include other states where the Republican prevailed, including some traditionally Democratic ones where he won in part by driving up the rural white vote. An attendee wears an American flag on his hat ahead of a campaign rally with Donald Trump on Nov. 3 in Selma, N.C. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News) [ Trump suggests revoking flag-burners\u2019 citizenship, despite constitutional protections ] Since defeating Hillary Clinton in electoral college votes on Nov.\u00a08, Trump has made some efforts to reach out beyond his base with Cabinet picks that have pleased the GOP establishment. Those include Elaine Chao, a former labor secretary and the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whom Trump announced as his transportation secretary on Tuesday. But there has been little in Trump\u2019s actions so far to suggest that he is courting the Democrats who voted against him, nor working to shore up an approval ranking still in negative territory. He has instead spent recent days making unfounded claims about illegal votes costing him the popular vote against Clinton and attacking CNN and other media for how they cover him \u2014 the kind of rhetoric that fired up his supporters during a bruising campaign season in which he also rallied on illegal immigration and lost manufacturing jobs. Trump did not say Tuesday what inspired his tweet about flag-burning, but it came just days after a college in western Massachusetts decided to stop flying the U.S. flag in response to students there burning one in protest of Trump\u2019s election. Hundreds of veterans and others gathered Sunday to protest the decision by Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass. A segment on the controversy aired Tuesday on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d shortly before Trump\u2019s 6:55\u00a0a.m. tweet went out. \u201cNobody should be allowed to burn the American flag \u2014 if they do, there must be consequences \u2014 perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet that by late afternoon Tuesday had been \u201cliked\u201d by more than 145,000 people. In a Washington where carefully vetted statements from the White House have long been the norm, this was clearly a different approach. \u201cThis is going to be one of the new dynamics of this incoming administration,\u201d said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cIt speaks to how Trump is able to generate a national conversation in 140\u00a0characters. . . . The polite society part of Washington is going to be scratching their heads and sometimes flat on their backs.\u201d Tuesday was also not the first time Trump has suggested a narrower view of the First Amendment and the rights it affords. During the campaign, he also blacklisted reporters from The Washington Post and other news outlets who fell out of his favor and suggested that he would \u201copen up\u201d libel laws to make it easier to sue the news media. In 1989, the Supreme Court struck down on First Amendment grounds a Texas statute banning flag-burning. Congress responded swiftly by passing the Flag Protection Act of 1989 \u2014 a law that was invalidated a year later by another Supreme Court ruling. Among the justices who supported the right burn a flag in both cases was the late Antonin Scalia, whom Trump has said is \u201cin the mold\u201d of those he\u2019d like to appoint to the court. \u201cIf it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag,\u201d Scalia said an event last year. But, he said: \u201cI am not king.\u201d Nearly a half-century ago, in 1967, the court also ruled that citizens cannot be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. Aware of those rulings, Republican leaders in Washington were loath to offer support for Trump\u2019s view. McConnell said the Supreme Court had spoken on the subject of flag-burning, adding that the Constitution protects even \u201cunpleasant speech.\u201d During a television appearance shortly after Trump\u2019s tweet, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested that Congress is unlikely to revisit the issue of a constitutional amendment to overturn the court\u2019s rulings. \u201cWe have a First Amendment right, but where I come from, you honor the flag,\u201d McCarthy said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cIf someone wanted to show their First Amendment right, I\u2019d be afraid for their safety, but we\u2019ll protect our First Amendment.\u201d Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller defended his boss\u2019s position during an appearance on CNN. \u201cFlag-burning should be illegal,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d [ From enemies to potential allies: How the Trump-Romney divide began to heal ] The issue appeared to be an uncomfortable one for some in Trump\u2019s party, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). McCain initially told reporters on Capitol Hill that he thinks there should be \u201csome punishment\u201d for flag-burning despite his respect for the court rulings. But McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, grew testy as reporters continued to pepper him with questions about Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cMy time is devoted to trying to make sure this nation is secured, not to comment on every comment of Mr. Trump,\u201d McCain said. The flag-burning debate has been rekindled a number of times in the past quarter-century. A 2005 bill sponsored by Clinton, then a senator from New York, would have outlawed flag desecration when the intent was found to be a threat to public safety. Violations would have been punishable by up to a year in jail and a $100,000 fine. A year later, the Senate narrowly failed to approve a constitutional amendment banning flag-burning, with McConnell among those voting in opposition. On Tuesday, several liberal advocacy groups voiced dismay that Trump was seeking to revisit those debates. \u201cOne of the founding principles of our nation is tolerance of peaceful protest,\u201d said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2011, a State of the First Amendment survey found that 39\u00a0percent supported a constitutional amendment to make flag-burning illegal while 58\u00a0percent opposed it. The survey presented brief arguments for both positions before posing the question. Earlier polls that did not explicitly mention First Amendment issues found more support for making flag-burning illegal. In a 2006 Gallup-USA Today poll, 56\u00a0percent said they would favor a constitutional amendment, while 41\u00a0percent said they were opposed. Reed, the longtime Republican consultant who now works for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Trump was reflecting the views of his base on the issue. \u201cThis guy\u2019s got his finger on the pulse of the country more than most,\u201d Reed said Scott Clement contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

He also started investing in the movie business and bought a house in Bel-Air. He is engaged to the actress Louise Linton, who would be his third wife. He told The Times in May that he has focused in recent years on the \u201c West Coast economy ,\u201d although he added that he was not turning his back on Wall Street. Mr. Mnuchin was part of a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government in 2009. He became chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation\u2019s largest small-business lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid. During his tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed a complaint with the federal government , alleging that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods. Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Trump have known each other for years \u2014 not always under the best of circumstances. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s company helped to finance construction of a Trump project in Chicago. In 2008, Mr. Trump sued Dune and other lenders to extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled. Mr. Mnuchin has never worked in government, but Treasury secretaries are often drawn from the private sector. He would become the third Goldman alumnus to serve in the job, after Henry M. Paulson Jr., under President George W. Bush; and Robert E. Rubin, under President Bill Clinton. ",

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Nov 30, 2016 9:40 AM EST President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he is nominating investor and former banker Wilbur Ross as his commerce secretary.\u00a0 The billionaire who will be running the Commerce Department \u201cWilbur Ross is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal. Together, we will take on the special interests and stand up for American jobs,\u201d said the president-elect in a statement released by his transition team.\u00a0 Chicago Cubs end 108-year drought Ross said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to join the incoming administration, and said he looks forward to \u201cworking especially closely with Steve Mnuchin to implement the economic programs which we have developed jointly to implement the President-elect\u2019s strategy for accelerating our economic growth.\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Trump also announced his pick for the deputy commerce secretary: Todd Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team.\u00a0 Ricketts is an \u201cimmensely successful businessman with unparalleled knowledge of the finance industry,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his statement. \u201cThe incredible job he and the Ricketts family did in the purchase and turnaround of the Chicago Cubs \u2013 one perfect step after another, leading to the World Championship, is what I want representing our people.\u201d\u00a0 The Cubs co-owner said he was \u201chonored\u201d for the chance to serve Mr. Trump.\u00a0 \u201cAdvancing practical policies that promote economic opportunity is critical to making America great again,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cI\u2019m eager to begin this important work and serving with Wilbur Ross to implement President-elect Trump\u2019s economic agenda, which will improve the lives of all Americans.\u201d\u00a0 Trump continues meetings to fill his Cabinet An ally during Trump\u2019s election campaign, the 79-year-old Ross is the billionaire chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructurings.\u00a0 As Commerce secretary, Ross would serve as the country\u2019s chief business promoter and overseer of trade and investment issues, in addition to running such major agencies as the Census Bureau and Patent and Trademark Office. During the campaign, Ross often appeared on business news shows to explain Trump\u2019s positions, sometimes softening or downplaying the candidate\u2019s protectionist trade policies.\u00a0 Ross built his estimated $2.9 billion fortune by snapping up distressed industrial businesses, such as steelmaker LTV. While that helped save jobs in hard-hit Rust Belt states, workers often bore the cost in the form of pared-back retirement and health care benefits. That has led some to\u00a0 label him \u00a0a \u201cvulture investor\u201d more interested in stripping corporate assets for profit than reviving ailing companies.\u00a0 But Ross rejects the label, saying the companies he invests in would be liquidated without the financial backing. More recently, his rhetoric has also echoed that of President-elect Trump\u2019s campaign speeches. Ross might be best known to voters as the owner of Sago Mine, a West Virginia coal mine where a dozen miners lost their lives in a 2006 explosion. He called that tragedy \u201cthe worst week of my life.\u201d (As commerce secretary, he would not oversee mining regulations -- that falls under the Department of Labor.) Ross also has business ties in China -- he told Bloomberg News in October that his company has a joint venture with a large electric utility in China, and he has recently visited China to scout out more investment deals. Ross and the president-elect may have some disagreements over trade policies, given Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist policies. He has proposed tariffs has high as 45 percent on Chinese imports, and he has also said he would call China a currency manipulator. Ross has said that the tariff comments are essentially a negotiating tactic. Both Ross and Mr. Trump have, however been critical of NAFTA and blamed the trade deal for job losses in the U.S. Ross is the latest in the group of post-Thanksgiving weekend Cabinet decisions from Mr. Trump. Earlier Tuesday, his team\u00a0 announced Rep. Tom Price (R-Georgia) \u00a0as health and human services secretary, and Mr. Trump is expected to name\u00a0 former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao \u00a0as his transportation secretary. He has also selected Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, though that decision has yet to be formally announced.

    "text": "By Michael Kranish November 29 at 4:21 PM Follow @PostKranish Shortly after Donald Trump won the presidential election, one of Mitt Romney\u2019s closest friends sent him an urgent plea over email: Move past the campaign hostility and, for the \u201cbest interests of the country,\u201d consider joining the new president\u2019s team as his secretary of state. Then the friend, Stephen Pagliuca, who worked with Romney at Bain Capital and has socialized with Trump, urged advisers to the president-elect to press Trump to name Romney for the State Department job. Pagliuca\u2019s messages, which he sent shortly after he saw that Romney\u2019s name was being floated, are part of the behind-the-scenes effort to heal a seemingly unbridgeable divide between two bitter foes, one a beloved figure of the Republican establishment and the other who upended his party hierarchy and won the White House as an avowed outsider. During the campaign, Romney called Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud,\u201d and Trump said Romney was a \u201cchoker\u201d who walked \u201clike a penguin.\u201d But Pagliuca, a co-owner of the Boston Celtics and a Democrat, said he knew something that others didn\u2019t. When he golfed with Trump at a Boston-area course some years ago, Trump had talked at length about how much he admired Bain Capital, a private equity firm that Romney led until 1999. President-elect Donald Trump sat down for dinner with former Massachusetts gov. Mitt Romney, who is a \"top flight\" candidate for secretary of state, according to Trump. (Reuters) Today, as Pagliuca and other Romney backers see it, Trump, 70, and the 69-year-old Romney had far more in common than many realize: Both came to prominence as risk takers and dealmakers, and both have spent much of their lives seeking to emulate and outdo the success of their fathers. Trump\u2019s father, Fred, was a New York City developer, and Romney\u2019s father, George, was a governor of Michigan who unsuccessfully sought the presidency. This shared background may not be enough to persuade Trump to nominate Romney to be his secretary of state. Nevertheless, Trump has made clear that Romney is a candidate for the job, and the two met Tuesday night for nearly two hours over dinner at Jean-Georges restaurant in New York, accompanied by the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, who is slated to be White House chief of staff. Speaking to reporters, Romney sounded nothing like the man who earlier this year declared Trump a fraud, remarking instead that he was deeply impressed with the president-elect. He did not apologize for his earlier criticism. Romney said that his conversation with Trump was \u201cenlightening and interesting and engaging\u201d and that he had been \u201cvery impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s victory speech, which called for inclusion. \u201cBy the way, it is not easy winning [the presidency]. I know that myself. He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful,\u201d Romney said. The former Massachusetts governor said he has been impressed by Trump\u2019s transition operation and by the people selected for other Cabinet posts. Romney said that all of those factors \u201cgive me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to\u201d a bright future. Donald Trump's senior adviser and former campaign manager took to the television airwaves on Nov. 27 to lobby publicly against former Massachusetts gov. Mitt Romney as secretary of state. But Trump is set to meet with Romney again on Nov. 29. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s consideration of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee has drawn outrage from some, but advocates argue that Romney\u2019s background and intellect would provide a crucial balance for the foreign policy team. \u201cI think Trump sees that,\u201d Pagliuca said. Romney, meanwhile, sees the possible job not just as a way to fulfill his desire to serve, but also to salve deep wounds, having lost both the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and the 2012 general election campaign for president. \u201cRomney\u2019s motivation, I suspect, is that losing twice still stings, so achieving a prominent position like secretary of state would wash away some of the bitterness of losing two presidential elections,\u201d said Rob Gray, who served as a key adviser during Romney\u2019s Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign and governorship. A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Romney associates said they see him as a person who would make up for Trump\u2019s deficiencies. \u201cI would describe a potential relationship as complementary,\u201d said Marc Wolpow, who worked with Romney at Bain Capital from 1990 to 1999 and also has met Trump. \u201cI think if you would merge both of them you\u2019d have the perfect president. . . . Mitt could be the good cop to the bad cops that surround Trump.\u201d Wolpow said the two men probably see qualities in the other that each is missing. Romney, he said, failed to connect with blue-collar voters and made \u201cexcuses\u201d for his wealth, but he possesses the diplomatic skills to be secretary of state. Trump hit it off with many average voters and cited his financial fortune as part of his appeal, but his brusque manner could be problematic in handling world affairs. \u201cMitt has the brilliance, the analytical mind, the temperament,\u201d Wolpow said. \u201cI think Trump sees in Mitt . . . qualities that Trump doesn\u2019t have, and I think Mitt sees in Trump qualities that Mitt doesn\u2019t have.\u201d Associates said Romney\u2019s Mormon faith also plays a role. Although they said Romney would not try to use the position of secretary of state to directly influence people to consider converting to his religion, the job would be one of the highest-profile government positions ever held by a Mormon, which could help the church\u2019s effort to gain acceptance around the world. Trump, for his part, has a history of working with Mormons and has said he values their work ethic. Trump once counted as his closest friend and business associate a Mormon named Stephen Hyde, who oversaw Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casino empire until he died in a 1989 helicopter crash. Trump, in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year, said he admired the way Hyde devoted himself to his work and his church, recalling that the company deducted Hyde\u2019s tithing directly from his paycheck. \u201cEvery month he would give a big percentage of his salary to the Mormon church, which I always respected a lot,\u201d Trump said. Romney\u2019s moralistic sense of responsibility couldn\u2019t be more different from Trump\u2019s self-styled playboy lifestyle, which has included two divorces and a high-profile affair. But Trump and Romney share a trait that is important to both men: Trump, whose brother died of symptoms related to alcoholism, and Romney share an aversion to alcohol; both men have said they never drink. Romney, like Trump, does not have deep experience in foreign affairs. He served as a Mormon missionary in France, did some deals around the world and oversaw the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. During the 2012 campaign, he relied heavily on a group of foreign policy and military advisers, not always successfully. During a visit, he stunned British organizers of the Olympics by saying their efforts at security were \u201cdisconcerting.\u201d The Guardian headlined a story about his visit, \u201cMitt Romney visits London while stumbling on almost every front.\u201d Romney famously labeled Russia as the No. 1 geopolitical foe of the United States, a view mocked by some at the time but later seen as prescient, given Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and other actions. Trump has taken a rosier view, signaling that he wants to reset Russian relations. Romney, whose father was born in Mexico \u2014 where the family had moved to escape anti-polygamy laws in the United States \u2014 has urged closer ties between the United States and its southern neighbor. Trump has promised to build a wall between the nations and make Mexico pay for it, and he proposed banning most Muslims from entering the country. That prompted Romney earlier this year to say Trump \u201ccreates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants.\u201d The two agree, however, on many other foreign policy issues, such as moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a top priority for Trump. Romney said in 2012 that he would declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, a pledge duplicated by Trump. When Trump endorsed Romney in 2012, Romney said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d because Trump \u201cshares my concern about China \u2014 the fact that China has been able to run roughshod over many industries in this country. Presidents have complained about it, but really haven\u2019t taken action to stop China from taking away our jobs.\u201d Trump initially mocked Romney\u2019s plan to have 11 million illegal immigrants \u201cself-deport,\u201d calling it \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cmaniacal,\u201d warning that it would cause the Republican Party to lose many Hispanic supporters. But Trump eventually one-upped Romney on his proposal, calling for forced deportation and saying some Mexican immigrants were criminals and \u201crapists\u201d and \u201csome, I assume, are good people.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s assertion that Romney walked like a penguin, the president-elect recently looked at Romney and saw a different visage. He said Romney, who is invariably formal, well-coifed and finely dressed, \u201clooks the part\u201d of secretary of state. Read more: ",

Associated Press The Supreme Court is expected to rule early next year\u00a0in the case of Jennings vs. Rodriguez.\u00a0 The Supreme Court is expected to rule early next year\u00a0in the case of Jennings vs. Rodriguez.\u00a0 (Associated Press) David G. Savage Contact Reporter A Supreme Court dispute over the government\u2019s power to indefinitely jail immigrants facing deportation has taken on added significance with the election of Donald Trump , who has vowed to\u00a0remove millions of foreigners in the country illegally. The case, to be argued Wednesday, pits civil libertarians and federal\u00a0judges in California\u00a0against the Obama administration, which is defending the government\u2019s broad power in dealing with immigration. At issue is whether immigrants\u00a0fighting deportation have a legal right\u00a0to a bond hearing\u00a0and possible release\u00a0if they are held more than six months while awaiting resolution of their case.\u00a0The immigrants involved include\u00a0longtime legal residents as well as some here illegally. Civil libertarians\u00a0say indefinitely holding such immigrants violates the 5th Amendment guarantee that \u201cno person shall be\u00a0\u2026 deprived of \u2026 liberty \u2026 without due process of law.\u201d In the past, the court has said the word \u201cperson\u201d includes immigrants as well as citizens. They also argue that many of these immigrants have lived and worked legally in the United States\u00a0and are being held for\u00a0long periods over\u00a0minor or nonviolent offenses, including simple drug possession. Government lawyers counter that federal law mandates that noncitizens convicted of crimes \u201cshall be detained.\u201d In the past, the Supreme Court has been closely split on rights for immigrants. In 2001, the justices said the Constitution \u201centitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\u201d By a 5-4 vote, however, they said foreigners facing possible deportation may \u201cbe detained for the brief period\u201d required to decide their immigration case. More recently, federal appeals court\u00a0judges in California and New York have set six months as the limit for what that \u201cbrief period\u201d may constitute. The case before the high court involves a ruling by\u00a0the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which\u00a0upheld a judge\u2019s order in Los Angeles that required the government to give\u00a0a bond hearing to deportable immigrants who are held in jail for more than six months.\u00a0 Civil liberties advocates say that without a limit of that sort,\u00a0the government could wield the threat of indefinite detention\u00a0against immigrants who might be pressured to simply give up and return home rather than spend years behind bars awaiting resolution. The case has drawn greater attention since Trump\u2019s election and may well portend some\u00a0of the legal battles ahead under his administration. In his first TV interview after the election, Trump spoke of arresting and deporting 2 million to 3\u00a0million foreigners who have criminal records. \u201cWhat we're going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records \u2014 gang members, drug dealers. We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million. It could be even 3 million. We are getting them out of our country,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Immigration experts say that number is not limited to people who have committed felonies or violent crimes, but includes many with lesser offenses, including traffic violations. To\u00a0carry out such deportations, federal agents would probably prefer to have a free hand to arrest and keep these immigrants in jail. Officials with Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request\u00a0for comment. Legal experts say a Supreme Court ruling upholding the president\u2019s power to detain immigrants indefinitely would give the new administration greater leverage in cracking down against illegal immigration. \u201cI thought this case was important before, but obviously it is more important with an administration that wants to do even more deportations,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. \u201cYou would think mandatory detention is for people with very severe crimes, but it is not. It can be for relatively low-level charges.\u201d Each day, more than 40,000 people are held in immigration jails because they have a criminal conviction on their records or because they entered the country seeking asylum, according to the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union. The court orders do not call for \u201cmass release,\u201d but only for \u201cindividualized hearings,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, an ACLU attorney from Los Angeles who will argue for the immigrants on Wednesday. He said\u00a0a significant number of the detainees are \u201clawful permanent residents\u201d who had families and worked in California, yet were jailed more than a year before their immigration cases were heard. The lead plaintiff, Alejandro Rodriguez, was brought to this country as an infant and obtained lawful status, but was jailed for possible deportation because of a drug possession and a \u201cjoyriding\u201d conviction as a teenager. After more than three years in jail, he won his immigration case and was released. Arulanantham says immigrants like Rodriguez should be given a hearing before a judge and released on bond if it is decided they are not a danger to the community nor are likely to flee. The court order does not extend to suspected terrorists and \u201cnational security\u201d threats, he noted. But lawyers for the Obama administration urged the high court to throw out the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision, which they said calls for a \u201cdramatic and wholesale revision\u201d of immigration laws. They argued for a hands-off approach by judges. They said the justices should affirm \u201cthe long-standing rule that the political branches have plenary [complete]\u00a0control over which aliens may physically enter the United States and under what circumstances.\u201d It\u2019s possible the eight justices could divide evenly on the new case. If so, they are likely to put off a ruling until a ninth justice is confirmed. Kevin Johnson, dean of the UC Davis Law School, said the election has put the case in\u00a0a new spotlight. \u201cI am more concerned with immigration detention in a Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cDetention will become commonplace for noncitizens placed in removal proceedings. And with the backlog in the immigration courts, it can take years for removal proceedings to be completed.\u201d In their legal briefs for Wednesday\u2019s case, government lawyers warned that allowing these people to be released on bond could allow many of them to escape. It would be time-consuming and costly if agents were forced to track down people who had absconded after their release, they said. The ACLU disagreed, saying the California court orders have been in effect for four years and have not led to such problems. It says\u00a0more than 95% of the people released on bond showed up for their hearing before an immigration judge. The high court\u00a0is expected to rule early next year\u00a0in the case of Jennings vs. Rodriguez.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Brazilian soccer team plane crash , California university leaders urge Trump to embrace students who are in the U.S. illegally , Metro will pay nearly $300 million to company that widened the 405 Freeway , and newly identified bodies of Pearl Harbor victims returned to families for burial .

Grace Beahm /Charleston Post and Courier via Pool The former North Charleston, S.C., police officer charged with murdering an unarmed black man during a traffic stop took the stand Tuesday to testify in his own defense. Michael Slager is accused of gunning down Walter Scott after pulling him over for a broken tail light. If convicted, Slager could face life in prison. The April 2015 incident was captured on two videos \u2014 one from Slager's dashcam showing the traffic stop and a second recorded by a bystander using a cellphone that showed the shooting. Former S.C. Police Officer Indicted On Civil Rights Charges In Death Of Black Man As NPR's Debbie Elliott has reported , \"Video from Slager's dashcam shows the officer at the driver's window, asking for Scott's driver's license and questioning him about documents for the car. After Slager returns to his patrol car, Scott jumps out of the car and runs. Slager gives chase, and there's an off-camera confrontation.\" The cellphone video shows Scott running away in an empty lot when Slager fires eight rounds and shoots him in the back. Once the bystander video was made public, the North Charleston Police Department fired Slager and a grand jury indicted him for murder. On Tuesday, Slager emphasized that he had acted according to his training as a police officer, and that he had been afraid of Scott. He contended, as he has previously, that Scott had taken his Taser stun gun. Article continues after sponsorship Court Gets Unusually Specific On Police Taser Gun Use He also said Scott had \"grabbed a bat \u2014 a bat or a club\" from the car as Slager and another officer pulled him out of the vehicle. Slager said he chased Scott because he \"must have been running for a certain reason.\" He testified that as he tried to handcuff Scott, Scott grabbed his Taser. Slager's voice cracked as he said he had been \"in total fear.\" \"I saw that Taser coming at me,\" he said. \"I fired until the threat was stopped, like I'm trained to do.\" Slager's defense attorney asked him at one point whether Scott had insulted police officers using an expletive during the altercation. Slager said yes. During Slager's testimony, the jury was shown a bystander video of the 2015 incident in which Slager shot and killed Walter Scott.

Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool With Slager on the witness stand, the prosecution played the bystander video for the court. No bat, club or Taser is visible in the grainy footage. During cross-examination, Slager repeatedly said he could not remember details of his thoughts or actions during the moments captured on the video. \"My family's been destroyed by this. [Walter] Scott's family has been destroyed by this,\" Slager said as he ended nearly two hours of testimony. \"It's horrible.\" Slager, who is white, is also facing separate federal civil rights charges over Scott's death. In that indictment , federal prosecutors accuse Slager of deliberately misleading investigators by telling them he had fired his weapon \"while Scott was coming forward at him with a Taser.\" \"In truth and in fact,\" the indictment reads, \"as defendant MICHAEL SLAGER then well knew, he (SLAGER) repeatedly fired his weapon at Scott as Scott was running away from him.\" The city of North Charleston also approved a $6.5 million civil settlement with Scott's family in 2015.

Rescuers working through the night were initially heartened after pulling three passengers alive from the wreckage. But as the hours passed, heavy rainfall and low visibility grounded helicopters and slowed efforts to reach the crash site. Colombia's aviation authority said initial reports suggest the aircraft was suffering electrical problems although investigators were also looking into an account from one of the survivors that the plane ran out of fuel about five minutes from its expected landing at Jose Maria Cordova airport outside Medellin. \"We can't rule out anything. The investigation is ongoing and we're going to await the results,\" said Gustavo Vargas, a retired Bolivian air force general who is president of the airline. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Trump pledged to protect Medicare. His choice for health secretary has other ideas Rep. Tom Price Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be Health and Human Services secretary. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be Health and Human Services secretary. (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press) Noam N. Levey and Noah Bierman Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump reassured voters during his insurgent political campaign that he would protect Medicare , Social Security and other popular federal assistance programs. But in tapping Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to be his Health and Human Services secretary, he has elevated one of the most aggressive proponents of dramatically overhauling the government safety net for seniors and low-income Americans, a long-held conservative\u00a0goal. Trump also took a step toward a potentially explosive political battle over the entitlements, which\u00a0account for\u00a0close to half of all federal spending. Such a battle \u2014 and the threat of benefit cuts to more than 100 million Americans \u2014 risks alienating some of the very working-class voters who fueled Trump\u2019s unexpected victory. His advisors and prospective Cabinet already include\u00a0several figures whose wealth and political connections\u00a0are at odds with\u00a0Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric. \u201cThe pressure here will ramp up significantly,\u201d warned John Lawrence , former chief of staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who has led numerous fights against GOP efforts in\u00a0recent years to overhaul entitlement programs. Donald Trump has chosen Steven Mnuchin, a wealthy Wall Street executive and Hollywood movie producer who served as his campaign finance chairman,\u00a0to be the next Treasury secretary, according to a person familiar with the decision. Mnuchin\u2019s deep roots on Wall Street fit the mold... President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Steven Mnuchin, a wealthy Wall Street executive and Hollywood movie producer who served as his campaign finance chairman,\u00a0to be the next Treasury secretary, according to a person familiar with the decision. Mnuchin\u2019s deep roots on Wall Street fit the mold... (Jim Puzzanghera) Even the smallest cuts in federal support can spark a backlash, Lawrence added, given people\u2019s attachment to Medicare and other programs. \u201cIt can be $20, and they\u2019ve got serious trouble on their hands,\u201d he said. Congressional Republicans voiced strong support Tuesday for Price, whom Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called \u201cthe right person to lead the charge\u201d to repeal Obamacare . But Democrats moved quickly to\u00a0highlight Price\u2019s\u00a0calls for more far-reaching entitlement changes. \u201cWashington Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year,\u201d said Sen. Charles E.\u00a0Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Senate minority leader. Several Senate Democrats, including red-state lawmakers such as Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly , announced they would vote against confirming Price. \u201cTom Price has led the charge to privatize Medicare, and for this reason, I cannot support his nomination,\u201d Donnelly said. Trump, in announcing his selection of Price, called the 62-year-old\u00a0six-term congressman \u201cexceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible healthcare to every American.\u201d Armand Emamdjomeh The president-elect did not mention Price\u2019s calls for major changes to Medicare and Medicaid , which Price has made a centerpiece of his legislative agenda. \u201cWithout changing course, America\u2019s healthcare system will worsen with time, the nation\u2019s federal health programs will either go bankrupt or contribute to the fiscal insolvency of the country at large, and Americans will lose access to the care they need,\u201d Price warned in the 2017 budget blueprint he crafted as chairman of the House Budget Committee. Price, like House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), advocates replacing the government-provided\u00a0Medicare health plan\u00a0with a program that provides seniors with a voucher to purchase private health coverage. This system, which supporters call premium support,\u00a0saves the federal government money by gradually shifting costs onto beneficiaries, independent budget analyses have shown. Price also advocates a new system of block grants to states that would sharply cut federal aid for Medicaid, which primarily serves poor Americans. Conservatives have argued for decades that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the mammoth government entitlement programs for the elderly, disabled and poor,\u00a0are unsustainable. But the three entitlements, which cost more than $2 trillion annually, remain extremely popular,\u00a0unlike the divisive Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is formally known. \u201cMedicare is not seen as the same type of issue as the ACA,\u201d Harvard University political scientist Robert Blendon, an authority on public opinions of healthcare, explained at a recent forum by the Alliance for Health Reform. \u201cMost voters of both parties think Medicare is working.\u201d Even Medicaid, which began as a welfare program, and the related Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have established strong bipartisan support, reflecting in part the large role they play in providing coverage to children and elderly Americans in need of nursing home care. Nearly two-thirds of Americans said that Medicaid is\u00a0a \u201cvery important\u201d government program in a 2015 national survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.\u00a0That was only slightly below Medicare, which was rated similarly by 77% of Americans, and Social Security, which 83% of respondents said was very important. The depth of that public support has prevented Republicans from making major changes to the programs over the years. President Bush\u2019s 2005 push to privatize Social Security not only was defeated, but helped reenergize Democrats and fueled the party\u2019s return to power in Congress in the 2006 midterm election. Trump appeared to grasp this on the campaign trail. Though he did not discuss healthcare and entitlement policies frequently,\u00a0Trump insisted several times that he would protect programs serving vulnerable Americans. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Trump said last year in an interview with the Daily Signal, an online news site operated by the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cEvery other Republican is going to cut, and even if they wouldn\u2019t, they don\u2019t know what to do because they don\u2019t know where the money is. I do,\u201d Trump said. But the president-elect has offered few details about his healthcare agenda, including his plans to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act. And many in Washington are still trying to figure out whether Trump will align himself with the conservative governing program that has been championed by Price, Ryan and other congressional Republicans in recent years. \u201cAll of Trump\u2019s nascent positions were opening gambits in a deal,\u201d said Rick Tyler, who was an aide to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). \u201cIt\u2019s always a negotiating position with him.\u201d Trump has indicated a willingness to forge an alliance with Democrats over infrastructure spending, a top policy goal that could find him clashing with fiscal conservatives in his party. That made his choice of Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, particularly noteworthy. In addition to serving eight years as President George W. Bush\u2019s Labor secretary, Chao is married to McConnell, a key negotiator in any spending plans Trump would put forward. Chao\u2019s establishment ties conflict with Trump\u2019s promise to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington and promote outsiders to lead his government. But Chao\u2019s connections could be an asset as he makes the case for fixing dilapidated airports, roads and bridges. Chao\u2019s tenure at the Department of Labor included criticism \u00a0from some advocates\u00a0that she sided with employers on enforcing safety standards and failed to adequately protect low-wage workers . Chao rejected those assertions.\u00a0 But the pick was greeted with cautious optimism by Democratic leaders. Schumer said Democrats are eager to work with Chao \u201cif President-elect Trump is serious about a major infrastructure bill, backed by real dollars and not just tax credits and without cutting other programs like healthcare and education.\u201d Trump made another overture to an establishment figure Tuesday when he and his designated chief of staff, Reince Priebus, dined with their party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. It was Trump\u2019s\u00a0second meeting with Romney, who is said to be under consideration as secretary of State. They met at Jean Georges, a high-priced restaurant alongside Central Park in New York. Asked by a reporter how the dinner was going, Trump flashed a thumb\u2019s-up.

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's budget office estimates the state's backlog of unpaid bills will hit a record $13.5 billion by July if the governor and Democrats who control the General Assembly remain deadlocked over a complete spending plan, a bleak reminder of what's at stake as negotiations... (Monique Garcia) Madigan spokesman Steve Brown dismissed the effort as more of the same failed tactics that Republicans have employed for years. \"I don't know that it really makes any difference, this is the kind of thing we have seen from the Republicans for decades,\" Brown said. \"It's not terribly effective, and it's certainly not persuasive in getting people to embrace some of the issues.\" Of the three Democrats singled out by the state GOP, one, state Rep. Jerry Costello , of Smithton, near St. Louis, faced no Republican opposition in the Nov. 8 election. Another, state Rep. Brandon Phelps , of Harrisburg in southeastern Illinois, had only token GOP opposition. The state GOP also singled out Democratic Rep. Sam Yingling, of Grayslake, who edged out Republican challenger Rod Drobinski, of Wauconda, by about 5 percentage points in a race in which both sides spent heavily. Yingling raised nearly $2.6 million during the 2016 election cycle, State Board of Elections records showed, with nearly $1.1 million coming from Madigan-controlled funds. Drobinski raised nearly $2.1 million, all but $44,000 coming from the House Republican Organization, the campaign arm of the House GOP, and the Illinois Republican Party. The state GOP raised more than $30 million in the 2016 campaign cycle with nearly $21 million coming from Rauner and his campaign fund. Much of the money that went to the state Republican Party was funneled to the House Republican Organization to oppose Madigan. Madigan on Monday predicted he has \"overwhelming support to be re-elected speaker,\" and his members are expected to gather privately Wednesday to discuss the matter. The House election for speaker will not be held until Jan. 11, when new lawmakers are sworn in, meaning Republicans still have several weeks to raise the pressure. Indeed, neither Phelps or Yingling would say if they plan to vote for the speaker again, noting they may not have much choice either way should he be the only name Democrats put forth. \"I will be supporting whoever the Democratic candidate is,\" said Yingling, who added that the attempt to divide Democrats is only \"strengthening the Democratic Party.\" \"This shows a complete incompetence on the part of the governor and his total lack of understanding of what it means to govern and work with the legislative branch,\" Yingling said. \"It also underscores the notion that the governor thinks that he can just buy whatever he wants, and in reality our democracy doesn't work like that.\" Meanwhile, House Democrats were unable to override Rauner's veto of a bill aimed at making voter registration automatic in Illinois. Under the legislation, those seeking a new or updated driver's license would automatically be registered to vote or have their registration updated unless they opted out. Currently, motorists seeking services at secretary of state driver's facilities are asked if they want to register to vote or update their registration \u2014 an opt-in form of voter registration. Rauner argued the bill opened the state to potential voting fraud and conflicted with federal law. That put Republicans who supported the bill in the spring in a tight spot, and they floated an alternative proposal to provide some political cover for switching their votes. That did little to appease Democrats, who contended Rauner's opposition was \"because he is concerned about his own re-election.\" \"It really sends the message that the support of voter suppression in Illinois will be upheld by certain members of this House,\" said Rep. Carol Ammons, D-Urbana. Rick Pearson contributed from Chicago. ",

Questions emerge after Calif. woman missing for weeks is found alive Keith Papini said in a statement released to Good Morning America \u00a0that investigators told him to \u201cbrace himself\u201d before he was re-united with his wife at a hospital Thanksgiving Day because of her battered condition. Investigators say Sherri Papini, 34, was abducted Nov. 2 after going for a jog near Redding. Her husband told Good Morning America the woman\u2019s captors threw her from a moving car with a chain around her waist and a bag over her head, and she used the bag to flag down a passing motorist. She was found about 150 miles south of where she disappeared. \u201cNothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see upon my arrival at the hospital, nor the details of the true hell I was about to hear,\u201d Keith Papini said. \u201cThe mental prison I was in over the past three weeks was shattered when my questions of my wife\u2019s reality became known.\u201d Keith Papini said the woman was emaciated, her \u201csignature long, blond hair\u201d had been cut off, and her face was \u201ccovered in bruises ranging from yellow to black because of repeated beatings, the bridge of her nose broken.\u201d He said the woman had \u201csevere\u201d burns, red rashes, and scabs. \u201cSherri was taken from us for 22 days, and suffered incredibly through both intense physical agony and severe mental torture,\u201d Keith Papini said in the statement. \u201cMy reaction was one of extreme happiness and overwhelming nausea as my eyes and hands scanned her body. I was filled with so much relief and revulsion at once. My Sherri suffered tremendously and all the visions swirling in your heads of her appearance, I assure you, are not as graphic and gruesome as the reality.\u201d Speaking on Good Morning America, Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko confirmed the details about Sherri Papini\u2019s condition, but said his office had not yet publicly released the information. He wasn\u2019t able to confirm Keith Papini\u2019s account of the woman being thrown from a moving vehicle, saying the information he had indicted the woman was dropped off, bound, by her captors. Investigators were on Sunday able to conduct their first in-depth interview with the woman, Bosenko said. Based on information she gave police, investigators are searching for two Hispanic women armed with a handgun and driving a dark SUV. Bosenko said investigators still haven\u2019t been able to determine a possible motive or whether the abduction was targeted or random. In the statement, Keith Papini blasted those who had speculated on social media that the woman\u2019s abduction was a hoax. \u201cRumors, assumptions, lies, and hate have been both exhausting and disgusting. Those people should be ashamed of their malicious, sub human behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to allow those people to take away our spirit, love, or rejoice in our girl found alive and home where she belongs.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Papini recalled in the statement the shock he felt at seeing his wife for the first time following her 22-day ordeal. He wrote of seeing her in a hospital bed, face covered in bruises and the bridge of her nose broken. He said she was 87 pounds and had severe burns, rashes and chain markings on her body. He said that her hair had been chopped off and she had been branded. He said it was his wife\u2019s \u201cwill to survive\u201d that brought her back to her family. \"We are very ecstatic to report that Sherri Papini has been located and has been reunited with husband and family on this day of Thanksgiving,\" Sheriff Tom Bosenko said at a news conference Thursday. Papini said in his statement that the family is grateful for the support it has received, but called it a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d \u2013 citing the growing chorus of people who are calling Sherri Papini\u2019s story a hoax \u2013 and that the ordeal has been \u201cexhausting and disgusting.\u201d After Sherri Papini was found, many took to social media to cast doubts on her story, citing that Papini could not give authorities a detailed description of her abductors. Some called the GoFundMe account that raised $50,000 the reason for creating a hoax tale, and others quoted anonymous sources as saying Papini had concocted similar kidnapping tales in the past and had posted anti-Latino sentiments on blogs. \"We are not going to allow those people to take away our spirit, love, or rejoice in our girl found alive and home where she belongs,\" Papini wrote. \"I understand people want the story, pictures, proof that this was not some sort of hoax, plan to gain money or some fabricated race war. I do not see a purpose in addressing each preposterous lie.\" CLICK HERE TO READ KEITH PAPINI\u2019S FULL STATEMENT Shortly after finding Sherri Papini, authorities said they were looking for \"a dark-colored SUV with two Hispanic females armed with a handgun,\" according to the sheriff.\u00a0 \"I am happy to say that Sherri is now safe and that she has been treated at an area hospital outside of Shasta County for non-life-threatening injuries,\" Bosenko said. He did not specify the nature of her injuries, but said\u00a0on Thursday she was treated at a hospital in Sacramento and reunited with her family. Advertisement ",

(Christian Action Network) An Islamist group with secretive compounds around the U.S. is arming up in anticipation of raids by the incoming Trump administration, according to a new report from a nonprofit think tank. Muslims of America, which is headquartered in Hancock, N.Y., and run from Pakistan by leader Sheikh Gilani, operates 22 \u201cIslamic villages\u201d around the nation. The compounds are legal, but Gilani has recently ordered all unarmed members to gather firearms, licenses and hunting permits, according to Clarion Project . Gilani believes his group will be targeted by Trump. \u201cI foretold disastrous results should this man be elected as the American President,\u201d Gilani said in a statement shortly after Trump was elected president on Nov. 8. \u201cHe has come as a test and trial for the faithful adherents of the holy books.\u201d Supporters say the compounds are simply Islamic communes for mainly African-American Muslims who seek to follow Gilani\u2019s teachings in a rural setting. While they have been the subject of numerous accusations and undercover reporting, the group is not known to have supported or conducted terrorist activity, and its critics are widely dismissed as conspiracy theorists . A confidential source allegedly inside the organization told Martin Mawyer of the Christian Action Network and Ryan Mauro of the Clarion Project that the group expects the FBI to reopen its cases against them as a \u201chomegrown terrorist organization,\u201d according to the report. According to the report, the sources stated that members across the country were given instructions by Gilani to \u201cbe prepared to fight,\u201d against President-Elect Trump, who the group believes is part of a satanic-Zionist conspiracy to destroy Islam. Muslims of America\u2019s headquarters in rural New York is known as \u201cIslamberg.\u201d According to a 2007 FBI report obtained by the Clarion Project, MOA \u201cpossesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns within the U.S. and overseas.\u201d Advertisement ",

When Plumlee threw the ball off the green, witnesses said Sivilay swung an iron at the back of Plumlee\u2019s head -- hitting him repeatedly with his club. The attack continued even after Plumlee fell to the ground with serious injuries, CBS DFW reported.\u00a0 \u201cWe went to the hospital and found out he had a fractured skull,\u201d said Plumlee\u2019s mother, Sohnya Suarez-Cope. \u201cNobody should have to go through something like that when you\u2019re having a fun day of golf.\u201d Plumlee was knocked unconscious and the remains hospitalized. Michael Plumlee, 27, is still in the hospital after a golf game turned violent. \u00a0 Close CBS Dallas-Fort Worth Carrollton police said Sivilay tried to leave the golf course before they arrived but was blocked by golf carts. He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\u00a0 His family wants the other golfers who were with Sivilay to also face charges since Plumlee\u2019s prognosis is uncertain. \u201cWe don\u2019t know long-term what is going to be like and it concerns me that any of these violent people can be out there free,\u201d said Suarez-Cope. Police confiscated several clubs to determine which one was used as a weapon. Sivilay has a previous criminal conviction for car burglary, but his violent round of golf could send him to prison for 20 years. \u201cGolf is supposed to be a gentleman\u2019s sport and for something like this to happen is unheard of,\u201d said Brandi Plumlee, the victim\u2019s stepmother. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

It is a lush and stunning array of ornaments, trees, lights, ribbons festooning a place First Lady Michelle Obama said she took pride in opening \"to as many people from as many backgrounds as possible\". She grew emotional as she spoke of the gratitude she felt both for the military families present and those who work behind the scenes to make the event so memorable. First Lady Michelle Obama, with the First Family's dogs Sunny and Bo, greets children of military families as they make holiday crafts and treats during the unveiling of the 2016 holiday decorations in the theme of 'The Gift of the Holidays,' in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, Nov.29, 2016. Olivier Douliery / ABACA USA \"So before I get choked up,\" she said. \"Let me officially kick off our final White House holiday season.\" Themed \"The Gifts of the Holidays,\" the display is meant to \"reflect on not only the joy of giving and receiving, but also the true gifts of life, such as service, friends and family, education and good health as we celebrate the holiday season,\" read a statement from the first lady. At her traditional ceremony, with military families as the first guests invited to see the decorations, the First Lady reflected back on the goal her family set when they first arrived eight years ago to welcome as many people to the White House as possible. \"We've worked hard to achieve that goal by welcoming almost half a million guests to this hose during the season,\" the First Lady said. The White House Christmas decorations are seen during a press preview on Nov. 29, 2016 in Washington, DC. Olivier Douliery / Abaca USA Over the years, the White House has been adorned with about half a million ornaments \u201470,000 this year alone. White House pastry chefs have baked some 200,000 holiday cookies. And 92 volunteers from 33 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have spent countless hours since Thanksgiving decorating the White House. The annual White House Gingerbread House in the State Dining Room was made from 150 pounds of gingerbread, 100 pounds of bread dough, and a lot of sugar. Each state and U.S. territory have gingerbread houses as well made from some 200,000 LEGOS. The First Lady's office reports a team of \"Master Builders\" spent some 500 hours designing and building the State Dining Room gingerbread displays. The theme of \"Gifts\" also focuses on many of the first lady's major initiatives. A giant red white and blue American flag installation is covered with pictures of the Obamas with military families. Gold Stars and ornaments hang from a Christmas tree honoring those who've given their lives. There are also iPads available in the hopes that visitors will send messages to the troops. In the library downstairs, which contains 2,700 books, Christmas trees made of crayons and pencils, honor \"the gift of education.\" Special ornaments spell out the word \"girl\" in 12 different languages, paying tribute to the First Lady's \"Let Girls Learn Initiative\". The White House hosts a press preview of the 2016 holiday decor at the White House in Washington, DC, USA, Nov. 29, 2016. The majority of the holiday decor was designed by Rafanelli Events and executed by 92 volunteers from across the country. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA The \"Let's Move\" initiative inspired wreaths adorned with such fruit as oranges, apples, lemons and limes. The display also represents the \"The Gift of Good Health\" and the White House Kitchen Garden. There's a huge literal interpretation of a gift box outside the East Visitor entrance and large replicas of First Dogs Sunny and Bo made from 25,000 yarn pom-poms in the entry hallway. In the East Colonnade 7,500 multi-colored ribbons hang. There are 6,000 \"snowball ornaments in the Lower Cross Hall and a 19 foot Douglas Fir in the Blue Room that just arrived from a tree farm in Pennsylvania. Some 68,000 guests are expected to visit the White House during the holiday season. \"This has been one of our favorite White House traditions,\" the First Lady said to the military families visiting the White House on Tuesday. \"Our military families like all of you remind us of what matters,\" she said. \"It's that kind of commitment to truly serving others, that's what the holidays are truly about, and that's what we honor with our holiday decorations every year at the White House.\" Ron Allen ",

There were initial reports of six survivors, but one of them died. USA TODAY A 2016 photo shows Brazil's Chapecoense players posing for pictures during their 2016 Copa Sudamericana semifinal match. (Photo: Nelson Almeida, AFP/Getty Images) Brazil and the entire soccer world were in mourning Tuesday after a chartered plane carrying a first-division Brazilian soccer team to a historic game slammed into a\u00a0Colombian hillside, killing 71\u00a0of the 81 people aboard, authorities said. Officials downgraded the death toll from an earlier reported number of 75, according to ABC News, NBC News and other news organizations. The\u00a072 passengers included members of Chapecoense, a Brazilian soccer team that rose\u00a0from relative obscurity to play in one of South America's most prestigious tournaments. The team had been scheduled\u00a0to play in the Copa Sudamerica finals against Atletico Nacional on Wednesday in Medellin. Twenty of the dead were journalists, and only one journalist survived, the Associated Press reported. \"May God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests traveling with our delegation,\u201d the club said in a statement after the crash Monday night.\u00a0Juan Carlos de la Cuesta, president of Atletico Nacional, expressed solidarity with Chapecoense and requested the team be declared tournament champion. Chapecoense represents\u00a0Chapeco, a southern city of about 200,000 more than 800 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. The climb to celebrity status was a Cinderella story that drew headlines across the nation. Less than a decade ago Chapecoense was mired in the nation's \"D\" league, essentially low minor leagues. In recent years, it steadily rose through the ranks, reaching the top division of Brazilian soccer in 2014.\u00a0Authorities said more than 20 journalists joined the team on the flight in anticipation of Wednesday's game. \"The pain is terrible. Just as we had made it, I will not say to the top, but to have national prominence, a tragedy like this happens,\" club vice-president Ivan Tozzo told Globo SportTV. \"It is very difficult, a very great tragedy.\" Posted!

The plane crashed moments later in a mountainous area in the Antioquian municipality,\u00a0about 22 miles from the airport, which serves\u00a0the\u00a0city of Medellin. It was not immediately clear what caused the short-haul, British Aerospace 146 to crash, but heavy rains and thunderstorms hit Colombia around the time of the tragedy. Officials said the plane's data and voice recorders\u00a0\u2014 black boxes\u00a0\u2014 were recovered from the scene. Colombia aviation officials said the plane experienced electrical problems, but the Associated Press said\u00a0investigators were also looking into an account from one survivor that the plane ran out of fuel. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out anything,\u201d LaMia Airlines president Gustavo Vargas told AP. Chapecoense defender\u00a0Alan Ruschel, 27, was in a stable condition after being pulled from the plane's wreckage, said Alfredo Bocanegra, head of Colombia's civil aviation\u00a0agency.\u00a0He said two other players, Jakson Follman and Helio Zampier,\u00a0journalist Rafael Valmorbida, flight attendant\u00a0Ximena Suarez and crew member Erwin Tumiri also survived and were taken to nearby hospitals.

(Jessie Grady) Sarah LarimerThe Washington Post Jessie Grady walked into a Michaels store last week in Chicago to buy a Santa hat for her young daughter. She ended up witnessing -- and filming --- another customer's \"unprovoked attack\" in which the woman unloaded on black Michaels employees, claiming she was being discriminated against and declaring that she voted for President-elect Donald Trump . \"And I voted for Trump! So there! What, you want to kick me out because of that?\" the woman shouts in the video, which has gone viral. \"And look who won! And look who won! And look who won!\" According to Grady, the Nov. 23 incident occurred at the arts and crafts store after the woman told Grady to go ahead of her at the register. Once Grady was done checking out, she said she heard the woman grow irate. The woman's \"racist rant,\" Grady said, included slurs. \"It just sounded like a disgruntled customer for a second,\" Grady told The Washington Post. \"And then she made a homophobic slur, she started cussing the manager, all sorts of things. It just kind of got out of control. So I waited, but it was like, when she started yelling African American women are discriminating against me, that's when I pulled out my phone.\" It was not clear from the footage why the woman thought she was being discriminated against. Grady said the ordeal stretched for about 45 minutes, though the video captures only part of the woman's rant. The video does not show the initial confrontation, but Grady said the woman was angry about a reusable bag. When a part-time manager came to assist, the woman \"went off\" on her, Grady said. At one point in the video clip, the woman is seen confronting Grady about her camera. \"I don't know what you think you're videoing, lady,\" she says. \"I don't know what you think you're videoing. I was just discriminated against by two black women. And you being a white woman, you literally thinking that that's okay, you standing there with your baby thinking that's OK? I don't know what you're videoing.\" \"When she started spinning out of control was when white people didn't stand up for her,\" Grady said by phone. \"Because if you see in the video, her total demeanor, even though she's insulting me, her total demeanor changes when she's speaking to me, as opposed to the African American employees. She was still looking for an ally in me, even though she is shouting at me.\" Footage of the incident was viewed more than 2 million views on YouTube by Tuesday morning. And an\u00a0 online fundraising campaign set up by Grady to help one of the Michaels employees, a manager, had raised more than $18,000. The initial crowdfunding goal was $400. \"I am overwhelmed by your generosity and it's given me hope,\" Grady wrote on the Gofundme page. \"I have been speaking to the manager I'm raising this gift for about what to do with the additional funds. I want this to be her decision to empower her to meet the needs of her family and of her community. It is not my place as a white woman to do that for her.\" Grady said she didn't film the incident to post it online, but rather because she had previously worked in the retail industry and thought the woman might contact the store and complain at a later date. \"I was thinking, 'I've worked in retail. She's going to treat them like this, then she's going to call tomorrow and she's going to get a discount because the customer's always right,' \" she said. \"But this customer's wrong.\" Other bystanders did stand in support of employees, Grady said, and police did respond. A Chicago police spokesman said in an email that there were no arrests or citations given. \"At Michaels, we do not tolerate discrimination or racism of any kind against our team members or customers, and we are actively investigating the situation,\" the arts and crafts supply chain said in a statement. \"We regret that our customers and team members were affected by this unfortunate incident and are grateful for the leadership of our store team in working to resolve it without further escalation.\" The incident came not long after a Florida man, David Sanguesa, was caught berating a Starbucks barista in footage that went viral. The man told ABC affiliate WPLG that a barista would not serve him. A colleague he was with suggested it was because of a pro-Trump display on his car. Sanguesa grew upset because he viewed it as \"anti-white discrimination.\" \"The reason that I posted the video is because people need to know that this is real,\" Grady said of the Michaels footage. \"They need to know that this is happening. And they need to stand up and do something about it, and say that this is not OK. I'm from the South, so I know a lot of people there who were Trump supporters. They're saying this doesn't happen, that it's not real. I thought OK, they know me, and I'm a woman, with a baby. And I need to say this because this is coming from a real person.\" ",

Joseph Dugan. Devon Reid, 24, was in the 1700 block of Sherman Avenue in downtown Evanston when he was stopped just after 5:30 p.m., Dugan said. Dugan said one of the officers, a white woman, saw Reid and another man with clipboards and wondered what they were doing. He said she stopped them and asked for their names and birth dates. The other man was a white 23-year-old, according to a Monday release by the city. The men gave their names but Reid, who said he hopes to run for Evanston city clerk, refused to give his birth date, Dugan said. \"She asked several times. He refused several times,\" Dugan said. Finally, the officer told Reid she would arrest him if he did not give his birth date. He still refused and she put him under arrest after calling for assistance from another officer, an African-American man. The female patrol officer and her immediate supervisor, a white male sergeant, are the officers who were put on leave, Dugan said. The second responding patrol officer was not put on leave, he said. Dugan said the sergeant was put on leave because he was involved after Reid was brought back to the station. Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas, Rosemary Regina Sobol and Elvia Malagon Chicago police on Saturday took the most serious action possible against an officer believed to have shot and killed a 19-year-old in West Englewood. In a statement regarding the Wednesday shooting of Kajuan Raye, who so far appears to have been unarmed, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said\u00a0Superintendent... Chicago police on Saturday took the most serious action possible against an officer believed to have shot and killed a 19-year-old in West Englewood. In a statement regarding the Wednesday shooting of Kajuan Raye, who so far appears to have been unarmed, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said\u00a0Superintendent... (Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas, Rosemary Regina Sobol and Elvia Malagon) Dugan said Reid was cited for disobedience to police in a public place and taken to the Evanston police station. Reid said he was put in handcuffs on the street before being taken to the police station. Dugan confirmed Reid was brought in for processing but was not placed in a cell; he bonded out at 7:25 p.m. The officers are on paid administrative leave while the department investigates what happened, something that could take a few weeks, he said. But Dugan said that the decision to arrest Reid was wrong. \"She didn't have to do that. She erred,\" Dugan said. \"He shouldn't have been arrested. Why it happened will be part of the investigation.\" Collecting signatures in downtown Evanston is not illegal, Dugan said, and Reid was under no obligation to give the officer his birth date. Dugan said he was not aware of any disciplinary record for the two officers. He said any repercussions they might face would be determined by Evanston's police chief, Richard Eddington. Genevieve Bookwalter / Pioneer Press Devon Reid, 24, of Evanston, addresses the city council on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016. Two Evanston police officers were placed on leave after Reid was arrested Sunday, Nov. 27, while collecting petition signatures to run for public office.

Two Evanston police officers were placed on leave after Reid was arrested Sunday, Nov. 27, while collecting petition signatures to run for public office. (Genevieve Bookwalter / Pioneer Press) Speaking at Monday night's Evanston City Council meeting, Reid said he believed he was arrested because of his race. \"I was handcuffed in the basement of the Evanston Police Department for being a 24-year-old African-American male running for political office in this city,\" Reid said. He spoke the same night that the Evanston City Council voted to strengthen the city's sanctuary city ordinance, which protects undocumented residents within city limits. Some in the meeting asked the council to consider greater police oversight while they discussed stronger resident protections. \"The election was a wake-up call for a lot of us,\" said Ald. Judy Fiske, 1st. \"Last night was also a wake-up call.\" Evanston resident Karen Courtright said it was incumbent on the council to prevent similar occurrences from happening again. \"The time has come for a little action in stopping the bullies on the police force,\" she said.

    "text": "GOP Prepares for House Vote on Medical Research Bill By alan fram, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Nov 29, 2016, 8:58 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Oct. 24, 2016, file photo, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. speaks at a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. Warren says a bill providing extra money for medical research is \u201cextortion\u201d and a giveaway to big biomedical companies. She also said the bill benefits a Republican donor who backs controversial therapies that are supposed to regenerate cells. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, file) 0 Shares Email Republicans and Democrats put finishing touches Tuesday on a $6.3 billion medical research bill as GOP leaders prepared to try pushing the measure through the lame-duck Congress by next week. The White House said it backs the measure, all but ensuring its approval. While Democrats and consumer groups were unhappy with parts of the legislation, it contained enough accomplishments for both sides. Government drug approvals would be accelerated, there would be more money for biomedical research \u2014 including on cancer, a priority for the White House and Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 and there would be added funds for battling abuse of addictive drugs like opioids, a growing problem that plagues red and blue states alike. In a letter to lawmakers, White House officials said the administration strongly supports the legislation and praised almost every aspect of it. It cited some problems, such as a need for more money to implement some of its requirements, but said, \"This legislation offers advances in health that far outweigh these concerns.\" The House was planning to consider the 996-page package Wednesday, with Senate action expected next week. \"It's a very important and attractive piece of legislation. I anticipate a big vote,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Health Committee. In eleventh-hour talks, both sides said they had agreed to remove language that would have exempted companies from publicly reporting education-related gifts to doctors, such as textbooks. Firms must report many payments they give physicians, which critics say encourage doctors to prescribe products made by those companies. Democrats had wanted stronger language to assure that the money the legislation makes available would actually be provided by future Congresses. They were also unhappy with provisions making it easier to get government approval to prescribe existing drugs for new uses, and with the measure's cuts in President Barack Obama's health care law and other programs, which would take effect immediately. But with Donald Trump replacing a more supportive Obama in the White House in just two months, Democratic leverage to demand changes was limited. In remarks Tuesday to the Senate, Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said there is \"some angst\" among Democrats about the bill and said he was expecting it to be changed, but was not specific. The bill was drawing populist attacks from two of the Senate's most liberal members, Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Sanders said Congress must \"stand up to the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies, not give them more handouts.\" In a fierce Senate speech Monday, Warren called the bill \"corrupt\" and \"very, very dangerous.\" The bill would let the Food and Drug Administration approve drugs and medical devices more quickly \u2014 which consumer groups say is dangerous. It lays out plans for $4.8 billion in additional spending over the next decade for cancer, brain and other biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health; $1 billion for grants to states for drug abuse prevention and treatment over the next two years; and $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration to streamline its approval procedures. It would also bolster federal mental health programs. To pay for the measure, the bill would cut a public health program in Obama's health care law, trim some Medicare and Medicaid payments and sell oil from the government's strategic petroleum reserve. Lawmakers who pushed to delete the provision exempting public reports of some payments to doctors included Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and No. 3 Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York. Schumer is slated to be Senate minority leader in next year's new Congress. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By ADAM LIPTAK NOV. 29, 2016 In his campaign and as president-elect, Donald J. Trump has made statements that are at odds with the United States Constitution. \u201cNobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d The Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment.  It has also said that the government may not strip Americans of their citizenship. First Amendment \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d 14th Amendment, Section 1 \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d \u201cPrior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!\u201d The Constitution bars federal government officials from receiving gifts and payments from foreign governments,  Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings with entities controlled by foreign states could test that limitation. Article I, Section 9 \u201cNo title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.\u201d On conceding the election: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense.\u201d Oct. 19, 2016 at the third presidential debate For more than 200 years, presidential elections in the United States have been settled according to the procedures set out in the Constitution and other laws, and they have concluded with the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next. Mr. Trump\u2019s statement leaves open the possibility that he will try to break from those precedents. 12th Amendment \u201cThe person having the greatest number of votes for president, shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed.\u201d \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Oct. 9, 2016 at the second presidential debate Mr. Trump has said that, if elected, he would instruct his attorney general to reopen criminal investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. (After the election, he appeared to soften his position , saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the Clintons.\u201d) Mr. Trump will have the legal power to tell his attorney general to open or close investigations, though doing so would violate political norms. But his suggestion that the president has the unilateral power to jail people for federal crimes overstates the president\u2019s authority. Presidents acting alone do not adjudicate criminal cases or send people to jail. By contrast, the Constitution does grant the president the unilateral power to show leniency. Article II, Section 2 The president \u201cshall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.\u201d \u201cI want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII \u2014 go down the list.\u201d But the Constitution has only seven articles. There is no Article XII. Article II, Section 1 The president must promise to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace, or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected.\u201d Feb. 26, 2016 at a rally in Fort Worth, Tex. Libel is a state-law tort constrained by constitutional principles.  A president\u2019s views do not figure in its application. The Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment erects significant hurdles to libel suits from public officials , candidates for public office and public figures , but it has never said that newspapers are \u201ctotally protected.\u201d First Amendment \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d \u201cOne of the first things I\u2019d do in terms of executive order, if I win, will be to sign a strong, strong statement that would go out to the country \u2026 anybody killing a police officer, the death penalty is going to happen.\u201d Again, Mr. Trump overstates the president\u2019s role in the constitutional order.  In addition, the Supreme Court has said that laws calling for mandatory death sentences violate the Constitution\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Fifth Amendment \u201cNo person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d Additional work by Josh Williams and K.K. Rebecca Lai More on NYTimes.com ",

    "text": "WATCH Pro Soccer Players Among 71 Killed in Colombian Plane Crash 0 Shares The trip to Medellin, Colombia, was supposed to be a joyous one for the members Chapecoense, a soccer club from the small city of Chapeco, Brazil, and they were in the middle of a fairy tale season. Now their journey will go down in history as a tragedy. Investigators will likely comb through the evidence for the next several months, hoping to discover why a charter flight crashed Monday night while carrying players, coaches, board members and journalists. The accident killed 71 people, officials said, revising the death toll from the initial figure of 75. Officials said six survived. Details are scarce, and it will take a significant amount of time for officials to determine the exact causes of the crash. However, information available soon after the crash point toward the pilots facing the worst of circumstances. Flight Was Taking Brazilian Team to Game of Their Lives The charter flight departed Bolivia on Monday just before 6:20 p.m. local time. A little over four hours later, the flight began what appears to be a holding pattern just south of the Medellin airport for about 13 minutes. According to flight data from FlightRadar24, the plane made three circles, descending from 21,000 feet to 15,550 feet for the last two minutes of available flight data. The flight's destination, Maria Cordova International Airport outside Medellin, is a notoriously difficult airport for pilots. The runway is at 7,000 feet, surrounded by mountainous terrain. Frequent adverse weather conditions can make visibility difficult. Approaching an airport at that elevation requires high approach speeds, creating an even greater challenge in poor conditions. Fotos de @AerocivilCol aeronave procedente Aeropuerto Viru Viru de Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia empresa Lamia matr\u00edcula CP2933 RJ 80. pic.twitter.com/ZKngqObQ5v \u2014 AERON\u00c1UTICA CIVIL (@AerocivilCol) November 29, 2016 There were scattered thunderstorms in the area at the time of the crash, and turbulence could have been present, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. The airport's official Twitter account confirmed the plane suffered an electrical failure before the crash. While the consequences of an electrical failure can vary greatly, if the pilots lost navigational aids on approach to an airport like Medellin at night in poor visibility, that could spell serious trouble. The limited evidence available at this time suggests some possible scenarios for the doomed flight. For insight into the incident, ABC News spoke with Col. Steve Ganyard \u2014 a former deputy assistant secretary of state, a retired fighter pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps and an ABC News contributor. The holding pattern seen on flight data could indicate the crew was attempting to troubleshoot the electrical failure. So late in the flight, however, the plane may have been low on fuel, forcing the crew to make a quick decision in poor weather surrounded by high terrain. Such a combination could have been perilous. \"An electrical failure under those conditions would challenge even the best pilots,\" Ganyard said. \"And if there was a total electrical failure, the flight was doomed.\" #AEstaHora Carlos Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez P\u00e9rez, Director de la UNGRD, realiza seguimiento a operaci\u00f3n de b\u00fasqueda y rescate en la zona del siniestro. pic.twitter.com/SsfOEBZDQt \u2014 UNGRD (@UNGRD) November 29, 2016 Under those conditions, a visual approach would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible. In such a case, a pilot would resort to the often used ILS, or instrument landing system. ILS allows the pilots to use radio signals to navigate the plane safely to the runway, even through poor visibility. A total electrical outage, although rare, would take this option away from the pilots. Investigators will surely look very closely at the reported electrical outage and why such an event may have occurred. Ganyard added that air safety in South America is relatively poor. \"A Bolivian charter aircraft was not likely maintained or manned to U.S. standards,\" he said. As the recovery mission is ongoing, fans and surviving team staff are remembering those who died. In an early morning tweet on Tuesday, the team shared a video of the players celebrating a recent victory with a simple caption: \u201cMay this be the last image of our warriors. #ChapeStrength.\u201d Que essa seja a \u00faltima imagem dos nosso guerreiros. #For\u00e7aChape pic.twitter.com/Q1ZxF5h4sV ABC News contributor Col.

Farmers want international trade deals and relief from regulations. But small towns are focused on re-inventing themselves to attract a new generation. FrankvandenBergh/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption FrankvandenBergh/Getty Images Who speaks for rural America? Farmers want international trade deals and relief from regulations. But small towns are focused on re-inventing themselves to attract a new generation. FrankvandenBergh/Getty Images The day after Donald Trump swept to victory, the head of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall, released a videotaped statement aimed at the President-elect and other political leaders in Washington. \"Rural America turned out and made their voice heard in this election,\" he said. \"Now it's time for our elected leaders to support rural America.\" In his statement, Duvall referred interchangeably to \"rural Americans\" and \"America's farmers and ranchers,\" suggesting that those are the same people. In reality, they're not. Farmers make up a small minority in the rural population, with different priorities and agendas than their non-farming neighbors. I explored these differences recently during a trip across parts of northern Indiana. It's a landscape dominated by wide fields of corn and soybeans and giant grain silos. In Kosciusko County, near the tiny town of Leesburg, I met Kip Tom, a farmer who joined the Trump campaign as an adviser on agricultural policy. Tom's farm is one of the biggest in the region. It covers almost 20,000 acres, scattered across seven counties. In those counties, about 70 percent of the votes went for Donald Trump. And Kip Tom thinks Trump will indeed listen to what farmers have to say. \"I see Trump being good for agriculture, absolutely,\" he told me. Article continues after sponsorship On some issues Trump has been right in sync with the major farm groups. They both want less environmental regulation, for instance. Trump has promised to ditch a rule called Waters of the U.S. , which defines which streams are covered by the Clean Water Act. The rule hasn't actually made much of a practical difference for farmers, but many farmers fear that down the road, it might give the EPA the authority to regulate what they do on the fields that surround small streams. \"Waters of the U.S. was an overreach by the federal government on our private property rights, to come out here and tell us how to operate our farms,\" said Tom. But when it comes to other issues, farm organizations want Trump to change his mind. They favor trade deals that Trump attacked during his campaign, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, which could expand their exports of pork, beef, and grain. Farm groups also don't want the government to crack down on immigration. Dairy farmers and vegetable growers rely heavily on immigrant workers. Tom says more people should \"walk a day with somebody who's a migrant, who was willing to do the work that others turn their nose to. I think we need to find some passion for those people and find a path toward citizenship for them,\" he says. This is the policy wish list for supporting \"rural America\" that Zippy Duvall, from the American Farm Bureau Federation, mentioned in his post-election statement: Free trade; environmental deregulation; immigration policies that don't take away farm workers; and continued funding for programs that help farmers financially when prices fall or bad weather ruins their crops. But does the rest of rural America care about these issues? To find out, I drove to the town of Warsaw, the county seat of Kosciusko County. Warsaw is doing better than a lot of rural towns. It's home to several thriving companies that make orthopedic devices, which provides a solid economic base. But like most small towns in the Midwest, it still worries about its future. Average incomes here have fallen below the national average. Poverty has been rising. The historic downtown, with its century-old brick storefronts and grand county courthouse, is eerily quiet during most of the day. And here's Warsaw's biggest concern: Young people and how to keep them from moving away. \"Millennials, they go where they want to live, and then they decide where they want to work,\" says Joseph Thallemer, Warsaw's mayor. According to census data, a couple of hundred more people leave Kosciusko County each year than move here. This, in fact, is why many Midwestern mayors and county commissioners are no longer quite so focused on getting companies to move to their communities, in order to bring in new jobs. Jobs aren't enough to make their millennials stay. Thallemer says that Warsaw has jobs in local factories that are waiting for people to fill them. And yet, young people choose to move away to places that seem more exciting. \"We have plenty of opportunity. But we don't have 70 degree average temperatures. We don't have palm trees. We don't have oceans,\" he says. What Warsaw needs, he says, is to find other ways to make the town special and attractive. Farms surround this town, but Thallemer barely mentions agriculture's priorities. That's because the number of farmers is tiny, compared to half a century ago. According to the latest census of agriculture from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there are just 497 people in all of Kosciusko county who say that farming is their principal occupation. That's out of a total population of 80,000. This is the situation, in fact, in much of rural America. Chuck Fluharty , president of the Rural Policy Research Institute at the University of Iowa, which focuses on the economic health of rural communities, says small towns don't depend much on farmers anymore \u2014 yet farmers need their struggling rural towns. Farmers \"are worrying about that car dealer, and they're worrying about that bank, and they're worrying about the small insurance company, and they're hoping to God that they don't lose their school,\" he says. But Fluharty thinks it is possible to revive small towns like Warsaw and keep young people from leaving. It may sound counter-intuitive, but jobs follow people, he says, rather than the reverse. If people want to live in a place, they'll inevitably create the economic activity that sustains that community. So what rural America needs, basically, is more people like Parker Beauchamp . Beauchamp grew up in Wabash, Indiana, about an hour south of Warsaw. He went off to college, but came back home to run the family insurance company. And he convinced his big-city wife to move there with him. \"That was a major, major sales job,\" he says. He and his wife still debate about staying here. \"We talk about it every day.\" Beauchamp doesn't have to be in Wabash. His company, Inguard, is competing for customers all over the country, not just in northern Indiana. He's recruiting employees from all over, too. But he wants to be in his home town. And he's thrown himself into the job of building a Wabash that more people from Denver or Chicago would want to move to. \"We just hustled,\" he says. \"We did whatever we could in order to get some energy into downtown.\" They've had some success. There's art and entertainment in the center of Wabash now, along with a renovated historic hotel. Shops that were boarded up are now open for business again. Government grants got some of this off the ground. But Chuck Fluharty, from the Rural Policy Research Institute, says rural communities, don't get nearly as much federal economic development money per resident as cities do. This is where he wants farmers to help, he says, because farm organizations have political clout. He thinks those farm organizations should be pushing Congress, and the new Trump Administration, on behalf of policies that help their small towns; not just their own farms. ",

The decision to tap Mnuchin, who served as the national finance chairman of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, for the top Treasury Department job has been widely expected since Mr. Trump won the race for the White House. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition recommended Mnuchin for the post. Mnuchin is a veteran of the finance world, spending 17 years at Goldman Sachs. He\u2019s also an interesting choice for Mr. Trump, given that he has donated more to Democratic candidates than Republicans in past elections. (In 2016, however, he gave almost entirely to Republicans, with the exception of Sen.-elect Kamala Harris in California.) Steven Mnuchin, national finance chairman of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, walks in the lobby of Trump Tower, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, in New York. Evan Vucci, AP Others who were reportedly considered for the job include JP Morgan Chase & CO CEO Jamie Dimon and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Mnuchin is the latest in a flurry of post-Thanksgiving weekend Cabinet announcements from Mr. Trump. Earlier Tuesday, his team announced Rep. Tom Price (R-Georgia) as health and human services secretary, and Mr. Trump is expected to name former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao as his transportation secretary.\u00a0 The treasury secretary is responsible for the important foreign policy tool of sanctions, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk reports. And that means Mnuchin will have a say in Cuba and Iran sanctions as well as Ukraine and Russia sanctions, in addition to Syria and counter terror and counter narcotics. The sanctions authority gives the treasury secretary the ability to add to or roll back Obama administration policies quickly, Falk added.\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett contributed reporting to this story. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The theme park itself wasn't burning, but more than a dozen cabins it manages were damaged. Families staying in 50 rooms at the park's DreamMoore Resort, as well as 19 cabins on the property, had to be evacuated. All evacuations in Pigeon Forge were lifted Tuesday afternoon, and most businesses were open, town officials announced. But Dollywood suspended operations until Friday because it's \"focusing its efforts for the next two days supporting the community,\" the company said. \"I have been watching the terrible fires in the Great Smoky Mountains and I am heartbroken,\" Parton said in a statement, adding, \"It is a blessing that my Dollywood theme park, the DreamMore Resort and so many businesses in Pigeon Forge have been spared.\" Parton, a native of Sevier County, had released a public service announcement with Smokey Bear on Sunday just hours before the wildfires erupted. She warned of forest fires and troubling drought conditions. In neighboring Gatlinburg, the scene was utter devastation: About half of the 10-square-mile town was affected, with more than 100 structures damaged, including a 16-story hotel and an apartment complex, officials said. Seventy-five 75 to 100 homes in the Cobbly Nob section were also gutted. The downtown and other areas of the town of 4,000 permanent residents were evacuated Monday night, and about 2,000 people were placed into shelters throughout the county, said Miller, the fire chief.

The petition filed Tuesday by lawyers for the Exoneration Project asks the criminal division's presiding Judge Leroy Martin Jr. to appoint a \"special master\" to review cases brought by former Sgt. Ronald Watts and officers he supervised. Watts is a former public housing officer notorious for shaking down drug dealers for protection money and pinning false cases on those who wouldn't play ball. Watts and another officer, Kallatt Mohammed, were arrested by the FBI in 2012 and later pleaded guilty to stealing money from a federal informant. Lawsuits filed by Clarissa Glenn and her husband, Ben Baker, who spent a decade in prison after being framed by Watts when he complained to internal affairs, have exposed further wrongdoing, the petition says. Chicago aldermen earlier this month agreed to pay $2 million to two whistleblower cops who were blackballed by the Police Department for helping investigate Watts and Mohammed. The city agreed to settle the case in May just before trial. \"There is little question that (those cases) barely scratch the surface of the wrongful arrests, prosecutions and convictions at the hands of an individual the Cook County State's Attorney's Office now acknowledges is a 'dirty police officer,'\" the filing says. \"The interests of justice necessitate a full accounting of all the victims that have been harmed by wrongful conviction through the actions of these rogue Chicago police officers.\" Chicago police sergeant and his crew \u2014 and that a code of silence within the department covered up the wrongdoing for years. Ben Baker, 43, was freed... A South Side man who spent more than a decade in prison on false drug charges filed a federal lawsuit Thursday alleging he was framed by a corrupt Chicago police sergeant and his crew \u2014 and that a code of silence within the department covered up the wrongdoing for years. Ben Baker, 43, was freed... (Jason Meisner) The petition was brought on behalf of Jamie Kalven, a reporter and activist who wrote a four-part series on the two blacklisted Chicago cops, Shannon Spalding and Daniel Echeverria, who secretly worked with the FBI for two years to build a case against Watts and his crew. It was a request not made lightly, said Joshua Tepfer, an Exoneration Project attorney. \"This is not just me or Jamie Kalven saying this \u2014 this is 10 years of law enforcement documents from the FBI and DEA backing this up,\" he said. \"This is an extreme remedy and I don't think it should be made frequently.\" A special master \u2014 who essentially works on behalf of the court \u2014 would have power to subpoena records from Chicago police and state prison internal affairs as well as the Independent Police Review Authority and its precursor to determine whether defendants had previously complained that they were framed, Tepfer said. Tepfer said he was asking Martin to limit the inquiry to cases in which Watts or a direct underling made an arrest that led to a felony conviction, in which the defendant alleged he was framed and that he never had a chance to back that claim with the substantial evidence since uncovered of Watts' wrongdoing. Cases that fit that criteria \u2014 and occurred from roughly 1998 to 2012 \u2014 would be presented to Martin, who would decide whether the defendants should receive a lawyer to present their claims, Tepfer said. He asked the judge to prioritize cases in which a defendant was still in prison. Tepfer said the scope of the inquiry was too broad for the state's attorney's conviction integrity unit, which has a small staff and is focused on re-examining murder cases. ",

By Rick Maese November 28 at 2:07 PM Follow @RickMaese Marathon runner Pat Huffman says of running, \u2018You\u2019ve got to understand, this is my whole life.\u2019 (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) One of the most unbelievable races of Pat Huffman\u2019s life was winding down. Her watch suggested that she\u2019d never run faster, and she knew the finish line wasn\u2019t far away. The final stretch was the toughest. She was coughing up blood. She\u2019d fallen and gashed her knee. She was out of breath, and everything felt a bit fuzzy. Huffman knew she was making good time in the Marine Corps Historic Half-Marathon but didn\u2019t realize that only two female runners were ahead of her \u2014 and they were both at least 15 years younger. For Huffman, 52, running is life \u2014 the crux of her identity in many ways \u2014 and the Marine Corps Marathon events always carried the most weight. She\u2019d used them to raise tens of thousands of dollars over the years for different charities. She collected the medals and attached the patches each year to her Marine Corps jacket. But it\u2019s the causes she runs for that spur her on. That\u2019s what helped her make those last few steps on the Fredericksburg, Va., course. Huffman had no idea at the time, but she was apparently the third-fastest woman across the finish line. In many ways, it was the race of her life. There was only one problem: race organizers would later call it the most egregious case of cheating they\u2019d ever seen. \u201cNothing added up,\u201d said Rick Nealis, the executive director of the Marine Corps Marathon. \u201cWhy would you cheat in this race? We\u2019re not giving out prize money. This race doesn\u2019t get you to Boston. So why would you cheat?\u201d Huffman had competed in Marine Corps events 15 times in the past \u2014 everything from 10-kilometer races to the full marathon. She\u2019d never before caused anyone to raise an eyebrow. But the race on May 15, 2015, set off a bizarre string of events. Race officials investigated and issued a one-year ban. Huffman protested, and thousands of supporters lined up behind her. Then came an Internet confession followed by claims of online identity theft. Now, 1\u00bd years later, Huffman maintains her innocence and says her reputation as a runner has been damaged, perhaps irretrievably so. She poses the same question as race officials: Why in the world would she ever cheat? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand, this is my whole life. Why would I do that?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not about the award. I have a whole basement of awards. I don\u2019t need the award. I train for everything I do. There\u2019s no need to cheat.\u201d Huffman has a funny moment with her student, Jessica Allen, 10, before a training session. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \u2018At a whole diferent level\u2019 Huffman calls herself the \u201cPeaceful Warrior,\u201d and her relationship with running goes back to her teenage years growing up in Howard County. Her high school didn\u2019t have a girls\u2019 cross-country team, so she pleaded to run with the boys. \u201cI couldn\u2019t catch the slowest boys, but I tried like hell,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI loved it and I was good at it right away. Running came naturally for me.\u201d Running can be a selfish endeavor, she concedes, but that\u2019s part of the reason she always wanted to run for a cause. For every race she signed up for, she\u2019d choose a charity and enlist friends, family and supporters to make pledges. She estimates that she\u2019s raised more than $200,000 over the course of two decades for wide-ranging causes such as sexual assault and post-traumatic stress disorder. A spokesperson for the Fisher House Foundation confirmed that in recent years Huffman ran on behalf of the organization that helps military families, including her suspect 2015 half-marathon in Fredericksburg. And the executive director of OAR \u2014 the Organization for Autism Research \u2014 said Huffman raced several years on behalf of his organization, raising several thousands of dollars each time. \u201cShe\u2019s at a whole different level than most people,\u201d explained Phil Lang, executive director of the Howard County Striders running group. \u201cWhen she finds a charity or a cause, she kicks it up to a whole other level. It goes way beyond what the normal runner would do. Just run and run and run. She can\u2019t help herself.\u201d It was always personal. Running, after all, had helped save her. Huffman says she was brutally assaulted and raped six years ago. She still suffers from PTSD related to the attack and has found solace in running. She stopped running full marathons then but still wanted to compete in shorter distances, mostly half-marathons, and 5- and 10-kilometer races. Initially, she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of running an actual race, fighting through a large crowd of strangers. So she organized \u201cvirtual races,\u201d running on a treadmill against others similarly situated in their basements or exercise rooms. Those served as fundraisers, too. \u201cIn all those years, I never ran for myself,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cIt was always charity.\u201d And that\u2019s why it was so devastating that when she ran the fastest race of her life, a man on the other end of the telephone said he didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done it fairly. \u201cThis might be hard to understand, but it was like being raped all over again,\u201d Huffman said. It doesn\u2019t add up The day of the race was sunny, and temperatures didn\u2019t approach 80 until the afternoon. Huffman says there was nothing unusual about the start. She greeted the wheelchair competitors at the starting line, and as always, she\u2019d dedicated the race to a pair of veterans who had struggled with PTSD and committed suicide. Their names were written on her arms. When the race started, like usual, she tried to get out front, away from the crowd. Because of her PTSD, she says she feels more comfortable with space around her. The race unfolded unspectacularly. Huffman knew she was making good time. She only vaguely remembers cruising through downtown and seeing Fredericksburg\u2019s colonial buildings along the way. \u201cThe thing is, when I run to run fast, I\u2019m locked in,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want anyone to touch me and I don\u2019t want to be tripped up.\u201d After tripping and falling near an area known as Hospital Hill. Pat Huffman ended the race bloodied. (Marine Corps Marathon photo) About 10\u00bd miles into the race, she suffered her only real calamity: She tripped near an area known as Hospital Hill. A local runner who was on hand to encourage racers approached her. Huffman dusted herself off, ignored the pain and continued toward the finish line, accompanied part of the way by the local runner. She said she was surprised there were so many others around her near the finish line, given her pace, until she remembered the slower 10-kilometer runners were also finishing at the same time. Race officials didn\u2019t notice Huffman crossing the finish line, despite her fast time and her blood-stained shirt. Huffman recalls finishing the race in less than 1 hour 34 minutes; race organizers were unable to confirm that time because her result has been purged from their system. At the awards ceremony that afternoon, another woman was honored as the third-place finisher. The next day, race officials looked at the finishing times and noticed Huffman\u2019s name. \u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018We messed up,\u2019 \u201d Nealis said. \u201c. . . It bothered me that we made a mistake, but I was going to fix it and make it right.\u201d As race officials delved further, though, things didn\u2019t add up, and they weren\u2019t always satisfied with Huffman\u2019s explanations. Finally, after more than a week of discussions, Nealis was convinced that Huffman had cheated. After the race director made his ruling, Huffman\u2019s friends and supporters rallied around her. Within hours, more than 1,000 names appeared on an online petition demanding that her punishment be lifted. Soon there would be nearly 5,000. Nealis\u2019s phone started ringing. Some people even showed up at his office. No one could understand how race officials would accuse this woman of cheating, someone who was doing it all for charity. Nealis didn\u2019t pretend to know her motivation, but he had no doubts. On a recent October afternoon, Nealis was in his Quantico office preparing for the 41st running of the Marine Corps Marathon. He pulled a purple folder out of a filing cabinet, labeled \u201cCheater.\u201d He said he\u2019d gone through all of this before with Huffman. He remembered back to the days following the race and asking Angela Anderson, the race\u2019s deputy director, to investigate. \u201cShe came back and said, \u2018This is an incredible lady. She works with Team Fisher House; she\u2019s a veteran fundraiser; she was brutally attacked and suffered PTSD. She wouldn\u2019t cheat. She\u2019s a wonderful lady,\u2019 \u201d Nealis recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m glad she\u2019s a wonderful lady, but this doesn\u2019t add up.\u2019 \u201d Pat Huffman says, \u2018Being accused of this changed everything.\u2019 (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) A matter of time Cheating is considered a cardinal sin among runners, a dedicated, tireless lot who respect the effort and sacrifices it takes to simply reach the starting line. In Huffman\u2019s case, Nealis felt he had more than enough evidence. The Marine Corps Marathon contracts with a photography company that stations a photographer every mile or so, with more placed downtown to capture the picturesque backdrops and classic buildings. More than a dozen are spread across the course. He told them to search for Huffman\u2019s bib No. 7243. There are plenty of photographs and eyewitnesses that show Huffman at both the start and the finish, but none could be found for a nearly seven-mile stretch in the middle of the course. She\u2019s like a ghost for the bulk of the race. In the photos that do exist of Huffman, Nealis felt her gait looked suspicious, her feet close together and too close to the ground. She didn\u2019t look like an elite runner who typically posts such a fast time, he said. He requested the data from the timing chip that runners carry throughout the race. There are five mats on the course that register when a runner has passed \u2014 the start/finish and four more every three miles or so. Huffman\u2019s chip showed her at the start and hitting the first mat three miles into the race. But the chip didn\u2019t record her crossing the next two mats. She doesn\u2019t show up on the course again until the 12-mile mark. Huffman said race organizers initially told her that her chip didn\u2019t register at the start of the race; Nealis denies this and said he was vague in his explanation while they investigated, keeping his cards close to his chest. Huffman said she can\u2019t be held responsible for cameras that didn\u2019t catch her or timing equipment that didn\u2019t work properly. Nealis pointed out that no other runner experienced a similar timing malfunction. Even if the cameras simply missed her and the chip did malfunction, Nealis said, the times don\u2019t add up. Her mile-split at the three-mile mark indicated she was running 10-minute miles \u2014 he says, on pace for a 2:11 finish. To finish when she did required her to run the remainder of the race at a pace more than 33 percent faster than she ran the first leg. More than two dozen race results for Huffman are available in various online databases. Her times vary widely. Her best mile pace appears to be a 7:29 in a Marine Corps 10k in 2011. Most of her mile-splits are in the nine-minute range. On the same course one year earlier, Huffman finished in 2:06:41, a 9:39 mile pace. And just two weeks before the Fredericksburg race, she completed a half-marathon in Pittsburgh in 2:09:16 \u2014 a mile-split of 9:51. She finished 89th in her age category there and was 2,793rd among women, more than a half-hour slower than her Fredericksburg result. Her personal record entering the Marine Corps race came one year earlier when she completed the Garden Spot Village Half\u00adMarathon in New Holland, Pa., in 1:40:46, a 7:41 mile pace. \u201cI remember hearing at some point what her [Marine Corps] time was and thought, \u2018Wow. That\u2019s pretty darn fast,\u2019 \u201d said Lang, who has coached Huffman in the past. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to me it was totally out of the question. . . . Just a really good race. \u2018Wow, she popped a good one. Good for her.\u2019 \u201d Nealis, though, is convinced, and because Huffman wouldn\u2019t admit to any wrongdoing, he banned her from any Marine Corps races for a year. \u201cThe egregious thing to me really goes back to the remorse,\u201d Nealis said. \u201cYou\u2019re caught \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019s out there running and I have no doubt that she could run a half-marathon, at least from looking at other races she\u2019s done. She can run, she can do it \u2014 so why not do it? Why wake up and decide to cheat and skip those six or seven miles?\u201d Huffman chuckles and shakes her head at the mention of the word \u201cremorse.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t show remorse because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d she said. Pat Huffman, center left, gives instructions to her youth runners with the Bullseye Running Junior Striders club. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Taking the next step Nealis had wrapped his investigation when a posting appeared on Facebook under Huffman\u2019s name admitting to cheating in the Fredericksburg race. Huffman\u2019s phone began lighting up with friends confused about the surprising confession. Huffman said she didn\u2019t write the post; her account was hacked. Nealis said it had no bearing on his decision, but more than a year later, Huffman is still grappling with the idea that her credibility has been questioned, that she might never clear her name and that anyone might doubt her integrity. She has struggled with depression and stopped competing for several months after the Marine Corps ban. \u201cThis affected everything I do,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery ounce of my life. Being accused of this changed everything.\u201d One recent October afternoon, Huffman was preparing for her running class behind Centennial High in Ellicott City. She coaches youth runners, ages 8-13, there twice a week. She was laughing and smiling as she gave instruction, clearly enjoying herself. She doesn\u2019t want the children or their parents to think she\u2019d ever cheat in a race. \u201cI just can\u2019t explain how badly it hurts that someone would even conceive of me doing that,\u201d she said shortly before the class began. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I tell my kids: If you can\u2019t make it, walk, whatever. But don\u2019t come back and tell me you did it.\u201d Huffman has dealt with some injuries but is back competing again. She ran the Boston Marathon this year for the first time, exempt from qualifying because she met a fundraising threshold. She also ran an event called the Tough Ruck, in which competitors must march 26.2 miles carrying a 30-pound ruck sack, an American flag and a soldier\u2019s boot filled with cement. If Nealis is right and Huffman cheated the Fredericksburg course, it certainly serves as a black mark on a prolific race r\u00e9sum\u00e9. But then again, Huffman was never really out there running for herself anyway. Her donation to the Fisher House that day counted all the same. \u201cObviously, putting up something individually special is one thing,\u201d Lang said, \u201cbut being able to contribute to others as she has done is so much more important.\u201d sports Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "Trump to nominate Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary, sources say Published               November 29, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump will nominate former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin to be his Treasury Secretary, two sources close to the transition told Fox News late Tuesday.\u00a0 One source told Fox that a formal announcement of Mnuchin's nomination could come as early as Wednesday.\u00a0 Mnuchin had long been considered a favorite for the Treasury position. Two weeks ago, businessman and close Trump associate Carl Icahn tweeted that Trump was considering Mnuchin for the post. Mnuchin, 53, was appointed Trump's campaign finance chair this past May. Through his work, Mnuchin grew close to Trump's children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- a top adviser to Trump -- and worked with them on fundraising events. The campaign raised at least $169 million, in addition to the $66 million Trump spent out of his own pocket. Though that was far short of what Hillary Clinton raised, it represented an impressive haul given that Trump didn't begin fundraising in earnest until the end of May. If approved by the Senate, Mnuchin would follow in the tradition of two previous treasury secretaries -- Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and Henry Paulson in George W. Bush's. All had vast Wall Street experience gained from years spent working at Goldman Sachs. Yet unlike Rubin and Paulson and unlike President Barack Obama's two treasury secretaries, Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew, Mnuchin would bring no government experience to Treasury, something that could prove a hurdle in navigating the tricky politics of Washington. After graduating from Yale in 1985. Mnuchin worked for Goldman Sachs for 17 years. His father, Robert Mnuchin, had himself worked for Goldman for three decades, becoming a partner in charge of equity trading. The younger Mnuchin amassed his own fortune at the firm and then left in 2002. He worked briefly for Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund led by George Soros, before starting his own investment firm, Dune Capital Management. As head of this firm, Mnuchin and other investors participated in the purchase of failed mortgage lender IndyMac in 2009 and renamed it OneWest. The failure of IndyMac in 2008 with $32 billion in assets was one of the biggest casualties of the housing bust. Mnuchin became chairman of OneWest, which was sold to CIT Group in 2015. Before the sale, OneWest faced a string of lawsuits over its home foreclosure practices. This month, housing advocates filed a complaint asking the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate OneWest for possible violations of the Fair Housing Act. The lender failed to place branches in minority communities, provided few mortgages to black homebuyers and preserved foreclosed properties in white neighborhoods while allowing similar homes in minority communities to fall into disrepair, according to the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. CIT declined to respond directly to the complaint but stressed in a statement that it is \"committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.\" Mnuchin also became a major investor in Hollywood, helping finance a number of movies, including the 2009 blockbuster \"Avatar.\" As treasury secretary, Mnuchin would be the administration's chief economic spokesman, serving as a liaison not only to Wall Street but also to global investors, a critical role given the trillions of dollars in treasury bonds owned by foreigners. In addition, it would be his job to sell the new administration's economic program to Congress. Mnuchin will also oversee a sprawling bureaucracy that includes the Internal Revenue Service and the agency that issues millions of Social Security and other benefit checks each month. Treasury also runs the agency that wages the financial war on terrorism. Earlier Tuesday, Trump officially nominated Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as Health and Human Services Secretary and tapped Elaine Chao, former President George W. Bush's Labor Secretary, to be secretary of transportation. Price, a former surgeon, supports the repeal of ObamaCare and has offered a replacement that would provide tax credits to subsidize the purchase of individual and family health insurance policies. His proposal would also allow insurers to sell policies across state line, boost incentives for health savings accounts, and create high-risk pools to help individuals afford coverage, while barring assistance for nearly all abortions. Price has emerged as a top advocate of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to transform Medicare from a program that supplies a defined set of benefits into a \"premium support\" model that would, similar to Obamacare, offer subsidies for participants to purchase health care directly from insurance companies. He also wants the Medicare eligibility age to rise to 67. Price also backs, as does Trump, a plan by House Republicans to sharply cut the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled and turn it over to the states to run. Like Trump and most other Republicans, Price wants federal funding withdrawn from Planned Parenthood, which has come under attack for its practice of supplying tissue from aborted fetuses to medical researchers. If confirmed as Transportation Secretary, Chao would face many pressing issues, such as\u00a0how to boost the nation's aging infrastructure so that it can accommodate population growth and not become a drag on the economy, modernizing the nation's air traffic control system, ensuring that new transportation technologies are adopted in a safe manner and responding to a surge in traffic fatalities. After serving in the Bush administration, Chao served on the board of directors for Bloomberg Philanthropies, run by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. She resigned last year after learning the organization planned to expand an environmental initiative to shutter coal-fired power plants. Almost 90 percent of Kentucky's electricity comes from coal, and Chao's ties to the organization were used against her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, during his 2014 re-election campaign.

Flener said strong afternoon winds fanned the wildfire on land in the great Smoky Mountains National Park to move quickly onto private property.\u00a0 That fire is now burning 500 acres, CBS affiliate WDEF reported. TEMA said no deaths have been reported. The National Guard has been mobilized to Sevier County, CBS affiliate WVLT reported . Officials with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park issued an air quality advisory Monday. Fires are now in the Pittman Center, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg areas. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is now closed, WVLT reported. A representative with the park said the air quality is unhealthy for the Sevier County section of the park and adjacent areas, especially in the Gatlinburg area due to heavy smoke from the nearby Chimney 2 Fire. The Sevier County Humane Society said all animals are safe. Fires Burning Now...based on a map from TN Dept. of Agriculture / Forestry https://t.co/yUhHE45Mla #local8wx pic.twitter.com/oqDqGFTG1H \u2014 Local 8 News (@wvlt) November 29, 2016 Storms roaring across the South appeared to be taking aim at some of the largest wildfires burning across the region, which could finally help firefighters in their efforts to subdue the blazes, authorities said Monday.\u00a0 As the storm system passed over Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee late Monday, it was heading toward some of largest wildfires in Georgia and North Carolina. The rain forecast \u201cputs the bull\u2019s-eye of the greatest amounts right at the bull\u2019s-eye of where we\u2019ve been having our greatest activity,\u201d said Dave Martin, deputy director of operations for fire and aviation management with the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. The projected rainfall amounts \u201creally lines up with where we need it,\u201d Martin said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re all knocking on wood.\u201d Yet after weeks of punishing drought , any rain that falls should be soaked up quickly, forecasters said. It will provide some relief but won\u2019t end the drought -- or the fire threat, they say.\u00a0 Drought conditions will likely persist, authorities said. The problem is that rainfall amounts have been 10 to 15 inches below normal during the past three months in many parts of the South, authorities said. \u201cI think we racked up deficits that are going to be too much to overcome with just one storm system,\u201d said Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. \u201cI would say it\u2019s way too early to say \u2018Yes, this drought is over,\u2019\u201d Svoboda said. \u201cDoes it put a dent in it? Yes, but we have a long ways to go.\u201d\u00a0 Monday afternoon, exhausted firefighters continued to battle brush fires across the state as their jobs are made harder by strong wind gusts across central Alabama ahead of possible severe weather this evening, CBS affiliate WAIT reported .\u00a0 As of 2:30 p.m. Monday, the Alabama Forestry Commission said there are 20 active fires in the state. One is on the Walker County/Cullman line on Highway 127 in Bremen. \u2014 EagleScoutNick (@Eaglescoutnick) November 28, 2016 The rain also brings danger because strong winds at the leading edge of the storms can topple trees and limbs that can kill and injure firefighters, he said.\u00a0 In Mississippi, trees were reported downed in nearly 20 counties across the state. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts of more than 50 mph were reported and more than 2 inches of rain fell in some areas. Power outages peaked at more than 23,000 statewide in Mississippi. Powerlines downed by winds sparked grass fires in four counties, said Greg Flynn, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The storms were moving across Alabama on Monday night and were expected to slam into Georgia during the overnight hours. High wind warnings were issued for mountainous areas in northern parts of Georgia.\u00a0 In South Carolina, the stormy forecast was giving hope to firefighters battling a blaze in the northwest corner of the state. The South Carolina Forestry Commission hopes to contain the Pinnacle Mountain fire by the middle of next week. More rain was expected Tuesday night and Wednesday morning in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

FBI Director James Comey testifies before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington in July. (Michael Reynolds / European Pressphoto Agency) Democrats have found no shortage of scapegoats for Hillary Clinton 's loss in the presidential election. But Clinton's top pollster is sticking with a simpler explanation: blame FBI \u00a0Director James Comey . \"We were winning this campaign,\" pollster Joel Benenson told former senior White House adviser David Axelrod during an event this week at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics. \"We came out of the third debate consolidating our lead ... and we get to 11 days out and the director of the FBI takes an unprecedented action and throws a monkey wrench into the campaign that you couldn't have anticipated.\" Benenson, who served as Clinton's chief strategist and also polled for President Barack Obama's winning campaigns in 2008 and 2012, said that he'd warned Clinton long ago that she faced an uphill battle as she tried to follow a two-term Democratic president. He acknowledged during the Monday night event that on the eve of the election, Clinton's team had only expected to lose two of the 10 key swing states \u2014 Florida and North Carolina. But he blamed Comey's October announcement that the FBI had discovered emails that might be linked to its investigation of whether Clinton mishandled classified information for Trump's victory, not missteps by Clinton and her team.

I am pleased to nominate Elaine as Secretary of the Department of Transportation.\u201d Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W.

Tim Ryan. Ryan poses a long-shot, but serious challenge to her leadership post, the first she has faced since 2010. In a closed-door election, the 194-member Democratic caucus will decide the race between Pelosi and Ryan as well as other top positions that will help steer the Democrats for the next two years. The election was originally expected to take place November 17, but Pelosi was forced to move the date to November 30 because of pushback from some members of her caucus who wanted more time to process the party's Election Day defeat. Ryan stepped up to challenge Pelosi after Democrats picked up just six seats on November 8 \u2014 far fewer than expected. He says that Pelosi and her team, also in their mid-70s, have served their time and that new leadership and new ideas are needed. \"We are not winning elections,\" Ryan told NBC News Wednesday, pointing to the loss of nearly 60 seats in the past six years. \"There is just no easy way to say this. When I talk to my colleagues, I said, 'Look, this is that uncomfortable family discussion you need to have, like when your parents or spouse tells you something you really don't want to hear but down deep you know it's right.'\" Play Dem Rep. on why new leadership is needed 4:47 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161130081525if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/820258883836\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Ryan says that Democrats have played too much into identity politics and alienated the whites voters Donald Trump won overwhelmingly, especially in the Rust Belt. \"I think, in part, we try to slice the electorate up. And we try to say, 'You're black, you're brown, you're gay, you're straight, you're a woman, you're a man.' The reality of it is there's no juice in that kind of campaign. There's no energy in that because it's divided,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. \"And we've got to have someone who can not just go on MSNBC, but go on Fox and Fox Business and CNBC, and go into union halls and fish fries and churches all over the country and start a brush fire about what a new Democratic Party looks like.\" The argument against Pelosi is also generational. Ryan, who has written a book on the importance of meditation, says that the current leadership, which includes Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, both in their 70s, needs to \"increase the number of voices\" in Democratic leadership. Related: In Battle for Democratic Party, Rep. Tim Ryan Challenges Pelosi for Leader Ryan proposed creating a new leadership position dedicated to a member who has served three terms or less. He also suggested that a newly created Committee on Policy Innovation be an \"Idea Factory,\" and that the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House, be nominated and chosen by the entire caucus. Currently, the leader chooses the head of the DCCC and it's up to the caucus to approve. Pelosi, who has the backing of President Barack Obama, whom she helped to deliver his major legislative accomplishments, said Ryan's assertion that she can't talk to white workers is absurd. \"He didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton,\" Pelosi told the Huffington Post , \"so I don't know why he's saying that.\" Play ",

Civil rights groups said the president-elect\u2019s victory has\u00a0inspired... (Jaweed Kaleem) Frustration also boiled over inside the mainstream media. One Politico editor, Michael Hirsh,\u00a0resigned last week after posting Spencer\u2019s addresses on Facebook and telling followers to \"Stop whining about Richard B. Spencer, Nazi, and exercise your rights as decent Americans,\u201d according to\u00a0comments first reported by the Daily Caller. \u201cHe lives part of the time next door to me in Arlington.

Trump himself disavowed the alt-right in a meeting with New York Times journalists, telling them , \u201cIt\u2019s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why.\u201d\u00a0 Among the alt-right\u2019s less hard-core associates,\u00a0the coverage of the Nazi salutes\u00a0has been like a light suddenly turned\u00a0on in a dark room. They scattered, issuing clarifications and recriminations along the way. Paul Joseph Watson, an editor for the conspiracy-minded site InfoWars,\u00a0 said \u00a0in July that he was \u201cin the alt-right,\u201d but then denied it\u00a0 last week , going on to argue that two different factions of the group\u00a0had emerged. \u201cOne is more accurately described as the New Right. These people like to wear MAGA [Make America Great Again]\u00a0hats, create memes & have fun,\u201d Watson wrote on Facebook, criticizing mainstream media for focusing on Trump\u2019s racist supporters. \u201cThey include whites, blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays and everyone else. These are the people who helped Trump win the election. \u201cThe other faction likes to fester in dark corners of sub-reddits\u201d \u2014 a reference to branches of the social-media site Reddit \u2014 \u201cand obsess about Jews, racial superiority and Adolf Hitler. This is a tiny fringe minority. They had no impact on the election.\u201d Some white nationalists themselves have a term for the split: the alt-right\u00a0versus the \u201calt-lite.\u201d Stephen K.

(Drew Angerer / Getty Images) White nationalists are\u00a0alt-right\u00a0and right-wing sites like Breitbart News and its chairman, the new White House advisor Stephen K. Bannon, are alt-lite,\u00a0according to Brad Griffin, a white nationalist who blogs under the pen name Hunter Wallace at the site Occidental Dissent. \u201cSteve Bannon is the most important figure in the alt-lite,\u201d Griffin wrote.\u00a0\u201cWe all see Breitbart as the premier alt-lite website which has popularized a diluted version of our beliefs.\u201d Breitbart News, which channels a more nationalistic form of mainstream conservatism,\u00a0gained notoriety over the last year both for implicitly supporting Trump\u2019s candidacy and for Bannon\u2019s proud announcement to Mother Jones in August, \u201cWe're the platform for the alt-right.\u201d Left-wing critics have called the site a front for white nationalism\u00a0and anti-Semitism, which its staffers have vigorously denied. Bannon and Breitbart staffers have distanced themselves from the alt-right label, which Bannon defined in a postelection\u00a0 interview with the Wall Street Journal as \u201cyounger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment.\u201d Bannon said alt-right supporters had\u00a0\u201csome racial and anti-Semitic overtones\u201d that he said he disagreed with, and that Breitbart News\u00a0provides \u201can outlet for 10 or 12 or 15 lines of thought,\u201d of which the alt-right is \u201ca tiny part.\u201d The heightened scrutiny of the alt-right has led mainstream institutions to draw tougher policies on addressing the movement. After the election, Twitter banished many prominent far-right users from its service, which had been a staging ground for racist, sexist and anti-Jewish attacks against public figures and journalists.

But the Facebook post is a valuable clue to Artan's state of mind as they try to determine if the ambush was rooted in terrorism or if he had a personal problem or grudge that pushed him over the edge. Two U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News there are no known contacts between Artan and ISIS or any other foreign terrorist organization, disputing an unsubstantiated claim from ISIS' media arm \u2014 which has become routine with attacks \u2014 that he was working in service of the Islamic State. The post was a picture of a document on a Dell computer screen with the warning: \"Screenshot this before it gets deleted.\" Below that was a jumbled diatribe in which the author railed about the treatment of Muslims around the world, including the Rohingya in Burma. There was no specific threat of violence but a suggestion that the U.S. could stop \"lone wolf attacks\" by making peace with \"dawla in al sham,\" an outdated name for ISIS. He wrote that he had reached \"a boiling point\" and included a bombastic vow to \"kill a billion infidels\" to save a single Muslim. He also name-checked radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, calling him a \"hero.\" \"By Allah, we will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims. You will not celebrate or enjoy any holiday,\" the post reads. In addition to dissecting the post, investigators are also delving into Artan's history, which superficially appeared to be the story of a devout scholar with an easy smile and a close-knit family. Screen grab from suspect's 2016 graduation from Columbus State Community College. He grew up in Somalia but left with his family in 2007, settling in Islamabad, Pakistan, according to law enforcement officials. According to Khan, Artan completed an advanced program at a top high school. He prayed five times a day and played cricket. \"He was a very, very nice person,\" Khan said. After seven years in Pakistan, Artan and his mother and his siblings came to the U.S. as refugees. His father lives and works in Dubai, Khan said. According to Catholic Charities records, the family came to America through Texas, staying in a temporary shelter in Dallas for 24 days before relocating to Columbus, Ohio, a city with a sizable Somali community.

And the fact that this would be a novel application of the corporate monitor role \u2014 such people are typically appointed as part of a settlement in a legal case, as a move by a company to ease the punishment \u2014 might give you pause. But appointing one would also suggest that you take the conflict issue seriously, not only to the American public but also to the rest of the world, which has long looked to the United States as a model of democracy. If your administration even raises the specter of corruption in the White House, that would undermine the entire country, as well as our economy. Companies like Apple, BP, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Siemens and Zimmer have been subject to corporate monitors. Typically, such a person is installed at the behest of the government after a business has been involved in breaking antitrust laws or foreign corrupt practices laws. For example, the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen was required to hire a corporate monitor to oversee Point72, his family office, as part of an insider trading settlement. A corporate monitor traditionally provides reports to the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission to make sure the company he or she oversees is in compliance with the law. A New York Times contributor, Steven Davidoff Solomon, has critically called the idea of corporate monitors in the business context \u201ca full employment act for former federal prosecutors that may have little effect on the way any company that is forced to hire a monitor conducts its business.\u201d That\u2019s true when companies hire cronies or other friends. That\u2019s why it is important to hire someone truly independent. \u201cThe mere presence of a corporate monitor can help to change the culture of a company and how it approaches its internal controls and compliance and ethics programs,\u201d Ryan C.

Trump, on Monday at Trump Tower. \u201cWhen he\u2019s upset with someone, they know it,\u201d she said. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Kellyanne Conway, one of President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2019s senior advisers, was about to board a flight back to New York on Monday morning when she caught a glimpse of the headline crawling across television screens in the terminal. \u201cSOURCES: TRUMP \u2018FURIOUS\u2019 OVER CONWAY COMMENTS ABOUT ROMNEY,\u201d screamed the headline on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program. Ms. Conway quickly dialed Mr. Trump, as well as Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and confidant, seeking reassurance that the headline was wrong. She got it. Ms. Conway, the Republican pollster and strategist who managed Mr. Trump\u2019s improbable campaign, said the president-elect was neither surprised nor angered by her public excoriation a day earlier of former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, a top prospect for secretary of state in the Trump administration. \u201cWhen he\u2019s upset with someone, they know it,\u201d Ms. Conway said in a telephone interview late Monday afternoon. While her public display may have bothered some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, by all accounts, her close relationship with the next occupant of the Oval Office remains secure. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump, in a statement emailed Monday evening by his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said: \u201cKellyanne came to me and asked whether or not she could go public with her thoughts on the matter. I encouraged her to do so. Most importantly she fully acknowledged there is only one person that makes the decision. She has always been a tremendous asset and that will continue.\u201d To those on the outside of the Trump transition, her remarks on Sunday had all the hallmarks of a political staff member gone rogue. Amid reports of intense closed-door deliberations over who should be secretary of state, Ms. Conway had seemed intent on committing a heretical political act by an aide: boxing in her boss. She wrote on Twitter about a \u201cdeluge\u201d of concerns from conservatives and appeared repeatedly on television, insisting that a Romney appointment would be seen by Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d But little in Mr. Trump\u2019s universe is simple. In fact, people familiar with the dynamic inside Trump Tower \u2014 who were granted anonymity to discuss the unusual process that Mr. Trump has allowed for his transition \u2014 said Ms. Conway had been neither insubordinate nor acting directly on the president-elect\u2019s instruction. By denouncing Mr. Romney even as Mr. Trump was preparing for their second meeting, this time over dinner on Tuesday, Ms. Conway was simply doing what she knows Mr. Trump likes: encouraging a public airing of conflicting views when he is unsure of what path to take. \u201cThe president-elect would never need to turn on a TV station to find out how I feel about anything or anyone \u2014 he would already know it,\u201d she said, noting that she had not said anything publicly that she had not also shared with Mr. Trump privately. \u201cIt would be a mistake to think that I communicate with him through the TV.\u201d What some saw over the weekend as an act of political defiance by Ms. Conway \u2014 undermining a potential cabinet nominee \u2014 was seen by Mr. Trump as a demonstration of loyalty, according to people who had talked to him. Her criticism of Mr. Romney articulated a view her boss had at times expressed: that Mr. Romney had tried to \u201churt\u201d him during the campaign and had yet to fully acknowledge it or apologize. \u201cThere was the Never Trump movement, and then there was Gov. Mitt Romney,\u201d she said on ABC, adding later, \u201cI only wish Governor Romney had been as critical of Hillary Clinton\u201d during the general election. During the primaries, Mr. Romney called Mr. Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d ",

    "text": "Trump unlikely to sway Supreme Court on flag burning Richard Wolf , USA TODAY 7:45 p.m. EST November 29, 2016 x Share If President-elect Donald Trump has his way, flag burning could become a crime. USA TODAY NETWORK WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 29:  An American flag flies over the U.S. Supreme Court June 29, 2015 in Washington, DC. Today the high court ruled on the controversial drug that was implicated in botched executions, state efforts to reduce partisan influence in congressional redistricting and Environmental Protection Agency limits on the emission of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants.  (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 562361313 ORIG FILE ID: 478979160 (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images) WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump will need to replace far more than one justice on the Supreme Court if he's serious about making flag burning a criminal offense. While Congress has been amenable to the idea -- with the Senate falling a single vote short of starting the constitutional amendment process a decade ago -- the high court has been a bulwark in defense of\u00a0the First Amendment. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that\u00a0\u201cNobody should be allowed to burn the American flag \u2014 if they do, there must be consequences \u2014 perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d As he did, the court's eight justices were preparing to issue the 2016 term's first decision. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, who Trump will get to replace next year, sided with liberal justices in 1989 and 1990 in holding that the Constitution protects flag burning. The first case dealt with a Texas protester; the second struck down a law passed by Congress. Both cases were approved 5-4. Scalia cited his vote on numerous occasions over the year as evidence that he did not always decide cases based on his personal views. \"If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag,\" he said. \"But I am not king.\" Most of the people on Trump's list of 21 potential high court nominees would agree with Scalia, says Jeffrey Rosen, president of the nonpartisan National Constitution Center. The flag-burning decisions, he says, are \"entrenched as part of our First Amendment tradition.\" What's more, only Justice Samuel Alito among current justices has been willing to restrict free speech considered by many to be abhorrent, such as protests at a Marine veteran's funeral and videos that depict the mutilating animals. By contrast, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 8-1 decisions upholding those forms of speech in 2010 and 2011. And he cited the court's past protection of flag burning in controversial 5-4 rulings that upheld the right to spend freely on political campaigns. \"If the First Amendment protects flag burning, funeral protests and Nazi parades \u2014 despite the profound offense such spectacles cause \u2014 it surely protects political campaign speech despite popular opposition,\" Roberts wrote in McCutcheon v. FEC, a 2014 case that struck down aggregate limits on campaign contributions. Trump denounces flag burning, Twitter points out it is constitutional And Justice Anthony Kennedy, the most frequent swing vote on the court, voted with the majority in the 1989 case despite having been nominated by President Ronald Reagan the year before. \"It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who hold it in contempt,\" Kennedy wrote in a separate concurrence. That's apparently not the way Trump's inner circle sees it. His spokesman, Jason Miller, called flag burning \"completely ridiculous\" and \"completely despicable\" in a contentious interview on CNN Tuesday. And Trump may have at least one powerful ally if he's serious about trying to make burning the flag illegal. His nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, supported the Senate's 2006 effort to recommend a constitutional amendment to the states. But the president-elect would face the wrath of civil liberties groups on the right as well as the left. said Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron: \u201cTrump is flirting here with a vision of a dark and totalitarian America, which should be a terrifying prospect for all Americans.\u201d Contributing: David Jackson 3882 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 77 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gGHGc4 ",

    "text": "Nov 29 2016, 5:28 pm ET Trump Will Violate DC Hotel Lease By Taking Office, Say Experts by Ken Dilanian advertisement Among Donald Trump's many potential conflicts of interest, one stands out: His organization's lease with the federal government to redevelop and run a luxury hotel in the iconic Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. How, critics wondered, could President Trump become his own landlord? Now comes a new twist: Two federal procurement experts are arguing that not only will Trump have an ethics challenge \u2014 he will be in violation of the terms of the lease as soon as he takes the oath of office. Steven L. Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at the George Washington University Law School, and Daniel I. Gordon, a senior advisor to GW's Government Procurement Law Program (and President Obama's first administrator for federal procurement policy) pointed out this week in Government Executive magazine that a provision in Trump's lease with the General Services Administration states that \"No ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom...\" Play Trump: I Attended Hotel Opening 'To Be There For My Children' 1:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161130010533if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/794327107960\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \"To protect the integrity of the federal government's procurement process, GSA must end its lease arrangement with President-elect Trump now,\" the experts argue. The GSA, which runs federal government real estate, declined to discuss the specifics when contacted by NBC News. \"GSA plans to coordinate with the President-elect's team to address any issues that may be related to the Old Post Office building,\" spokeswoman Renee Kelly said in a statement. \"GSA ran a fair and open competition, subject to careful and rigorous review, which resulted in the selection of the Trump Organization as the preferred private sector entity to redevelop the Old Post Office. GSA negotiated a lease with the Trump Organization and submitted the details to Congress prior to signing the lease in August 2013,\" Kelly added. The federal conflicts of interest law prohibits government officials from using their governmental authority in ways that will help their financial interests, but that law does not apply to the president. Trump has dismissed concerns about his business ties, telling the New York Times, \"The president can't have a conflict of interest.\" But whatever the law says, the lease is clear, Schooner and Gordon say. Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump attend the ground breaking of the Trump International Hotel at the Old Post Office Building in Washington on July 23, 2014. Gary Cameron / Reuters \"The language could not be any more specific or clear,\" they write, having first raised the issue in a November 15 op-ed in the Washington Post. \"Donald Trump will breach the contract on Jan. 20, when, while continuing to benefit from the lease, he will become an `elected official of the Government of the United States.'\" \"The situation is a casebook example of both the appearance of a significant conflict of interest and an intolerable intermingling of an elected official's governmental duties and his family's personal financial interests.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The hotel has drawn attention for another reason. The Washington Post reported Nov. 18 that foreign diplomats were booking rooms there in an effort to \"build ties with the new administration.\" \"The faster GSA ends its business relationship with the Trump Organization, the better,\" Schooner and Gordon write.

The claim\u00a0issued by Amaq news agency makes no suggestion that the\u00a0assailant, Abdul Razak Artan,\u00a0had been in direct contact with the group or was formally affiliated with the organization, according to a transcript of the report provided by SITE Intelligence Group,\u00a0which monitors radical organizations. \"The executor of the attack in the American state of Ohio is a soldier of the Islamic State and he carried out the operation in response to calls to target citizens of international coalition countries,'' according to a translation of the Amaq report provided by SITE. Accused Ohio State attacker reportedly posted rant online SITE Director Rita Katz immediately cast doubt on any formal affiliation between the suspect, a member of a Somali\u00a0refugee family, and the terror group also known as ISIS or ISIL. \"This style of reporting by ISIS indicates it wasn't coordinated with the group,'' Katz said Tuesday, adding that the attack, however, was consistent with recent public appeals from the group to lash out using vehicles and knives as weapons.

Caption A wildfire has struck the Chimney Tops mountain and the resort city Gatlinburg. November 2016 A wildfire in Gatlinburg, Tenn. National Park Service Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Residents evacuated the area as trees caught fire on the low slope of the hills and mountains on either side of the road\u00a0\u2014 the flames\u2019 orange tendrils licking at the asphalt\u00a0and black smoke obscuring the sky. \u201cFire was coming over the mountains, and the smoke was so bad we could barely breathe as we were trying to pack up,\u201d Mike Gill, who was evacuating with his wife, Betty, told NBC News . Katie Brittain, manager at\u00a0the Dress Barn in Pigeon Forge, told The Washington Post that when she arrived at work Monday, the sky was brown and ash was raining down. Despite the ominous conditions outside, store employees weren\u2019t sure whether they were supposed to evacuate from their location, not far\u00a0from Dolly Parton\u2019s theme park, Dollywood. She said employees stayed put, but grew increasingly nervous as the smoke thickened and the wind increased that afternoon. By the end of the day, she said, the inside of the store \u201csmelled like a bonfire.\u201d \u201cThe smell was really, really bad,\u201d she said. \u201cMy eyes were burning and our throats were getting scratchy.\u201d \u201cEveryone was kind of in a state of disbelief,\u201d she added. At least 12 people were transported from Gatlinburg for treatment, mostly for non-life-threatening injuries officials said Tuesday. In Gatlinburg, flames\u00a0began engulfing private structures, including the 300-room Park Vista hotel.\u00a0Inside the hotel, dozens of guests were trapped Monday by a wall of flames around the building. Logan Baker\u00a0 told NBC affiliate WBIR \u00a0that the firefighters initially told guests that they would\u00a0be safe inside the building, but a short time later, \u201cthey saw flames coming down the hill.\u201d\u00a0By the time guests had packed their cars with luggage, however, it was too late to escape, Baker told the station, noting that the only road out was covered in flames. \u201cWhen you opened the doors, it just blew you back,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cEmbers started flying into the hotel.\u201d Baker told WBIR he helped bring people back inside the hotel; once inside, firefighters told them to remain in the lobby while they fought the fire outside. Video taken from inside the hotel lobby shows massive flames licking at the windows. Guests can be overheard discussing a plan to \u201cdive into the pool.\u201d \u201cWell, they locked the pool up,\u201d one\u00a0woman\u00a0said. \u2014 \u30ed\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3 Logan (@Redwolfstone123) November 28, 2016 The fire also forced employees at Ripley\u2019s Aquarium of the Smokies to evacuate, leaving behind more than 10,500 animals, Ripley Attractions General Manager Ryan DeSear told WBIR . DeSear said the blaze was about 50 yards from the building when employees had\u00a0to evacuate. \u201cTo them, every animal has a name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t give that up.\u201d But he added: \u201cNothing is more important than human life. Fish can be replaced. It sucks.\u201d Late Tuesday morning, Ripley announced that the animals were \u201csafe and under care.\u201d [ More than 10,000 aquarium animals, dozens of bald eagles spared as fires rage in Tenn. ] The town of Gatlinburg, with a population of about 4,000 about 43 miles south of Knoxville, is surrounded on three sides by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Smokies, part of the Appalachian mountain range, straddle the border between eastern Tennessee and North Carolina. Considered the gateway city to the Tennessee side of the park, Gatlinburg draws more than 11 million visitors a year, according to tourism officials. It is known for its mountain chalets and ski lodge \u2014 drawing honeymooners and other visitors all year long. Gatlinburg\u2019s neighbor, Pigeon Forge, is home to Dollywood, country-themed music venues and attractions, and popular outlet malls. According to the park officials, Great Smoky Mountains National Park logged more than 9.4 million visitors in 2013 \u2014 by far the most of any of the 59 national parks that year. \u201cThe second most heavily visited national park is Grand Canyon with 4.6 million visits,\u201d according to the National Park Service. On Tuesday, the\u00a0Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and other officials urged\u00a0residents in Sevier County to stay clear of roadways to make way for first responders and to stay off wireless devices, unless it was to make an emergency call, to keep systems clear for vital communication. The agency\u00a0also announced a temporary flight restriction in the area \u201cto prevent aircraft from complicating the response.\u201d \u201cThis is going to be a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d Michelle\u00a0Hankes,\u00a0executive director\u00a0of the American Red Cross of East Tennessee, said about\u00a0the response effort . Hankes, who recorded a video statement at an emergency shelter in Pigeon Forge, said that about 130 people, including children and pets, have turned up there while fleeing their homes. Hundreds of others were sheltered elsewhere. \u201cThis fire is unpredictable,\u201d Hankes said, crying. \u201cWe still have wind gusts \u2014 the rain has helped, but it\u2019s still a devastating, devastating loss for the people here. \u201cThese are our community \u2014 this is East Tennessee and we\u2019re going to work together.\u201d Officials said the towns and surrounding area\u00a0sustained widespread property damage. \u201cThe center of Gatlinburg looks good for now,\u201d Newmansville Volunteer Fire Department Lt. Bobby Balding told the Knoxville News Sentinel . But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s the apocalypse\u00a0on both sides.\u201d TEMA\u00a0said Tuesday that \u201cvery preliminary surveys of damaged areas\u201d suggested that \u201chundreds of structures are lost.\u201d \u201cWestgate Resorts is likely entirely gone (more than 100 buildings),\u201d TEMA\u00a0said in a statement, \u201cBlack Bear Falls has likely lost every single cabin.\u201d The agency initially said that\u00a0Ober Gatlinburg Ski Area and Amusement Park \u201creportedly is entirely destroyed.\u201d However, the mountain resort posted a video Tuesday morning showing the facility intact. Officials said in a\u00a0statement \u00a0that Dollywood, in Pigeon Forge\u00a0\u2014 the largest theme park in the area\u00a0\u2014 had sustained no real damage by\u00a0late Monday, but that 50 rooms in the park\u2019s DreamMore Resort and 19 of its cabins were still evacuated. \u201cDollywood crews and firefighters are working to protect the park areas adjacent to a fire burning on Upper Middle Ridge,\u201d according to the statement. [ Few women fight wildfires. That\u2019s not because they\u2019re afraid of flames. ] National park officials explained\u00a0that the severe wind gusts of more than 80 mph, combined with \u201cunprecedented low relative humidity, and extended drought conditions,\u201d\u00a0caused the fire\u00a0\u201cto spread rapidly and unpredictably.\u201d \u201cWind gusts carried burning embers long distances causing new spot fires to ignite across the north-central area of the park and into Gatlinburg,\u201d Great Smoky Mountains National Park wrote on its Facebook page Tuesday morning. \u201cIn addition, high winds caused numerous trees to fall throughout the evening on Monday bringing down power lines across the area that ignited additional new fires that spread rapidly due to sustained winds of over 40 mph.\u201d The conditions made it difficult\u00a0\u2014 if not impossible\u00a0\u2014 for firefighters to contain the flames.

    "text": "Former South Carolina Cop Michael Slager Takes Stand at His Murder Trial, Says He Fired Until Threat Was Stopped By EMILY SHAPIRO Nov 29, 2016, 4:39 PM ET 0 Shares Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via AP Photo WATCH Officer Defends His Actions in Walter Scott Murder Trial 0 Shares Email When former police officer Michael Slager, who is accused of murdering an unarmed black man, took the stand in his own defense at his state murder trial this morning, he swore that the unarmed man was a threat and that he kept shooting him until the threat was over. Slager, who is white, is accused of killing Walter Scott at a traffic stop on April 4, 2015, in North Charleston, South Carolina, when Slager was an officer for the city's police department. Witness video that surfaced shortly after the deadly encounter appears to show the moment Slager fatally shot Scott as he ran away. The video garnered national attention, propelling Slager into the spotlight. Slager, 34, has pleaded not guilty to murder. Slager's attorneys have said the witness video doesn't show the whole struggle between Slager and Scott and does not give the perspective of events from Slager's point of view. On the stand today, Slager told his defense attorney Andy Savage he repeatedly instructed Scott to get on the ground. Slager said he did not curse, did not use a racial epithet and did not do anything to indicate he was angry. Slager said at one point Scott had control of the Taser and he was in fear. Slager told Savage that he warned Scott ahead of time before firing his Taser and firearm. Slager said Scott was a threat and that he kept shooting him until the threat was over. Slager told the court that his life became a \"roller coaster\" after the deadly 2015 shooting. \"When I was in jail, the only thing they wanted to do was give me medicine to calm me down,\" Slager said. \"They wouldn't even talk to me. I remember the doctor who was in charge of mental health came into my cell and said, 'I'll give you whatever medicine you want.'\" He continued, \"My family's been destroyed by this. Scott's family has been destroyed by this. It's horrible.\" Slager explained that he married his wife in 2010 and they were eager to start a family. \"I've always wanted a son or a daughter so due to some medical issues we had to do IVF,\" Slager said. But when his son was born, Slager said he did not attend. His attorney, Andy Savage, asked why, and after a long pause, Slager said, \"I was in jail.\" Savage asked, \"For this case?\" Slager responded, \"Yes, sir.\" Jury Selected in Murder Trial for Former South Carolina Cop Michael Slager During cross-examination, Slager told prosecutors that neither Scott nor his passenger was belligerent to him at the traffic stop. Slager said that Scott \"stated that he owned the car, then he said he did not own the car, then he said he was in the process of buying it.\" Slager said he didn't check Scott's criminal history and he did not know that Scott had a child support warrant. When asked by the prosecution if Scott did anything to escalate the situation other than run, Slager said \"No.\" When asked if Scott had done anything threatening other than trying to get away, Slager said, \"No, not at that time.\" Slager said he later told his supervisors that Scott took the Taser and came at him with it. While he remembers some things about the encounter, \"I don't remember everything that happened,\" Slager said. \"I don't remember Walter Scott's arm around my neck. I don't remember the ground fight,\" he added. \"I don't remember dropping the Taser.\" Slager said he had been Tased himself and that the natural reaction is \"to get away.\" When asked by the prosecution if that was what Scott was doing, Slager said that Scott \"wasn't complying the whole scenario...he never stopped after I gave him multiple commands to stop, even before the Tasing.\" Slager did not specify in his testimony when he had been Tased. \"When Mr. Scott was coming after me with the Taser, I drew my weapon and fired,\" Slager said, adding that Scott \"tried to Tase me with it when we were on the ground.\" Slager said Scott was still coming at him with the Taser, so he made the decision to use lethal force. \"I fired my firearm until the threat was stopped,\" Slager said. He also told the prosecutor that he used \"self-defense\" that day. \"In this situation, with everything leading up to the shooting, I was tired,\" Slager said. \"I ran the 200 yards, I was on a fight on the ground, Mr. Scott was coming after me with the Taser twice. My mind was like spaghetti.\" The witness video of the shooting was filmed by Feidin Santana, who testified for the prosecution earlier this month. On the stand he recounted the moments before, during and after he witnessed the deadly shooting. Santana told the court he saw an officer chasing a black man, heard an \"electric sound\" -- later determined to be a Taser -- and saw the officer punch the man once the man was on the ground. He said the black man, who he later learned was Scott, tried to get away from the Taser. The officer, who Santana identified in court as Slager, was on top of Scott, Santana testified. Santana said Slager was holding onto Scott, but Scott was able to get away. \"After he got away ... [the officer] shoot the man running from him,\" Santana said. \"And he shoot until he gets on the ground.\" Slager faces 30 years to life if he is convicted, according to The Associated Press. A federal trial is scheduled for next year. 0 Shares ",

Jay, 31, is a lifetime .287 hitter in seven seasons with the rival Cardinals and Padres. The left-handed hitter is an exceptional defender and is expected to complement the development of Almora, 22. The right-handed hitting Almora batted .277 in 112 at-bats as a rookie and displayed flawless defense and astute baserunning skills during the Cubs' run to their first World Series title since 1908. It's believed Jay agreed to an $8 million contract, slightly more than half of what Fowler is expected to command on an annual basis in a multi-year deal. Though primarily a center fielder, Jay's versatility will give manager Joe Maddon plenty of options as well as bolster the Cubs' offense from the left side alongside Kyle Schwarber. \"Pumped for @JonjayU to join the squad !!!!\" Almora, a fellow Miami native, wrote on his Twitter account after the agreement became public. Jay was limited to 90 games with the Padres in 2016 because of a broken right forearm suffered when Nationals left-hander Gio Gonzalez hit him with a pitch June 19. Jay returned Sept. 6 and finished the season with a .291 batting average. Jay has a lifetime .352 on-base percentage and has spent most of his career batting in the top two spots in the order. Jay has hit higher than .290 in five of his seven seasons, including a career-best .305 mark in 2012 with the Cardinals. Jay batted .297 with 24 doubles and 10 home runs in a career-high 159 games in helping lead the Cardinals to their last World Series title in 2011. Although Fowler played exceptionally well in center, Jay's defense represents an upgrade. Jay has a lifetime .996 fielding percentage in center \u2014 the highest mark for any active player (with a minimum of 500 games) at that position. Jay's .995 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions ties Jacoby Ellsbury for the best percentage mark among active outfielders. His lifetime .344 on-base percentage at the leadoff spot is well below Fowler's .367 lifetime mark there. ",

Here is what we know about the 53-year-old. USA TODAY NETWORK Businessman Steven Mnuchin shown arriving at  Trump Tower in New York City for meetings with  President-elect Donald Trump on November 17, 2016. (Photo: EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ, AFP/Getty Images) From buying a failed bank during the U.S. financial crisis to producing major movies and serving as national finance chairman for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Steven Mnuchin has a record\u00a0of winning risky bets. Now the former Wall Street\u00a0banker\u00a0is poised for what could be his biggest challenge yet: Trump's nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary. Trump is expected to officially name Mnuchin, 53, as his choice for the nation's top financial\u00a0policy job as soon as Wednesday,\u00a0a source close to Trump's transition team told USA TODAY Tuesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to speak publicly about selections. To associates and friends who were surprised when accepted Trump's invitation to serve as lead campaign fundraiser after the New York presidential primary, Mnuchin offered a potentially prescient explanation. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to be like, \u2018Well, why did he do this?\u2019 if I end up in the administration,\" he told Bloomberg Businessweek in August. The news that Mnuchin is Trump's pick came as reports swirled that Trump would nominate billionaire Wilbur Ross, also considered a risk taker, to serve as Commerce secretary.\u00a0Ross, 79, made a career out of buying ailing companies in sometimes troubled sectors on the cheap, restructuring them and then selling them for billions of dollars.\u00a0Ross, too, could be announced as early as Wednesday, the source close to the transition team said. Trump has praised Mnuchin, who with the Republican National Committee helped raise tens of millions of dollars for the billionaire businessman's winning campaign over Hillary Clinton. However, they weren't always the best of friends. In a 2008 lawsuit, Trump targeted one of Mnuchin's companies in a lawsuit that alleged Deutsche Bank and other investors improperly balked at extending\u00a0multi-million dollar construction loans on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. The case was ultimately settled. Mnuchin, a twice-married father of three, is a Yale College graduate who followed his father to renowned U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs. He started at the financial powerhouse in the 1980s and spent 17 years there, amassing a fortune\u00a0and becoming an executive vice president\u00a0of the New York City-based company\u00a0before his\u00a02003 departure. His next stop was ESL International, the hedge fund founded by Edward Lampert, one of Mnuchin's Yale roommates and another Goldman alumnus who is now the CEO and chairman of Sears Holdings. Lampert tapped him for a board seat on Sears Holdings-owned retail chain\u00a0Kmart in 2003. However, Mnuchin left soon afterward to become chief executive of SFM Capital Managment, a fund backed by\u00a0international financier and investor George Soros. Mnuchin's SFM tenure\u00a0was similarly\u00a0brief. In 2004, he co-founded private hedge fund Dune Capital Management with Daniel Neidich, another former Goldman executive. The fund invested in equities and\u00a0real estate \u2014 including some Trump projects. Additionally, the fund invested in the U.S. movie industry. Starting in 2006, Mnuchin reached\u00a0a three-year deal in which an entity called Dune Entertainment agreed to\u00a0invest $500 million in a string of 20th Century Fox movies, according to multiple media reports. The transaction launched a deeper Mnuchin dive\u00a0into\u00a0entertainment investments and co-producing that ultimately included the Hollywood blockbuster success Avatar, The X-Men franchise, American Sniper, Gravity and The Lego Movie. Those films scored box office wins. Yet\u00a0other movies that involved Mnuchin, such as Our Brand is Crisis, a fictional account of American campaign strategists involved in a Bolivian election, flopped. In 2013, Mnuchin,\u00a0filmmaker Brett Ratner and Australian businessman James Packer joined in an\u00a0entity called RatPac-Dune Entertainment that agreed to $300 million in co-financing for as many as 75 films by Warner Bros. Pictures, according to the movie company and\u00a0media\u00a0reports. The following year, Mnuchin partnered with Ryan Kavanaugh and an investment group to buy debt and an equity stake in Kavanaugh's Relativity Media. He also took a seat on the Relativity board of directors, becoming the company's non-executive chairman. \"Steven has been a trusted advisor for years, and I personally recruited him to join our board,\" Kavanaugh said in a statement at the time. \"he brings an unrivaled perspective on the every-increasing value of content in Hollywood and Wall Street.\" The move also ended up snarling\u00a0Mnuchin in controversy. Five years before taking the Relativity post, he\u00a0led an investor group that\u00a0bought California-based IndyMac Bank, which had collapsed in a more than $7 billion implosion during the financial crisis. The investor group, which paid the FDIC roughly $1.55 billion to take the bank off the FDIC's hands, was backed by Soros, hedge fund manager\u00a0John Paulson, computer manufacturer\u00a0Michael Dell, private equity investor\u00a0Christopher Flowers\u00a0and others. IndyMac became OneWest Bank, with Mnuchin as its chairman. The deal drew criticism\u00a0because it was finalized\u00a0before FDIC Chair Sheila Bair managed to institute a change that would require\u00a0private equity buyers like the Mnuchin-led group to maintain a\u00a010% leverage ratio at newly-resurrected banks and hold the investments for at least three years. Bair, now the president of Washington College, declined to comment for this story.\u00a0However, recounting the IndyMac collapse and sale in Bull By the Horns, her 2012 book about her FDIC tenure, Bair characterized the regulator as boxed in. \"The reality is that those who are brave enough to buy distressed companies in a down market \u2014 whether banks or any other type of company \u2014 \u00a0expect to make a return commensurate with the risks they are taking,\" wrote Bair.\u00a0\"The FDIC, as seller, had no good options.\" File photo taken in 2009 shows a New York City building bearing the logo of the CIT Group. \u00a0(Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) New criticism \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 came after Relativity Media sought federal bankruptcy court protection in July 2015. By then, Mnuchin had left the movie company's board. And he was weeks away from selling OneWest Bank to CIT Group at\u00a0a price that produced\u00a0a hefty profit for him\u00a0and fellow investors\u00a0\u2014\u00a0$3.4 billion in cash and stock, more than doubling\u00a0their\u00a0investment. One of Relativity Media's creditors, RKA Film Financing, took a cynical view of Mnuchin's dual involvement with the movie company and the bank \u2014 which was also owed millions\u00a0by Relativity. In a 2016 New York Supreme Court lawsuit, RKA said Relativity's collapse \"amounted to a classic Ponzi scheme,\" and labeled its CEO Kavanaugh \"a con man.\" Mnuchin had held \"a unique position,\" the lawsuit alleged, \"affording him knowledge of both Relativity's precarious financial position and the ability to ensure certain creditors \u2014 namely OneWest Bank \u2014 were able to siphon away funds that had been commingled\" with RKA's investments. The lawsuit also charged that OneWest swept approximately $50 million from Relativity's bank accounts before the collapse. A bankruptcy court declaration by Timothy Coleman, a Blackstone expert who worked with Relativity on restructuring plans, said the OneWest transfers \"further strained\" the movie company's \"already problematic liquidity situation,\" and also forced postponement of some film projects. The movies included Masterminds, which features\u00a0Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig and other actors in a comedy based on an actual bank robbery. The film ultimately opened on Sept. 30 this year. A Mnuchin court filing called his inclusion in RKA's lawsuit\u00a0\"not just baseless, but sanctionable.\" He moved to throw out the case, as did Kavanaugh.\u00a0Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos dismissed the lawsuit in an October decision that left the door open for the complaint to be updated\u00a0and refiled. Benjamin Naftalis, an attorney for RKA, said the company \"plans to file an amended complaint that will continue to include Mr. Mnuchin.\" Though Mnuchin is best known publicly for his business dealings, he and his family also became known as some of the thousands of\u00a0investors caught up in the aftermath of Bernard Madoff's notorious\u00a0Ponzi scheme. More than $3 million that Mnuchin and his brother\u00a0inherited from their deceased mother's estate represented fictitious profits from Madoff's estimated $20 billion\u00a0scam, court-appointed trustee Irving Picard alleged in a 2010 bankruptcy court filing. But a court decision said the family's withdrawals, and similar Madoff payouts to other\u00a0investors,\u00a0had occurred more than two years before the scheme collapsed. As a result, the money\u00a0could not legally be recovered to help repay the disgraced financier's less fortunate customers, the court ruled. Although Mnuchin so far has emerged relatively unscathed from several court challenges, a new federal complaint filed after Trump's win potentially could become a factor in Senate confirmation hearings for the Treasury post. OneWest was criticized by\u00a0some housing advocates over a wave of foreclosures filed amid\u00a0the financial crisis. Additionally, the bank, its successor, CIT Bank, and CIT Group were targeted this month with a new federal complaint that alleged they engaged in redlining and other discrimination against minorities. Two groups that advocate for fair housing and equal access to credit filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Bank tied to Trump adviser accused of discrimination \"Our analysis of OneWest suggests the bank has no significant branch presence in communities of color, and not surprisingly, its home loans to borrowers and communities of color are low in absolute terms, low compared to its peer banks, and low when compared to what one would expect given the size of the\u00a0Asian-American, African-American and Latino populations in California,\" said Kevin Stein, a deputy director for\u00a0the California Reinvestment Coalition, one of the groups that filed the complaint. In response, CIT Group said it is\u00a0\"committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.\" Mnuchin did not respond to USA TODAY interview requests submitted to a company spokesman. However, Trump's presidential transition staff provided a statement in which former OneWest chief executive Joseph Otting said the bank \"remained committed to fair lending and meeting the credit needs of all borrowers in its communities, including those in distress.\" Stein\u00a0said the allegations submitted to HUD should be examined during Mnuchin's expected confirmation hearings. \"It was not our intent in filing the case. But it should be considered,\" said Stein. \"The American people would want a Treasury secretary who understands the lives of ordinary people and how they interact with major financial institutions.\" Ray Locker and Paul Davidson contributed.\u00a0 Follow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc ",

Kellogg is one of several companies announcing it will pull ads from the far-right news and commentary site. USA TODAY NETWORK Battle Creek-based Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles because the products might be contaminated with bacteria. (Photo: Phil Coale, AP) Kellogg, the food manufacturer that owns Pringles and Pop-Tarts, confirmed Tuesday that it will discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com, the far-right news and commentary site that was formerly run by a top aide of President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump, Steve Bannon. The site has come under fire on social media in recent days as consumers, angered at what they say is its racist, sexist and anti-Semitic content, publicly name its advertisers. Bannon worked as executive chairman of Breitbart News\u00a0until he left to run Trump's campaign. He was scheduled to return to Breitbart, but earlier this month, Trump named Bannon his chief strategist, stirring more of the site's critics to call out its content and appeal to its advertisers. \"We regularly work with our media buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren't aligned with our values as a company,\"\u00a0Kellogg spokesperson\u00a0Kris Charles in a statement. \"This involves reviewing websites where ads could potentially be placed using filtering technology to assess site content. As you can imagine, there is a very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed. In this case, we learned from consumers that ads were placed on Breitbart.com and decided to discontinue advertising there.\" Steve Bannon: 'I\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist' Breitbart News\u00a0couldn't be reached for comment. But in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon has claimed that he was not a White nationalist, as many liberals assert. \"I\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist,\u201d Bannon said. Other companies have already said on Twitter that they will stop advertising on Breitbart. They include pharmaceutical manufacturer Novo Nordisk, eyeglasses maker Warby Parker and the San Diego Zoo. AppNexus, one of the largest online advertising networks, also blocked Breitbart News.

(Photo: Jasmine Stole/PDN) HAGATNA, Guam \u2014 The Korean Air passenger who got into a fight with a flight attendant on board a plane bound for\u00a0Guam from Seoul, South Korea\u00a0was sentenced to 28 months and nine days in federal prison on Tuesday. Chief Judge Frances Tydingco-Gatewood\u2019s punishment for passenger Kwon Woo Sung is a total of 36 months, including the past seven months\u00a0he served under house arrest and in federal detainment. This leaves 28 months and nine days left on his sentence. Kwon, a dentist in South Korea, pleaded guilty to interfering with flight crew members and attendants. He was headed to Guam in April for vacation and ordered five beers in a 35-minute span before the crew decided not to serve him any more alcohol, according to court documents. After he smoked a cigarette in the plane's restroom and admitted to it, he asked for another beer but was denied. Kwon then became angry and fought with the flight attendant, documents state. About five passengers had to help restrain him for about an hour until they landed in Guam. Judge requests video of in-air melee on Korean Airlines flight Kwon's attorney, Peter C. Perez, asked if Kwon could serve\u00a0all or part of the sentence in home detention instead of prison. Tydingco-Gatewood gave the attorneys another day to look into home confinement as an alternative and the hearing will continue Wednesday. Before the Tuesday's hearing ended, the judge said\u00a0that this was the longest sentencing of her life. Kwon was initially\u00a0sentenced to three years on Nov. 8, but his attorneys, Perez and Edward Han, asked the judge for more time to discuss whether Kwon would accept the sentence or withdraw his guilty plea and go to trial. The defense presented more testimony from Kwon, his 70-year-old mother Yang Young Hwa and Kwon\u2019s psychiatrist on Monday. The defense also filed another 212 pages\u00a0for the judge to consider in sentencing Kwon. After Monday\u2019s hearing, Tydingco-Gatewood\u00a0returned Tuesday with the same punishment she pronounced three weeks ago. Kwon\u2019s crime is serious enough to sentence him that way, she\u00a0said. Kwon must also pay a $10,500 fine, $1,000 of which is for smoking in the plane\u2019s restroom. The money will be taken out of Kwon\u2019s $100,000 cash bail. Kwon still has the option of withdrawing his guilty plea if he does not accept the court\u2019s sentence. Kwon and his mother fell to their knees at one point at Monday\u2019s hearing, both in tears and pleading for leniency, bowing to Tydingco-Gatewood. Hwa\u2019s tearful statements in court were heart-wrenching, the chief judge said, adding that this was one of the more emotional sentencing hearings\u00a0in her 22 years as a judge. During a lunch break after\u00a0Tydingco-Gatewood sentenced him,\u00a0Kwon and his mother embraced and cried loudly in the courtroom. Kwon\u2019s psychiatrist testified to\u00a0treating Kwon for the past three years for mental and emotional issues, including anxiety, depression, anger issues and others. Kwon expressed his remorse in testimony before the judge and in his apology letters to passengers, flight crew and Korean Air CEO. The letters were part of the 212 documents filed last week. An attorney in South Korea also penned a letter that said Kwon may be charged with a crime when he returns home. But there is no certainty that Kwon will be prosecuted in South Korea, Tydingco-Gatewood said. The chief judge said she learned a lot about the Korean culture in this case. She praised the local Korean community for supporting Kwon. As an example, two people who never even met him stepped in to be his third-party custodians. Many Koreans in Guam and in his hometown wrote letters asking the judge for leniency. You don\u2019t see much of that, Tydingco-Gatewood said of the Korean community's response to Kwon's case. 100 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 40 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ghsvJo ",

    "text": "Wisconsin Officials Receive Recount Payment From Jill Stein By Meghan Keneally Nov 29, 2016, 6:40 PM ET 0 Shares LAUREN JUSTICE/The New York Times/Redux WATCH Move for Recounts in Several States Gains Momentum 0 Shares Email The Wisconsin Elections Commission announced that it has received the required payment from Jill Stein to start the presidential recount in the state later this week. The former Green Party presidential candidate previously submitted a petition for a recount in Wisconsin, and she paid the required $3,499,689 set by the commission via bank wire transfer, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The Wisconsin Elections Commission announced that amount as the required fee to start the recount process, but in its announcement today it noted that \"there was an error in adding up figures\" from the state's 72 county clerks, so the actual total is $3,898,340. However, it is not requiring Stein to pay that new total \"at this time.\" Instead, the elections commission said it will wait until the actual costs are reported and either bill Stein for any excess charges or return any unused funds. The second petitioner for the recount, fellow third party candidate Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, withdrew his recount petition today. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Donald Trump won the state with 1,404,000 votes, and Hillary Clinton came in second with 1,381,823 votes -- a difference of 22,177 votes. Stein had 31,006 votes, and De La Fuente had 1,514 votes. Wisconsin Officials Say Recount Isn't Expected to Change Election Results \"I fully expect, given the history of how elections are conducted in Wisconsin ... that the outcome is not going to be different\" from the current results, Mark Thomsen, the chairman of the state's elections commission, said at a news conference Monday. Stein has said that she was calling for the recount \"because of the vulnerability of \u2026 voting systems and various indicators of concern,\" though she admitted that she does not expect the outcome of the election to change. Clinton's team said it will support the recount effort. Trump tweeted that the recount was a \"scam\" on behalf of the Green Party and later made the unsubstantiated claim that he \"won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" His claims have not been independently verified, and election officials from numerous states -- including Wisconsin -- have criticized Trump's claim of having won the popular vote nationwide and said that there was no widespread illegal voting in their states. Stein set up a fundraising page on her website last week, saying that the money raised would be put toward recount efforts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. According to the site, she had raised nearly $6.5 million for the efforts as of Tuesday evening. 0 Shares ",

Email President-elect Donald Trump will soon inherit America\u2019s wars against ISIS.\u00a0 The U.S. is training and assisting Iraqi and Kurdish forces in the liberation of Mosul, the last major city in Iraq controlled by ISIS.\u00a0 The operation is six weeks old. After more than two years of ISIS occupation, Iraq's second-largest city is being taken back by the Iraqi Army. Lara Logan reports from Mosul. Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend served in northern Iraq during the U.S. occupation 10 years ago, and now he\u2019s back, as the commander of the U.S. coalition against ISIS. \u00a0 A new generation of Americans in Iraq, this time aiding Iraqi troops who are doing most of the fighting on the front-line. \u201cThis fight would challenge any army,\u201d said Townsend. \u201cThis fight would challenge the United States Army.\u201d But then Townsend broke off our interview, because his men had ISIS in their sights. \u00a0 There are now around 6,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, supporting over 40,000 Iraqi fighters in the battle for Mosul, an offensive criticized by Mr. Trump for its lack of secrecy.\u00a0 \u201cWhatever happened to the element of surprise?\u201d he asked during a debate.\u00a0 Is a battle that size something Townsend can keep a secret? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so\u2026.it\u2019s hard to move 40,000 troops and all their tanks and trucks and artillery into position and it not be noticed by somebody,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend speaks with CBS News\u2019 Holly Williams.\u00a0 CBS News Mr. Trump\u2019s stated solution to ISIS is: \u201cBomb the hell out of them.\u201d But at this command center -- where they launch airstrikes on ISIS -- every strike must be approved by senior officers, it can take minutes -- or several hours -- and sometimes they\u2019re refused permission. Captain Matt Lyles explained to CBS News why it is done this way.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to get it right for us. We need to get it right for them,\u201d he said.\u00a0 They want to avoid killing civilians at all costs. He said they don\u2019t want to destroy a house if they don\u2019t need to. American air power is playing a decisive role in beating back ISIS -- but the simple truth is that there are no easy solutions to ISIS, and the battle for Mosul will be long and deadly. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The sun in Barrow set earlier this month on Nov. 18, and it will not rise again until next year: Jan. 22, 2017, to be exact, according to meteorologists.\u00a0 The unusual expanse of time between sunset and sunrise in Barrow is due to the way the Earth tilts in relation to its orbit around the sun. As the Earth\u2019s northern hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the sun disappears for a stretch in certain northern areas, CBS Seattle affiliate KIRO explained. Barrow is used to this cycle repeating itself every winter.\u00a0 In a literal sense, the sun has set in Barrow for the last time. By the time the sun rises in January, the city will officially go by another name: Utqia\u0121vik, which is an I\u00f1upiat Eskimo word that means a place for gathering wild roots, the Alaska Dispatch News reported. About 61 percent of the city\u2019s population is I\u00f1upiat Eskimo. Located on the Chukchi Sea coast at the northern tip of Alaska, Barrow is home to slightly more than 4,400 residents, many of whom still hunt and fish for much of their food. It\u2019s a city where the sale of alcohol is banned, and one bank serves the entire community.\u00a0 Life in Barrow won\u2019t be completely dark until January: according to KIRO, the city will get a few hours of twilight each day from the sun just below the horizon, allowing enough light to distinguish objects outside.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Students gather at Revolution Square to pay homage to late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, in Havana, on November 29, 2016. (RONALDO SCHEMIDT/AFP/Getty Images) Kate Linthicum Contact Reporter Fidel Castro was one of the world\u2019s most polarizing figures, lionized by some\u00a0as a principled defender of the poor and loathed by others as a repressive dictator. His divisive legacy can be seen in the guest list of foreign dignitaries attending memorial services\u00a0for Castro\u00a0in Havana this week.\u00a0 Many world leaders are notably absent.\u00a0 British Prime Minister Theresa May , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande declined to attend Cuba\u2019s elaborate homage to Castro, who ruled the Caribbean island based on Marxist principles for nearly half a century \u2014\u00a0in part by jailing dissenters.\u00a0 Also missing was President Obama, who earlier this year met with Castro\u2019s younger\u00a0brother, Raul, in a historic trip to Cuba aimed at warming relations between the two countries. Obama\u00a0sent two U.S. officials to the memorial instead. The\u00a0list of foreign leaders who decided to attend the memorial in\u00a0Havana\u2019s Revolution Square speaks to the\u00a0enduring influence of Castro\u2019s revolution in many\u00a0post-colonial countries in Latin America and Africa, especially those whose leaders lean toward the ideological left. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Bolivian President Evo Morales paid their respects at the square Tuesday along with hundreds of thousands of Cuban mourners. \u201cCuba is going through a moment of profound shock,\u201d Morales told reporters the evening before. Castro, he said, was \u201cmy brother.\u201d ",

Bruno Kahl, who leads the Federal Intelligence Service, told Tuesday's edition of the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that his agency knows of \"cyberattacks that have no other point than causing political insecurity.\" He said that \"Europe is in the focus of this attempted disruption, and Germany in particular.\" U.S. authorities have concluded Russia was responsible for hacking Democratic National Committee emails, which Russia denies. Kahl said he has \"indications it comes from those quarters.\" He said it's technically difficult to assign blame to any \"state actor\" \u2014 but that \"some things speak for it being at least tolerated or wished for on the part of the state.\" \"The perpetrators have an interest in delegitimizing the democratic process as such \u2014 whomever that later helps,\" Kahl was quoted as saying. \"I have the impression that the outcome of the American election isn't causing mourning in Russia so far.\" Traces left on the internet suggest that those responsible wanted to demonstrate what they can do, \"and not just in the U.S. elections,\" he said. Germany's election is expected next September, and votes in the Netherlands and France are scheduled earlier in the year. Kahl, whose agency is best known by its German acronym BND, said that Germany isn't alone on the list of target countries. And he added: \"it could be that the increasing transparency on these matters will lead to a rethink.\" \"It is right to address this kind of thing openly,\" he said. \"A kind of pressure is being exerted on public discourse and democracy that is not acceptable.\" His comments follow a large internet outage that affected almost a million customers of German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom starting Sunday. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security said the outage was part of a world-wide attack on internet routers that exploited unsecured maintenance ports. The government's secure communications network was also targeted but protective measures prevented it from being affected, the agency said. Asked whether the outage resulted from a Russian attack, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said he didn't want to speculate on the origin. \"At the moment, who exactly the initiator was is not certain,\" he added. 0 Shares ",
