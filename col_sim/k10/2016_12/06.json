Pat McCrory Concedes NC Governor's Race to Democratic Challenger Roy Cooper By VERONICA STRACQUALURSI Dec 5, 2016, 12:42 PM ET 0 Shares Email Weeks after Election Day and after requesting a recount, incumbent Republican Gov. Pat McCrory conceded the North Carolina gubernatorial race to his Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper. \"Despite continued questions that should be answered regarding the voting process, I personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken and we now should everything we can to support the 75th governor of North Carolina - Roy Cooper,\" Gov. McCrory said in a video released Monday by his office. Today, Governor McCrory released the following video message on the 2016 election results. pic.twitter.com/e65DTFaZ6l \u2014 NC Governor's Office (@GovOfficeNC) December 5, 2016 Cooper won 49 percent of the vote, with McCrory close behind at 48.9 percent of the vote. The North Carolina gubernatorial race was the last remaining race without a winner called. McCrory came under fire earlier this year for signing the controversial House Bill 2, otherwise referred to as the \"bathroom bill.\" The bill directs all public schools, public college campuses, and government agencies to require that multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, such as locker rooms, be designated for use only by people based on their \"biological sex\" stated on their birth certificates. Transgender people can use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get their biological sex on their birth certificate changed.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story By going after China\u2019s policies on trade and security, Mr. Trump appeared to be confirming his intent to take a tougher line with the Chinese leadership across a broader range of issues \u2014 and further dampened hopes in Beijing that he might step back from the campaign rhetoric he has used, including threats of punishing trade tariffs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That could put President Xi Jinping in a difficult position, forced to choose between playing down Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks and risking a backlash at home, or raising the stakes by pushing back more forcefully and setting China on a potential collision course with the United States, its most important trading partner. The Chinese government\u2019s initial reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s call has already faced a torrent of criticism on social media from Chinese who complained it was not tough enough. The statement from Foreign Minister Wang Yi, which was relatively low-key given the unprecedented nature of the call, refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump, instead accusing Taiwan of playing a \u201clittle trick\u201d on the American president-elect. Photo A satellite image of Subi Reef, an artificial island that Beijing is developing in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, in September. Credit United States Geological Survey, via Getty Images That offered Mr. Trump a face-saving way out of the imbroglio, and a chance to de-escalate. But the messages he posted on Twitter late Sunday stepped up the pressure on China\u2019s leaders instead. Some Chinese analysts see Mr. Trump as striking out early on a starkly different path from President Obama\u2019s, determined to strenuously compete with China on economic issues. In the last four years, Mr. Obama has stressed cooperation with Beijing, particularly on the Paris international climate accord , which the Chinese government saw as being in its own interest because of its public\u2019s anger over pollution. Mr. Obama veered away from bargaining on issues like China\u2019s protected marketplace and its repressive human rights situation, even though some officials in his administration have privately argued he could have obtained concessions in those areas. By contrast, Mr. Trump is looking like a negotiator from the start, some Chinese analysts said. \u201cBy showing strength at the beginning, he may hope to gain advantages in bargaining later with the Chinese on many key issues,\u201d Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe is a businessman, and he could be bringing his business bargaining tactics to interstate relations.\u201d Thus, he said, there was \u201cstrategic logic\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s actions in the past few days. Another Chinese state newspaper, the hawkish Global Times, called Mr. Trump a \u201cneophyte\u201d in diplomatic affairs, and some Chinese reports have suggested that the president-elect did not understand the import of his phone call with Ms. Tsai. But Mr. Trump\u2019s follow-up messages on Twitter seemed to show he had been well briefed on Taiwan and questions of trade and the South China Sea. The call with Ms. Tsai and the Twitter posts reflected the views of Trump advisers with Asia experience, such as John Bolton, whom Mr. Trump is said to be considering as his secretary of state. Mr. Bolton served during the administration of George W. Bush in the early 2000s as under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and in the mid-1990s he wrote research papers for the Taiwan government. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Bolton said Saturday of China that it was to time to \u201cshake the relationship up,\u201d noting what he called its \u201caggressive and belligerent claims\u201d in the South China Sea. \u201cNobody in Beijing gets to dictate who we talk to,\u201d Mr. Bolton said on Fox News. Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for chief of staff, who has been described in Taiwan\u2019s news media as a good friend of Taiwan , said in his own Fox News appearance Saturday that Mr. Trump \u201cknew exactly what was happening\u201d when he spoke with Ms. Tsai on Friday. Photo A man reading a newspaper with the headline \u201cChina wants U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to use caution in dealing with Taiwan issue\u201d at a brokerage house in Beijing on Monday. Credit Andy Wong/Associated Press Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China who is also said to be under consideration for secretary of state, called Mr. Trump\u2019s call \u201cshrewd\u201d on Saturday, saying it would provide a \u201cuseful leverage point\u201d with Beijing. Mr. Huntsman spent two stints in Taiwan, first as a Mormon missionary and later as an executive for a company his family owned. In Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter messages late Sunday about China, two of his three assertions were essentially correct, including his reference to the South China Sea. In the last several years, China has built artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea, and it has constructed military airstrips and naval berths on three of them. During the construction phase, the Obama administration insisted that the South China Sea was an international waterway, and it used freedom of navigation patrols by the United States Navy to make that point. Some American critics who believed Mr. Obama should have shown a stronger hand approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tweets and actions appear to be more than a symbolic act,\u201d said James E. Fanell, a former director of intelligence and information operations for the United States Pacific Fleet. \u201cThis will upset Beijing, but it is going to remind the rest of the Indo-Asia Pacific region that the new administration is not going to be fettered by the past.\u201d On trade, Mr. Trump was also broadly accurate. When China joined the World Trade Organization in late 2001, it was treated as a developing country, allowed to retain higher tariffs than industrialized countries to protect its industries. China reduced its high tariffs on imported cars, but only to 25 percent. By contrast, the United States imposes a 2.5 percent tax on imported cars. Many other goods entering China also face tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent, while the United States has eliminated tariffs on a broad range of imports and kept tariffs at 2.5 percent or less for most other categories. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that China had devalued its currency \u2014 one he made frequently during his campaign \u2014 is out of date. In recent years, China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to strengthen, to make it more appealing to global investors. Last year, the International Monetary Fund said the renminbi was no longer undervalued, after a decade of saying that it was. But a few months later, China devalued the renminbi, in a move that shocked the markets, and has since let it become weaker still. The difference is that these days, Beijing \u2014 worried about people and companies taking money out of the country \u2014 is trying to slow that fall. Many economists and investors believe the renminbi should weaken because China\u2019s growth is slowing. But China has been dipping into its currency reserves and making other moves to moderate the drop. Without those efforts, many economists believe, the currency would be even weaker than it is now.

    "text": "Man Accused of Threatening Muslim Officer Faces Hate Charge By The Associated Press NEW YORK \u0097 Dec 5, 2016, 7:05 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Man Accused of Harassing Muslim Cop Arrested 0 Shares Email A man who authorities said shouted \"go back to your country\" at a Muslim woman wearing a religious head covering may have picked the wrong target: a decorated New York City police officer. Officer Aml Elsokary, a New York City native who joined the force after the Sept. 11 attacks, said she was off duty in her Brooklyn neighborhood Saturday when she encountered a man yelling and pushing her 16-year-old son. When she intervened, she said, the man referenced the Islamic State group and threatened to slit her throat. It was the first time anything like that had happened to her, she said at a news conference with the city's mayor Monday. \"I became a police officer to show the positive side of a New Yorker, a Muslim woman, that can do the job,\" Elsokary said. \"I help everybody, no matter what your religion, what's your faith, what you do in New York. I'm born and raised here.\" The man accused of making the threat, Christopher Nelson, 36, was arraigned Monday on a felony charge of menacing as a hate crime. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The encounter was one of a number of alleged episodes of religious or racial bigotry reported in the city in recent days. On Monday, a transit worker who is Muslim was pushed down the stairs at Grand Central Terminal by a man who called her a terrorist, police said. The station agent, who was wearing a religious head covering, was attacked while on her way to work. She was treated at a hospital for ankle and knee injuries. Gov. Andrew Cuomo also noted in a statement that a subway train was vandalized with swastikas on Saturday, and Ku Klux Klan materials were distributed at Long Island Rail Road stations last week. The police department cited Elsokary for bravery in 2014 after she and a partner ran into a burning building to save a baby. Police Commissioner James O'Neill recalled visiting Elsokary at the hospital where she and her partner were treated for smoke inhalation. \"You and your partner did a tremendous job that day,\" O'Neill told her at Monday's news conference. Mayor Bill De Blasio said there are 900 Muslims serving as New York City police officers, on a force of about 36,000. \"In 2014, she ran into a burning building and helped to save a young girl and her grandmother. And, then, on Saturday, she had to experience a man allegedly yelling at her and her son, 'Go back to your country,'\" said de Blasio. \"Well this is Officer Elsokary's country. She is an American. She is a New Yorker. She's already at home.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show the last name of the officer is Elsokary, not Elsakary. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Bergdahl's former platoon member dismisses pardon plea Published               December 05, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s former platoon member\u00a0said Monday the one-time prisoner of war -- who asked for a presidential pardon after being accused of endangering comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan \u2013 \u201chas to be accountable for his actions.\u201d BERGDAHL REQUESTS PARDON FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA, US OFFICIALS Sgt. Matt Vierkant told \u201c FOX & Friends ,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but his that he was put in that position so he has\u00a0 nobody to blame but himself and it\u2019s unfortunate that he was a prisoner for five years, but it\u2019s his own fault.\u201d Vierkant went on to dispute the allegations that no troops were killed in the search for Sgt. Bergdahl. \u201cI think everyone in the military and everyone I know knows that people are seriously hurt and killed because of Bergdahl\u2019s actions and as the trial gets under way\u2026 it will all come to the attention of everyone.\u201d JUDGE HEARS TESTIMONY ABOUT INJURIES DURING SEARCH FOR BOWE BERGDAHL White House and Justice Dept. officials said Saturday that Bergdahl had submitted copies of the clemency request seeking leniency. If granted by President Obama, it would allow Bergdahl to avoid a military trial scheduled for April where he faces charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. If the pardon isn't granted, Bergdahl's defense team said it would expand its legal strategy to the new administration by filing a motion arguing that President-elect Donald Trump violated his due process rights with scathing public comments about the case. Bergdahl, of Hailey, Idaho, walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was held captive by the Taliban and the group\u2019s allies for five years. The Obama administration's decision in May 2014 to exchange him for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, led some Republicans to accuse the president of jeopardizing the nation's safety. Some lawmakers said they were outraged the administration didn't give Congress a 30-day notice about transferring the detainees, as required by law. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump was one of Bergdahl's most vocal critics, saying repeatedly the soldier was a traitor who would have been executed in the \"old days.\" During a July speech in Indiana, Trump lamented that Bergdahl could wind up with a light punishment. \"Remember the old days? A deserter, what happened?\" he said before pantomiming pulling a trigger and adding: \"Bang.\" Bergdahl, who faces trial at Fort Bragg, has said he walked off his post in Afghanistan because he wanted to cause an alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. But Bergdahl's lead defense lawyer, Eugene Fidell, said he planned to file a motion seeking dismissal of the charges against Bergdahl shortly after the January inauguration, arguing Trump violated Bergdahl's constitutional due-process rights. The defense has been noting Trump's comments about Bergdahl in what they've dubbed the \"Trump Defamation Log.\" A version included in the court record lists 40 such instances as of August. \"All of these things put together and repeated rally upon rally for basically a year have a cumulative effect that I think is totally at odds with the right to a fair trial,\" Fidell said in a phone interview. Sgt. Vierkant, Bergdahl\u2019s former platoon member, views the situation differently, thinking Bergdahl would receive a fair trial under the incoming Trump administration. \u201cHe was never in his chain of\u00a0command.\u00a0He has no say or ruling over the\u00a0trial.\u00a0I believe we should let the\u00a0military be professionals\u2026 in the end, his opinion\u00a0isn't going to affect it any\u00a0more than my opinion or anyone\u00a0else.\u201d\u00a0 Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid reported that Welch entered court at approximately 4:30 p.m. escorted by two U.S. Marshals. He was restrained at his hands and feet. According to Reid, court documents filed charged Welch with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license, unlawful discharge of a firearm, and carrying a rifle or shotgun outside the home or business. Police said he brought a rifle into the popular Comet Ping Pong pizzeria. The bizarre rumors about the pizza joint began with a leaked email referencing Clinton and pizza parties. It morphed into fake online news stories about a child sex trafficking ring operating out of the restaurant.\u00a0 On Sunday, it culminated in violence when police say Welch fired a rifle inside the restaurant as he attempted to \u201cself-investigate\u201d the conspiracy theory known in the Twitterverse as \u201cPizzagate.\u201d\u00a0 No one was hurt and Welch was arrested.\u00a0 According to the documents, Welch told officers that he had \u201cread online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there. He stated that he was armed to help rescue them. He surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.\u201d He was armed with an AR-15 style weapon and told officers he also had a .38 caliber handgun. The shooting alarmed those from neighboring businesses all the way to the White House about the real-life dangers of fake news on the internet. One of those people posting on the conspiracy theory is the son of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed national security adviser.\u00a0 Even Monday, Michael Flynn Jr., who has posted frequently on the Pizzagate theories, continued to push the conspiracy theory. He\u2019s an adviser to his father,\u00a0 Michael Flynn , whom Mr. Trump has selected to serve as national security adviser.\u00a0 Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, \u201cUntil #Pizzagate proven to be false, it\u2019ll remain a story.\u201d\u00a0 On Monday, Mr. Trump\u2019s team had no immediate response to questions about the conspiracy theory or the roll of Michael Flynn Jr. in the transition.\u00a0 On Monday, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, asked about the shooting, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate and that\u2019s concerning in a political context. It\u2019s deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.\u201d The fake news stories alleging that Clinton and her campaign chief ran a child sex ring out of the restaurant have been denounced by the owner of the popular pizza restaurant. \u201cWe should all condemn the efforts of certain people to spread malicious and utterly false accusations about Comet Ping Pong,\u201d owner James Alefantis said. \u201cLet me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them. What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences.\u201d\u00a0 ",

Michael Slager, left, walks to the Charleston County Courthouse during a break in jury deliberations on Monday. (Mic Smith / Associated Press) Jenny Jarvie The extraordinary courtroom back-and-forth in the murder trial of Michael Slager , a white former North Charleston, S.C., police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man, continued Monday with the jury indicating that the majority of jurors are still undecided. On Friday, the jury foreman had suggested that the jury of 11 whites and one African American were \u201chopelessly deadlocked,\u201d with one juror refusing to convict. After a total of more than 17 hours of deliberation, the jury reported Monday morning that the majority of jurors had still not reached a verdict on whether to convict or acquit Michael Slager, who fatally shot Walter Scott in the back as he fled a traffic stop. The jury\u2019s long, protracted struggle to gain consensus over the April 2015 shooting underscores the challenge prosecutors face in convicting police officers who kill civilians.\u00a0 Guilty verdicts are rare, but many believed Walter Scott\u2019s case was an open-and-shut instance of a police officer killing a black man without cause: After the incident, a bystander released a video of Slager firing at Scott in the back as he ran away, at least 17 feet away. That video prompted Slager\u2019s then-defense attorney to resign.

Pastor\u00a0Joshua Beckley of the Ecclesia Christian Fellowship Church\u00a0spoke at a candlelight vigil the day after a terrorist attack killed\u00a014 people and 22 were seriously injured in 2015. A year later, he reflects on the city and how it has changed. At trial, the defense argued that the officer acted in self-defense. Prosecutors had charged Slager, 35, with murder, which carries a prison penalty of 30 years to life, but last week Judge Clifton Newman allowed jurors to consider the lesser charge of manslaughter, which involves two to 30 years in prison. On Monday morning, the jury appeared stuck, sending a note to Judge Newman with a flurry of questions: Why was voluntary manslaughter offered in addition to murder? What is meant by \u201csufficient legal provocation,\u201d \u201cimminent danger\u201d and \u201caforethought?\u201d Does self-defense apply equally to a police officer and a regular civilian? Defense attorney Andrew Savage called for a mistrial, arguing that one juror had already indicated he would not convict. He noted that the jury's most recent note was not written by the jury foreman \u2013 although it was signed by him\u2014and raised the possibility that the foreman might be preventing all members of the jury from having their say. Yet Judge Newman ruled against a mistrial, stating that the court was obligated to answer questions posed by the jury during deliberations \u2013 unless the answers might be inappropriate. \u201cImportantly, the note \u2026 doesn\u2019t say the jury is deadlocked,\u201d the judge said before asking attorneys to craft responses to jurors' questions. \u201cIt says they are undecided and that's what deliberations are all about \u2013 getting an undecided jury to decide.\u201d One of a string of deadly police shootings of African Americans that inspired mass street protests and national debate on racism and policing, the Scott shooting was seen as a significant test case in whether seemingly compelling video evidence could lead to a guilty verdict. During the monthlong South Carolina trial, prosecutors argued that Slager fired eight shots at Scott, 50, out of malice, ill will and total disregard for human life. They added that video evidence showed Slager staging evidence after the killing, dropping his Taser next to Scott\u2019s body so he could claim Scott had taken the stun gun. Slager\u2019s legal team countered that Slager shot Scott in self-defense. Last week, Slager testified he pulled Scott over for a broken tail light, and returned to his police cruiser to write up a warning ticket. Suddenly, Scott fled from his vehicle, Slager pursued, and the two men became involved in a physical fight. Slager said he was left in \u201ctotal fear\u201d after Scott grabbed his Taser and pointed it at him. Not long after the jury began deliberating, there were signs it was struggling over the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. On Thursday, jurors asked the judge to explain the difference between fear and passion. While Slager\u2019s defense hinged on his fear for his life when he fired at Scott, the voluntary manslaughter charge involves killing in the heat of passion. On Friday, Judge Newman read notes that appeared to indicate a lone juror refused to convict. \u201cWe all struggle with the death of a man and with all that has been put before us,\u201d one juror wrote in a long note that the judge read to the courtroom. \u201cI still cannot, without a reasonable doubt, convict the defendant.\u201d A separate note from the jury foreman indicated that one juror had \u201cissues\u201d and \"needs to leave.\"\u00a0 Judge Newman urged jurors to return to their deliberations: \u201cThe majority should consider the minority's position, and the minority should consider the majority's position,\u201d he told them. By the end of the day, the foreman reported they were \u201chopelessly\u201d deadlocked. A few moments later, however, jurors suggested that further explanation of the law might lead to a unanimous verdict and agreed to continue deliberating Monday. It is not the first time in recent weeks a jury has grappled with whether to convict a police officer for the death of an unarmed black man. On Nov. 12, a judge in Ohio declared a mistrial after a jury failed to reach agreement on the case of a white former University of Cincinnati police officer, Ray Tensing, charged with murder in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorist, Sam DuBose. Whatever the result of the state murder trial, Slager\u2019s legal battles are not over. He faces separate charges in federal district court of violating Scott's civil rights, using a weapon during the commission of a civil rights offense, and obstruction of justice. If convicted of a civil rights violation, he could face life in prison.\u00a0 Jarvie is a special correspondent. ",

Jurors last month convicted Justin Ross Harris of malice murder and other charges in the June 18, 2014, death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper, who was left in a Hyundai Tucson for seven hours in sweltering heat. Jurors believed Harris left the little boy to die on purpose. Harris, 35, was also convicted of eight counts of malice murder, felony murder, cruelty to children in the first and second degree, sexual exploitation of and dissemination of harmful material to minors. Justin Ross Harris and his son Cooper. Facebook via WXIA The prosecutor, Chuck Boring, said at the hearing that Harris was \"driven by his own selfishness\" and that Cooper died in the most \"tortuous, horrific, unimaginable way possible\" before recommending Harris serve the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, plus 32 years to serve consecutively. Neither Harris, who appeared Monday in an orange jumpsuit and shackles, nor his attorneys chose to present any mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing. Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark said the court found that Harris \"intentionally and unnecessarily\" inflicted \"wanton, severe physical and mental pain and agony\" upon his son. \"What factually was a horrendous horrific experience for this 22-month old child who had been placed in the trust of his father and in violation and dereliction of duty to that child, if not love of that child, callously walked away and left that child in a hot car in June in Georgia in the summer to swelter and die,\" she said. Clark then accepted the prosecution's recommendation for the maximum sentence. On the morning of Cooper's death, Harris was supposed to drop off his son at a daycare before heading to work at a Home Depot in the suburbs outside Atlanta. Related: Georgia Dad Justin Ross Harris Convicted of Murder in Toddler Son's Hot Car Death The two went to a Chick-fil-A for breakfast that morning, according to prosecutors, and then instead of taking his son to day care, Harris parked his car at the lot by the Home Depot and left Cooper before heading in to work. The child's cause of death was listed as hyperthermia. Harris' case drew national attention after it was revealed that the then-married Harris had been sending sexually explicit text messages to multiple women and underage girls. Harris' wife of ten years, Leanna Taylor, filed for divorce as the case progressed. There was no evidence connecting her to Cooper's death, nor has she ever charged in connection with it, her attorney said in a statement after Harris was convicted. Prosecutors argued that Harris left Cooper to die in an attempt to rid himself of parental responsibility as he continued to pursue sexual relationships with prostitutes and the women he met online. Some of the explicit messages were sent the day Cooper died, they said. Investigators had also said in pre-trial testimony that five days prior to Cooper's death Harris had watched a viral video online in which a veterinarian demonstrates to pet owners the effects of being left in a hot car. Related: Murder Trial to Begin for Georgia 'Hot Car' Dad Justin Harris The defense contended that while Harris was responsible for leaving Cooper in his car that day, his actions were not criminal and instead a tragic accident. They argued that Harris forgot his son was in the car because he had changed his routine that morning. Prosecutors countered the Chick-fil-A was less than a mile away from the Home Depot. Lead defense attorney Maddox Kilgore had told jurors that while Harris did engage in \"immoral sexual behavior,\" he had been attempting to turn his life around. Daniella Silva ",

To celebrate life. They were young, enthusiastic. Excited about the world around them, often struggling to pay their bills with service-industry jobs, struggling to fit in to a society they sometimes felt had no real place for them, drawn together in the struggle to thrive in the hard city of Oakland. At least 36 were killed, though, when fire ripped through the Ghost Ship venue in Oakland. Pictures from inside the building taken before the fire show carpets strewn across wooden floors, a tangle of rafters and wood hanging from the ceiling. A staircase made from wood pallets. Exit\u00a0doors that were almost impossible to find. What you don\u2019t see: the community created there, the sense of belonging and creating and experiencing all wrapped up into one. \u201cYou came to find like minds,\u201d said Vikram Babu, 35, an app designer who was supposed to be at the party that night. Babu got the address wrong and missed the party. Several of his friends were inside. One got out. Another, filmmaker Alex Ghassan remains missing. Ghassan has young twin daughters, and posted an Instagram photo shortly before the fire from inside the venue. Authorities on Monday continued the grim task of recovering and identifying the dead, in some cases asking friends and family to preserve hairbrushes so they can make DNA matches, because the fire burned the bodies so intensely. Mourners are holding a \u201clight\u201d vigil Monday night to remember the dead, and asking attendees to bring only flashlights, glow sticks or battery-powered candles, to avoid triggering any more bad memories caused by the flames. Authorities have not released the names of all the dead, and in one case are withholding the name of a victim because he's a minor. Among the dead, as identified by officials, friends or family: Experimental filmmaker and VJ\u00a0Jon Bernbaum, a near-constant presence in his friends' lives that's now missing. \"He was over at my house at least once or twice every week to hang out with his friends, make art, or, and Jesus did Bernbaum love this, get into long passionate arguments about life, god, art, and the Universe,\" said his friend, Tony Lund. \"So, I think what makes this so surreal is that most of us ... saw the guy all the time -- it was our lifestyle to make s---\u00a0and be social. Losing him is losing family because you become so psychologically conditioned to accept the permanence of people like Jon.\" Ara Jo, 29, a visual artist from Los Angeles who organized book and zine festivals. \u201cShe\u2019d just pour more and more of herself in until the event happened,\u201d said her boyfriend, Terry Ewing. She was also deeply caring of the larger community, engaged in activism about issues she felt were vital. She went to the Ghost Ship event in part to get the word out about fundraisers she was doing to support the Dakota access pipeline protests. Jo\u2019s brother and extended family arrived in Oakland on Sunday to await word. Her parents flew in from Korea, arriving Monday morning. Cash Askew, 22, of Oakland, a guitarist and member of the band Them Are Us Too. In a statement, Askew\u2019s record label said people who knew her were in \u201cawe of her talent, her gentle kindness, and her creative momentum. She was loved and admired by everyone she met, and her passing is an excruciating loss that we may never fully process or recover from.\u201d Sara Hoda, 30, of Walnut Creek, Calif., a Burning Man attendee (many at the event had Burning Man ties), described by her former housemate as Montessori teacher. That former housemate herself became part of the story when her efforts to find Hoda were publicized by the media. \u201cShe didn't deserve to go like that. After reading an account of what it was like to get out of there, all I can hope is that it happened quickly,\u201d Carol Crowder wrote on Facebook. \u201cI'm feeling pretty beat up about it, and somehow I ended up as the communicator and now reporters are trying to talk to me and I don't know what to tell them. But Sara was a good person. She deserves to be remembered.\u201d Travis Hough, 35, of Oakland, described by his family as a \u201cwarm, loving soul.\u201d His father on Dec. 3 posted a Facebook photo of the two of them, and then had to explain to his friends that his son had died. Like many others, his family has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for funeral services and time off work. Hough was a creative arts therapist in the Bay Area and a member of the band Ghosts of Lightning, his manager, Brendan Dreaper, told the LA Times. \u201cHe was a super fun person to be around. I never had a bad day being around him,\u201d Dreaper told the Times. \u201cTravis had his heart open to everything and I\u2019m at a loss for what to say.\u201d Nick Gomez-Hall, 25, of Coronado, Calif., a guitarist and musician who posted photos on Facebook of road trips with his white pickup, who friends remembered for his kindness. Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, of Hayward, Calif., a musician who used the name Nex Luguolo and performed with the group Symbiotix Fungi. Em B, 33, a poet, barista and baker, described by her former partner and roommate as \u201cthe best person in the world,\" the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\u00a0The transgender woman\u2019s death was confirmed by the Alameda County coroner in calls to her father, Jack Bohlka, and to the former partner, the Chronicle reported.

Draven McGill, 17,\u00a0the youngest of the confirmed fire victims. The son of a sheriff's deputy, he attended Ruth Asawa School of the Arts in San Francisco, according to school officials.

Gore, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton, declined to say what exactly he and Trump spoke about during the meeting. But he said he met with both the president-elect and Ivanka Trump, who reportedly wants to make climate change one of her signature issues. \"I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground... I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that,\" Gore told reporters after the meeting. Later Monday, Gore spoke to MNSBC's Chris Hayes and reiterated that he felt good about the meeting, adding \"we're in this wait and see period, but I was happy to have the opportunity and to have the exchange of views.\" Although he was reluctant to go into detail about his conversation with the President-elect, Gore also praised Ivanka Trump's commitment to the issue, saying her passion was \"certainly evident\" during the brief conversation they had before his meeting with Trump. Ultimately, Gore said he believes the momentum and international support built up around climate change will continue no matter the policies of the next administration. \"I think the momentum is unstoppable now, we're winning this \u2014 we're going to win it \u2014 but there is a serious question as to how fast we will win and that's crucial,\" he said. Since leaving public life following his unsuccessful 2000 presidential run, Gore has become one of the best known crusaders in the fight against human-caused climate change. He hit the campaign trail for Clinton in the final months of the presidential contest, calling her both the best candidate to combat global warming and reminding supporters \"every single vote counts.\" Clinton, like Gore in 2000, won the popular vote but lost the electoral college. Before running for office, Trump called climate change a hoax \"created by and for the Chinese.\" However, Trump said he has an \"open mind\" on the issue in an interview with the New York Times last month.

    "text": "Man Fires Rifle Inside D.C. Pizzeria, Cites Fictitious Conspiracy Theories Stopping the proliferation of fake news isn't just the responsibility of the platforms used to spread it. Those who consume news also need to find ways of determining if what they're reading is true. We offer several tips below. The idea is that people should have a fundamental sense of media literacy. And based on a study recently released by Stanford University researchers, many people don't. Sam Wineburg, a professor of education and history at Stanford University and the lead author of the study, said a solution is for all readers to read like fact checkers. But how do fact checkers do their job? Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, says fact checkers have a process for each claim they deal with. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Makes Unfounded Claim That 'Millions' Voted Illegally For Clinton \"You'll isolate a claim that has something that can be objectively verified, you will seek the best primary sources in that topic. Find whether they match or refute or prove the claim being made and then present with all limitations the data and what the data says about the claim being made,\" Mantzarlis says. That's the framework for professionals, but there are ways for everyone to do a bit of fact checking themselves. Melissa Zimdars is an assistant professor of communication and media at Merrimack College. When she saw her students referencing questionable sources, she created and shared a document with them of how to think about sources as well as a list of misleading, satirical and fake sites. Both Mantzarlis and Zimdars agreed there a few best practices people can use when reading articles online. Pay attention to the domain and URL For Advertisers, Fake News Is Not The Biggest Problem Established news organizations usually own their domains and they have a standard look that you are probably familiar with. Sites with such endings like .com.co should make you raise your eyebrows and tip you off that you need to dig around more to see if they can be trusted. This is true even when the site looks professional and has semi-recognizable logos. For example abcnews.com is a legitimate news source, but abcnews.com.co is not despite its similar appearance. Read the \"About Us\" section Most sites will have a lot of information about the news outlet, the company that runs it, members of leadership, and the mission and ethics statement behind an organization. The language used here is straightforward. If it's melodramatic and seems overblown, you should be skeptical. Also, you should be able to find out more information about the organization's leaders on places other than that site. Look at the quotes in a story Or rather, look at the lack of quotes. Most publications have multiple sources in each story who are professionals and have expertise in the fields they talk about. If it's a serious or controversial issue there are more likely to be quotes \u2014 and lots of them. Look for professors or other academics who can speak to the research they've done. And if they are talking about research, look up those studies. Look at who said them Then, see who said the quotes, and what they said. Are they a reputable source with a title that you can verify through a quick Google search? Say you're looking at a story and it says President Obama said he wanted to take everyone's guns away. And then there's a quote. Obama is an official who has almost everything he says recorded and archived. There are transcripts for pretty much any address or speech he has given. Google those quotes. See what the speech was about, who he was addressing and when it happened. Even if he did an exclusive interview with a publication, that same quote will be referenced in other stories, saying he said it while talking to the original publication. Students Have 'Dismaying' Inability To Tell Fake News From Real, Study Finds Check the comments A lot of these fake and misleading stories are shared on social media platforms. Headlines are meant to get the reader's attention, but they're also supposed to accurately reflect what the story is about. Lately, that hasn't been the case. Headlines often will be written in exaggerated language with the intention of being misleading and then attached to stories that are about a completely different topic or just not true. These stories usually generate a lot of comments on Facebook or Twitter. If a lot of these comments call out the article for being fake or misleading, it probably is. Reverse image search A picture should be accurate in illustrating what the story is about. This often doesn't happen. If people who write these fake news stories don't even leave their homes or interview anyone for the stories, it's unlikely they take their own pictures. Do a little detective work and reverse search for the image on Google. You can do this by right-clicking on the image and choosing to search Google for it. If the image is appearing on a lot of stories about many different topics, there's a good chance it's not actually an image of what it says it was on the first story. These tips are just a start at determining what type of news an article is. Zimdars outlined these and others in a guide for her students . If you do this you're helping yourself and you're helping others by not increasing the circulation of these stories. And you won't be the only one trying to stop the spread of this false content. The company leaders behind the platforms these stories are shared on are trying to figure out how to fix the issue from their side, but they are also trying to make sure not to limit anyone's right to freedom of speech. It's a tricky position to be in, but they've said they'll try. In the end it really does depend on taking responsibility and being an engaged consumer of news. Here's one last thing. Satirical publications exist and serve a purpose, but are clearly labeled as exaggerated and humorous by the writers and owners. Some of the more well-known ones like The Onion and ClickHole use satire to talk about current events. If people don't understand that, they might share these articles after reading them in the literal sense. If this happens or if you see your friends sharing blatantly fake news, be a friend and kindly tell them it's not real. Don't shy away from these conversations even if they might be uncomfortable. As said, everyone has to help fix the fake news problem. Wynne Davis is a Digital News intern. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Newspaper headlines show Italian Premier Matteo Renzi's resignation following the result of Sunday's constitutional referendum, at a newsstand in Rome, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. Italian voters dealt Premier Renzi a resounding rebuke early Monday by rejecting his proposed constitutional reforms, plunging Europe's fourth-largest economy into political and economic uncertainty. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) The results over the weekend of Italy\u2019s referendum and Austria\u2019s presidential election were billed as the first true test of the rising tide of populism that has engulfed European politics amid stagnant economies, high unemployment and unease over the continuing stream of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa. But instead of making a murky political situation clearer, Sunday\u2019s results have left observers with almost more questions than answers as the world awaits 2017\u2019s key elections in Western European superpowers France, Germany and The Netherlands. \u201cThere are definitely trends that we\u2019re seeing across the region, but one thing this weekend showed is that each country is different,\u201d Dan Kelemen, a professor of political scene at Rutgers University, told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t expect that just because the Brexit in the U.K., the election of [Donald] Trump in the U.S. and the rise of some populist leaders in Europe that the rest of the countries are going to go this way.\u201d In Rome - amid a wave of anti-establishment anger led by populist comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement - Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has promised to step down from power after Italians voted against a series of reforms that acted as an unofficial plebiscite on his rule.

All rights reserved.) While Italy\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote on Renzi\u2019s referendum is a clear indication of populism\u2019s rise on the boot of Europe, Sunday\u2019s decision may be a high point for the movement given the fractured nature of Italian politics and the varying political viewpoints at play. Grillo\u2019s 5-Star Movement is the biggest winner in the referendum's failure, but the more left-leaning populist will have to face numerous other candidates if he hopes to win the prime minister\u2019s job when elections are next held. Grillo has called for quick elections, but political analyst Giovanni Orsina, deputy director of the school of government at Rome's LUISS university, said he probably doesn't want them to come too soon because he wants the establishment's failure to \"cook\" over time. If opinion polls hold, the 5-Star movement commands roughly one-third of the vote, but whether that would be enough to govern depends on how the new electoral law is written. The other big player in Italy\u2019s upcoming election is the anti-EU, anti-migrant Northern League and its leader, Matteo Salvini. The Northern League's popularity got a boost in the week after Trump's victory, and Salvini has deepened his alliances with Europe's far-right parties to solidify his influence. Salvini wants \u00a0immediate elections in an effort to latch on to the growing discontent connected to the migrant crisis, especially in the northern regions of Veneto and Lombardy where they run regional governments and where\u00a0Italy's\u00a0proud entrepreneurial class is still struggling to regain footing after the economic crisis. Experts say that while these two parties certainly used the strength of Europe\u2019s populist movement to squash Renzi\u2019s referendum, the sheer number of political parties in Italy will make it difficult for one party to seize power outright. \u201cThe referendum was definitely a vote for populism, but it was more so about Italian anger at\u00a0 Renzi than populism,\u201d Kelemen said. About 700 miles to the north, the far-right candidate Norbert Hofer narrowly lost the country\u2019s presidential election to leftist Alexander Van der Bellen in a race that pitted Hofer\u2019s nationalistic brand of populism against Van der Bellen\u2019s self-described \u201cPro-European\u201d politics. Van der Bellen\u2019s victory over Hofer was welcomed by moderate European leaders \u2013 on both the right and left \u2013 as a win for supporters of the European Union and a blow against the populist forces looking to weaken it. Related Image Expand / Contract Presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leading member of the Greens Party, celebrates on the podium at a party of his supporters in Austria's capital Vienna Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016, after the first official results from the Austrian presidential election showed left-leaning candidate Alexander Van der Bellen with what appears to be an unbeatable lead over right-winger Norbert Hofer. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) The Austrian presidency is a mostly symbolic post, but the race attracted a good deal of attention across a Europe stunned by the electoral win by Trump in the U.S. and the Brexit vote in Britain. \"What happens here today has relevance for all of Europe,\" Van der Bellen said as he cast his ballot, later noting that his win showed most voters backed his message of \"freedom, equality, solidarity.\" Van der Bellen added that \u00a0the win sends a \"message to the capitals of the European Union that one can win elections with high European positions.\" He said he would work to unite a country deeply split between the moderate liberals who voted for him and supporters of Hofer's anti-immigrant Freedom Party. \u201cThis is definitely a clear cut win for those in favor of a multi-national, more Euro-centric view of politics,\u201d Kelemen said. Van der Bellen received praise from numerous European leaders including France\u2019s\u00a0Francois Hollande, who said Austrians \"made the choice of Europe, and openness.\" The results in Italy and Austria may give those two countries a better grasp on their domestic political situations, but does little to help forecast how their neighbors will vote in 2017. More on this... Europe's Trump moment: Countries see rise of populist leaders amid anger over economy, migrant crisis In France, the socially conservative former Prime Minister Francois Fillon looks poised to face off next year against Marine Le Pen, whose staunch opposition to the European Union and hardline immigration proposals has won her many supporters among the country\u2019s far-right. The Dutch will decide in March if they want the pugnacious populist Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom to run the country. While he currently sits atop the polls, experts say that the Dutch political system would make it difficult for him to pass a number of items on his agenda if elected. \u201cHe\u2019s popular, but the Dutch system has a lot of coalitions and not many other parties appear willing to work with Wilders,\u201d Kimberly Morgan, a political science professor at George Washington University, told FoxNews.com. And in Germany, as Chancellor Angela Merkel goes for her fourth term, she will face a resurgent far-right led by populist politician Frauke Petry of the Alternative for Germany party. However, it seems that Merkel will retain her job despite grumblings about her handling of the refugee crisis. \u201cWe should not jump to conclusions that Europe is going to the far right like some people are saying,\u201d Kelemen said. \u201cThey may make some gains, but it will be far from a takeover.\u201d Ther Associated Press contributed to this report.

Newslook A judge has ruled that damaging testimony Bill Cosby gave in his accuser's lawsuit can be used at the comedian's upcoming sex assault trial. (Photo: Mel Evans, AP) A Pennsylvania judge has ruled that damaging testimony Bill Cosby gave in an accuser's lawsuit can be used at his criminal sex assault trial. Cosby, 79, who is set to go to trial in June 2017, faces three counts of aggravated indecent\u00a0sexual assault stemming from a 2004 encounter with\u00a0Temple\u00a0University employee Andrea Constand, who looked to Cosby\u00a0as a mentor. Constand,\u00a0a 43-year-old Canadian now living in\u00a0Toronto,\u00a0says Cosby drugged her and assaulted her at his\u00a0Montgomery County\u00a0home, an account similar to that of five dozen other women who have come forward to accuse Cosby since the fall of 2014. Cosby insists the encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby's defense lawyers have\u00a0argued that Cosby only agreed to testify in a deposition in 2005, for a civil suit brought by Constand (and settled in 2006), after being promised he wouldn't be charged in the case. Montgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill concluded Monday that Cosby never had a promise from prosecutors that he could never be charged. \"Because there was no promise, there can be no reliance on the part of the defendant and principles of fundamental fairness\u00a0and due process have not been violated,\" O'Neill wrote, following a lengthy summary of his conclusions of law. \"This court finds there is no Constitutional barrier to the use of the defendant's civil deposition testimony.\" Bill #Cosby loses another pretrial bid; #MontcoPa judge denies request to suppress deposition testimony pic.twitter.com/M9r8TIFMmr \u2014 Carl Hessler Jr. (@MontcoCourtNews) December 5, 2016 The release of the deposition testimony last year prompted prosecutors to reopen Constand's 2005 criminal complaint. The prosecution aims to show that Cosby exhibited a pattern of sexual assault dating back to the 1960s and in multiple states.\u00a0Cosby has not been charged in any of these other accusations, due to statutes of limitation\u00a0in other states. Cosby criminal trial tentatively moved to June 2017 The judge's ruling provides another big win for the prosecution, which has repeatedly won on several pre-trial issues raised by Cosby. In this issue, prosecutors seek to use Cosby's own words in the\u00a0damaging deposition he gave for Constand's civil lawsuit. \"It\u2019s a pretty damaging blow for the defense and a pretty big win for the prosecution, because the deposition was given under oath so it has lot of weight to it,\" says\u00a0Larry Cunningham, vice dean & professor at\u00a0St. John's University School of Law. \"It\u2019s going to be very, very damaging for him at his criminal trial.\" Cosby acknowledged in the deposition that he had obtained drugs to give to women he sought for sexual encounters. He called them consensual, but many of the women say they were drugged and/or raped or molested. Bill Cosby arrives for hearings seeking dismissal of sex-assault charges The deposition was included in \"new evidence\" Steele cited in charging Cosby, after a previous\u00a0district attorney had declined to file charges in 2005. Cosby argues the deposition should be tossed because it was sealed and then wrongly released by a judge. \u201cAllowing the jury to hear Mr. Cosby\u2019s deposition testimony is another step forward in this case and will aid the jury in making its determination,\" Steele said in a statement. \"It\u2019s important that we are able to present all of the evidence available, and Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s ruling allows us to make this evidence part of the upcoming trial.\u201d Cunningham says the judge's decision gets the prosecution \"much\" closer to a conviction. \"Now the defense really has to come up with an argument or explanation to the jury explaining some of (Cosby's) admissions in the deposition itself,\" he says. A comment from the Cosby legal team was not immediately available. The ruling on the deposition is one of two key pretrial issues. The judge must also decide if prosecutors can call 13 other accusers to testify against him for an alleged \"pattern of bad acts.\" Contributing: The Associated Press Posted!

    "text": "Supreme Court appears in favor of ruling against racial gerrymandering in GOP-controlled states Justice Anthony Kennedy Denis Poroy / Associated Press Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holds the key Supreme Court vote on racial gerrymandering. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy holds the key Supreme Court vote on racial gerrymandering. (Denis Poroy / Associated Press) David G. Savage Contact Reporter A Supreme Court majority on Monday appeared to lean in favor of Democrats in Virginia and North Carolina seeking to rein in what they call racial gerrymandering\u00a0by Republican-controlled legislatures in those states. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is likely to hold the deciding vote, said he was troubled that Republican leaders drew new election maps by moving more black voters into districts that already had a majority of African American residents and usually favored black candidates. Civil rights lawyers and Democrats have contended these \u201cpacked\u201d districts have the effect of diluting or weakening the political power of black and Latino voters in other districts and statewide. \u201cI have problems with that,\u201d Kennedy said, suggesting he would question\u00a0such districts\u00a0if the \u201ctipping point, the principal motivating factor was race.\u201d Trump's victory assures a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. \u00bb If the court's majority agrees, the ruling would put states, counties and cities on notice that they may not concentrate more black and Latino voters into districts that already routinely\u00a0elect\u00a0minority representatives. In Virginia, Republican lawmakers decided that each of the 12 districts that currently elect\u00a0black candidates must maintain at least a 55% black voting population. And in North Carolina, Republican leaders moved tens of thousands of black voters in the Greensboro area into a district that had regularly elected a black Democrat to Congress. In their defense, the Republicans said they acted to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The landmark law has been understood to mean states may not\u00a0take steps that would reduce the number of districts that elect minority representatives. GOP lawmakers in both states argued they were protecting those seats.\u00a0 They also insisted that their primary motivation was\u00a0partisan\u00a0politics, not race. Paul Clement, the former solicitor general who was representing the Republicans, described the central North Carolina district as a \u201cpolitical draw.\u201d He said the state's expert drew the district map based on \u201cpolitical data. He drew the map to draw Democrats in and Republicans out.\u201d Redrawing electoral districts based on partisan gerrymandering is not only a time-honored political tradition, he argued, it is legal. But Marc Elias, lawyer for the Democrats, said the evidence produced at a trial showed the Republicans acted based on race. He noted that North Carolina legislators moved 75,000 African Americans into a district\u00a0that had faithfully elected Rep. Mel Watt , a black Democrat, for more than 20 years before he left to lead\u00a0the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The exchange highlighted an issue that has bedeviled the justices and confused lower courts. Under the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection, states may not make decisions based on race, but they may act based on political considerations. That distinction becomes murky when considering that African Americans vote reliably for Democrats. So is shifting black voters from one district into another a racial move or political one? For the fourth time, the electoral college picks the loser of the popular vote. \u00bb \u201cThis is such a complicated area,\u201d said Justice Stephen G. Breyer . He noted that when pressed, Republican\u00a0leaders acknowledged that \u201cthe reason we did that is most African Americans voters vote for Democrats.\u201d Last year, Breyer wrote a 5-4 decision for the court that set aside an Alabama redistricting plan because GOP lawmakers had similarly moved more blacks into black-majority districts. That opinion, which Kennedy joined, said it was unconstitutional to shift thousands of black voters into these districts, but it did not go far enough to resolve the current disputes.\u00a0 The comments and questions during Monday\u2019s arguments suggested the justices may split along similar\u00a0lines. The recent spate of redistricting cases put a spotlight on how the two ideological sides have shifted on racial gerrymandering. Twenty years ago, the court\u2019s conservatives struck down\u00a0districts in which race was used as the predominant factor, pushing aside objections from liberals and many Democrats\u00a0who said such plans were needed to elect minorities to legislatures. But since the redistricting after the 2010 census , it is the now Democrats who have objected to the role race has played in the Republicans\u2019 redrawing of districts. Among the justices, only Kennedy has stuck to the same position. He objected to the race-based redistricting in the 1990s, and last year\u00a0he joined the court\u2019s four liberals to reject race-based electoral districts in Alabama. The two cases heard Monday are Bethune-Hill vs. Virginia and McCrory vs. Harris. Lurking in the background is the potentially more explosive issue of partisan gerrymandering, since both sides admit to having redrawn\u00a0electoral maps to favor their candidates. Several lawsuits on the way to the court are urging the justices to prohibit state lawmakers from drawing electoral maps that lock in one party's control of a legislature for a decade. Last month, a federal court in Wisconsin struck down the state\u2019s electoral map for its state assembly on the grounds the districts were drawn to lock in a solid majority for Republicans, even in years when most of its voters choose Democrats. State officials say they plan to ask the Supreme Court to review the decision in the case of Whitford vs. Nichol. The justices have never struck down a state's electoral map because it unfairly favored\u00a0the candidates of one party over the other, but voting rights experts say they are optimistic that Kennedy is at least open to such a ruling.

    "text": "Plos One Italian archaeologists discovered the plundered tomb of Queen Nefertari in Egypt's Valley of the Queens in 1904, and amid the debris, they found a pair of mummified knees. Now, for the first time, researchers have conducted a broad array of tests on the knees and say they are confident they belong to Nefertari, who was the wife of Pharaoh Ramses II and one of the most famous of Egypt's queens. The knees, which are housed at the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, have long been presumed to be hers. But Egyptologist Joann Fletcher from the University of York tells The Two-Way that until now, there was plenty of reason for skepticism. \"We know certainly in the Valley of the Queens, from previous work we've done, that individuals were often buried in earlier tombs,\" Fletcher says. \"We had no way of knowing if these were Nefertari's remains or not. They could have been washed into the tomb at a later date during one of these occasional flash floods that do occur in that part of Egypt.\" Article continues after sponsorship The international team of researchers carried out tests that included radiocarbon dating, genetic studies, paleopathology and chemical tests, and their findings were recently published in the journal Plos One . They concluded that these knees belonged to a woman about 40 years old at the time of her death \u2014 which, as Fletcher says, was approximately Nefertari's age when she disappeared from the royal stage and is presumed to have died. An analytical chemistry analysis of the materials used to mummify the knees suggests that they belonged to someone at the very highest strata of ancient society. \"They'd been mummified to a very high standard using the most costly of ingredients. Very careful wrapping, a lot of attention to detail,\" says Fletcher. Tests indicate that they belonged to someone about 5 feet, 5 inches tall, taller than average for the time. A pair of ornate sandals found in Nefertari's tomb are also designed for a person of about the same height. \"If a large team all come up with data that all points in the same direction, then we can say this seems the most likely possibility,\" Fletcher says. \"You can never say 100 percent, this is definitely the person. But we are personally quietly confident that this is the great queen herself.\" An Egyptian guard examines a doorway inside the tomb of Queen Nefertari in the Valley of Queens in Luxor, south of Cairo, in 1995. Mohamed El-Dakhakhny/AP hide caption toggle caption Mohamed El-Dakhakhny/AP What most likely happened, Fletcher says, is that Nefertari's mummy was torn apart by frantic grave robbers trying to steal gold and jewelry in its wrappings before guards could stop them: \"You do get that feeling that there's a real degree of ripping apart human remains to get to the wealth.\" Identifying these knees, she says, adds to the picture of this key moment in ancient Egyptian history, the time of Ramses II. Fletcher says Nefertari played an important diplomatic role, exchanging correspondence and gifts with other queens around the ancient world. But she is best-known for her beauty, and she brought a sense of glamour to royal events. \"While Ramses II was the ultimate symbol of pharaonic might and power, very much flexing his pharaonic muscles on every temple wall in Egypt, it seems, Nefertari was usually the sort of, for want of a better word, eye candy,\" Fletcher says. Her great beauty is clearly visible in the renditions on her tomb walls. \"The irony is, of course, that we can never compare that to the physical reality because the knees are it. There's no face, there's no extra parts. It's just literally a mummified pair of knees and some of the legs,\" Fletcher adds. Still, she says: \"In Egyptology, you have to be happy with what remains after several thousand years.\" ",

Statistically, the answer is yes, and it's the situation Donald Trump will inherit when he takes the oath of office next month. Still, there are some shortcomings in Obama's record over the last eight years. The good news: The nation's unemployment rate declined more than three percentage points; the Dow Jones average has more than doubled; income is up (but only slightly); poverty is down (but barely); the number of Americans without health insurance was cut in half; the federal budget deficit is down; and the numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are a fraction of what they were in 2009. The bad news: The nation's debt nearly doubled during Obama's presidency, and the number of Americans receiving food stamps increased. And then there's the state of Obama's Democratic Party: When he took office, Democrats held 256 House seats, 58 Senate seats and 28 governorships. Now (before the next Congress convenes), it's 188 House seats, 46 Senate seats, and 18 governorships. The \"then\" figure is the best-available number for when Obama first took office in 2009. And the \"now\" is the most recent figure.

A video of the interrogation \u2014 obtained by the Chicago Tribune \u2014 shows him bragging about his life as a \"stickup man\" who preyed on easy targets, sometimes committing multiple robberies on Chicago's South Side in a single day. But Carter's demeanor changed when he discovered why the detectives wanted to talk to him. \"Y'all are homicide detectives?\" Carter asked uncertainly. \"Yes,\" one of the detectives replied. \"Is it considered a high-profile case?\" the admitted King Cobras gang member asked. \"Yes.\" Carter looked down and shook his head. \"I shoulda figured that,\" he said. The detectives were investigating the killing of Officer Michael Bailey, 63, who was gunned down nearly a year earlier, in July 2010, outside his South Side home just hours after finishing an overnight shift on then-Mayor Richard Daley's security detail. He was washing his Buick Regal, an early retirement gift the veteran officer had given himself in anticipation of leaving the department in a few weeks. Cop killed Chuck Berman / Chicago Tribune Police finish their investigation at the scene where off-duty Chicago Officer Michael Bailey was shot and killed after returning to his South Side home work in July 2010. Police finish their investigation at the scene where off-duty Chicago Officer Michael Bailey was shot and killed after returning to his South Side home work in July 2010. (Chuck Berman / Chicago Tribune) According to recently filed court documents, Bailey's son, Chip, had run out of the family's Park Manor home on hearing the gunshots, saw his father lying motionless on the ground in his police uniform \u2014 a baseball jersey over the top \u2014 and cried out, \"Get up! Get up!\" a witness told police. A bottle of glass cleaner laid next to Bailey. Bailey was one of five Chicago cops killed in 2010, one of the department's deadliest years in decades. Three were killed during attempted robberies, authorities said. By the time detectives brought Carter in for questioning a year after Bailey's killing, his was the only one of the five slayings that hadn't been solved, despite a massive $130,000 reward. Video obtained by the Tribune of Carter's interrogation shows how two seasoned homicide detectives worked to elicit incriminating remarks from him \u2014 though not a confession to the officer's killing \u2014 during interviews that prosecutors say lasted just a few hours. Attorneys for Carter have asked Cook County Judge Stanley Sacks to throw out comments that Carter made after telling detectives he wanted to speak \"off the record.\" Carter, 29, is being held on no bail in Cook County Jail while awaiting trial on murder charges. In the recordings, the skinny, self-proclaimed \"stickup man\" admitted seeing the \"old man\" \"off guard\" with his new vehicle on the night Bailey was killed. \"Just a regular person washing their car,\" Carter told detectives. Police had spent a frustrating year chasing down leads on what one homicide detective called a \"cowboy shootout\" \u2014 Bailey emptied his .9 mm semi-automatic but was shot three times. They got nowhere until Carter, who was in prison on a parole violation, allegedly told several witnesses about killing Bailey while trying to rob him. Prison officials had also told Chicago police about a phone call they intercepted in which Bailey's killing was discussed. When police later raided a home where Carter had stayed while on parole, they found letters he'd written a friend from prison that referred to Bailey's killing. \"Murder of a Police Officer\" was written on the front of one, according to the detectives. In the video, Carter told detectives that he was talking about a decades-old murder committed by a gang chief. Two eyewitnesses also identified Carter as the thin man in blue jean shorts who fatally shot Bailey, according to a recent court filing by his attorneys, who allege the photo lineups were improperly suggestive. The judge is expected to hear arguments on Carter's statements and the lineups in January before setting a trial date. In the nearly seven years since the five officers violently lost their lives, only the killings of Bailey and David Blake, a SWAT officer allegedly killed while off-duty by a teen who wanted to steal his gun collection, have yet to go to trial. Prosecutors have won convictions for the slayings of Officers Michael Flisk, an evidence technician killed while investigating a garage burglary, Thomas Wortham IV, killed in an attempted robbery while off-duty outside his parents' home, and Thor Soderberg, who was fatally shot with his own gun by a mentally disturbed man shortly after finishing his police shift. Carter's murder case has been postponed while prosecutors tried him first for a carjacking and armed robbery, securing convictions last year. He has yet to be sentenced in that case. Bailey's family declined to comment. Bailey funeral Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune Police officers salute the casket of Chicago Officer Michael Bailey at his funeral on July 23, 2010. Police officers salute the casket of Chicago Officer Michael Bailey at his funeral on July 23, 2010. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) As is common in homicide interrogations, the detectives repeatedly told Carter they already knew he killed Bailey, citing eyewitness reports and incriminating letters he'd sent a friend that they uncovered while searching that home for the murder weapon. Their focus, the detectives said, was answering a question that \"100,000 coppers\" were asking \u2014 did Carter know Bailey was a police officer when he shot him? They used flattery, sarcasm and blunt remarks in an effort to keep Carter talking. Detective Tim Murphy seemingly left Carter unnerved simply by rifling through a large accordion folder of investigative files he said they'd compiled on their suspect. In one seemingly off-the-cuff moment, Carter, who had long denied ever shooting at anyone during a robbery, told the detectives what happened one time he pulled a gun on a woman to rob her. \"She looked at me and called me a bitch and took off running across the street,\" Carter said as the detectives laughed. \"I wanted to shoot her but \u2026 like, man, she had courage or whatever, you know what I'm saying? \"You know how that is, it's a natural reaction \u2014 whenever somebody move, you shoot them,\" said Carter, contradicting his earlier remarks unprompted. \"But I remember that time I wasn't going to shoot her just to shoot her. \u2026 It was at the point where like, man, she just tried me \u2026 she just tried me. All I can do is just laugh at it. \"She just went across the street and continued her little jog.\" He mocked his other robbery victims, saying the \"kush guy,\" a seller of high-quality marijuana who alleged Carter fired shots at him during a robbery, \"doesn't have no kush, he only has regular weed and then like six bags at that.\" Carter also said he had lost loved ones to violence.

    "text": "China Appeals to US to Stop Disrupting Acquisitions By The Associated Press BEIJING \u0097 Dec 5, 2016, 7:32 AM ET 0 Shares Email China urged Washington on Monday to stop disrupting its foreign corporate acquisitions after President Barack Obama blocked the purchase of a German maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment as a security risk. The proposed acquisition of Aixtron SE by China's Fujian Grand Chip was \"pure market behavior,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang. On Friday, Obama ordered Fujian Grand Chip to drop its attempt to take over Aixtron's California subsidiary. The government said Aixtron's technology has \"military applications.\" \"We hope that the United States will cease making groundless accusations about Chinese companies and will provide a fair environment and favorable conditions for investment by them,\" said Lu at a regular briefing. \"I think this matter will in the long run be in the interests of all the parties concerned.\" It was the third time in three decades that a U.S. president has blocked an acquisition by a Chinese company on security grounds. Germany approved the 670 million euro ($740 million) takeover of Aixtron's German parent but said last week it was reconsidering due to unspecified \"security-related questions.\" Chinese companies have made a multibillion-dollar string of acquisitions in Europe to obtain technology and brands including Club Med, Pirelli tires and Volvo Cars. Many Europeans welcome the influx of money but China faces criticism from business leaders that they are blocked from making similar acquisitions in its state-dominated economy. Aixtron, based in Herzogenrath, says its headquarters, research and development operations and existing technology would remain at its current sites under the proposed acquisition.

But again, we have all heard the insults, and we have all heard the lies. We have also all heard the threats.\"\u00a0 Lawmakers said\u00a0they wanted to remind Congress of immigrants' contribution\u00a0to the economy through a number of resolutions and bills filed on Day One of the legislative session. And they sought\u00a0to send the message that\u00a0the state does not\u00a0approve of bigoted rhetoric, mass deportation\u00a0or expedited removal\u00a0from the country without due process.\u00a0 A pair of resolutions stating elected officials' support for a comprehensive and workable approach to fixing the nation's historically broken\u00a0immigration system\u00a0passed both the state House and Senate. But they sparked testy exchanges among lawmakers over whether the state was acting too soon. Two more bills aim to bolster the legal representation of immigrants who are in the country\u00a0illegally and face the threat of deportation. Lawmakers said it was premature to talk cost estimates but gave a range of anywhere from $10 million to $80 million to implement both proposals. The most sweeping proposal would use state government grants to fund attorneys for immigrants through a public defender model. Attorneys would be appointed by judges, lawmakers said. Rendon said he was not concerned about hurting the state's relationship with the federal government. \"President-elect [Donald]\u00a0Trump\u00a0had made his stances clear,\" he said.\u00a0 Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Le\u00f3n said leaders were\u00a0looking to work with federal officials and find\u00a0common ground. \"We are not looking for a fight,\" he said. But as \"elected officials of the most diverse state, the greatest mosaic of hues on this planet, it is our moral responsibility, it is our political responsibility to protect the most vulnerable of this state.\"\u00a0 Latest updates ",

Harris was also sentenced to an additional 32 years on other charges. Cooper, died on June 18, 2014, after he spent about seven hours in a car seat in Harris' locked SUV in the Atlanta area. WSB-TV Cooper Harris is seen in this undated handout photo. Prosecutor Chuck Boring said at the sentencing that Cooper died in the most \"torturous, horrific, unimaginable way possible.\" \"There is no justification,\" he said. Boring said only one sentence \"reflects\" the \"evil\" crime: life without parole. He asked for an additional 32 years for other charges. Judge Mary Staley Clark said at the sentencing that the jury \"fairly deliberated and discharged their duties and found the defendant guilty of what factually was a horrendous, horrific experience for this 22-month-old child who had been placed in the trust of his father. And in violation and dereliction of duty to that child, if not love of that child, callously walked away and left that child in a hot car, in June, in Georgia, in the summer to swelter and die.\" Clark then said she would follow the state's sentencing recommendation. Harris, wearing an orange jumpsuit and shackles, appeared emotionless in court after signing a sentencing document. ",

    "text": "LOCAL L.A. Now Oakland officials fielded multiple complaints about warehouse before deadly fire At least 36 people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Phil Willon , Paige St. John and Soumya Karlamangla Contact Reporters There are growing calls for a full accounting of how Oakland city officials handled safety and health issues at a warehouse where at least 36 people died in a fire amid evidence that various city agencies fielded\u00a0complaints over the last two years.\u00a0 \u201cI think we have to take responsibility and certainly our staff members that had that task were not as responsive or assertive as necessary,\u201d said\u00a0Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo on Monday. He and others said that the city had been aware of safety and fire hazards\u00a0at the warehouse for more than two years.\u00a0Neighbors and former residents have told The Times that they had contacted \u00a0the city about trash and debris piled up outside the warehouse as well as their concerns about unsafe conditions there. The owner of the building, which housed an artists\u2019 collective and is in Gallo\u2019s district, did not have any of the building permits or fire inspection that would have been required by the alterations inside, the councilman said. Responding to multiple complaints from neighboring businesses and residents, a city building inspector went to the warehouse on Nov. 17 to investigate but could not get access inside the building, Gallo and city officials said. Cash Askew, 22... (Los Angeles Times Staff) \u201cThe only question that is still outstanding for me, the administration has to tell us, well, what happened to the code inspector? Why did he just knock on the door and not pursue?\u201d Gallo said Monday.\u00a0\u201cThis thing has been going on for 2 1/2  years.\u201d Police were repeatedly called to the warehouse to address complaints, according to one former resident. Those reports could not be confirmed to The Times on Sunday by Oakland police. After a December 2014 party, one partygoer notified the city Fire Department of unsafe conditions, and it was inspected, said Danielle Boudreaux, who spent time at the warehouse. She did not know the result.\u00a0 Gallo said he personally went to the building with an Oakland Police Department captain because of complaints about refuse and other junk scattered outside the warehouse. Gallo said they did not go inside, however. City records cited allegations of at least three code violations at the building this year. In one complaint, city inspectors said there was a complaint of an illegal building on the property as well as piles of trash.\u00a0 The building was permitted for use as a warehouse, not for housing. City officials said that a party or concert at the property would have required a permit, which had not been granted. They also said there was no evidence of fire sprinklers or alarms in the building. The building was the site of a concert Friday night called the Golden Donna 100% Silk 2016 West Coast Tour. Gallo said complaints were filed by the owner of a neighboring Wendy\u2019s restaurant because people going to parties inside the warehouse often parked in the restaurant\u2019s parking lot and also left their trash. A resident nearby also complained to the city, saying the pallets and other trash the building manager was throwing into an empty lot posed a fire hazard, Gallo said. Shelley Mack, 58, said she paid $700 a month to live inside a trailer parked in the warehouse from November 2014 to February 2015. She said she had been drawn to the space by a Craigslist ad that promised cheap living space. Once there, she and several tenants \u2014 between 10 and 20, depending on the day \u2014 shared a single bathroom. The building had no heat, and in November 2014\u00a0a transformer blew, cutting off power. \u201cThere was no electricity, and it was freezing in there,\u201d she said. Gas-powered generators were used to run small space heaters, and propane tanks placed indoors by the exits fueled other heaters, Mack said. Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories Partygoers described a rabbit warren of rooms crammed with belongings \u2014\u00a0pianos, organs, antique furniture, doors\u00a0and half-finished sculptures. \"It was a tinderbox,\" said Brooke Rollo, 30, who lives less than a mile from the scene and had gone to parties there. Firefighters who responded to Friday\u2019s\u00a0three-alarm blaze described the interior as a labyrinth. Alameda County Dist. Atty. Nancy O'Malley said Monday that her office had launched an investigation, and the site is now a \"potential crime scene.\" \u201cIt\u2019s too early to speculate\" about the charges,\u201d she said.\u00a0\"Right now we've just started our investigation.\"\u00a0 O'Malley\u00a0said her office is looking into whether there's\u00a0criminal liability attached to this fire and if so, against whom. \u00a0 She said the charges could include manslaughter or murder, but it was too early to know what the evidence would reveal.\u00a0 O'Malley said her office would \"leave no stone unturned.\"\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The victims of the deadly Oakland fire , who\u2019s to blame for one of the worst fires in California history , Dakota Access pipeline opponents have claimed a big victory for now , and robots are taking over many warehouse jobs in California .

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach REUTERS Share advertisement With its graffiti and cracked exterior, the run-down warehouse sitting at 1305 31st Avenue in Oakland, California, did not look like a home at first glance. Known as the Ghost Ship, it was an artists' collective. But, perhaps more importantly, it was a roof over the heads of a handful of residents who wanted an affordable place to call home in an area where the tech boom has priced most locals out of their long-time neighborhoods. No matter that the loft-like space was not zoned for residential living, and didn't have any sprinkler system. Friday's fast-moving and fatal blaze that destroyed the building and killed close to 40 people has brought Silicon Valley's housing crisis into the spotlight once again. Related: Oakland Warehouse Fire: Death Toll Up to 36, Officials 'Absolutely Believe' Number Will Climb Sleeping in Shifts for a Lower Rent The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Oakland was $2,210 in November 2016, according to Zumper's National Rent Report . Oakland has a median household income of $52,962, according to Census data. \"There are a lot of things people are doing to respond to the high housing cost, from overcrowding in single family dwellings or even lots of unrelated individuals in a one-bedroom apartment,\" Leslye Corsiglia, executive director of affordable housing advocacy group SV@Home, told NBC News. \"I've even been in apartments where people slept in shifts.\" In the case of the Ghost Ship, the building was last designated as a warehouse and did not have permits for residences or events, according to Darin Ranelletti, Oakland's Interim Planning and Building Director. Carmen Brito, one of the people who lived at the warehouse, told TODAY that , \"At some point, when you need somewhere to sleep at night, it doesn't matter whether you have a piece of paper telling you if that's OK or not.\" \"I think the thing you have to understand about the Bay Area is that it's incredibly difficult to find housing,\" she said. \"If [you] go three blocks west of here, you can find plenty of people who couldn't find housing.\" Play How Was Deadly Oakland Warehouse Fire Allowed to Happen? 1:55 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161206011642if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/825417283816\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Dotcom Displacement Silicon Valley has a shortage of around 25,000 homes, which means lower-income workers are completely priced out of the region. Many are forced to travel more than 50 miles to work and back each day. Even tech workers at industry giants must endure long commutes \u2014 an issue that companies such as Palantir, Salesforce, and Facebook have attempted to rectify by offering employees cash bonuses to move closer to campus, thereby relieving some of the strain on the inner cities. \"We haven't built enough housing in the region to keep up with population growth,\" said Stephen Levy, director and senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \"We're very short on supply, and what that has meant is the people with money have begun to bid up prices and rents on homes that used to be lived in by middle-class families,\" he told NBC News. \"This leads to displacement for folks who see their rents increase.\" Just last week, Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of public policy and communications, announced the social media giant would invest $20 million to develop affordable housing and fund job training. But it's not simple philanthropy: As part of its gigantic campus expansion project, Facebook is legally required to give back to the community to regulate income inequality. However, building new housing will require zoning approvals and various other red tape to cut through before the actual construction begins. As an immediate way to help, Schrage said $500,000 of that money would go toward an \"assistance fund to provide legal support to tenants threatened with displacement from evictions, unsafe living conditions and other forms of landlord abuse.\" In 2013, Google also stepped in to help with the housing crisis, committing $6 million to help build an affordable housing complex. Corsiglia and Levy said they were happy to see tech companies doing their part to help with the problem. However, both said there's a greater issue at play that even Silicon Valley's deep pockets can't solve. There's an attitude of \"not in my backyard\" when it comes to building new, affordable units, they said. \"It is a modest drop in the bucket but it does not address the problem of people blocking housing projects,\" Levy said. \"That will take zoning changes and political will.\" With a limited amount of land to build on, Corsiglia said it's vital that future construction projects build for density, creating taller building with more units. \"In situations like Oakland, when you think of people who are struggling, it is a wide swath of people,\" she said. \"It's artists, teachers, retail workers, and people we need in our community to keep our quality of life. It really is a wide variety of our population that is struggling.\" Alyssa Newcomb ",

    "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch December 5, 2016, 3:45 PM Amazon's newest shopping disruption is a doozy Email Amazon ( AMZN ) today unveiled a prototype for a brick-and-mortar food store called Amazon Go . That sounds like a big deal, but it actually promises something far beyond what current grocers can offer: This store will let consumers make purchases while they\u2019re tracked with cameras and artificial intelligence sensors that know what goods they\u2019ve picked up, and then they pay via their mobile devices -- automatically -- as they leave. No need for waiting on a checkout line (and no need for the jobs of countless cashiers). According to the e-commerce giant, Amazon Go is currently being tested at a location in its Seattle hometown that\u2019s open now only to company employees. Amazon, which will open the 1,800-square foot store to the public next year, is said to be planning a chain of convenience stores that offer perishable items as well as meals. It\u2019s a further challenge to rivals such as Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ), which depend on their grocery businesses for more than half of their annual sales. Traditional players such as Kroger ( KR ) are also in Amazon\u2019s sights. \u00a0 Making a new venture into the physical world, online retail giant Amazon is planning to open brick and mortar grocery stores. Wall Street Journal... Amazon\u2019s version of a grocery store uses what the company calls \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology. Developed over the past four years, it\u2019s similar to the gear used in self-driving cars, according to Amazon. It automatically detects which products are taken from -- or returned to -- the store\u2019s shelves and keeps track of those goods in a virtual cart. When you\u2019re done shopping, you leave the store, and your Amazon account gets charged automatically (and you\u2019ll get an emailed receipt). \u201cThe Go technology Amazon developed streamlines and shortens the whole consumer experience of grocery shopping and, just like Uber, removes the whole payment hassle,\u201d said Amanda Nicholson, \u00a0 a professor of retail practice at Syracuse University\u2019s Whitman School of Management, in an email.\u00a0 She added, \u201con the more practical side of things, problems might include customers moving stickers from item to item, how to handle \u2018returns\u2019 and, of course, if this really becomes the modern way to shop, we\u2019re looking at significant job losses for cashiers in the U.S.\u201d Amazon didn\u2019t provide additional details on its plans for Amazon Go, such as if it will license the technology to other retailers, and it declined to make any executives available for interviews.\u00a0 Clearly, the ramifications of Amazon\u2019s \u201cJust Walk Out Technology\u201d could be huge for grocery stores, which are worried about turning off customers with long checkout lines, and other physical retailers struggling to draw crowds as online shopping surges in popularity, according to Howard Davidowitz, who runs New York-based Davidowitz & Associates, a firm that provides consulting and investment banking services to retailers. \u201cThis takes a lot of technology,\u201d said Davidowitz, who described it as a \u201cgame changer.\u201d If it works, he said, \u201cit can change the way retailing is done.\u201d \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology comes as shoppers are growing increasingly comfortable making purchases over their smartphones and tablets.\u00a0 According to ComScore , mobile devices will account for about 20 percent of total holiday e-commerce sales, in line with the third quarter when it reached an all-time high.\u00a0 A year ago, spending from mobile devices accounted for about 13 percent of e-commerce holiday spending. Although mobile payment offerings such as Apple Pay ( AAPL ), PayPal ( PYPL ) and Android Pay ( GOOG ) have gained in popularity, consumers have been slow to adopt them. \u201cSelf-checkout is already available to shoppers who use hand-held scanners, and Amazon Go could offer a shopping experience that eliminates even that simple step,\u201d said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, an e-commerce services provider that owns FreeShipping.com and ShopSmarter, a price comparison site. \u201cIt\u2019s still in beta testing at the moment, but if Amazon can deliver on its promise, it\u2019s likely that down the road, millions of in-store shoppers will be able to bypass checkout lines and essentially \u2018grab and go.\u2019\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Florida Gov. Scott may serve as a model and warning for President-elect Donald Trump. Both opposed the Republican establishment, spoke forcefully on cracking down in immigration and vowed to battle insiders in the capital.

In a lawsuit filed Monday in Leon Circuit Court, they\u00a0assert that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, actually won Florida. The plaintiffs, who live in Osceola and Volusia counties, say the state\u2019s official election results were off because of hacking, malfunctioning voting machines and other problems.

By Mark Berman December 5 at 5:58 PM Follow @markberman A video showing former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott is shown in court during Slager\u2019s murder trial last week. (Grace Beahm/Pool photo via Post and Courier via AP) A\u00a0jury deadlocked Monday in the case of a former South Carolina police officer charged with murder after he was recorded on video last year firing a barrage of bullets at the back of Walter Scott, a fleeing driver, in one of the most high-profile shootings to rattle the nation in recent years. \u201cWe as the jury regret to inform the court that despite the best efforts of all members, we are unable to come to a unanimous decision,\u201d the jury wrote in a note that Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman read aloud in the courtroom. Newman declared a mistrial shortly before 3:40 p.m. and thanked the jurors for their \u201chard work in trying to reach a unanimous verdict in this case.\u201d Prosecutors as well as attorneys for Michael Slager, the former officer,\u00a0also thanked the jurors\u00a0for their effort in the case. Several jurors wiped tears from their eyes as Newman made his announcement following more than 20 hours of deliberations. It was the second time in a matter of weeks\u00a0that a mistrial was declared in a case\u00a0 involving an officer charged with murder \u00a0after being recorded\u00a0shooting someone, following a similar outcome in Ohio last month.\u00a0Prosecutors in South Carolina, echoing their\u00a0counterparts in Ohio, vowed to seek another trial for Slager. When he declared the mistrial, Newman did not say\u00a0whether the deadlock came down to a sole holdout. The jury of 11 white people and one black man in Charleston began deliberating Wednesday and\u00a0 seemed on the verge of a deadlock by Friday , when a juror sent a note saying they could not pick a guilty verdict. Jurors then asked to take the weekend off and resume deliberations Monday morning. [ Jury teetered on the brink of a deadlock last week ] Slager, who is white, was fired \u00a0after graphic video emerged showing him shooting Scott, a black motorist, as the 50-year-old was running away after a traffic stop in April 2015. A South Carolina judge on Monday declared a mistrial after a jury deadlocked on whether white former police officer Michael Slager committed murder in the April 2015 shooting death of black motorist Walter Scott. (Reuters) The\u00a0recording, captured by a bystander, spread quickly across news stations and the Internet, propelled into the public consciousness during a wave of scrutiny and protests nationwide focusing on how police use deadly force. Slager became the rare officer charged for an on-duty shooting, and the case continued to draw national attention as it stretched into December. Slager, who said he feared for his life during the encounter, was charged remarkably quickly amid a shifting climate sparked by protests in Ferguson, Mo., just months before Scott\u2019s death. After local officials announced the charges and vowed reforms in an attempt to reassure the public, a local activist said they didn\u2019t want the city to become \u201canother Ferguson.\u201d [ South Carolina police officer charged with murder ] After the\u00a0officer\u00a0pulled Scott over for a traffic stop, footage recorded by Slager\u2019s dashboard camera captured the two men briefly interacting before Scott runs away and out of view. Over the police radio, Slager can be heard calling in a description of Scott before yelling, \u201cTaser, Taser, Taser!\u201d Far more widely seen was the recording captured by a bystander, video showing\u00a0Scott fleeing after a physical encounter with Slager. In this video, Scott can be seen running away as the officer takes aim and fires.\u00a0Slager\u2019s\u00a0trial effectively put his word against that video footage, contrasting the images shared around the world with an officer\u2019s description of his own fear and what he said happened before the recording began. Former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager reacts to a question while testifying in the murder trial.\u00a0(Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via AP) \u201cI was scared,\u201d Slager said during the trial, holding back tears. He described feeling \u201ctotal fear that Mr. Scott was coming toward me.\u201d The video showed Scott\u2019s back to the officer as he fired the fatal shots.\u00a0Slager said that while he tried to subdue Scott, the driver had grabbed the Taser during a struggle over the device. Speaking on the witness stand, Slager was asked by a prosecutor whether he agreed that Scott was unarmed and running away. He said he did not realize the Taser had dropped behind him when he fired. \u201cAt the time,\u201d Slager responded, \u201cI would say no. But after watching the video, yes.\u201d Michael Slager, a white, former South Carolina police officer, takes the stand at his murder trial to defend his decision to shoot and kill unarmed black man Walter Scott in April 2015. (Reuters) In the footage that captured Scott\u2019s death, Slager could be seen placing an item \u2014 his Taser \u2014 near Scott\u2019s body after the shooting. [ \u201cLook for justice\": A shooting in South Carolina and the power of video ] Speaking after the mistrial was declared, Walter Scott\u2019s older brother, Anthony, asked that people who protest in the community remain peaceful. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tear up this city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep it just the way it is. We\u2019re going to believe in peaceful protests, because it didn\u2019t turn out the way we feel, but we feel our voices need to be heard.\u201d Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, called the trial\u2019s outcome\u00a0\u201ca missed opportunity for justice\u201d but said the\u00a0fight was far from over, noting that Slager faces federal charges as well as a retrial. \u201cHe may have delayed justice, but he did not escape it,\u201d Stewart said. When asked whether another jury will\u00a0convict Slager, Stewart responded:\u00a0\u201cOf course. He\u00a0dodged it by a hair, and he\u2019s not dodging it again.\u201d The lawyers for the family of Walter Scott, the black man who was shot dead by former South Carolina patrolman Michael Slager, reacted on Monday to news of his mistrial, saying the officer has \"delayed\" justice but will not \"escape\" it. (Reuters) Scarlett A. Wilson, the prosecutor for Charleston County, said in a statement Monday afternoon that her\u00a0office fully intended to put Slager on trial once more. \u201cWe will try Michael Slager again,\u201d she said. Alluding to the federal charges against Slager, Wilson continued: \u201cWe hope the federal and state courts will coordinate efforts regarding any future trial dates but we stand ready whenever the court calls.\u201d An attorney for Slager said in an email Monday night that he would spend the coming weeks reviewing the trial\u2019s transcript, examining how to mount a more persuasive argument and \u201clooking for a better way to tell our story.\u201d In court, he had thanked the jurors for their efforts.\u00a0\u201cThe rule of law has to be preserved in this country, and you have done that,\u201d Andrew J. Savage III, the attorney, told the jurors. \u201cI thank you.\u201d Gov. Nikki Haley said that she understood there will be \u201ca new trial where the Scott family and all of South Carolina will hopefully receive the closure that a verdict brings,\u201d the Associated Press reported. \u201cJustice is not always immediate, but we must all have faith that it will be served I certainly do.\u201d Officers are infrequently\u00a0charged \u00a0for deadly on-duty shootings, and convictions in such cases are even less common.\u00a0There have been thousands of police shootings since 2005, and during that same span, 78 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter, according to\u00a0Philip M. Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who studies arrests of officers. The dash cam from North Charleston, S.C. police officer Michael Slager's vehicle shows the initial traffic stop and interaction that preceded Slager shooting and killing Walter Scott. (South Carolina Law Enforcement Division) The jury in Slager\u2019s trial began deliberating Wednesday, the same day authorities said a Charlotte police officer would not face charges for fatally shooting a man there in September. Last month, a Minnesota police officer was charged with manslaughter for shooting Philando Castile \u00a0over the summer, while prosecutors in Ohio said they would retry a former campus police officer in Cincinnati after a mistrial was declared . An undated photo of Walter Scott. (Family photo via AP) In all of these cases, video footage \u2014 some of which captured the shootings, while others captured the aftermath or reactions from loved ones \u2014 played a key role in the investigations and the public outcries. The recording from Cincinnati, much like the one in North Charleston, appeared to contradict the officer\u2019s account. Slager \u2014 who also faces a federal civil rights charge for the shooting \u2014 was charged by the state with murder last year, but the judge agreed last\u00a0week to let the jurors also consider manslaughter, a lesser charge with a lighter sentence. [ \u201cI was scared\": S.C. officer on trial for murder in shooting of unarmed black man takes the stand ] Under South Carolina law, murder is defined as killing a person \u201cwith malice aforethought, either express or implied\u201d and must be punished with between 30 years in prison or life imprisonment in cases, such as this one, where the death penalty is not being sought. Manslaughter, defined as killing \u201cwithout malice, express or implied,\u201d carries with it a sentence of between two and 30 years. The jury in Charleston had the choice between these counts or acquitting Slager, if they could reach a unanimous verdict. In Minnesota, prosecutors last month said they opted for a second-degree manslaughter charge for the officer who shot Castile because it was \u201cthe highest, most provable offense.\u201d The prosecutor in Ohio who decided to retry Raymond Tensing, the former officer who shot and killed Samuel DuBose during a traffic stop in Cincinnati last year, said jurors were leaning toward convicting that officer of voluntary manslaughter and acquitting him on the murder charge. He still\u00a0 opted to retry him on both counts. Newman told jurors in Charleston that without a verdict, the case will likely return to the courtroom with another jury. [ A year of reckoning: Police fatally shoot nearly 1,000 ] In a year-long study , The Post found that the types of incidents that sparked protests across the country \u2014 usually white officers killing unarmed black men or boys \u2014 represented less than 4 percent of fatal shootings. More than 7 in 10 of the people shot were wielding\u00a0a gun or a knife. More officers have been charged in recent years, which have been roiled by demonstrations and calls for reform. Video evidence, available in\u00a0an era of widespread police cameras and ubiquitous civilian smartphones, has increasingly been a factor in those cases. Last year, a makeshift memorial was created where Scott was shot. (David Goldman/AP) Fewer officers were killed by suspects last year than in 2014, but that number has increased this year,\u00a0reaching 62 officers shot and killed through the first 11 months of the year \u2014 up from 38 such deaths last year. Police officers say they are increasingly anxious in the era of smartphones and protests, and after ambush killings of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge , some in law enforcement call this a uniquely difficult and dangerous time for policing. During his trial, Slager described his regrets from the shooting, saying that in hindsight, he would have called for backup and not chased Scott. The former officer was in custody when his son was born, and while locked up, he was held near Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old charged with killing nine black parishioners in a Charleston church last year and on trial at the same time as Slager . \u201cMy family has been destroyed by this,\u201d Slager said. \u201cThe Scott family\u2019s been destroyed by this. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d Dustin Waters in Charleston, S.C., contributed to this story, which has been updated since first published at 3:42 p.m. Further reading: ",

With Mendoza are her mother, Susana, left, her husband, David M. Szostak and son David Q. Szostak.

Szostak and son David Q. Szostak. (Seth Perlman / AP) Privacy Policy Democrat Susana Mendoza was sworn in Monday as state comptroller during a small ceremony at the Capitol, asking for patience and prayers as she takes office with lllinois' pile of unpaid bills topping $10.4 billion. Mendoza said she will use her role overseeing the state's checkbook to \"safeguard the interests of the state's most vulnerable people,\" a goal that will be no small feat as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the Legislature remain deadlocked on a budget. The nearly two-year-long stalemate has led to a huge spike in debt as court orders and laws still require the comptroller to cut checks for some key services even if there's no money in state coffers to cover the costs. \"I ask you to please bear with me, this is going to be tough,\" Mendoza warned. \"Keep me in your prayers as I take on what will be the most challenging experience of my lifetime.\" She pointed to the sea of red ink, noting that the state's failure to pay bills affects businesses small and large and the people they have been hired to serve. \"Let's start by the fact that we're looking at almost $11 billion in bill backlogs, but that's not just $11 billion. That $11 billion signifies people who need us to do the right thing for them. They are not numbers on a spreadsheet, they are stories of people's lives and how people are hurting in this state,\" Mendoza said. Mendoza won the seat in November, defeating Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger, who Rauner appointed to the post following the death of Judy Baar Topinka shortly after she won another term in office in 2014. Now, Mendoza will face re-election in two years. Democratic Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza is set to be sworn in as Illinois comptroller on Monday, taking the office that controls the... Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Topspin Democratic Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza is set to be sworn in as Illinois comptroller on Monday, taking the office that controls the... (Chicago Tribune staff) With her victory last month, Democrats now control every statewide office except that of Rauner and his lieutenant governor. Mendoza, though, vowed to carry on Topinka's reputation for working across the aisle and frequently referenced their friendship throughout her speech. Mendoza wore a red suit with gold buttons that was formerly owned by Topinka and took the oath of office with her hand on the Topinka family Bible. The ceremony marks Mendoza's return to Springfield, where she served as a House lawmaker from 2001 to 2011 until she was elected Chicago city clerk. Mayor Rahm Emanuel will name Mendoza's clerk replacement. Despite her status as a former lawmaker, Mendoza said she hoped her former colleagues in the Legislature understand her decision to continue a Munger policy that's held up their paychecks for several months. In April, an election-seeking Munger announced that legislative salaries would no longer be among the first bills paid each month, sending them to the back of the queue alongside nonprofits and other businesses waiting to get paid. A group of Democratic lawmakers sued last week in an effort to speed up their paychecks, saying the move violated the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branch. Democratic leaders on Sunday said they need more information to formulate a comprehensive budget plan, including the potential effects of an incoming Donald Trump administration, but Republicans called the request a stall tactic aimed at creating financial havoc with a short-term state spending... Democratic leaders on Sunday said they need more information to formulate a comprehensive budget plan, including the potential effects of an incoming Donald Trump administration, but Republicans called the request a stall tactic aimed at creating financial havoc with a short-term state spending... (Rick Pearson) Munger called the suit \"cowardly\" and questioned the timing, noting the office was soon to be \"led by one of their own.\" On Monday, Rauner called on Democrats to drop the legal challenge, calling it \"an insult to the taxpayers of Illinois.\" The governor said the effort was a \"rigged deal,\" pointing to one of the lawmakers' attorneys, Michael Kasper, a Democratic lawyer with long-standing ties to House Speaker Michael Madigan . Rauner called upon Mendoza to hire outside counsel instead of relying on representation from Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who is the speaker's daughter. \"Pretty clearly, this is an orchestrated effort. It's clearly coordinated,\" Rauner said. \"It's not fair to taxpayers. And frankly, it's not fair to our government service recipients. Why should legislator pay be put ahead of our human services funds? Why should legislator pay be put ahead of our school funding?\" Mendoza has said the delay will continue unless she is ordered otherwise by a court, and she said she also will put her personal paychecks at the end of the line. Asked if Democrats should drop their suit, Mendoza said legislators \"make valid points.\" \"However, I make a very valid point that the state of Illinois is in its worst fiscal crisis right now,\" Mendoza said. \"Not because I want to villainize legislators, I clearly don't. I think a lot of them work very hard. However, we are public servants and in this fiscal crisis we need to make sure we prioritize the right people first.\" Mendoza said blame for the budget impasse falls on Rauner and Democrats alike. But she echoed a leading Democratic argument that the economic agenda the governor has made a condition of a budget deal should be considered separately from any spending plan. She called on all sides to work together to reach an agreement, before saying that Munger's administration did not provide any help with the transition. Munger said last week that she did not meet with Mendoza but their staffs had been in talks. Munger contended that Mendoza was trying to put political workers on the state payroll before she took office. Still, Mendoza said she was not going to dwell on the past, tearing up as she talked about the path ahead. \"I am so proud to have the opportunity to lead you, and I hope that when my day is over here you will have been proud of me as well,\" Mendoza said. \"We're going to get out of this, and we're going to do it together. And Illinois will see brighter days ahead.\" Chicago Tribune's Kim Geiger contributed from Chicago. ",

    "text": "Warning: The video above contains graphic content. South Carolina officials announced murder charges against white police officer Michael Slager ... Speaking after the court hearing, Scott\u2019s family said they remain hopeful that another jury will convict Slager. They said the solicitor plans on re-trying the case, and Slager also faces trial next year in federal court on charges of depriving Scott of his civil rights. \u201cHe dodged it by a hair,\u201d said family lawyer Chris Stewart. \u201cHe\u2019s not dodging it again.\u201d Scott\u2019s mother Judy Scott said her faith leads her to believe that her son will receive justice. \u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d Judy Scott said. \u201cY\u2019all hear me? It\u2019s not over until God says it\u2019s over.\u201d\u00a0 Slager\u2019s wife, Jamie, cried after the jurors were dismissed and briefly put her head on the bench in front of her. She said \u201cthank you for everything\u201d to the defense lawyers as they left the courtroom. She did not respond when reporters asked if she wanted to comment. One female juror wiped away tears with her hands and a tissue as the attorneys addressed them and thanked them for their hours of work.\u00a0 During the trial, the prosecution argued that the 35-year-old Slager let his sense of authority get the better of him. The defense maintained that the two men wrestled on the ground, that Scott got control of Slager\u2019s stun gun and then pointed the weapon at the 35-year-old officer before the shooting. The defense also contended there was no way the officer could tell if Scott was unarmed. Much of the testimony centered on the cellphone video, which at times was blurry and shaky. The jurors saw it video numerous times, including several times frame by frame. The defense contended that there was much more to the case than the brief video clip that was seen worldwide. They focused their case on the seconds before the shooting that were not captured on the cellphone video, which was taken by a barber who passed the scene while walking to work. Slager took the stand and testified that Scott wrestled with him and grabbed his Taser and came at him with it. He said he was in \u201ctotal fear\u201d at the time he fired his gun. \u201cAt that point I pulled my firearm and pulled the trigger,\u201d he testified. \u201cI fired until the threat was stopped as I was trained to do.\u201d Slager, who was five-year veteran of the department, also expressed regret over the whole incident. \u201cMy family has been destroyed by it. The Scott family has been destroyed by it. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said. Last year, the city of North Charleston reached a $6.5 million civil settlement with Scott\u2019s family. In the wake of the shooting, the city also asked that the U.S. Justice Department conduct a review of its police department policies with an eye toward how the department can improve its relationship with residents.\u00a0 It\u2019s the second time in recent weeks a jury has deadlocked in an officer-involved shooting.

CBS News Google didn\u2019t say why only some changes were made to the tool, which offers users suggested phrases when typing words into Chrome\u2019s search bar or Google\u2019s search box. \u201cOur search results are a reflection of the content across the web,\u201d a Google spokesperson said, according to The Guardian. \u201cThis means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don\u2019t reflect Google\u2019s own opinions or beliefs - as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.\u201d The company said autocomplete predictions are generated algorithmically, based on the interests and search activity of users.\u00a0 \u201cBecause of this, terms that appear in autocomplete may be unexpected or unpleasant,\u201d Google said, according to The Guardian. \u201cWe do our best to prevent offensive terms, like porn and hate speech, from appearing, but we acknowledge that autocomplete isn\u2019t an exact science and we\u2019re always working to improve our algorithms.\u201d It also appeared on Monday that Google removed the suggested phrase \u201care women equal to men.\u201d The phrase no longer turned up in suggested Google search results after being captured in a screenshot by the Guardian. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Since that first post, every Monday, we have featured the story of a different missing person brought to our attention from a member of our online communities. This map shows all the locations across the country where those part of our Dateline Missing in America remain missing from. On this third anniversary of the series, more than a third of those we have featured are still missing. Several have had someone charged in connection with their cases. In others, a person has been convicted of their murder. But they still have not been brought home. Please take a moment to read, and share, their stories. Someone, somewhere, saw something that may help authorities. Could it be you or one of your friends?

She then headed back to the home she shared with the boy and his father, with whom she reportedly no longer had a romantic relationship. A grainy security video, captured the next morning around 5:00, shows Peggy's Toyota truck being parked at T&J's Ice House, a rural bar along Highway 9. A dark, unidentified figure can be seen walking away from the vehicle through an early morning storm. In the year since, there have been few clues uncovered in the case.

JAKE LATIOLAIS Jake Latiolais It was in the early morning hours of August 29, 2014, that Jake Latiolais told friends he was headed towards West Baton Rouge outside Baton Rouge, Louisiana. That was the last time anyone heard from the 22-year-old. Shortly after, police received an anonymous call about a person going over the railing of the Mississippi Ridge Bridge. Responding officers found Jake's truck running on the shoulder of the bridge and his cell phone on the pavement next to it. A dive team was called in, but nothing of significance was found. Officials have not ruled out foul play. Family members insist Jake would not simply disappear on his own or take his own life. If you have any information regarding Jake's case, please call the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office at (225) 389-8617. DEANNE HASTINGS Deanne Hastings Deanne Hastings left her fianc\u00e9 a note the night of November 3, 2015, saying she was headed to the store. That was the last time anyone heard from her. She had just finished her last day of cosmetology school that afternoon. The following morning, her credit card was used at a store not too far from her home outside Spokane, Washington. Security video shows Deanne leaving the store around noon. Her car was later discovered parked in downtown Spokane. It appeared to have been left there the night she vanished. Inside were her purse, cell phone and wallet. Earlier this year, a man was arrested and charged with using Deanne's credit cards. He spent several months in jail and was released in September. Neither he, nor anyone else, has been charged in connection to Deanne's disappearance. If you have any information regarding Deanne's case, please call the Spokane Police Department at (509) 456-2233. NANCY BROMET Nancy Bromet Nancy Bromet left her father's home in Sunrise, Florida on November 12, 2015, to head to Bakersfield, California with her boyfriend, a long-haul truck driver. Several days later, the 37-year-old called her sister Laura saying she was in distress and wanted to come home. Nancy was reported missing by her boyfriend, who reportedly told police he dropped her off at a shopping mall outside El Centro, California, while he was finishing deliveries. Nancy was not there when he returned, according to police. Few clues have been discovered in the case, and the investigation is still \"open and active,\" authorities said. If you have any information regarding Nancy's case, please call the El Centro Police Department at (760) 337-4861.

Family members insist Tyarra would never have run away, and was planning to start classes soon on early childhood development at the Guilford Technical Community College nearby. If you have any information regarding Tyarra's case, please call the Greensboro Police Department at (336) 373-2287. DONNA CHATTERTON Donna Chatterton Donna Chatterton's home went up in flames on February 4, 2015. There were no remains found in the charred remnants of the home, but no one knew where Donna was. Authorities have said they believe the fire was accidental, most likely started by a space heater that was left on. However, officials believe Donna met with some type of foul play. Family members said authorities came close to charging someone in connection with Donna's disappearance, but there was not enough evidence to move forward. If you have any information regarding Donna's case, please call the Lee County Sheriff's Office at (239) 477-1810. NOEMI GONZALEZ Noemi Gonzalez It's been nearly two years since grandmother Noemi Gonzalez disappeared from her North Miami, Florida home.

The Air Force veteran, and father of three, was going through a divorce, but family members said there were absolutely no red flags in his personal life that would have led to his disappearance. Because he is an avid swimmer, they fear he possibly headed towards the water for a late night dip. None of Michael's belongings were found on the beach, or anywhere for that matter. Authorities say the case is still active and ongoing. If you have any information regarding Michael's case, please call the Hermosa Beach Police Department at (310) 318-0360. MORGAN BAUER Morgan Bauer Morgan Bauer mysteriously vanished after she moved across the country from Aberdeen, South Dakota to Atlanta, Georgia. According to Sherri Sichmeller, Morgan's mother, the 19-year-old had arranged to stay with a man she met on Craigslist, offering to clean and do other chores until she settled into a job. But for an unknown reason, Morgan was reportedly kicked out of that temporary home and was living at a local motel. She stopped posting on social media, and last spoke with family members and friends, on February 29, 2016. Authorities continue to investigate Morgan's disappearance, but say they do not suspect foul play in the case. Morgan's mother Sherri vows to continue to search for Morgan until she hears from her daughter that she is somewhere safe.

In the six or so months since he vanished, there have been very few clues as to what may have happened to the 19-year-old. Martin vanished without his cell phone and did not have access to a vehicle, which makes his disappearance all the more troubling to his family.

She never returned home, and her phone either was turned off or died later that afternoon. Authorities said the search continues to be active and ongoing, but few details are available to be released. A search warrant was executed in connection with the case several weeks after Kianna's disappearance on a property not far from the apartment complex where Kianna's family lives.

According to Bianca's sister, Jovanna Burney, and close friend, Monica Nevarez, Bianca had recently told her husband she wanted a divorce and had met someone else. Foul play has not been ruled out in the case, but few clues have been uncovered. Family and friends continue to post almost daily on the Facebook page 'Help Find Bianca Carrasco.'

CHARLENE VOIGHT Charlene Voight Charlene Voight, 36, had just moved to Littleton, Colorado from her family's home in Southern California when she disappeared. The move, in part, was so she could finally be with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jeff Beir. The \"always happy\" blonde had just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in Landscape Architecture, and she was excited to start a new career. After not hearing from their daughter for several days, which was extremely unusual, Charlene's parents reported her missing on July 8, 2016. A few weeks after Charlene vanished, her boyfriend Beir was arrested on unrelated charges of sexual assault involving another woman. Several weeks ago, authorities began conducting a search of a landfill north of Denver in connection with the case. It's unclear what evidence, if any, was recovered. If you have any information regarding Charlene's case, please call the Littleton Police Department at (303) 794-1551.

In late October, authorities announced that two Fort Campbell soldiers were being held as persons of interest in Shadow's disappearance. It was also uncovered that Shadow's ex-husband, Jamal McCray Williams, was booked into the Montgomery County Jail on an out-of-state warrant. It's unclear if he is one of the persons of interest in connection with the case.

When she called back 15 minutes later to ask him another question, his phone was off. After no one else was able to get ahold of him, and he didn't return to the family home in Raytown, Missouri, family members reported him missing. Several days later, a woman called saying she saw Brandon sitting on the steps of the Park Meadows Apartment complex in Kansas City. Family members went to the complex, where they say they found several shell casings and a shot in window. It's unclear if the scene there is connected in any way to Brandon's disappearance.

By Craig Whitlock and Bob Woodward December 5 at 6:47 PM Follow @craigmwhitlock Follow @realbobwoodward The Pentagon has buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste, according to findings by The Washington Post. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The Pentagon has buried an internal study that exposed $125\u00a0billion in administrative waste in its business operations amid fears Congress would use the findings as an excuse to slash the defense budget, according to interviews and confidential memos obtained by The Washington Post. Pentagon leaders had requested the study to help make their enormous back-office bureaucracy more efficient and reinvest any savings in combat power. But after the project documented far more wasteful spending than expected, senior defense officials moved swiftly to kill it by discrediting and suppressing the results. The report , issued in January 2015, identified \u201ca clear path\u201d for the Defense Department to save $125\u00a0billion over five years. The plan would not have required layoffs of civil servants or reductions in military personnel. Instead, it would have streamlined the bureaucracy through attrition and early retirements, curtailed high-priced contractors and made better use of information technology. The study was produced last year by the Defense Business Board, a federal advisory panel of corporate executives, and consultants from McKinsey and Company. Based on reams of personnel and cost data, their report revealed for the first time that the Pentagon was spending almost a quarter of its $580\u00a0billion budget on overhead and core business operations such as accounting, human resources, logistics and property management. [ The Defense Business Board\u2019s 2015 study on how the Pentagon could save $125 billion ] The data showed that the Defense Department was paying a staggering number of people \u2014 1,014,000 contractors, civilians and uniformed personnel \u2014 to fill back-office jobs far from the front lines. That workforce supports 1.3\u00a0million troops on active duty, the fewest since 1940. The cost-cutting study could find a receptive audience with President-elect Donald Trump. He has promised a major military buildup and said he would pay for it by \u201celiminating government waste and budget gimmicks.\u201d Robert \u201cBobby\u201d L. Stein, former chairman of the Defense Business Board. He serves as managing director of Chartwell Capital Management and president of the Regency Group. (Thomas Hager/Courtesy of Chartwell Capital Management) For the military, the major allure of the study was that it called for reallocating the $125\u00a0billion for troops and weapons. Among other options, the savings could have paid a large portion of the bill to rebuild the nation\u2019s aging nuclear arsenal, or the operating expenses for 50 Army brigades. But some Pentagon leaders said they fretted that by spotlighting so much waste, the study would undermine their repeated public assertions that years of budget austerity had left the armed forces starved of funds. Instead of providing more money, they said, they worried Congress and the White House might decide to cut deeper. So the plan was killed. The Pentagon imposed secrecy restrictions on the data making up the study, which ensured no one could replicate the findings. A 77-page summary report that had been made public was removed from a Pentagon website . \u201cThey\u2019re all complaining that they don\u2019t have any money. We proposed a way to save a ton of money,\u201d said Robert \u201cBobby\u201d L. Stein, a private-equity investor from Jacksonville, Fla., who served as chairman of the Defense Business Board. Stein, a campaign bundler for President Obama, said the study\u2019s data were \u201cindisputable\u201d and that it was \u201ca travesty\u201d for the Pentagon to suppress the results. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in peril because we\u2019re spending dollars like it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he added. The missed opportunity to streamline the military bureaucracy could soon have large ramifications. Under the 2011 Budget Control Act, the Pentagon will be forced to stomach $113\u00a0billion in automatic cuts over four years unless Congress and Trump can agree on a long-term spending deal by October. Playing a key role in negotiations will probably be Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis. The Defense Business Board was ordered to conduct the study by Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work, the Pentagon\u2019s second-highest-ranking official. At first, Work publicly touted the efficiency drive as a top priority and boasted about his idea to recruit corporate experts to lead the way. After the board finished its analysis, however, Work changed his position. In an interview with The Post, he did not dispute the board\u2019s findings about the size or scope of the bureaucracy. But he dismissed the $125\u00a0billion savings proposal as \u201cunrealistic\u201d and said the business executives had failed to grasp basic obstacles to restructuring the public sector. \u201cThere is this meme that we\u2019re some bloated, giant organization,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough there is a little bit of truth in that . . . I think it vastly overstates what\u2019s really going on.\u201d Work said the board fundamentally misunderstood how difficult it is to eliminate federal civil service jobs \u2014 members of Congress, he added, love having them in their districts \u2014 or to renegotiate defense contracts. He said the Pentagon is adopting some of the study\u2019s recommendations on a smaller scale and estimated it will save $30\u00a0billion by 2020. Many of the programs he cited, however, have been on the drawing board for years or were unrelated to the Defense Business Board\u2019s research. Work acknowledged that the push to improve business operations lost steam after then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was replaced by Ashton B. Carter in February 2015. Carter has emphasized other goals, such as strengthening the Pentagon\u2019s partnerships with high-tech firms. \u201cWe will never be as efficient as a commercial organization,\u201d Work said. \u201cWe\u2019re the largest bureaucracy in the world. There\u2019s going to be some inherent inefficiencies in that.\u201d \u2018Dark matter\u2019 Work, a retired Marine officer, became deputy defense secretary in May 2014. With the military budget under the most pressure since the end of the Cold War, he sought help from the Defense Business Board, an advisory panel known for producing management studies that usually gathered dust. Work told the board that the outcome of this assignment would be different. In a memo, he directed the board to collect sensitive cost data from the military services and defense agencies that would reveal how much they spent on business operations. Pentagon officials knew their back-office bureaucracy was overstaffed and overfunded. But nobody had ever gathered and analyzed such a comprehensive set of data before. Some Defense Business Board members warned that exposing the extent of the problem could have unforeseen consequences. \u201cYou are about to turn on the light in a very dark room,\u201d Kenneth Klepper, the former chief executive of Medco Health Solutions, told Work in the summer of 2014, according to two people familiar with the exchange. \u201cAll the crap is going to float to the surface and stink the place up.\u201d \u201cDo it,\u201d Work replied. To turn on the light, the Pentagon needed more outside expertise. A team of consultants from McKinsey was hired. In a confidential August 2014 memo, McKinsey noted that while the Defense Department was \u201cthe world\u2019s largest corporate enterprise,\u201d it had never \u201crigorously measured\u201d the \u201ccost-effectiveness, speed, agility or quality\u201d of its business operations. Nor did the Pentagon have even a remotely accurate idea of what it was paying for those operations, which McKinsey divided into five categories: human resources; health-care management; supply chain and logistics; acquisition and procurement; and financial-flow management. McKinsey hazarded a guess: anywhere between $75\u00a0billion and $100\u00a0billion a year, or between 15 and 20\u00a0percent of the Pentagon\u2019s annual expenses. \u201cNo one REALLY knows,\u201d the memo added. The mission would be to analyze, for the first time, dozens of databases that tracked civilian and military personnel, and labor costs for defense contractors. The problem was that the databases were in the grip of the armed forces and a multitude of defense agencies. Many had fought to hide the data from outsiders and bureaucratic rivals, according to documents and interviews. Information on contractor labor, in particular, was so cloaked in mystery that McKinsey described it as \u201cdark matter.\u201d Prying it loose would require direct orders from Work. Even then, McKinsey consultants predicted the bureaucracy would resist. \u201cThis is a sensitive exercise conducted with audiences both \u2018weary\u2019 and \u2018wary\u2019 of efficiency, cost, sequestration and budget drills,\u201d the confidential memo stated. \u201cElements of the culture are masterful at \u2018waiting out studies and sponsors,\u2019 with a \u2018this too shall pass\u2019 mindset.\u201d Overstaffed chow hall From the outset, access to the data was limited to a handful of people. A $2.9\u00a0million consulting contract signed by the Pentagon stipulated that none of the data or analysis could be released to the news media or the public. Moreover, the contract required McKinsey to report to David Tillotson III, the Pentagon\u2019s acting deputy chief management officer. Anytime the Defense Business Board wanted the consultants to carry out a task, Tillotson would have to approve. His office \u2014 not the board \u2014 would maintain custody of the data. \u201cGood news!\u201d Work emailed Tillotson once the contract was signed. \u201cTime to cook.\u201d In an Oct.\u00a015, 2014, memo, Work ordered the board to move quickly, giving it three months to produce \u201cspecific and actionable recommendations.\u201d In a speech the next month, Work lauded the board for its private-sector expertise. He said he had turned it into \u201can operational arm\u201d of the Pentagon leadership and predicted the study would deliver transformational results. In an aside, he revealed that early findings had determined the average administrative job at the Pentagon was costing taxpayers more than $200,000, including salary and benefits. \u201cAnd you say, hmmm, we could probably do better than that,\u201d he said. The initial results did not come as a surprise. Former defense secretaries William S. Cohen, Robert M. Gates and Chuck Hagel had launched similar efficiency drives in 1997, 2010 and 2013, respectively. But each of the leaders left the Pentagon before their revisions could take root. \u201cBecause we turn over our secretaries and deputy secretaries so often, the bureaucracy just waits things out,\u201d said Dov Zakheim, who served as Pentagon comptroller under President George W. Bush. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it at the tail end of an administration. It\u2019s not going to work. Either you leave the starting block with a very clear program, or you\u2019re not going to get it done.\u201d Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine general and former staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, said lawmakers block even modest attempts to downsize the Pentagon\u2019s workforce because they do not want to lose jobs in their districts. Without backing from Congress, \u201cyou can\u2019t even get rid of the guy serving butter in the chow hall in a local district, much less tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d he said. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work, the Pentagon\u2019s second-highest-ranking official, ordered the Defense Business Board to conduct the study. (Kate Patterson/for The Washington Post) \u2018Time to hunt!\u2019 The Defense Business Board assigned five members to conduct the study alongside consultants from McKinsey. Scott Rutherford, senior partner at McKinsey\u2019s Washington office, declined to comment. The team ran into resistance as several Pentagon offices delayed requests for data, according to emails and memos. Work and Tillotson had to intervene to get the data flowing. At one point, more than 100 people were feeding data from different sectors of the bureaucracy. Laboring under its tight deadline, the team hashed out an agreement with Pentagon officials over which job classifications to count in their survey. The board added a sixth category of business operations \u2014 real property management. That alone covered 192,000 jobs and annual expenses of $22.6\u00a0billion. On Christmas Eve, Klepper emailed Work and Tillotson to thank them for putting their muscle behind the project. Without it, he said, \u201cthis would all have been DOA and the naysayers would all have been right.\u201d He hinted the board would make some eye-catching recommendations and expressed relief its work had not been torpedoed. \u201cI have to admit, with all the caution, negative reaction and pushback,\u201d Klepper said, \u201cI had a bit of concern at the end of the analysis some form of censorship would stop us from showing the true opportunity.\u201d Work replied that he could not be happier. \u201cTime to hunt!\u201d he said in an email, adding that he was \u201cvery excited about 2015\u201d and ready to make \u201csome bold moves.\u201d The year kicked off with promise. On Jan.\u00a021, 2015, the Pentagon announced Stein, the private-equity investor, had been reappointed as the board\u2019s chairman and praised him for his \u201coutstanding service.\u201d The next day, the full board held its quarterly public meeting to review the results of the study. The report had a dry title, \u201cTransforming DoD\u2019s Core Business Processes for Revolutionary Change,\u201d and was packed with charts and jargon. But it began plainly enough. \u201cWe are spending a lot more money than we thought,\u201d the report stated. It then broke down how the Defense Department was spending $134\u00a0billion a year on business operations \u2014 about 50\u00a0percent more than McKinsey had guessed at the outset. Almost half of the Pentagon\u2019s back-office personnel \u2014 457,000 full-time employees \u2014 were assigned to logistics or supply-chain jobs. That alone exceeded the size of United Parcel Service\u2019s global workforce. The Pentagon\u2019s purchasing bureaucracy counted 207,000 full-time workers. By itself, that would rank among the top\u00a030 private employers in the United States. More than 192,000 people worked in property management. About 84,000 people held human-resources jobs. The study laid out a range of options. At the low end, just by renegotiating service contracts and hiring less-expensive workers, the Pentagon could save $75\u00a0billion over five years. At the high end, by adopting more aggressive productivity targets, it could save twice as much. After a discussion, the full board voted to recommend a middle option: to save $125\u00a0billion over five years. Hordes of contractors Afterward, board members briefed Work. They were expecting an enthusiastic response, but the deputy defense secretary looked uneasy, according to two people who were present. He singled out a page in the report. Titled \u201cWarfighter Currency,\u201d it showed how saving $125\u00a0billion could be redirected to boost combat power. The money could cover the operational costs for 50 Army brigades, or 3,000 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters for the Air Force, or 10 aircraft-carrier strike groups for the Navy. \u201cThis is what scares me,\u201d he said, according to the two people present. Work explained he was worried Congress might see it as an invitation to strip $125\u00a0billion from the defense budget and spend it somewhere else. A few weeks later, Carter replaced Hagel as defense secretary. Carter sounded as though he would welcome the kind of revolutionary change the board was urging. \u201cTo win support from our fellow citizens for the resources we need, we must show that we can make better use of every taxpayer dollar,\u201d Carter said in an inaugural message in February 2015. \u201cThat means a leaner organization, less overhead, and reforming our business and acquisition practices.\u201d In briefings that month, uniformed military leaders were receptive at first. They had long groused that the Pentagon wasted money on a layer of defense bureaucracies \u2014 known as the Fourth Estate \u2014 that were outside the control of the Army, Air Force and Navy. Military officials often felt those agencies performed duplicative services and oversight. But the McKinsey consultants had also collected data that exposed how the military services themselves were spending princely sums to hire hordes of defense contractors. For example, the Army employed 199,661 full-time contractors, according to a confidential McKinsey report obtained by The Post. That alone exceeded the combined civil workforce for the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development. The average cost to the Army for each contractor that year: $189,188, including salary, benefits and other expenses. The Navy was not much better. It had 197,093 contractors on its payroll. On average, each cost $170,865. In comparison, the Air Force had 122,470 contractors. Each cost, on average, $186,142. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has emphasized goals such as strengthening the Pentagon\u2019s partnerships with high-tech firms. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) Taking fire Meantime, the backlash to the $125\u00a0billion savings plan intensified. On Feb.\u00a06, 2015, board members briefed Frank Kendall III, the Pentagon\u2019s chief weapons-buyer. Kendall\u2019s operations were a major target of the study; he oversaw an empire of purchasing agents and contractors that were constantly under attack from Congress for cost overruns and delays. Kendall put up a stiff fight. He challenged the board\u2019s data and strenuously objected to the conclusion that his offices were overstaffed. \u201cAre you trying to tell me we don\u2019t know how to do our job?\u201d he said, according to two participants in the meeting. He said he needed to hire 1,000 more people to work directly under him, not fewer. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, call in an auditor,\u201d replied Klepper, the board\u2019s restructuring expert. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s even worse than this.\u201d In an interview, Kendall acknowledged he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the board\u2019s work, which he criticized as \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cvery low on content.\u201d He said the study had ignored efforts by his agencies to become more efficient, and he accused the board of plucking the $125\u00a0billion figure out of thin air. \u201cIt was essentially a ballpark, made-up number,\u201d he said. Still, Kendall knew that lawmakers might view the study as credible. Alarmed, he said, he went to Work and warned that the findings could \u201cbe used as a weapon\u201d against the Pentagon. \u201cIf the impression that\u2019s created is that we\u2019ve got a bunch of money lying around and we\u2019re being lazy and we\u2019re not doing anything to save money, then it\u2019s harder to justify getting budgets that we need,\u201d Kendall said. More ominously, board members said they started to get the silent treatment from the Pentagon\u2019s highest ranks. Briefings that had been scheduled for military leaders in the Tank \u2014 the secure conference room for the Joint Chiefs of Staff \u2014 were canceled. Worse, the board was unable to secure an audience with Carter, the new defense secretary. Stein, the board chairman, accused Carter of deliberately derailing the plan through inaction. \u201cUnfortunately, Ash \u2014 for reasons of his own \u2014 stopped this,\u201d he said in an interview. Peter Cook, a spokesman for Carter, said the Pentagon chief was busy dealing with \u201ca long list of national security challenges.\u201d He added that Work and other senior officials had already \u201cconcluded that the report, while well-intentioned, had limited value.\u201d The fatal blow was struck in April. Just three months after Stein had been reappointed as board chairman, Carter replaced him with Michael Bayer, a business consultant who had previously served on the panel and clashed with Stein. Bayer declined to comment. A few weeks later, Klepper resigned from the board. The $125\u00a0billion savings plan was dead. In an interview, Tillotson, the Pentagon\u2019s acting deputy chief management officer, called the board\u2019s recommendations too ambitious and aggressive. \u201cThey, perhaps, underestimated the degree of difficulty we have in doing something that in the commercial sector would seem to be very easy to do.\u201d Yet he acknowledged that its overall strategy for scaling back the bureaucracy was sound and that, given more time, it would be possible to realize huge savings. \u201cIf we had a longer timeline, yes, it would be a reasonable approach,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might get there eventually.\u201d Ending the debate Frustration, however, persisted in some corners over the Pentagon\u2019s unwillingness to tackle the inefficiency and waste documented by the study. On June\u00a02, 2015, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus delivered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. He complained that 20\u00a0percent of the defense budget went to the Fourth Estate \u2014 the defense agencies that provide support to the armed forces \u2014 and called it \u201cpure overhead.\u201d Navy Secretary Ray Mabus takes his seat to testify to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2016. (Kevin Lamarque /Reuters) He singled out the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Defense Logistics Agency, which together employ about 40,000 people, as egregious examples. When a reporter in the audience asked whether he thought the agencies should be abolished, Mabus resisted the temptation to say yes. \u201cNice try on getting me into deep trouble,\u201d he replied. But trouble arrived in Mabus\u2019s email the next day. \u201cRay, before you publicly trash one of the agencies that reports through me I\u2019d really appreciate a chance to discuss it with you,\u201d wrote Kendall, the Pentagon\u2019s chief weapons-buyer, whose management portfolio included the Defense Logistics Agency. He said that if Mabus had a complaint, he should raise it directly with their mutual bosses, Carter and Work, and copied the email to both. In his interview with The Post, Kendall said he was \u201ccompletely blindsided\u201d by the Navy secretary\u2019s criticism, \u201cso I sent him what I thought under the circumstances was a pretty polite note.\u201d [ Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work\u2019s response to The Washington Post ] Mabus did not back down. In an emailed retort to Kendall, he referred to the ill-fated Defense Business Board study. \u201cI did not say anything yesterday that I have not said both publicly . . . and privately inside this building,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been numerous studies, which I am sure you are aware of, pointing out excessive overhead.\u201d That prompted a stern intervention from Work. \u201cRay, please refrain from taking any more public pot shots,\u201d Work said in an email. \u201cI do not want this spilling over into further public discourse.\u201d Evelyn Duffy contributed to this report. investigations Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

A jury in Georgia found a father guilty in the 2014 murder of his son. The 22-month-old was locked in a hot car for seven hours and later died. C... A Georgia judge also sentenced Justin Ross Harris to an additional 32 years in prison, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Harris showed no emotion as the sentence was handed down. His lawyer said he plans on filing a notice of appeal within 30 days.\u00a0 Harris was found guilty of malice murder last month after he left his son Cooper in an SUV on June 18, 2014. Harris left his son strapped into his car seat in the back while Harris went to work as temperatures soared. The boy was dead when his father pulled him from the vehicle more than seven hours later.\u00a0 He told police he took Cooper to breakfast that morning and then drove straight to work, forgetting to take the child to day care. In November, Harris was found guilty of eight counts including malice murder, felony murder, cruelty to children, criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful material to minors.\u00a0 Justin Harris with his son, Cooper CBS Atlanta Jurors heard from a total of 70 witnesses, 52 of whom testified for the prosecution,\u00a0 reported CBS affiliate WGCL. Harris\u2019 defense attorney argued in November that his client was\u00a0 \u201cclueless\u201d and forgetful. \u00a0But a prosecutor called Harris a murderer with a \u201cmalignant heart,\u201d who killed his child to escape his family commitments as he sank deeper into a double life of sexual flirting and affairs with women he met online. Investigators found evidence that Harris was engaging in online flirting and in-person affairs with numerous women other than his wife, including a prostitute and an underage teenager.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of an adult hating his child,\u201d prosecutor Chuck Boring told jurors during closing arguments. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he loved himself and his other obsessions more than that little boy.\u201d Harris also was found guilty of sending sexual text messages to a teenage girl and sending her nude photos.\u00a0 WATCH: Justin Ross Harris sentencing in death of 22 month-old son Cooper. MORE: http://bit.ly/Z8TwCJ Posted by CBS46 on Monday, December 5, 2016 Because the case had received an enormous amount of local and national media coverage, Superior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark decided after nearly three weeks of jury selection in April that pretrial publicity had made it too difficult to find a fair jury in Cobb County, where the boy died, and granted a defense request to relocate the trial. A jury in Glynn County, located on the Georgia coast about 60 miles south of Savannah, spent about a month listening to evidence in the case and deliberated for four days before finding Harris guilty of all eight counts against him. In addition to malice murder and felony murder charges, Harris also was found guilty of sending sexual text messages to a teenage girl and sending her nude photos. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Rachael Madison, 44, was reported missing by Thelma Newsom, her aunt, on after she didn\u2019t come home from a jog. Her family said Madison came to Ormond Beach, Florida from Indiana just before Thanksgiving to get away from her allegedly abusive husband. Investigators say the husband, 58-year-old Jarvis Madison, called his wife\u2019s relatives inquiring about her whereabouts and had threatened to kill her aunt for hiding her. Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s deputies told local news outlets earlier this week they were concerned for her well-being because of past incidents of violence. Jarvis Madison was taken into custody Friday morning in Kentucky, and he allegedly gave police information leading investigators to a remote area near Knoxville, Tennessee, where Rachael\u2019s remains were found Friday evening, FBI Public affairs specialist Amanda Warford Videll said.

WZZM Election workers prepare for a recount of presidential votes in Oakland County, Mich., on Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. (Photo: Kathleen Gray, Detroit Free Press) WATERFORD, Mich.\u00a0\u2014 The Michigan presidential recount began Monday in two counties, hours after a federal judge ordered a recount to begin at noon Monday. \"Welcome to today's recount,\" was the deceptively simple proclamation from Oakland County's election director Joe Rozell. Ingham County also began recounting ballots. The counties are tasked with recounting nearly 4.8 million ballots, including 668,925 ballots in Oakland, cast for president in Michigan. Wayne and Macomb counties will begin their recounts Tuesday morning. It's a process that began a week ago when the state Board of Canvassers certified the results of the Nov. 8 election, which showed that Republican Donald Trump won the state with a 10,704-vote margin over Democrat Hillary Clinton. While each candidate received more than 2.2 million votes each in Michigan, Green Party candidate Jill Stein finished a distant fourth with 51,463 votes. But even with that small margin, Stein asked for a recount of Michigan's vote: not because the results are likely to change, her campaign said, but to ensure that the votes were counted accurately and ultimately ensure the integrity of the election. Emergency hearing on Mich. recount ends: Decision pending Sitting in a sprawling conference room at the Oakland County Intermediate School District, several hundred people working as counters, observers and challengers watched a 17-minute training video. Fueled by pizza and caffeine and paid $150 a day, the recount teams methodically removed stacks and stacks of ballots from ballot containers and separated them into seven piles\u00a0\u2014 one each for Trump, Clinton, Libertarian Gary Johnson, Stein, Natural Law candidate Emidio Soltysik, U.S. Taxpayers candidate Darrell Castle and \"Other\" for all the ballots where a candidate was written in. Once the separation is done, the votes from each precinct will be tallied and compared to the Nov. 8 Election Day totals. It's a process that is expected to last for the next several weeks\u00a0\u2014 seven days a week\u00a0\u2014 in counties across Michigan. John Pirich, one of the attorneys for Trump said he came to the first day of counting to see the \u201cHerculean task\u201d in person. \u201cLook around you, we\u2019ve got 300 to 400 people. There\u2019s noise everywhere and chaos in the sense that mistakes are going to be made and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to make sure doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very daunting process.\u201d U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith's decision for the recount to proceed came after Goldsmith held a rare Sunday hearing in federal court. It lasted three hours, and Goldsmith issued a written opinion just after midnight Monday morning. Goldsmith said a state law requiring a two-business-day waiting period to start the recount probably violates voting rights. Stein has shown \"a credible threat that the recount, if delayed, would not be completed\" by Dec. 13 \u2014 the federal \"safe harbor\" deadline to guarantee Michigan's electoral votes are counted when the electoral college meets Dec. 19. In this Oct. 6, 2016, file photo, Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein meets her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. A federal judge early on the morning of Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, ordered a recount of Michigan's presidential ballots to begin that day at noon. \u00a0(Photo: D. Ross Cameron, AP) \"With the perceived integrity of the presidential election as it was conducted in Michigan at stake, concerns with cost pale in comparison,\" Goldsmith said in his opinion. In ordering the recount to begin at noon Monday, rather than Wednesday morning under the two-day waiting period the state planned to observe, Goldsmith ordered the recount, once started, \"must continue until further order of this court.\" Ronna Romney McDaniel, chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, who attended Sunday's court hearing, said in a release Monday morning she is \"outraged that Jill Stein is trying to use the courts to change the outcome of the Michigan election\" after \"all votes were counted and certified by the Board of Canvassers.\" She said \"this recount is an incredible waste of Michigan taxpayers' money,\" and \"we will vigorously pursue any and all options available to us to overturn this ruling and to end this recount.\" \u201cWith the perceived integrity of the presidential election as it was conducted in Michigan at stake, concerns with cost pale in comparison.\u201d U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in opinion Any appeal would go to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Gisgie Gendreau, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Secretary of State, said Monday officials were \"reviewing the order,\" and did not yet have any details to announce. Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Schuettte, said his office also was reviewing the ruling. Mark Brewer, an attorney representing Stein, said \"this is a victory for the voters of Michigan.\" Over the weekend, Stein filed court papers to intervene in Schuette's state court action to block the recount, and she also will be intervening in a similar state court case brought by Trump, Brewer said. Brewer wouldn't \"speculate\" on how Goldsmith's order, which said the recount must continue until Goldsmith orders otherwise, impacts the state court cases. Stein filed suit against state election officials in federal court in Detroit late Friday to expedite the recount, the latest in a slew of lawsuits over her request for a recount of Michigan's presidential election vote. Stein is seeking recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 three battleground states that have voted Democratic in recent elections but shifted to Republican in 2016. If recounts resulted in all three states flipping to Democrat Hillary Clinton from President-elect Donald Trump, Clinton would win the presidency. Jill Stein to take Pennsylvania recount to federal courts Goldsmith, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama in 2010, agreed. \"The fundamental right invoked by plaintiffs \u2014 the right to vote, and to have that vote conducted fairly and counted accurately \u2014 is the bedrock of our nation,\" he said in his opinion. On Friday, the Michigan Board of Canvassers deadlocked at 2-2 on Trump's objection to Stein's recount request, which allowed the recount of about 4.8 million ballots to proceed. But under Michigan law, state officials must wait two business days after hearing objections to a recount petition before they can start counting. That is to allow for court review of how the Board of Canvassers ruled on the objection to the recount request. A two-business day wait from Friday means the recount would start late Tuesday at the earliest, and more likely, Wednesday morning. Stein's attorneys argued that would jeopardize chances to meet a federal requirement that electors be certified Dec. 13, six days prior to the electoral college meeting Dec. 19. Federal judge denies quick halt to Wisconsin recount In his opinion, Goldsmith agreed that if the recount did not start until Wednesday, the chances of completion by Dec. 13 were in doubt. A similar election recount effort is now headed to federal court in Pennsylvania, where Stein's campaign is pushing for a statewide recount of votes in the presidential election on constitutional grounds. The campaign is seeking legal intervention from the federal courts after dropping its case in Pennsylvania's state courts, arguing the state courts are ill-equipped to handle the issue. \u201cWe are committed to this fight to protect the civil and voting rights of all Americans,\u201d Jonathan Abady, lead counsel for the Stein recount campaign, said in a statement. \u201cOver the past several days, it has become clear that the barriers to verifying the vote in Pennsylvania are so pervasive and that the state court system is so ill-equipped to address this problem that we must seek federal court intervention.\u201d Contributing: Paul Egan and Tresa Baldas\u200b, Detroit Free Press;\u00a0The Associated Press.

A statement described Carson as a \"distinguished national leader who overcame his troubled youth in the inner city of Detroit to become a renowned neurosurgeon.\" Ben Carson MIKE BLAKE / Reuters In the announcement, Trump said he was \"thrilled\" to nominate Carson, who dropped out of the campaign race in March after a string of disappointing primary finishes on Super Tuesday. \"Ben Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities,\" Trump said. \"We have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities. Ben shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a Presidency representing all Americans. He is a tough competitor and never gives up.\" Carson and Trump had a contentious relationship during the heated Republican primary as the two battled at the top of the polls in the fall of 2015. Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what I do. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2015 The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2015 Trump leveled some of his harshest critiques of the campaign against Carson, calling him \"pathological\" in the same way as a child molester . Trump also used Carson's self-described anger management problems in his youth as a knock against him on the campaign trail. \"Think about what Carson is saying: he hit his mother over the head with a hammer, he hit a friend in the face with a lock, he tried to kill somebody with a knife,\" Trump said in Fox News interview in November 2015. Carson mostly ignored Trump's offensive and, after ending his campaign, endorsed him. \"There are two different Donald Trumps,\" Carson said at the March press conference. \"There's the one you see on the stage, and there's the one who's very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully.\" The former neurosurgeon became one of Trump's most prominent surrogates at a time when few other Republicans were publicly backing him and became a vice chairman of Trump's transition team. Carson's background in medicine led to speculation he could be tapped as the secretary of health and human services, though aides close to the retired pediatric neurosurgeon knocked down the rumors by claiming he doesn't have the experience to run a federal bureaucracy -- despite running for president. Carson had a change of heart, though, and said last month that he had been offered and was considering the HUD job. It him well over a week, though, before his nomination was officially announced. Related: China Chases Silicon Valley With Trump Fears Last week, Trump announced that he planned to nominate former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as his Treasury secretary and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department. He chose Betsy DeVos to be secretary of education and Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, to be transportation secretary. Trump also has turned to retired general James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis to be secretary of defense. Play ",

The Bexar County Sheriff's Office identified the dead officer on Monday as seven-year veteran Dora Linda (Solis) Nishihara. Deputy Dora Linda (Solis) Nishihara was killed when her car fell into a sinkhole on Dec. 4. Bexar County Sheriff An unidentified man in the second vehicle was rescued by a civilian and transported to a local hospital with minor injuries, San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said during a news conference. The incident occurred on a two-lane road in a section of southwest San Antonio. In a statement, fire department spokesman Joe Arrington said crews responded to a water rescue shortly after 7:30 p.m. What they found, Arrington said, was a broken 54-inch pipe and a pit measuring 10- to 20-feet deep that stretched the entire width of the road. Robert Puente, president of San Antonio Water System, told reporters Monday that the pipe was near two construction projects \u2014 one that was completed last year and one that was still underway. Puente said it was unclear what caused the pipe to rupture. A sink hole in San Antonio killed a Bexar County sheriff's deputy on Sunday. San Antonio Fire Department \"The pit is full of sewer water,\" he added. \"Until we find an opportunity to look inside will we know what happened.\" Hood said Nishihara's vehicle was 90 percent submerged and he didn't know how long she had been in the water. But, he added: \"There was no way [she was] going to survive. The car was upside down.\" Tim Stelloh ",

Related: Lone Juror Says He Can't Convict in Slager Trial Prosecutors argued Slager was planting a taser near Scott's dead body. That was an important claim, as it could suggest Slager was knowingly trying to stage a fight that did not occur, to justify force that he knew was excessive at the time. The prosecution raised the issue in opening and closing arguments, accusing Slager of staging a crime scene. \"His first instinct, after those shots were fired and he cuffs a dead Walter Scott, was to stage, was to stage the scene,\" prosecutor Wilson told the jury. Judy Scott, center, Walter Scott's mother, is comforted by her son Rodney Scott, as the family attorneys, Chris Stewart, left, and Justin Bamberg, right, hold a press conference after the mistrial was declared for the Michael Slager trial Monday Mic Smith / AP In her closing arguments, Wilson noted that Slager never rolled over Scott's body to find the Taser because he knew where to find it. She emphasized to the jury that Slager \"knows that Taser is a problem for him.\" Slager personally denied the accusation when he took the stand. \"I must have dropped it by Mr. Scott's body. I don't remember doing that,\" Slager testified. He also said on the stand that a lot of what happened is \"fuzzy\" in his memory, but he insisted he only acted out of a necessity to defend himself. Related: Jury in Walter Scott Trial Can Consider Lesser Charge While the jury may have been close to a conviction, some experts say if a jury won't convict an officer in the face of this video evidence, it seems virtually impossible to convict officers for anything done in the line of duty. \"It seems that juries are very reluctant to second guess on duty police officers in split second life or death decisions involving deadly force,\" said Professor Stinson, who studies these cases.

Aside from his focus on immigration and the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump spent little time on the campaign trail detailing a specific policy agenda. But many of his nominees have spent their careers advocating positions that will now become the focus of examination during their confirmation hearings. Taken together, they suggest an administration determined to alter course on immigration, abortion, housing laws, the environment, worker protections and privatization of federal functions. \u201cWe will learn a lot more during the hearings,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cCertainly, I think it\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve seen in the last eight years.\u201d Photo Andrew Puzder, a wealthy California donor to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, is said to be a leading candidate to be his nominee for labor secretary. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Mr. Trump\u2019s personnel decisions for prominent national security jobs \u2014 attorney general , defense secretary , national security adviser , C.I.A. director \u2014 have already begun to more firmly establish the contours of his approach to foreign policy, even as he struggles to settle on someone to be the nation\u2019s top diplomat as secretary of state. On the domestic front, announcements of several cabinet posts are helping to define the new president\u2019s approach to issues at home. His choices so far suggest a more conservative approach to many domestic issues than Mr. Trump himself articulated during the campaign. This week, Mr. Trump is expected to fill a series of positions that will accelerate the U-turn from current policies. He is said to be seriously considering Mary Fallin, Oklahoma\u2019s Republican governor, for interior secretary, which would presage a shift away from the department\u2019s current approach toward energy and public lands. Mr. Obama has aggressively sought to shut down fossil fuel production and increase the use of renewable sources of energy, while Ms. Fallin is an outspoken proponent of drilling and fracking on public lands. She was the first governor to announce she would oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed rules on emissions from coal-fired power plants. Andrew F. Puzder, a wealthy California donor to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign whose company, CKE Restaurants, oversees chains such as Hardee\u2019s, is said to be a leading candidate for labor secretary.

USA TODAY Sports Bryce Harper ix eligible for free agency after the 2018 season. (Photo: Geoff Burke, Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports) NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. - The Washington Nationals, balking at Bryce Harper\u2019s demands in early talks about a long-term contract extension, now are preparing themselves to be without their All-Star outfielder after 2018, a high-ranking Nationals executive told USA TODAY Sports. The executive spoke to USA TODAY Sports on Monday only on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. Harper, according to the executive, is asking for a record deal that will exceed 10 years in length, and likely pay him in excess of $400 million. Agent Scott Boras says the only active negotiations of late have involved a one-year deal in 2017. Harper, who made $5 million last season, is eligible for salary arbitration, and Boras seemed mystified by the Nationals' stance. \"I have had no long-term discussions with the Nationals on Bryce,\" Boras said in a text message to USA TODAY Sports. \"No terms, no offers discussed. Only arbitration-year discussions.\" In a meeting with Washington-area reporters on Monday, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said he would not discuss private negotiations. Harper, just 24, is expected to be the centerpiece of a the star-studded free agent class of 2018 that includes Baltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado, Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones and closer Zach Britton, Pittsburgh Pirates center fielder Andrew McCutchen, New York Mets starter Matt Harvey, and potentially Cy Young winners Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers and David Price of the Boston Red Sox, who have opt-out clauses. Dodgers re-sign Rich Hill to three-year, $48 million deal The Nationals, who had begun preliminary negotiations this year to retain Harper beyond 2018, believe the chasm in their talks now have become too great to overcome. While no specific dollar amount has been broached by Boras, the executive says Harper is seeking a deal more than 10 years in length, believing it would exceed $400 million. The largest contract in baseball belongs to Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton, who signed a record 13-year, $325 million contract extension in 2014 that\u2019s heavily backloaded. It eclipsed the total amount of Alex Rodriguez\u2019s 10-year, $275 million contract with the New York Yankees in 2007, but pays an average salary of $2.5 million less a year than A-Rod\u2019s deal. Harper will be 26 when he hits the market, the same age as Rodriguez when A-Rod first became a free agent. In 2007, when Rodriguez opted out of a 10-year, $252 million contract, Boras negotiated a $275 million deal with the New York Yankees that took A-Rod past his 42nd birthday. Harper would require a 16-year contract - essentially a lifetime deal - to reach that age. Harper has 121 home runs through five major league seasons, and hit 42 as a 22-year-old in winning the 2015 NL MVP award. The Nationals finished last season with a $155.5 million payroll, and they have already committed $87.4 million in salaries in 2019 to starters Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, and infielder Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cThe Washington franchise has one of the most successful ownership groups on and off the field,\u201d Boras told USA TODAY Sports in spring training. \u201cThey certainly have the ability to conduct whatever form of business they see fit.\u201d The Nationals\u2019 refusal to currently meet Harper\u2019s request certainly explains why the Nationals plan to be one of baseball\u2019s most aggressive teams at the annual winter meetings. The Nationals not only are strongly pursuing McCutchen, but also Chicago White Sox ace Chris Sale, according to baseball officials familiar with their thinking. Report: Giants nearing deal with closer Mark Melancon They also have engaged in trade talks with the Tampa Bay Rays for center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, but consider the asking price exorbitant. The Nationals adamantly refuse to include center fielder/shortstop Trea Turner in any deal, but are willing to discuss most of their prized prospects, including pitcher Lucas Giolito, and believe that it\u2019s possible to actually acquire Sale and McCutchen. Giolito and Turner are among a group of five Nationals prospects who cracked Baseball America's midseason top 100 prospects list. While the Nationals are poised to be a perennial power under GM Mike Rizzo, they realize the window with Harper now is two years. The Nationals have won the NL East three times in the last five years, but have yet to win a postseason series since moving from Montreal after the 2004 season. The last World Series championship won in the District was 1924. The Nationals, if successful pulling off the trades for Sale and McCutchen, certainly would be the favorites to win the NL East again, and rival the World Series champion Chicago Cubs for the finest team in the National League. Can you imagine a rotation of Scherzer, Sale, Strasburg, Tanner Roark and perhaps Joe Ross? The Nats still are seeking a closer, too, and hope to sign free agent Aroldis Chapman or Kenley Jansen. If they manage to pull off the two deals and sign Chapman or Jansen, the Nationals would increase their payroll by $26 million alone for McCutchen and Sale in 2017, with a projected $20 million annual salary for either closer. The Nats may be willing to absorb the increased payroll now, particularly with Jayson Werth\u2019s $21 million salary coming off the books after the 2017 season, but unless Harper lowers his demands, they\u2019ll be planning a future without him. It\u2019s still early, of course. Anything can happen over the next two seasons. Yet, unless either side dramatically changes their stance in negotiations, you might as prepare Harper's next uniform now. He\u2019ll be a New York Yankee, and the Nats can thank him for the memories. GALLERY: Bryce Harper through the years Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

That was round one \u2014 we've got two more rounds to go,\" he said, adding that solicitor Scarlett Wilson planned to try the case again as soon as she could. Wilson released a statement later Monday, saying \"We will try Michael Slager again.\" The solicitor also stood in support of the Scott family, adding \"We are grateful for their patience, understanding and cooperation with us. They have not received the credit they deserve in their calm leadership for the community. The Scotts have been a sterling example of dignity and grace in extraordinary circumstances.\" Walter Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, called on the public to \"keep your head high\" and protest peacefully. He added that while he hoped to find peace he could not yet forgive Slager. \"In my heart I will find the peace to forgive Slager for doing that, but in this present time until my family can see justice, no, there's no forgiveness,\" he said. \"I think there was malice and forethought, I think it was murder,\" he added. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said in a statement Monday evening that \"It is my understanding that there will be, as quickly as possible, a new trial where the Scott family and all of South Carolina will hopefully receive the closure that a verdict brings.\" \"Justice is not always immediate, but we must all have faith that it will be served \u2014 I certainly do,\" she said. \"I urge South Carolinians \u2014 in Charleston and across our state \u2014 to continue along the path we have walked these last two years: a path of grace, faith, love and understanding.\" Former North Charleston, South Carolina, police Officer Michael Slager in court Friday in Charleston. Grace Beahm / AP The jury, which consisted of 11 white men and women and one black man, had remained undecided on Monday in the murder trial. The defense in ex-patrolman Michael Slager's the five-week trial claimed that he feared for his life when 50-year-old Walter Scott got control of the officer's stun gun and pointed it at him. Related: Prosecutor Will Retry Ohio Cop in Killing of Driver But Scott was shot five times in the back while running from Slager during a routine traffic stop. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police department after his confrontation with Scott led to Scott's death. Slager had been charged with murder in Scott's killing, although the jury was also allowed to consider a lesser verdict of manslaughter. He had faced 30 years to life in prison if convicted. Slager also faces trial next year in federal court on charges of violating civil rights laws, obstruction of justice and using a firearm while committing a act of violence. Play ",

WCNC Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton wears a black coat and hat as he talks with reporters during a post-game news conference after an NFL football game, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016, in Seattle. (Photo: Stephen Brashear, AP) One day after facing intense scrutiny for his unorthodox move, Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera said he remains satisfied with his decision to bench star quarterback Cam Newton for a dress code violation. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with it,\u201d Rivera said Monday afternoon during a press conference. \u201cBecause the truth of the matter is I have to treat everybody the same. I really do. And that\u2019s all that was. There\u2019s no underlying message. There\u2019s no feud. Because I\u2019ve done this before. It\u2019s just unfortunate that the guys that I\u2019ve done it before weren\u2019t the quarterback. \"I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a big deal. I think that\u2019s quite honestly why it\u2019s being made bigger than it really is. Because all I did was treat a player like I treat any other player.\u201d Cam Newton explains dress code violation that led to benching Rivera benched Newton for the opening series for failing to wear a collared shirt and neck tie for Carolina\u2019s flight to Seattle prior to facing the Seahawks. Newton, who wore a black turtleneck and jacket, said he did not have a dress shirt because the Panthers were on a long road trip after facing the Oakland Raiders the previous week. Backup Derek Anderson threw an interception on the first play from scrimmage, and the Seahawks eventually converted a field goal. The Panthers lost 40-7 to drop their record to 4-8. After the game, Newton said he stood by Rivera\u2019s decision. \u201cI feel I wore a similar outfit as this before and nothing was done, but [Rivera] says he has rules in place and we have to abide by them,\u201d Newton said late Sunday night. \u201cNo person is greater than the next person and, you know, it is what it is.\u201d 40 things we learned in Week 13 of the 2016 NFL season Rivera admitted that he knew the decision to bench Newton would prompt a \u201cfeeding frenzy,\u201d but stressed multiple times during his news conference that the team has moved on and is focused on next week\u2019s opponent, the San Diego Chargers. \u201cI\u2019ve had to address this issue before, and I treat everybody the same,\u201d Rivera said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time, and it probably won\u2019t be the last time. It\u2019s just the way it is. But at the end of the day, everybody gets treated the same. I\u2019ve addressed it. Cam addressed it as well, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re moving on.\u201d Rivera, however, answered with an emphatic \u201cno\u201d when asked if he was worried about losing the locker room.

    "text": "Fake US Embassy in Ghana Operated for 'About a Decade,' State Department Says By Elizabeth McLaughlin Dec 5, 2016, 3:56 PM ET 0 Shares Star U.S. State Department The exterior of the fake US embassy in Accra, Ghana, discovered by the U.S. State Department and shut down last summer. The illegitimate embassy was run by organized crime rings and was found to have 150 passports from 10 countries, as well as real and counterfeit visas from the US, according to the State Department. 0 Shares Email A fake U.S. embassy in the Ghanaian capital of Accra has been issuing counterfeit U.S. visas and false identification documents for about a decade, according to the U.S. State Department. A recent online story released by the State Department's Diplomatic Security public affairs office detailed how this fake embassy's long criminal history finally ended this past summer when the Regional Security Office, in co-operation with Ghanaian authorities, shut down the operation. The article began circulating widely over the weekend and a State Department official confirmed the report today. Department officials insist that -- to their knowledge -- no one who obtained a counterfeit visa was able to enter the U.S. The building that housed the fake embassy flew the American flag three days of the week and featured a photo of President Obama inside. Flyers and billboards in Ghana and neighboring Cote d'Ivoire and Togo advertised their fraudulent services for the cost of $6,000. An investigation found that the operation was run by Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings, as well as a Ghanaian attorney practicing immigration and criminal law. The State Department said Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch posed as \"consular officers.\" They paid off corrupt officials when suspicions arose over their illegal activities. Those corrupt officials also provided real bank documents so they could be altered by the criminals. U.S. State Department The exterior of the legitimate U.S. embassy in Accra, Ghana. Last summer, the US State Department shut down a fake U.S. embassy in Accra being run by organized crime rings. An informant tipped off the Regional Security Office that a fake U.S. embassy and a fake Netherlands embassy were operating in Accra. At the time, diplomatic security agents were looking into a separate fraud investigation under \"Operation Spartan Vanguard,\" which works to address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. embassy in Ghana and the region more broadly. \"The investigation identified the main architects of the criminal operation, and two satellite locations (a dress shop and an apartment building) used for operations,\" the State Department article said. \"The fake embassy did not accept walk-in visa appointments; instead, they drove to the most remote parts of West Africa to find customers. They would shuttle the customers to Accra, and rent them a room at a hotel nearby. The Ghanaian organized crime ring would shuttle the victims to and from the fake embassies. Locating the document vendor within the group led investigators to uncover the satellite locations and key players.\" A series of raids led to the arrest of several suspects and collected evidence that included a laptop, cell phones, 150 passports from 10 countries, legitimate and counterfeit visas, and counterfeit identity documents. The Ghanaian police plan to pursue the arrest of several other suspects still at large, including the Turkish organized crime group, according to the State Department article. U.S. State Department The exterior of the fake US embassy in Accra, Ghana, discovered by the U.S. State Department and shut down last summer. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said during today's news briefing that the department was not aware of anyone who attempted to use the counterfeit visas to gain entry into the U.S. Toner elaborated on how the criminals were able to produce fraudulent documents, saying they obtained a handful of real Ghanaian and foreign passports that were either lost, stolen or sold. Fewer than ten of those contained expired U.S. visas, which the criminals then used as models for counterfeit U.S. visas. \"The visas in question were not stolen from the U.S. embassy,\" he said. Toner emphasized the difficulty in producing counterfeit U.S. visas, calling them a \"highly secured document\" with numerous security features. As a result of the fake U.S. embassy raid in Accra, as well as other raids identified through Operation Spartan Vanguard, the export of fraudulent documents has decreased by 70 percent in West Africa, according to the State Department article. They views these types of operations as essential to stopping these criminal networks who produce passport and visa fraud, adding, \"This is only the beginning.\" 0 Shares ",

Deputy Nishihara worked as a Reserve Deputy from August 2009 to October 2016. pic.twitter.com/hvxBygZHBP \u2014 Bexar County Sheriff (@BexarCoSheriff) December 5, 2016 A crane was used to retrieve her personal car from water about 12-feet deep. Nishihara\u2019s body was inside the vehicle. Sheriff\u2019s spokesman James Keith says Nishihara was not working Sunday when her vehicle went into the sinkhole. Utility officials say the sinkhole appeared after a sewer line ruptured during heavy rain earlier Sunday. CBS San Antonio affiliate KENS-TV reports that occupants of a car passing by saw a man stranded in the sinkhole and stopped to help him. Firefighters said in the process of helping him, a woman was injured. By the time first responders were able to make it to the scene, they realized that Nishihara\u2019s vehicle was already 90 percent submerged in the waters, and it was not likely that she would have survived. A 100-ton crane was taken to the scene to remove both vehicles from the sinkhole Monday afternoon.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Trump Renews Defense of His Call With Taiwan Leader By jonathan lemire and gillian wong, associated press NEW YORK \u0097 Dec 5, 2016, 8:50 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH VP-elect Mike Pence Says Trump's Phone Call With Taiwan 'Just A Courtesy Call' 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is using Twitter to renew his defense of his engagement with the leader of Taiwan, a breach of diplomatic protocol as the U.S. shifted recognition from Taiwan to China nearly 40 years ago. In a series of Sunday evening tweets, Trump groused about criticism that he didn't work with China ahead of the contact. China considers Taiwan a rogue province. \"Did China ask us if it was OK to carry out a number of actions such as build up disputed islands in the South China Sea or take economic measures hurtful to the United States,\" Trump tweeted. The Taiwanese leader, Tsai Ing-Wen, called Trump Friday to congratulate him on the election in communication arranged by an American third party. Taiwan's official Central News Agency, citing anonymous sources on Saturday, said that Edwin Feulner, founder of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, was a \"crucial figure\" in setting up communication channels between the sides. The call prompted an understated complaint from China to the U.S. government. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday that the contact was \"just a small trick by Taiwan\" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV. \"The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,\" Wang was quoted as saying. Chinese officials said they lodged a complaint with the U.S. and reiterated a commitment to seeking \"reunification\" with the island, which they consider a renegade province. The call was the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily given by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy. \"President-elect Trump is just shooting from the hip, trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications,\" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Sunday that the phone call shouldn't necessarily be interpreted as a shift in U.S. policy. He shrugged off the attention to the incident as media hype. \"It was a courtesy call,\" Pence told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" But other Trump supporters suggested the move was calculated. \"I think it was a terrific message to them that we're no longer going to be pushovers, and there's going to be consequences for their hostile and aggressive actions,\" California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who says he is under consideration to become the next secretary of state, told Fox News on Monday. Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable. Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council , said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on cross-strait issues. Yet the phone conversation prompted mixed reactions. Douglas Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which unofficially represents U.S. interests in Taipei, said it was too soon to judge whether Trump was going to lead that shift, or if the incident was just a \"complicated accident.\" \"Beijing will watch closely to see which it is,\" said Paal, now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The U.S. shifted diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. But the governments in Washington and Taipei have maintained close unofficial ties and deep economic and defense relations. The U.S. is required by law to provide Taiwan with weapons to maintain its defense, and since 2009, the Obama administration has approved $14 billion in arms sales to Taiwan. The Taiwanese presidential office said Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan. Tsai also told Trump that she hoped the U.S. would support Taiwan in its participation in international affairs, the office said, in an apparent reference to China's efforts to isolate Taiwan from global institutions such as the United Nations . Taiwan's presidential office spokesman, Alex Huang, said separately that Taiwan's relations with China and \"healthy\" Taiwan-U.S. relations can proceed in parallel. \"There is no conflict\" in that, he said. China's foreign ministry said Beijing lodged \"solemn representations\" with the U.S. over the call. \"It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory,\" Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said in a statement. \"The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Matthew Pennington and Darlene Superville in Washington, Johnson Lai in Taipei, and Nomaan Merchant and news researcher Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Amazon announced its Amazon Go \"just walk out\" store on Dec. 5, 2016. These stores allow customers to enter, grab items and then leave without ever having to go through a checkout lane. An Amazon Go app and sensors track everything the customer has taken, charging their Amazon account as they leave. (Photo: Amazon) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line. Customers tap their cell phones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's\u00a0network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app. The service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart. The Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\" When the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account. Amazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131\u00a07th Ave.,\u00a0near Amazon's offices, but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said. The technology \"is amazing,\" said\u00a0Phil Lempert,\u00a0a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles. He's even more intrigued by the multiple images of \"meal kits\" show in Amazon's video. These \"everything\u00a0you need to cook a quick, high-quality dinner\" kits have become popular but the economics of delivering them has meant they're difficult to make economically viable. Stores such as Amazon Go may provide a sweet spot for them. \"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store) they have done a great job of merchandising and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect,\" Amazon go could be a venue where they could succeed, said Lempert. 9832 CONNECT TWEET 711 LINKEDIN 62 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gHRupA ",

By Jenna Johnson and Juliet Eilperin December 5 at 1:47 PM Follow @wpjenna Follow @eilperin Former vice president Al Gore spoke to reporters Dec. 5 about his meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, calling their conversation \"extremely interesting.\" (The Washington Post) As Donald Trump continues to indicate\u00a0that he might be willing to change his position on climate change, which he has long called a \u201choax,\u201d the president-elect met Monday with former vice president Al Gore, who has become\u00a0a prominent activist in the fight against global warming. Gore was originally scheduled to meet just with Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is not registered with a political party and\u00a0has already pushed her father to adopt positions usually promoted by Democrats. Gore told reporters that after that meeting, he then had \u201can extremely interesting conversation\u201d with the president-elect. \u201cI had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground,\u201d Gore told reporters after spending about 90 minutes\u00a0at\u00a0Trump Tower in Manhattan during the lunch hour Monday. \u201cI had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that.\u201d Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and has even accused the Chinese government of creating this fake problem to steal manufacturing jobs from the United States.\u00a0But Trump seemed to soften that position during a meeting with the New York Times late last month, saying that he would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d on the issue and acknowledging that human activity might be connected to changes in the climate. [ China tells Trump climate change is not a Chinese hoax ] Ivanka Trump is one of the most influential people in Trump's life and is a member of his transition team, although\u00a0she has said she does not plan to take an active role in her father's administration. Her husband, Jared Kushner, is one of Trump's most trusted aides, and the couple are reportedly house-hunting in Washington . While Gore was not personally close to Hillary Clinton \u2014 their relationship became strained in the wake of President Bill Clinton's impeachment and as they both vied for Democratic donors' support during their respective political bids in 2000 \u2014 the former vice president campaigned on her behalf late in this year's presidential campaign. [ Why Gore waded into the 2016 campaign ] Speaking to an audience at Miami Dade College in October, Gore warned that Trump, \u201cbased on the ideas that he has presented, would take us toward a climate catastrophe.\u201d Appealing directly to millennials, he alluded to his own narrow loss to George W. Bush in 2000 in Florida and said young people could not afford to vote for anyone other than Clinton. \u201cThe world is on the cusp of either building on the progress and solving the climate crisis, or stepping back, washing our hands of America\u2019s traditional role as the leader of the world and letting the big polluters call the shots,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThe choice is that clear. It\u2019s that stark.\u201d But while national environmental groups and many scientists have already fired shots across the bow at Donald Trump, suggesting he needs to respect scientific integrity and refrain from appointing advisers who would gut existing\u00a0environmental and public health safeguards, some prominent activists have been exploring ways to influence the incoming administration. The most obvious target has been Ivanka Trump and her husband, since they are seen as the least conservative members of Trump's family. [ Scientists and environmentalists brace for a clash with Trump ] Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, for example, recently gave her a copy of his new\u00a0National Geographic documentary on climate change, \u201c Before the Flood .\u201d DiCaprio aired the documentary in October on the White House's South Lawn, before which he appeared onstage with President Obama and atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe. DiCaprio, who campaigned on Clinton's behalf and aired the film on college campuses in Florida and elsewhere, did not mention Trump by name but alluded to him at the event. \u201cWe must empower leaders who not only believe in climate change but are willing to do something about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over. If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science, or empirical truths, and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.\u201d Elise Viebeck contributed to this report.\u00a0 politics ",

(Photo: Ajesh Shah, AP) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Long known as a haven for artists, activists and folks on the fringe, the San Francisco Bay area is now largely unaffordable\u00a0to the very people who made it such a beacon. Soaring housing prices have sparked even\u00a0greater consequences farther afield, where unpermitted and sometimes unsafe spaces have become the center of\u00a0the arts community. The Oakland fire that killed at least 36 people over the weekend set ablaze a warehouse cluttered with\u00a0impromptu \u2014 and unlicensed \u2014 artist studios and living spaces, and an open second floor used for concerts and parties. One rickety staircase was the only way down for those fleeing the fire from upstairs.

The rise of the second tech boom in the past six years prompted\u00a0warehouse spaces and lofts in San Francisco\u2019s formerly industrial areas \u2014 once home to artists \u2014\u00a0to rapidly give way to high-end condos and live-work spaces that only start-ups with venture capital funding can afford.

That\u2019s partly\u00a0the result of\u00a0an influx of high-paid tech workers and also\u00a0a dearth in new home construction due to resistance from local communities. The area gained 500,000 new jobs but only added a little under 56,000 units of housing in the past six years, according to the California Department\u00a0of Finance and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional planning organization. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco in 2016 was $3,373,\u00a0according to Rent Jungle. In Oakland, the average for a one-bedroom was $2,778.\u00a0In comparison, the average rent in New York City was $2,826,according to the site.

Some friends who live near the Oakland warehouse that caught fire have dealt with problems such as sewage backing up into their living space and major structural issues. \u201cThey\u00a0don\u2019t want to complain because they don\u2019t have anywhere to go. It becomes a question of staying put or facing homelessness. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous,\u201d she said. Oakland\u2019s downtown area was once inexpensive but it, too, has\u00a0become popular with tech companies and consequently seen\u00a0rent prices rise. Today, there are artists workspaces and collectives in Oakland\u2019s Fruitvale and Jingletown neighborhoods, but\u00a0even those have become too expensive for many. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot of artists (are) moving to San Leandro, because it was cheaper \u2014\u00a0for about five minutes,\u201d said Blazenhoff, referring to the\u00a0working class town eight miles southeast of Oakland. Blazenhoff and many others note artists create spaces that draw others, often beginning a process of gentrification that in the end pushes them out. \u201cArtists bring culture. They come here to find their people, to find their community,\u201d she said. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Dylann Roof Allowed to Hire Lawyers Back, for Now By jeffrey collins, associated press CHARLESTON, S.C. \u0097 Dec 5, 2016, 3:28 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Dylann Roof to Judge: Let Lawyers Back on Death Penalty Case 0 Shares Email A federal judge agreed Monday to let a white man accused of fatally shooting nine black parishioners rehire his attorneys until a verdict is reached, but to remain his own lawyer if he is found guilty and the trial moves into a penalty phase. The decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel ended a week of Roof acting as his own lawyer in his death penalty trial. Roof wrote the Judge a handwritten note with his request over the weekend. It is unclear why Roof is so determined to keep the lawyers out of the penalty part of his case. In their own motion Friday asking Gergel to order Roof to hire them back, they suggested there is something embarrassing Roof is afraid they might use to try to spare his life. They did not elaborate. Roof, in his gray and white jail jumpsuit, simply answered questions with \"yes\" or \"no.\" Then after Gergel ruled, the 22-year-old described by his lawyers as a \"ninth-grade dropout\" quietly slid back into the far left chair at the defense table. Lead lawyer and capital defense expert David Bruck took back the lead chair, at least for now. Death penalty trials are split into two parts: the guilt phase, and then a separate portion that focuses on whether the defendant will be sentenced to death, or life in prison. Roof's lawyers can represent him in the guilt portion. Gergel, who last week called Roof's decision to be his own lawyer \"unwise,\" said he is still worried Roof is making a grave error by deciding to represent himself in the penalty phase. \"I continue, Mr. Roof, to urge you to reconsider this decision,\" Gergel said. Authorities said Roof shot nine black people during a prayer meeting on June 17, 2015, at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopalian Church in Charleston because he hated African-Americans. He faces hate crimes and obstruction of religion charges. A state death-penalty trial on nine counts of murder will follow the federal trial. Roof's main act during his week as his own lawyer was to oversee, along with prosecutors, the selection of 67 people who will make up the pool for the 12 jurors and six alternates. The jury will be selected Wednesday before opening statements. The week of jury qualification was much shorter than the federal death-penalty trial of Boston bomber Dshokhar Tsarnaev, which took almost two months. Gergel held a 50-minute hearing to deal with other motions Monday. He agreed to allow Roof's parents, grandmother and grandfather, who is a lawyer, to be in the courtroom for the trial even though they are potential witnesses. All other witnesses must stay out of the courtroom unless they are testifying. Prosecutors told Gergel that they expect their case in the guilt phase to last six or seven days, with Bruck saying he will take \"very little additional time.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press Writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina , contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stands in front of a fresco in the Palazzo Chigi in Rome in this June 23 file photo. (Filippo Monteforte / AFP/Getty Images) Tom Kington Anti-establishment parties are feeling emboldened after the defeat of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in a crucial referendum, demanding snap parliamentary elections in the wake of his resignation. The Five Star Movement, which wants Italy to drop the euro currency, and the anti-migrant Northern League party, both called for elections Monday, the day after Italian voters resoundingly snubbed Renzi\u2019s proposals, 59% to 41%. By promising to step down if he lost the referendum, which would have slashed the senate\u2019s powers, Renzi inadvertently turned the contest into a vote on his government and its handling of Italy\u2019s flatlining economy. On Monday, the youthful prime minister made good on his promise and handed in his resignation to Italian President Sergio Mattarella, although Mattarella asked him to stay in office until the end of the week to usher through Italy\u2019s 2017 budget. Calling on his blog for immediate elections, Five Star founder Beppe Grillo wrote, \u201cFrom next week, we will start to vote for our government policies on-line and for our government team.\u201d He added, \u201cThe regime\u2019s propaganda and all its lies are the first victims of this referendum. The times have changed \u2014 sovereignty belongs to the people.\u201d A figurine depicting Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stands in a Nativity scene on Naples' famed Christmas creche street, San Gregorio Armeno, on Dec. 5, 2016.

The Renzi figure is holding a suitcase in one hand and a placard saying 'I resigned' in the other. (Ciro Fusco / European Pressphoto Agency) The Five Star Movement and the Northern League have been likened to the anti-establishment vote which helped push Britain out of the European Union in a referendum held earlier this year, and also have been compared to backers of President-elect Donald Trump . Much the same was said of the populist, right-wing candidate for president of Austria, Norbert Hofer, but he lost an election Sunday to a leftist candidate, Alexander Van der Bellen, who was the preferred choice of the country\u2019s establishment. Grillo has distanced himself from hard right anti-establishment parties in Europe, claiming his Five Star Movement is more interested in ecology and online democracy than xenophobia and nationalism. Mattarella is likely to resist calls for an election, and instead nominate a caretaker government to first pass a new electoral law because the current one only applies to the lower house. It was framed on the assumption that elections to the Italian senate would be annulled by the referendum. He may nominate as caretaker prime minister a member of Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party, such as Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, since the party remains the largest group in parliament. Alternatively, he may bring in a nonpolitical government of experts, possibly run by Senate Speaker Pietro Grasso, before fresh elections in 2017 or 2018. As voting patterns in the referendum were published on Monday, it emerged that a surprisingly large group of No voters, 54%, told exit pollsters they rejected the reforms purely on merit, rather than considering themselves anti-establishment voters. According to this group, which included former Prime Minister Mario Monti , the reforms hobbled the checks and balances enshrined in Italy\u2019s 1948 constitution by reducing the voting rights of senators in parliament\u2019s upper house. But one expert said anti-system anger was also evident in young voters and voters in the depressed south of the country, including towns like Palermo in Sicily, where the No vote hit 72%. \u201cRenzi, a 41-year-old reformer, came to be viewed as an icon of the Italian and European establishment by the young after just 2\u00bd years in office,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of politics at Rome\u2019s Luiss University. \u201cThey believe politics will not solve their problems and they voted to punish Renzi, rather than find any solutions,\u201d he added. \u201cThey thought \u2018I have no hope, and no job, who can I take it out on? How about that guy who\u2019s on TV 12 hours a day?\u2019\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The victims of the deadly Oakland fire , who\u2019s to blame for one of the worst fires in California history , Dakota Access pipeline opponents have claimed a big victory for now , and robots are taking over many warehouse jobs in California .

Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas on May 2, 2012. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune With self-driving cars, hoverboards and cellphones in our pockets with more processing power than NASA needed to get to the moon, life in 2016 can sometimes feel like a science-fiction movie. But just how far we have come has been laid bare by long-serving Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas, who proudly revealed Monday that 18 years into her administration, everyone in her office has a computer. A whole computer, with a keyboard and everything. \"Now everyone has a computer ... any place in the office, so you don't run to find a microfiche or open a filing cabinet,\" Pappas boasted at a City Club of Chicago lunch at Maggiano's. Perhaps stunned into silence by the march of technological progress, the audience had to be reminded to clap by Pappas, who added: \"In two years there won't be any filing cabinets, so I want you to applaud that.\" Pappas' speech also included a playful jab at her Greek ancestry (\"How can you talk to someone who isn't listening?\" she said of the Greek government), her claim that \"I helped China set up their property tax system\" and an intriguing blind item of sorts about an unidentified \"finance minister of a very well-known country in Europe.\" Shown an online auction system by Pappas, the unnamed European finance minister told her, \"We really don't need this \u2014 how do you steal with a system like that?\" she said. Though she touted her use of technology to cut wait times and improve efficiency, she confessed to being confused about how to deliver her PowerPoint presentation because \" they didn't tell me which button to push!\" A keen aficionado of aerial yoga \u2014 a form of yoga done hanging from a hammock \u2014 she eventually figured out how to show her audience an impressive photo of herself performing the \"Giselle pose\" while suspended from the ceiling.

    "text": "Ellison's bid to lead DNC complicated by calls to relinquish House seat Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison remains the frontrunner to take over the beleaguered Democratic National Committee but is facing growing questions not only about his controversial past but whether he can effectively lead the group without relinquishing his House seat. The call for a full-time DNC leader -- and for Ellison to step down from the House if he gets the job -- is being led by former committee Chairman Howard Dean, who last week ended his bid to return to the post. Dean made the announcement before a gathering in Denver of Democratic state party leaders, after which Ellison purportedly said with mixed emotions that he is considering leaving Congress to devote his full attention to the DNC.\u00a0 Dean made clear he considers Ellison's exit from Congress a requirement. He afterward told MSNBC, \u201cI do not support Keith as long as he has his congressional seat. I do not believe you can do this job and another job in Congress. I don't support Keith. Maybe I will later.\u201d The other remaining DNC candidates are Ray Buckley and Jamie Harrison, the chairmen, respectively, of the New Hampshire and South Carolina state Democratic parties. Beyond concerns about splitting duties, Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, is facing criticism about his past remarks on Israel and association with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. \u201cKeith Ellison is, by all accounts, a decent guy,\u201d Alan Dershowitz, a renowned Jewish lawyer and legal scholar who supports Democratic candidates, said in a FoxNews.com op-ed . \u201cBut it is hard to imagine a worse candidate \u2026 Ellison represents the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party, just when the party -- if it is to win again -- must move to the center in order to bring back the voters it lost to (Donald) Trump.\u201d Ellison, in his sixth term, would take over the committee after a bruising 2016 election cycle in which Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was upset by Trump, the Republican nominee, after essentially leading the entire race. In addition, Washington Democrats missed their best opportunity in years to retake control of the Senate, gaining just two seats while winning only a handful of House seats and again losing more gubernatorial and state legislative seats across the country. (Democrats could pick up a third Senate seat in Saturday\u2019s runoff election in Louisiana.) Clinton\u2019s White House bid was set back on the eve of this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention when leaked emails revealed DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and some of her staff appeared to favor Clinton over primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders -- who appealed to the electorate\u2019s far-left wing and who backs Ellison\u2019s bid. Schultz resigned, but the DNC\u2019s problems continued when more leaked emails, in the closing weeks of the White House race, revealed that interim-DNC leader and former CNN contributor Donna Brazile had given the Clinton campaign questions in advance of a network-sponsored debate and town hall forum. Ellison reportedly argued at the meeting last week that he could handle both jobs, especially in a GOP-controlled Congress, just as Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, did. The argument\u00a0 was not well received . \u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to you guys to make that determination,\u201d Harrison reportedly said to chortles. The DNC charter also appears to automatically prohibit Ellison or anyone else from holding both posts, as it stipulates the chairman \u201cshall serve full time.\u201d However, an allowance seemed to have been made when President Obama personally appointed Wasserman Schultz. Dershowitz further suggested that beyond Ellison\u2019s questionable ideology the DNC needs a leader who can reconnect the party with disaffected centrist voters. \u201cThe centrist voters they lost to Trump will only be further alienated by the appointment of a left-\u00adwing ideologue who seems to care more about global issues than jobs in Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2026 . Ellison\u2019s sordid past associations with Louis Farrakhan \u2026 will hurt him in middle America.\u201d The 68-year-old Dean, a Clinton supporter, also said last week that he dropped his DNC bid because he thought the party needed a younger face and that he didn\u2019t want to get involved in an \u201cideological fight\u201d between the party\u2019s establishment and progressive wings.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

They found that the spate of hate crimes and the ominous talk by Mr. Trump or his advisers about barring Muslims from entering the country and registering those living here had caused all of them to think about Germany in the years before the Holocaust. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWhen did you know it was time to leave?\u201d Ms. Firdaus asked one woman who had just recounted how her relatives had fled the Nazis. \u201cThe ones that didn\u2019t leave are the ones who went to Auschwitz.\u201d The Jewish women tried to convince her that they would not let it come to that. \u201cIf Muslims have to register, we\u2019re all going to register,\u201d said Mahela Morrow-Jones, who is helping to build the first West Coast chapter of the Sisterhood in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe it, sister.\u201d Groups are reaching out not just to clergy, but also to laypeople, including business executives, students and women.

Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a recent interview: \u201cJews know what it means to be identified and tagged, to be registered and pulled aside. It evokes very deep emotions in the Jewish community.\u201d Mr. Greenblatt received a standing ovation when he declared at his organization\u2019s conference in Manhattan last month that if Muslims were ever forced to register, \u201cthat is the day that this proud Jew will register as a Muslim.\u201d \u201cAll of us have heard the story of the Danish king who said if his country\u2019s Jews had to wear a gold star,\u201d he said, \u201call of Denmark would, too.\u201d Nearly 500 Muslim and Jewish women, many wearing head scarves and skullcaps, gathered on Sunday at Drew University in Madison, N.J., in what organizers said was the largest such meeting ever held in the United States. It was the third annual conference of the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, a grass-roots group that now claims 50 chapters in more than 20 states. The first conference two years ago drew only 100 people. The women spread out inside an enormous sports complex and met in clusters to study sacred texts on the racquetball courts, practice self-defense techniques in the dance studio and, in the bleachers, discuss how to talk to friends whose impression of Islam had been shaped entirely by news of terrorist attacks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Over lunch and in the hallways, they traded stories about the latest ugly outbreaks back home: a brick thrown through the window of a Muslim-owned restaurant in Kansas, apartments of Muslim families in Virginia hit with eggs and graffiti, swastikas scrawled on synagogues and in a playground in New York. Sisterhood chapters keep track of the incidents on their F acebook pages and other social media. \u201cIgnorance is one of the key triggers of hate,\u201d said Sheryl Olitzky, the group\u2019s executive director, in her opening remarks. \u201cWe need to show the world that we are Americans. We are here because we love each other and we\u2019re overcoming hate.\u201d Ms. Olitzky, a marketing executive whose husband and two sons are rabbis, started the first Sisterhood women\u2019s meeting in New Jersey six years ago on the theory that \u201cwomen navigate the world through relationships.\u201d She baked the challah and hosted the Shabbat dinner on Friday night at her home. Photo Shabiha Sheikh and Barbara Breitman attended a workshop at the conference. Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times The Sisterhood is one of several groups expanding their work on Muslim-Jewish relations: The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding started an initiative to elevate Muslim condemnations of terrorism, which are often ignored by the news media. The Anti-Defamation League is increasing its work against anti-Muslim bigotry. \u201cIt\u2019s the Trump effect,\u201d said Imam Abdullah Antepli, the chief representative on Muslim affairs at Duke University, who attended the women\u2019s conference with his wife. \u201cI see the Muslim community even more eager to reach out and to put aside the grievances of the past.\u201d The most prominent new initiative is a Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council whose co-chairmen are two Fortune 500 chief executives: Farooq Kathwari, of the furniture company Ethan Allen, who is Muslim, and Stanley Bergman, of the medical products distributor Henry Schein, who is Jewish. The council, which was forming as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was gaining steam, includes both Democrats and Republicans. It was created by leaders of the American Jewish Committee and the Islamic Society of North America in an effort to have influence on public policy. The group intends to oppose a registry, support immigrants and refugees, and push for accommodating religious practices in the workplace. Despite the new cooperation, tensions over Israel continue to flare up. Several Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, recently declared their opposition to Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is a Muslim, becoming the chairman of the Democratic National Committee because of critical statements he has made about Israel. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And the embrace of Muslims is hardly universal. A few Jewish groups have applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on Muslims, and cheered his appointment of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. General Flynn has called Islam \u201ca cancer\u201d and a \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d masquerading as a faith. The appointment of General Flynn prompted the usually stoic Ms. Firdaus to rethink her situation. She abandoned the plan to buy a vacation home in Tampa, or anywhere in the United States, at least for now. Instead, she and her family will spend Christmas vacation in Toronto, where they intend to open a bank account and look for a condominium to buy \u2014 just in case they have to flee. Attending the Sisterhood conference on Sunday, however, Ms. Firdaus said she was feeling a bit more optimistic. She was surrounded by Jews who pledged not to abandon Muslims. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, brought the women to their feet cheering with stories of how in history\u2019s darkest times, love had conquered hate. \u201cSitting here makes you feel it\u2019s really not so hopeless. This is food for the soul,\u201d Ms. Firdaus said. \u201cBut there were 60 million people who voted for Trump. I\u2019m not ready to leave, but you have to have a plan.\u201d Follow Laurie Goodstein @lauriegnyt on Twitter. For breaking news and in-depth reporting, follow @NYTNational . ",

Video by Jasper Colt, USA TODAY Former British prime minister Tony Blair (Photo: David Baratz, USA TODAY) 498 CONNECT TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 117 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Former British prime minister Tony Blair warns that political upheaval from Great Britain's Brexit vote in June to the collapse of the Italian government on Sunday signals the most dangerous time for Western democracies in decades. \"It does feel perilous, actually, because I think there are decisions that are being taken of vast moment in circumstances where systems are fragile,\" he told Capital Download on Monday. \"And that is troubling.\" It has been a year of unexpected victories by populist and nationalistic forces that are challenging the establishment: passage of the referendum pulling Britain from the European Union, the election of Donald Trump as president in the United States,\u00a0defeat of a measure in Italy that prompted the prime minister to announce his resignation. Italian vote, Renzi resignation confuses global markets And in the Austrian election Sunday,\u00a0the candidate representing the\u00a0party founded by former Nazis lost \u2014 but after commanding\u00a046% of the vote. Blair, who was in Washington to address a conference sponsored by the bipartisan group No Labels, announced last week the launch of a new organization that will try to help build a more muscular policy agenda for centrists\u00a0and encourage\u00a0networking among them across Europe, in the United States and elsewhere. Given the rise of extreme voices on the left and right, he said,\u00a0\"I'm not sure we're asking the right questions right now, never mind giving the right answers.\" Of particular concern to him is a \"longing\" for an authoritarian leader. \"It's amazing how many people you will find who will reference a style of leadership of (Russian) President Putin in a positive way,\" he told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. \"I think people want their country moving and they think that if the present system is not moving it, and not making the changes that they want to see, then maybe someone who just says, 'I don't care what anyone thinks; I'm just going to go for it, and this is what I'm going to do'\u00a0\u2014 that has a certain attraction. \"If the center isn't a place of strength and vitality, and it looks kind of flabby and just managing the status quo, then you're at risk of someone coming along and doing that.\" Capital Download - Conversations with Washington's biggest newsmakers In his speech to the No Labels conference, he faulted some centrist political leaders for failing to do enough to improve the economic prospects for workers disrupted by globalization and to ensure a sense of personal safety at a time, for instance, that Great Britain and other European countries have absorbed a wave of immigrants from Syria. \"People will only put aside prejudices if they think there are rules,\" he said. Blair sees a common thread from Brexit's passage to Trump's election to support for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a provocative figure whose anti-drug campaign is blamed for thousands of deaths. Tony Blair speaks at a No Labels event in Washington on Dec. 5, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Paul Morigi, AP Images for No Labels) \"There is immense amount of anger at established ways of doing things,\" Blair said. \"There is, I think, a whole group of people who feel ignored by those in power, that is for sure true. There is more anger around in politics than for a long time.\" While issues such as immigration aren't new, there is \"much greater skepticism towards globalization and the benefits of it.\" What's more, \"social media is a revolutionary phenomenon,\" he went on. \"It changes the way politics works. It changes the way the media works. If we're not careful, it locks people into conversations with people who just agree with them, and who then have a general conspiracy-theory view of the rest of the world.\" Blair has never met Trump and didn't criticize him. Asked about whether it was wise for Trump to accept a congratulatory telephone call from the president of Taiwan\u00a0\u2014 the sort of conversation every American president since 1979 deliberately has avoided \u2014 Blair demurred.\u00a0\"I'm not going to get into your politics,\" he began. \"To be honest, in the end, I'll tell you what I really think: Let's see how it works out.\" Trump talks to Taiwan's leader, breaking precedent \"I'm less worried about America than I am about Europe; I'll be very frank with you,\" he said. \"America is such a strong country and you've got so many checks-and-balances and you've got such resilience in your economy and so on; you guys will do fine, I'm sure. In Europe, we have systems that are at a point of fragility that troubles me.\" Blair was just 54 years old when he moved out of 10 Downing Street after serving as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. His political appeal for a \"new way\" was akin to President Bill Clinton's \"third way\" for Democrats here, and he was a crucial ally for President George W. Bush during the Iraq War. Now he offers a bit of free advice for President Obama, who will move out the White House next month at age 55: Find a cause. \"When you've got young political leaders and then they leave office young, you've got to find something that really motivates you,\" he said. \"The reason I spent so much time on the Middle East is that I'm deeply motivated by it. But you've got to find something that gets you up in the morning with the same sense of purpose and excitement as happened when you were prime minister or president.\" Capital Download with former British prime minister Tony Blair and USA TODAY's Susan Page. \u00a0(Photo: David Baratz, USA TODAY) 498 CONNECT TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 117 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gJj99v ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Petula Dvorak Columnist December 5 at 12:53 PM Follow @petulad The fake news stuff we\u2019ve been talking about? That all just got real. An entire D.C. neighborhood was on lockdown Sunday because some dope with a gun believed a fake news story that wildly and wrongly linked a neighborhood pizzeria to a child sex ring. You could conclude that Edgar Maddison Welch, the 28-year-old man from North Carolina who allegedly walked into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant carrying an assault rifle, pointed it at an employee and then fired one or more shots, might be a singular nut job. [ N.C. man told police he went to D.C. pizzeria to investigate conspiracy theory ] The exterior of Comet Ping Pong, where a gunman showed up to \u201cself-investigate\u201d a fake story about a child sex ring. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post) He told police he had come to the restaurant to \u201cself-investigate\u201d a false election-related conspiracy theory that linked Hillary Clinton to the child sex ring. But he wasn\u2019t the only dope who was roped into this. A week before the presidential election, the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn \u2014 the man President-elect Donald Trump has chosen as his national security adviser \u2014 shared the Comet Ping Pong conspiracy story. Thousands of others shared it, too. Days later, the retired general himself tweeted a hashtag referring to another fake news story that accused Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta , of satanic rituals using bodily fluids. That there, the satanic ritual stuff, is straight out of the grocery checkout line. Remember when Americans used to laugh at the crazy-bad supermarket tabloid stories about \u201cBat Boy!\u201d or \u201cTitanic Survivors Alive!\u201d or \u201cAlien Bible Found! They worship Oprah!\u201d? D.C. police detained a gunman on Dec. 4, who had walked into Comet Ping Pong, a popular Northwest Washington restaurant and music venue. Police said no injuries were reported. (Faiz Siddiqui,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) What was different back then? Why didn\u2019t a desperado come storming toward the White House gates with his gun after the story about George W. Bush meeting with aliens hit the stands? Because most people knew the source of the news \u2014 the National Enquirer, News of the World, etc. \u2014 wasn\u2019t remotely serious, as lacking in nutrition as the candy bars the tabloids were displayed alongside. But in today\u2019s social media universe, there\u2019s a flood of stories from fake news sites that look legit. And stories that sound as ludicrous as alien love triangles don\u2019t get a laugh, they get shared by our leaders, generating violent threats, dangerous reactions and, in the worst cases, bloodshed. [ Fake news writers need to meet the real reporters who die trying to do their jobs ] In an era when we have more access to more information than ever before, we\u2019ve also become more willing to believe the crazy \u2014 and share it with others. What happened at Comet Ping Pong isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen real consequences of the doctored-news phenomenon. A year ago, a gotcha video \u2014 created by folks who lied, schemed and plotted to get a doctor to talk about the graphic details of her work while secretly being record \u2014 was pinging in the head of Robert Lewis Dear Jr. when he stormed a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. Dear used the phrase \u201cno more baby parts\u201d after he allegedly killed three people \u2014 a police officer, an Iraq War veteran and a mother of two \u2014 and injured nine others in that shooting rampage. Grandstanding congressmen fed him the \u201cbaby parts\u201d line after they watched that heavily edited video of a Planned Parenthood executive talking about the donation of tissue from aborted fetuses. (They must\u2019ve forgot that fetal tissue has been used in important medical research since the 1930s and helped produce vaccines for polio, measles and mumps.) The video was created under false pretenses, heavily edited and never would have met the standards of a legitimate news organization. That faux investigation ended in hours of congressional hearings, a budget crisis for Planned Parenthood in many states and the deaths of those three people in Colorado. [ Words matter in attacks on Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, Muslims ] Five years ago, it wasn\u2019t fake news but an equally careless use of words that helped incite an equally terrible burst of violence. Supporters of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin put out a map with crosshairs targeting the districts of 20 House Democrats and urging folks: \u201cDon\u2019t Retreat, Instead \u2014 RELOAD!\u201d Then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) was on that map and criticized it as soon as it was posted online and her office was vandalized. \u201cWe\u2019re on Sarah Palin\u2019s targeted list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district,\u201d Giffords told MSNBC at the time. \u201cWhen people do that, they\u2019ve got to realize there\u2019s consequences to that action.\u201d On Jan. 8, 2011, the consequences were chilling: Jared Loughner showed up with a gun outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was greeting constituents and killed six people and injured 20 more, including Giffords. Still, as the funerals were being held and Giffords was in intensive care, Palin\u2019s supporters insisted crosshairs were never a reference to guns. Words matter. That kind of disregard for common sense and responsibility has kudzu-ed into what we have today, educated leaders willing to believe conspiracy theories about child sex rings and satanic rituals thanks to nothing more than a slick-looking online story. Get a grip, America. The owner of Comet Ping Pong had endured weeks of death threats. Phone calls, messages, stalkers, employees being harassed. They\u2019ve all complained about the relentless attacks. Then they faced a real attack, which has left a business and a neighborhood deeply shaken. \u201cLet me state unequivocally: these stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them,\u201d owner James Alefantis wrote on his Comet Ping Pong Facebook page Sunday night. There is no FBI investigation, no New York Police Department takedown. None of that. \u201cWhat happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences,\u201d Alefantis wrote. \u201cI hope that those involved in fanning these flames will take a moment to contemplate what happened here today, and stop promoting these falsehoods right away.\u201d Those who run our social media companies and Internet search engines need to find a way to help a gullible country differentiate between fake news and real news. Let\u2019s make America believe in facts again. Twitter: @petulad ",

Jon Huntsman , newly on Donald Trump \u2019s expanded list of contenders for secretary of state, praised the president-elect\u2019s decision to take a call from Taiwan\u2019s president, which broke with decades of U.S. policy. \u201cThe call came in from President Tsai Ing-wen. He made the choice to take it, which I think was absolutely right,\u201d Huntsman told ABC News before making remarks at a conference hosted by the nonpartisan group No Labels, which he co-chairs. Huntsman\u2019s praise is especially significant because he served as the U.S. ambassador to China under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011. The phone call was the first known contact between a U.S. president or president-elect and a Taiwanese counterpart since 1979. The U.S. has since adhered to the one-China policy, which recognizes Taiwan as a part of China. Huntsman said he did not view this call as a shift in U.S.-China policy but said he was sure the Trump team did not orchestrate the call without knowing the implications. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot more to come, would be my guess, once the president-elect becomes president, but we\u2019ll have to just wait and see. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a broader strategy,\u201d Huntsman said. Also, he confirmed that Trump is considering him as his possible top diplomat but said they haven\u2019t had or scheduled any formal meetings yet. 0 Shares ",

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that considers the influences of race and politics in redistricting on Monday. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear over the past quarter century that racial gerrymandering is an unconstitutional no-no, but partisan gerrymandering is still permissible. The question is: How do you tell the difference? Especially when the Voting Rights Act allows for some consideration of race to ensure minority representation, and when party affiliation often correlates with race. In cases from Virginia and North Carolina, the Supreme Court seemed unsure on Monday how to balance these mandates. Questions Of Race And Redistricting Return To The Supreme Court In Virginia, the Republican state Legislature drew 12 state legislative districts, each with a 55 percent African-American majority. The Legislature argues that it was just trying to meet the requirements of the Voting Rights Act. In the Supreme Court chamber, lawyer Paul Clement, representing the Legislature, portrayed the Virginia line-drawing as a \"bipartisan success story\" and noted that only two members of the black caucus voted against it. But Marc Elias, representing the other side, said the Legislature had created a \"one size fits all\" redistricting that places voters in or out of districts \"based solely on the color of their skin.\" Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree, but Justice Samuel Alito said the whole controversy looked to him like little more than an \"invitation for litigation.\" On the steps of the Supreme Court after the argument, Elias noted that prior to the redistricting, black candidates were winning elections even in districts where African-American voters were in the minority. \"The idea that those percentages needed to be ramped up was not a function of what was necessary by the Voting Rights Act or to help the African-American community,\" he said. \"It was racial sorting, pure and simple.\" Article continues after sponsorship In Monday's second case, from North Carolina, lawyers Elias and Clement were back at the lectern. At issue were two congressional districts drawn by Republicans, who hold the majority in the North Carolina state Legislature. Clement, representing the Republicans, said one district was drawn to comply with the Voting Rights Act while the other was \"an avowedly political draw,\" meaning it was drawn to maximize partisan advantage. Justice Elena Kagan interrupted: Suppose a state wants \"to segregate all the African-American voters\" but then it \"[justifies] it based on politics, because that sounds better\"? Was Clement suggesting that the challengers would have to present their own alternative maps? \"Yes,\" Clement answered. If they've got all that direct evidence of a racial motive, the alternative map drawing \"should be a breeze.\" \"Not so easy,\" replied Kagan, \"because we know that race and politics correlate,\" but \"if race is the motive, you get one result, and if politics is your motive, you get another.\" Justice Stephen Breyer diagnosed the problem as a set of existing legal standards that lower courts can't seem to apply. State legislatures need standards that enable them to separate the \"sheep from the goats,\" he said, so that every case won't come up to the Supreme Court for the justices to spend the entire term reviewing 5,000-page records. When Elias returned to the lectern for the Democrats, he said one of the challenged districts in North Carolina needed only 2,800 more voters to reach the target number for its population. Instead, he said, lawmakers changed the district lines to move in 75,000 African-Americans while moving out an equal number of whites. That, he suggested, \"corralled\" black voters to minimize their influence in neighboring districts. In rebuttal, lawyer Clement said the fact that legislators \"brought in a bunch of African-Americans because they were trying to bring in Democrats is about as interesting as the sun coming up in North Carolina.\" With a conundrum to resolve, the Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision by June.

Chuck Burton/AP hide caption toggle caption Chuck Burton/AP Members of the defense team for Dylann Roof arrive at the federal courthouse in Charleston, S.C., on Nov. 7. Chuck Burton/AP The man accused of killing nine people during a bible study in Charleston, S.C. last year has rehired his defense attorneys to represent him in the first phase of his federal murder trial. Dylann Roof, 22, faces 33 federal hate crimes charges for walking into the basement of a historically black church and sitting among worshipers before opening fire, according to prosecutors. The government is seeking the death penalty. Earlier this month, Roof asked to represent himself in the trial, prompting a series of delays to the final phase of jury selection as U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel ordered an evaluation of Roof's mental competency. Last week, Gergel granted Roof's motion to act as his own attorney. Charleston Church Shooting Suspect Will Represent Himself In Death Penalty Trial For five days, Roof represented himself during the final jury selection, expressing few opinions about potential jurors as his attorneys sat next to him providing backup counsel. But late last week, Roof's attorneys asked the judge to reverse the decision, arguing that Roof was not equipped to adequately defend himself against a possible death sentence, and that \"allowing him to proceed would deprive him of protection against cruel and unusual punishment,\" reported the Charleston Post and Courier . On Sunday, Roof sent a handwritten letter to the judge asking that his lawyers be allowed to represent him in the first phase of the trial, during which evidence is presented, but not during the sentencing phase, in which arguments will be presented for and against the death penalty. \"I would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only,\" the letter began. #DylannRoof asks the court in a handwritten letter to let's his attorneys represent him again in the guilt phase of his trial only. pic.twitter.com/arioqpYGGJ \u2014 Alexandra Olgin (@Alexolgin) December 4, 2016 On Monday morning, Judge Gergel asked Roof to confirm his request in court, the Post and Courier reported. Article continues after sponsorship \"You are delegating to (defense attorneys) your strategic decisions in the guilt phase, and that is acceptable to you?\" Gergel asked Roof, according to the newspaper. \"Yes,\" Roof replied. The ruling reinstated a defense team that includes attorney David Bruck, who also defended the man sentenced to die for his role in bombing the Boston Marathon, as The Two-Way has reported. On Monday, jury selection resumed with Bruck handling all motions on Roof's behalf. Among those motions was a request to dismiss the federal hate crimes indictment altogether, which the judge denied. As The Two-Way has noted : \"The federal hate-crime charges against Roof 'center on both the victims' race and their identity as churchgoers who were attempting to follow their religious beliefs when Roof attacked.' At the time, [Attorney General Loretta Lynch] called hate crimes 'the original domestic terrorism.' \"Roof also faces federal weapons charges. \"The Justice Department says he selected the [ Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church ] and his victims to win notoriety and to try to ignite a race war.\" Roof appeared to have set up a website that included a \"manifesto-like diatribe against non-whites,\" as we've reported . Roof is also facing separate murder charges brought by the state of South Carolina, which is also seeking the death penalty. As NPR's Debbie Elliott has reported , the family members of some of the shooting victims have said they are unhappy with the drawn-out nature of the legal proceedings, and do not favor the death penalty for Roof.

In the Oceti Sakowin camp, native and non-native alike danced to celebratory drumming that blasted through loudspeakers. But reality soon began to sink in among the thousands who have been fighting the construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline for months, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others say endangers local drinking water and would disturb sacred tribal sites.

Seymour said she was worried the decision could be easily overturned by President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Here's what may be next for the protesters and Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company building the pipeline, after the U.S. Army Corps turned down the permit for the project. What can Trump do? Trump can overturn Sunday's U.S. Corps decision . Trump supported the completion of the pipeline, according to an aide's memo recently obtained by the Associated Press. A spokesman, Bryan Lanza, said in the memo that Trump's backing for the pipeline \"has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.\" In general, Trump has pledged to invest in infrastructure projects. During the campaign, he also supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which has also prompted opposition. \"This is a temporary celebration ... With a new government it could turn and we could be at it again.\" In an interview with NBC News in November, Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren said he was \"100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration.\" \"I believe we will have a government in place that believes in energy infrastructure,\" he said. In June, Warren donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund , a joint fundraising committee for Trump's campaign, and a further $3,000 directly to the Trump campaign . For his part, Trump's campaign financial disclosure forms revealed the President-elect's investments totaling between $500,000 and $1 million in Energy Transfer Partners.

Any legal options for Energy Transfer Partners? In its statement Sunday night, Energy Transfer Partners did not threaten legal action against the Corps. That may be because the company, at least right now, would have a weak case in court, said Deborah Sivas, an environmental law professor at Stanford University. \"The statement was clear: a final decision has not been made,\" Sivas told NBC News. \"Unless they find themselves before a very sympathetic judge, they don't have a case with no finality to a decision.\" The language in the Corps decision, Sivas added, both concedes that the company has met all the legal requirements while also recognizing a \"heightened duty to tribes and protecting their lands.\" An Energy Transfer spokesperson declined to comment on the possibility of the company taking legal action against the government. According to Sivas, however, there may be a political route for the company in the absence of legal recourse. \"I suspect that they have the ear of the transition team,\" said Sivas. \"If I were advising them, I would say your political strategy is likely to be more successful than your legal options at this point in time.\" What could Energy Partners do? The Dallas-based company financing the $3.7 billion project does not look to be backing down. \"The Administration's statement today that it would not at this time issue an 'easement' to Dakota Access Pipeline is a purely political action,\" read a statement by the company Sunday. Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren. John L. Mone / AP The company went on to say that it expected \"to complete construction of the pipeline,\" noting that \"nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way.\" When asked by NBC News whether the company would be willing to pay any fines to the government if they continued construction, an Energy Transfer Partners spokesperson said \"it would not.\" These fines would be slapped on Energy Transfer Partners if the company defies the Corps of Engineers' orders and drills under Lake Oahe, a large Missouri River reservoir. That stretch required an easement from federal authorities. Will the pipeline be re-routed? The Army Corps assistant secretary for civil works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, said in a statement Sunday that the Corps based their decision permission to the company \"on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing.\" The pipeline would cross 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe with double walled and remote-controlled shutoff valves on each side of the crossing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies just a half-mile from where the pipeline would be constructed, has for months said the pipeline would destroy the area's water supply and ancient sacred sites dating back 15,000 years. Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, waits to give his speech against the Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access oil pipeline during the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sept. 20. DENIS BALIBOUSE / Reuters Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II has called for a pipeline re-route \u2014 a request that has been rejected on numerous occasions by Energy Transfer Partners. The tribe's worry the pipeline would destroy sacred sites and compromise its water supply \"were not based on the facts,\" Energy Transfer Partners' Warren told NBC News. Warren has also told NBC News that there was no guarantee an oil spill would not happen, but the pipeline would be prepared to withstand such an event. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said it will look at possible alternate routes, although any other route is also likely to cross the Missouri River. What will pipeline opponents do next? The U.S. Corps of Engineers decision to deny the permit to Energy Partners was welcomed, albeit cautiously, by those opposing the construction. Activists celebrate at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on Sunday.December 4, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota.                  The Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday notified the Standing Rock Sioux that the current route for the Dakota Access pipeline will be denied. JIM WATSON / AFP - Getty Images Brian Cladoosby, the president of the National Congress of American Indians, called the move a victory for \"all of Indian Country\" that showed \"respect for tribal sovereignty and a true government-to-government relationship.\" Still, the new Trump government would bring with it renewed struggle, according to Charlotte Bad Cob, from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. \"This is a temporary celebration. I think this is just a rest,\" she told Reuters. \"With a new government it could turn and we could be at it again.\" Daniel A. Medina ",

Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool Judge Clifton Newman addresses the jury last week in the murder trial of former North Charleston, S.C., police officer Michael Slager. Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool Updated at 4:45 p.m. ET The judge in the murder trial of former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager declared a mistrial on Monday after the jury said it could not come to a unanimous decision. \"We as the jury regret to inform the court that, despite the best efforts of all members, we are unable to come to an unanimous decision in the case of the State vs. Michael Slager,\" a letter from the foreperson of the jury read. Jury In S.C. Police Shooting Trial Says It Is Struggling To Reach Verdict Judge Clifton Newman said the case would be retried at a future date, the timing of which could depend on a federal civil rights case that is also pending against Slager, as we have reported . Slager is accused of murder for shooting Walter Scott multiple times as he ran away from the officer in 2015, after a routine traffic stop. The jurors had three options if they hoped to avoid a mistrial: a guilty verdict for either murder or voluntary manslaughter, or an acquittal. In all, the jury deliberated for about 22 hours over four days, and the content of their deliberations was uncommonly public. On Friday, during its third day of deliberation, the jury began sending a series of notes to Judge Newman, containing questions about the case and statements about the opinions of individual jurors. As The Two-Way reported, on Friday one of the 12 jurors could not agree with the other 11 on a guilty verdict: \"In a letter read from the bench by Judge Clifton Newman, the dissenting juror wrote, 'I understand the position of the court, but I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict. ... I expect those who hold opposing views will not change those views.' \" 'We all struggle with the death of a man and with all that has been put before us,' the letter continued. 'I still cannot convict the defendant. At the same time my heart does not want to tell the Scott family that the man who killed [Walter Scott] ... is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.' \" Article continues after sponsorship Late Friday afternoon, the jury sent another note saying it was \"hopelessly deadlocked,\" leading the defense to call for a mistrial for the first time. But when the judge asked the foreperson if more time would help them reach a unanimous decision, the foreperson said yes, and the jury continued deliberating. Monday morning, the jury returned and, within an hour of resuming deliberations, sent a note to the judge saying that the majority of jurors were undecided, and listing multiple questions about the case. The questions included why manslaughter was offered as a potential verdict, and what was meant by \"imminent danger.\" After hung jury in Michael Slager murder trial, Walter Scott's mother says God will see that justice is done. pic.twitter.com/neFIUsvn4k \u2014 Debbie Elliott (@NPRDebElliott) December 5, 2016 After asking for input from lawyers for both sides, Newman brought the jury in and clarified the difference between murder and manslaughter charges. He also reminded the jurors that there is only one law governing self-defense. In other words, police officers are governed by the same self-defense law as other people. After nearly three more hours of deliberation, the jury announced it could not reach a unanimous decision. In her closing remarks to the jury, prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said, \"Y'all have been remarkable. Your service has been exemplary, you have been in more thinking than any trial we have ever had.\" She appeared on the verge of tears as she thanked the family of Walter Scott, who were sitting in the courtroom. \"I don't mean to downplay or understate my disappointment that together we can't reach a resolution,\" Wilson said to the jury. But \"no one can blame you.\" \"We believe in peaceful protests,\" Walter Scott's brother Anthony Scott told reporters outside the courthouse. \"We feel like our voices need to be heard. We need to let the nation know we're not happy, but we're not sad. Because we do believe in peaceful protests.\" Walter Scott's mother, Judy Scott, said little. \"I trust God,\" she told reporters. \"It's not over till God says it's over.\" ",

Prosecutors then asked for the jury to be given the Allen Charge, a special set of instructions imploring the jury to go back and discuss further. WLTX Dimitri Ford, from North Charleston, holds a sign supporting the Scott family during a prayer vigil in front of the Charleston County Courthouse as the jury deliberates in the Michael Slager trial Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in Charleston, S.C. (Photo: Mic Smith, AP) A South Carolina judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors said they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict in the case of a\u00a0white former North Charleston police officer charged with murder in the death of black motorist Walter Scott. The mistrial came just a few hours after Circuit Judge Clifton Newman had ordered jurors to continue deliberating. But the jurors reported later that they were hopelessly unable to reach a unanimous consensus. The panel of one black and 11 white jurors had deliberated about 22 hours over four days. Lawyers for Michael Slager had sought a mistrial after jurors told Newman on Friday they were deadlocked because one holdout juror was unwilling to convict Slager. Jurors, however, sent the judge a note Monday saying most of the jurors were undecided. The jurors also asked the judge several questions, including why Slager was charged with voluntary manslaughter in addition to murder.\u00a0Slager could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted of murder. A voluntary manslaughter conviction could bring a sentence of anywhere from two years to 30 years. Slager's wife, Jamie, cried after the jurors were dismissed and briefly put her head on the bench in front of her. She said \"thank you for everything\" to the defense lawyers as they left the courtroom. She did not respond when reporters asked if she wanted to comment. One female juror wiped away tears with her hands and a tissue as the attorneys addressed them and thanked them for their hours of work. There were no outbursts in the courtroom. Savage did not comment. Scott's mother and brother said outside the courthouse that justice will eventually prevail. \"I'm not sad because I know justice will be served,\" Judy Scott said. Scott's family also called for peaceful protests. \"We're not going to tear up this city,\" said Scott's brother, Anthony. \"We're not happy. But we're not sad.\" Asked whether he could forgive Slager, Anthony Scott said he could eventually \"find the peace\" to forgive the ex-officer but not before justice is served. \"He gets to spend Christmas with his family,\" he said of Slager. The jury also asked if the self-defense standard is\u00a0the same for a police officer as it is for other people. Slager, 35, was near tears last week when he testified\u00a0he pulled over Scott's 1991 Mercedes for a broken tail light on April 4, 2015. Scott, 50, ran away, and Slager said a scuffle ensued after he pursued Scott on foot. Slager said Scott attempted to wrest away the officer's Taser and that he shot Scott out of fear for his own life. Jury in Scott case in S.C. breaks for weekend amid deadlock A bystander's cellphone video, which\u00a0begins seconds before Slager started shooting, shows Scott fleeing as Slager fires eight shots. Scott was hit three times in the back, once in the buttocks and once on the ear. Outside the courthouse, local pastors conducted a prayer vigil while awaiting a verdict. One man held a sign reading \"Justice for Walter Scott and his family NOW!\" Slager was fired from the force and charged with murder within days of the release of the cellphone video. He has been free since January on a $500,000 bond. Slager also is awaiting trial in federal court, charged with violating Scott's rights, obstruction of justice and a gun violation. The city of North Charleston agreed to pay a $6.5 million settlement to the Scott family. Contributing: Associated Press ",

By Elise Viebeck and Karoun Demirjian December 5 at 11:10 AM Follow @eliseviebeck Follow @karoun \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump named Ben Carson as his nominee for housing and urban development secretary. Here's what you need to know about the former GOP presidential candidate. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump has nominated retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an unconventional choice that underscores Trump\u2019s willingness to forgo traditional policy expertise in some Cabinet positions to surround himself with allies. Carson \u2014 who ran against Trump in the wide field of Republican presidential primary candidates and has never held political office \u2014\u00a0is the president-elect\u2019s highest-profile African American supporter and confidant. A conservative political celebrity, the 65-year-old Carson recently cast doubt on his suitability for a Cabinet role, saying he would be \u201clike a fish out of water\u201d as a federal bureaucrat. \u201cI am thrilled to nominate Dr.\u00a0Ben Carson as our next Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,\u201d Trump is quoted as saying in a statement released by his transition team Monday. \u201cBen Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities.\u201d A review of some of Carson\u2019s political commentary on housing policy reveals his views to be at odds with some of the anti-segregation\u00a0policies championed by minority groups, including the NAACP. On at least one occasion, he criticized efforts by the Obama administration to use its regulatory powers to improve racial integration in housing. [ Carson\u2019s ride from Trump friend to enemy to inner-circle ally ] If confirmed by the Senate, Carson will be enlisted to serve as Trump\u2019s unofficial envoy to African Americans and to lead the charge to repair what Trump has described as America\u2019s blighted and dangerous inner cities, a dystopian, racially charged image criticized as frequently at odds with reality. He will also lead Trump\u2019s efforts in an arena where Trump and members of his family have been accused of flouting the law in their own business ventures. Trump is also expected on Monday to formally name retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis as his defense secretary. Trump shared his intentions Thursday during a raucous \u201cthank you\u201d rally in Cincinnati. Carson\u2019s lack of experience in the housing sphere raised concerns among advocates for vulnerable Americans. \u201cWith many qualified Republicans to choose from with deep knowledge of, and commitment to, affordable housing solutions for the poorest families, and with the housing crisis reaching new heights across the country, Dr. Carson\u2019s nomination to serve as HUD Secretary is surprising and concerning,\u201d Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. Trump\u2019s HUD pick follows his decision to name South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), the daughter of Indian immigrants, as ambassador to the United Nations and former labor secretary Elaine L. Chao as his choice for transportation secretary. Chao in 2001 became the first Asian American woman to be named to a Cabinet post and went on to head the Labor Department under President George W. Bush for eight years. These two appointments, along with Carson\u2019s and Trump\u2019s selection of Betsy DeVos as his choice for education secretary, confirm that the president-elect is seeking a measure of racial and gender diversity in his emerging administration. [ The latest on Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks ] Carson and the president-elect were not always as friendly as they are now. In November 2015, as the Republican presidential primary cycle was heating up, Trump used Carson\u2019s description of himself as a violent adolescent to attack his rival at campaign rallies. Noting Carson\u2019s admissions\u00a0in his 1996 autobiography, interviews and public statements\u00a0that, growing up, he had tried to attack his mother with a hammer and almost stabbed a friend, Trump said Carson had a \u201cpathological temper\u201d that was incurable, comparing it to \u201cchild molesting.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re a child molester, a sick puppy, a child molester, there\u2019s no cure for that,\u201d Trump said in Fort Dodge, Iowa. \u201cThere\u2019s only one cure, and we don\u2019t want to talk about that cure. That\u2019s the ultimate cure. No, there\u2019s two \u2014 there\u2019s death and the other thing. But if you\u2019re a child molester, there\u2019s no cure, they can\u2019t stop you. Pathological, there\u2019s no cure.\u201d With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage \u2013 don't people get it? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2015 Carson was also critical of Trump at times, but without the same level of intensity. He\u00a0said in March that he might have \u201cpreferred\u201d a different Republican presidential nominee but that \u201cwe\u2019re only looking at four years\u201d if Trump fails as president. A Seventh-day Adventist, Carson entered the political sphere after admonishing the audience at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast \u2014 including President Obama. Standing a short distance from Obama, he said the United States faced \u201cmoral decay\u201d and \u201cfiscal irresponsibility\u201d similar to the end of the Roman Empire. Soon, he was making the rounds as a commentator in print and on Fox News, where he was often featured as a critical voice on the Affordable Care Act. Carson does not have specific experience with the activities of HUD, which manages low-income housing assistance, facilitates financing for homeownership and administers fair-housing programs. But he has a documented position on fair-housing policies that has advocates nervous about what protections a Trump administration might dismantle \u2014 particularly for\u00a0racial desegregation. Last year, then-candidate Carson forcefully criticized an Obama administration rule requiring cities and towns to publicly report racial bias in their housing patterns, saying it would \u201cfundamentally change\u201d communities by requiring affordable housing to be built in wealthier neighborhoods. \u201cThese government-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality create consequences that often make matters worse,\u201d Carson wrote in the Washington Times . \u201cThere are reasonable ways to use housing policy to enhance the opportunities available to lower-income citizens, but based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous.\u201d Trump and members of his family have come under scrutiny for allegedly flouting fair-housing laws in their own real estate business. In 1973, the Justice Department sued Trump and his father, Fred Trump, for allegedly discriminating against black apartment applicants. Trump filed a counterclaim and after nearly two years of fighting, struck a deal with the government. The Justice Department declared it a victory for the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. Trump also declared victory, in part because the agreement stated that Trump made the deal without acknowledging he was at fault. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump drew criticism for painting urban communities as hellishly violent and benighted. \u201cYou have so many things, so many problems, so many horrible, horrible problems. The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We\u2019re going to work with the African American community, and we\u2019re going to solve the problem of the inner city,\u201d Trump told a rally before the election. If confirmed, Carson will join Trump\u2019s Cabinet with a devoted following of conservative Christians, tea party supporters and fans of his achievements in pediatric neurosurgery, which were portrayed in the made-for-TV film \u201cGifted Hands.\u201d \u201cWe have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid,\u201d Carson wrote Wednesday on Facebook. At the same time, he also brings a lengthy history of gaffes and odd, controversial statements unusual for an incoming Cabinet secretary: He has called President Obama a \u201cpsychopath,\u201d compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery and said the contemporary United States is akin to Nazi Germany. In one instance, he said gun control made it possible for the Holocaust to occur. Carson\u2019s unique personal history gives him a pronounced, often controversial view on the roots of urban poverty. [ Carson\u2019s positions on poverty create tension with rags-to-riches life story ] Born into a struggling family on the southwest side of Detroit, Carson was educated at Yale University and the University of Michigan before he began a celebrated surgical career at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He credits his achievements to his Christian faith and the high expectations of his mother, an illiterate domestic servant who sought never to take government assistance, though she sometimes did. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like the idea of dependency,\u201d Carson told The Washington Post last year. \u201cEven if she sometimes took government aid, she always wanted to be independent. She would get in arguments with others who would say, \u2018There\u2019s aid for dependent children \u2014 you don\u2019t need to be working.\u2019\u201d Carson\u2019s social and scientific views are also far to the right. According to past statements, including on the 2016 campaign trail, he views being gay as a choice, doubts human activity contributes to global warming and believes abortion should be outlawed in all circumstances, including in cases of rape and incest.

The jury members said they were unable to come to unanimous decision. They had deliberated since closing arguments ended last Wednesday. Slager, who is white, was accused of killing Walter Scott , an unarmed black man, at a traffic stop on April 4, 2015, in North Charleston while Slager was an officer with the city's police department. Video that surfaced shortly after the encounter appears to show the moment Slager fatally shot Scott as he ran away. The video garnered national attention, propelling Slager into the spotlight. He was fired from the force after the shooting, according to The Associated Press. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, said at a news conference after the mistrial was announced that she isn't sad about the mistrial \"because Jesus is on the inside. And I know that justice will be served, because the God that I serve, he's able. He told me to wait on the Lord and be of good courage, and God, he is strengthening my heart. God is my strength, and I know without a doubt that he is a just God and injustice will not prevail.\" Scott family attorney L. Chris Stewart said at the news conference, \"If you thought that we were going to come out here crying or weeping or weak, you don't know the Scott family, who've become my family.\" He added that Slager \"dodged it by a hair, and he's not dodging it again.\" \"The fight isn't over,\" Stewart said. \"That was Round 1.\" He said the solicitor will try the case again and the Department of Justice will also be trying the case. Slager \"delayed justice,\" Stewart said. \"He did not escape it.\" Another family attorney, Justin Bamberg, said, \"Justice will be had\" in the end. \"Thanks to Feidin Santana [who recorded the video], we've seen the light, and there is no way at the end of the day that former Officer Michael Slager can escape what's coming to him,\" Bamberg said. Walter Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, urged for peaceful protests, adding that his family has had to \"live with\" the video \"being played over and over again.\" Walter Scott's Mother Emotional on the Stand in 1st Day of Murder Trial for Former SC Cop Michael Slager Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said in a statement, \"We will try Michael Slager again. We hope the federal and state courts will coordinate efforts regarding any future trial dates, but we stand ready whenever the court calls.\" She added, \"While I cannot overstate our disappointment that this case was not resolved, I commend those who sacrificed so much time, energy and effort to serve on this jury.\" Wilson addressed the Scott family in her statement, saying, \"My thoughts and prayers are with the Scott family. We are grateful for their patience, understanding and cooperation with us. They have not received the credit they deserve in their calm leadership for the community. The Scotts have been a sterling example of dignity and grace in extraordinary circumstances. This is a very difficult time for them, but I have no doubt that they will continue to support our efforts to find justice for this case. I have no doubt that they will continue to show their faith in the criminal justice system.\" She also thanked the Scott family in court after the mistrial was announced. \"When I finished up closing arguments,\" she said, \"and I walked over to give hugs, poppa Scott, the patriarch of the family, said to me, 'You'll always be my daughter.'\" Defense attorney Andy Savage directly addressed the jury in court as well. \"This is not a case about an individual or family,\" he said, adding the case is about \"the state of South Carolina,\" not Walter Scott. \"That's not to diminish Mr. Scott.\" \"The rule of law has to be preserved in this country, and you have done that,\" Savage said to the jury. \"Thank you.\" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said in a statement after the mistrial, \"It is my understanding that there will be, as quickly as possible, a new trial where the Scott family and all of South Carolina will hopefully receive the closure that a verdict brings. Justice is not always immediate, but we must all have faith that it will be served. I certainly do.\" Haley said she urges all South Carolinians \"to continue along the path we have walked these last two years \u2014 a path of grace, faith, love and understanding. That is who we are and who I know we will continue to be.\" Slager pleaded not guilty to murder. But as the trial concluded last week, the jury was allowed to consider a voluntary manslaughter charge. The voluntary manslaughter charge was requested by the prosecution, and the judge allowed it, based on testimony given during the trial. Slager also faces a federal trial, which is scheduled for next year. 0 Shares ",

Pulse owner Barbara Poma in a statement said she \u201ccan\u2019t just walk away\u201d from the nightclub. \u201cI feel a personal obligation to ensure that a permanent space at Pulse be created so that all generations to come will remember those affected by, and taken on, June 12th,\u201d Poma said in the statement, released by attorney Gus Benitez. The city announced in November that it had a deal in place to buy the property for $2.25 million and turn it into a memorial. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said at the time that the city planned to keep the nightclub \u201cas-is\u201d for about 12 to 18 months after purchasing it and then get community input for what to do with the site.

Red Line, Universal City station Christina House / For The Times People on the platform at the Metro Red Line's Universal City station in 2014. People on the platform at the Metro Red Line's Universal City station in 2014. (Christina House / For The Times) Richard Winton , Kate Mather and James Queally Contact Reporters An overseas tip about an imminent bombing of the Metro Red Line\u2019s Universal City station has forced federal and local law enforcement in Los Angeles to swiftly ramp up security across its sprawling transit system, authorities said Monday. An anonymous man warned of a potential attack on Tuesday and provided the information on a tip line abroad, according to\u00a0Deidre Fike, the assistant director in charge of the\u00a0FBI's\u00a0office in Los Angeles. The tip line was run by an unidentified foreign government, which relayed the information Monday morning to an FBI terrorism task force. Fike\u00a0declined to specify from which country the tip originated but said it was delivered in English. At a hastily called news conference Monday night, the FBI as well as Los Angeles-area law enforcement leaders said the threat was considered specific and imminent, but investigators were still examining its credibility. \u201cThis could be real, it could be a hoax,\u201d said Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell . \u201cWe\u2019re asking the public to stay calm and vigilant.\u201d Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said that area law enforcement reviews threats \u201cconstantly\u201d but that this particular incident was \u201cvery specific\u201d and forced a rapid response. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the time to vet this threat in the way we would like,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThis one we had to move quickly on.\u201d Riders were told to expect the\u00a0increased presence of uniformed police and sheriff\u2019s deputies as well as K-9 units scouring the area for explosives. McDonnell, whose department oversees security for the Los Angeles County Metro rail and bus system, said undercover operations would be conducted throughout the day. Mayor Eric Garcetti asked the public to prepare for random bag searches, and said he would ride\u00a0the Red Line on Tuesday morning from Universal City. \u201cMy advice is right now, everyone should go about their normal day tomorrow,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cPeople may see a heightened security presence \u2026 but don\u2019t let those frighten you.\u201d Nearly 150,000 daily boardings are recorded on the Red Line, which connects\u00a0North Hollywood with central and downtown Los Angeles, according to the\u00a0 Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority . That\u00a0figure\u00a0include ridership estimates for the Purple Line, which shares much of the Red Line\u2019s downtown L.A. route. Chief Scott Edson, who oversees counter-terrorism as head of the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Homeland Security Division, cautioned that the department often receives threats and that it\u2019s hard to determine the credibility. He said passengers should report any suspicious activity. Last year, a phone\u00a0threat of violence at L.A. schools prompted the district to cancel classes for the day. Officials later determined the threat was not credible, and there was some debate about whether the district overreacted.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The victims of the deadly Oakland fire , who\u2019s to blame for one of the worst fires in California history , Dakota Access pipeline opponents have claimed a big victory for now , and robots are taking over many warehouse jobs in California .

    "text": "<p>Mateen Cleaves listens as his lawyer Frank Manley addresses the media after Mateen\u2019s case was dismissed Monday, Dec. 5, 2016 at Genesee District Court in Flint, Mich.&nbsp;</p> Close Mark Felix | MLive.com, AP FLINT, Mich. -- A judge on Monday dismissed all charges against former Michigan State basketball star Mateen Cleaves, who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman after a charity golf event and a visit to a bar in 2015. Judge Cathy Dowd in Flint, Michigan, heard days of testimony, including details from the woman, who said she twice tried to get away from Cleaves but was pulled back into a motel room and sexually assaulted. A witness confirmed that she saw the woman try to escape a room at the Knights Inn near Flint. But a police officer summoned to the motel said the woman never indicated that she was assaulted.\u00a0 Cleaves, 39, was charged with unlawful imprisonment, assault with intent to commit sexual penetration, second-degree criminal sexual conduct and third-degree criminal sexual conduct. He pleaded not guilty. The Associated Press generally doesn\u2019t name people who say they were sexually assaulted. The woman testified that she never said \u201cno\u201d to Cleaves \u201cbut I told him I wanted to go home.\u201d They met at a golf event that day, and she later sent him a text message to join her and others at a bar. In dismissing the charges, the judge said there were credibility problems with the woman\u2019s testimony. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe he\u2019s pulling her back in the room to commit\u201d criminal sexual conduct, Dowd said. \u201cThere are a number of factors that lead me to believe something else could be going on. She is the one that invited Mr. Cleaves to come to the bar. She is the one that voluntarily left with Mr. Cleaves to go someplace else.\u201d\u00a0 The legal standard to send someone to trial in Michigan is probable cause. It\u2019s a much lower threshold than beyond a reasonable doubt, which determines guilt or innocence at trial. Prosecutors said they\u2019ll appeal Dowd\u2019s decision.\u00a0 Cleaves released a statement, thanking his wife and lawyers and saying \u201cjustice was served.\u201d\u00a0 In his closing remarks to the judge, defense attorney Frank Manley called it a case of \u201cregret,\u201d not \u201crape.\u201d But prosecutor Lisa Lindsey said if the woman didn\u2019t want to be at the motel with Cleaves, then \u201cwhy did she run out of the room desperately trying to get away from the defendant?\u201d Cleaves led Michigan State to the NCAA basketball championship in 2000 and remains close to the program. Mateen is the middle name of coach Tom Izzo\u2019s son. Cleaves appeared in 167 games for four NBA teams. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Police say the victim, Ava Castillo, and her 10-year-old sister were helping their mom, 27-year-old Diana Gomez, unload groceries on Nov. 14, when the suspects ambushed them and tried to grab Gomez\u2019s purse. The alleged robbers fired several shots at Gomez and one of the bullets hit Ava, who was in her mother\u2019s arms, according to police. Gomez was hit seven times, and Betzida, the 10-year-old daughter, was also struck at least once. They have both since been released from the hospital. Philip Battles, 18, and two 17-year-old boys face capital murder charges in the case. Battle has also been charged with capital murder in the Nov. 7 shooting of Ignacio Ortega, who was killed during an apparent robbery. Julie Gomez, the sister of Diana Gomez, told the station after the shooting the woman tried to protect the girls by putting them behind her when she saw the gun. She said her sister couldn\u2019t stop crying over the death of her young daughter. \u00a0\u201cMy sister is at a loss for words. She\u2019s in shock.

Flynn, President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2019s choice for national security adviser, has a well-established penchant for pushing conspiracy theories about Islamic law spreading in the West and the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Less well noticed was his willingness throughout the presidential campaign to indulge in conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton. Six days before the election, Mr. Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, tweeted a fake news story that claimed the police and prosecutors in New York had found evidence linking Mrs. Clinton and much of her senior campaign staff to pedophilia, money laundering, perjury and other felonies. \u201cU decide,\u201d Mr. Flynn wrote in the Twitter message on Nov. 2, though it appeared there was little doubt what he thought. U decide - NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc...MUST READ! https://t.co/O0bVJT3QDr \u2014         General Flynn (@GenFlynn) Nov. 3, 2016 Mr. Flynn\u2019s month-old tweet is attracting renewed attention after a man fired a rifle on Sunday inside a Washington pizza restaurant that was the subject of false stories during the campaign tying it and the Clinton campaign to a child sex trafficking ring. The man, Edgar M. Welch, 28, of Salisbury, N.C., told the police that he had come to the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, in northwest Washington, to \u201cself-investigate\u201d the sex trafficking hoax , which is being called Pizzagate. No one was hurt, and Mr. Welch was arrested at the scene. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the incident marked a violent turn in a continuing story in which the restaurant, its employees and nearby businesses have been subjected to threats and harassment because of the hoax, for which no evidence has been produced. Despite the absence of evidence to back up the theory, some high-profile supporters of Mr. Trump have continued to spread it, including Mr. Flynn\u2019s son, Michael G. Flynn. On Sunday, hours after the gunfire at Comet Ping Pong, the younger Mr. Flynn, 33, went on Twitter to say that until Pizzagate was proved false, it remained a story. Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many \"coincidences\" tied to it. https://t.co/8HA9y30Yfp \u2014         Michael G Flynn (@mflynnJR) Dec. 5, 2016 Michael G. Flynn is more than just a family member of an incoming senior administration official. In recent years, he has served as the chief of staff to his father, who started a private intelligence and consulting business, the Flynn Intel Group, after being forced to retire from the military in 2014. Photo The police surrounded Comet Ping Pong, the pizza restaurant that was the subject of a fake news story, after a man with an assault rifle entered the restaurant in Washington on Sunday. Credit Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency Throughout the campaign, Michael G. Flynn served as a gatekeeper for his father, and he now appears to have a job with the Trump transition team. Email sent to an address at the Flynn Intel Group returned with an automated response that provided a new email contact for both Flynns \u2014 and each had a Trump transition email address that ended with .gov. The Twitter feeds of both men leave little doubt about their politics \u2014 the main difference is that the son appears to have shown even less restraint than his father when it comes to spreading conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clinton and her campaign. He retweeted suggestions that Mrs. Clinton and President Obama were \u201cat the center\u201d of the conflict in Syria and profiting from it, and suggested that both would be tried for treason if Mr. Trump were elected. He shared a fake news story that claimed hackers had found video evidence that President Bill Clinton had raped a teenage girl. And in a Twitter message that he deleted after CNN found it in November, he questioned what was wrong with dating websites that were only for white people, saying black Americans have BET, a television network that caters largely to black viewers. Since Sunday\u2019s gunfire at Comet Ping Pong, Michael G. Flynn has also continued to push his support for the Pizzagate fake news, retweeting messages that say the media have sought to normalize pedophilia. His father, though, has kept a lower profile since the election. He has not given interviews, and he has kept his Twitter postings relatively tame, posting patriotic messages on Veterans Day and more recently praising Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of retired Gen. James N. Mattis of the Marines as defense secretary. General Mattis...another amazing choice for our country. @realDonaldTrump & @mike_pence mean what they say! We will #MAGA thank you America! https://t.co/sPF0ounPmO ",

Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune After waiting a lifetime for a championship team, Cubs fans will discover the price of success. The average price of season tickets will rise 19.5 percent in 2017, the Cubs announced Monday, with increases ranging from 6 percent for upper-deck reserved seats to 31 percent for infield club box seats. The highest-priced premium seat is $409 for a dugout box for one of the three \"diamond\" games \u2014 the home opener and Saturday games against the Yankees and Cardinals \u2014 while the lowest is $8 for upper outfield reserved for one of nine \"bronze\" games, weekday games in April and early May. Colin Faulkner, senior vice president of sales and marketing, pointed to the \"unprecedented demand\" this year's championship season created. \"Trying to capture that demand and continue the progress on the field, and (with) our mission to field a consistently competitive team, no surprise, we'll be increasing season ticket prices,\" Faulkner said. \"Even with the 191/2 percent increase, it leaves a significant value for our season ticket holders.\" The Chicago Cubs players will learn this month how lucrative their bonuses will be for winning the World Series .

The \"2016 World Series Collector's Edition: Chicago Cubs,\" an eight-disc set will... (Chicago Tribune staff) The Cubs said 2016 regular-season tickets resold on StubHub.com for an average of 96 percent above their face value. Postseason tickets went for 670 percent above face value, including a 1,206 percent increase for the three World Series games at Wrigley Field. After the Cubs' playoff run in 2015, the team said it increased prices by an average of 10 percent. Team Marketing Report, using its own calculations, had the Cubs with a 14.6 percent increase from 2015 to '16 to an average of $51.33, well over the major-league average of $31. The Cubs drew more than 3.2 million fans in 2016, fifth-highest in the majors at more than 39,900 per game. The Cubs' overall attendance increase of 313,000 was the second-highest jump in the majors behind the Blue Jays' increase of 597,000 fans. The Cubs ranked third in average ticket price, according to TMR, behind the Red Sox ($54.79) and Yankees ($51.55). Faulkner said he did not know where the Cubs expect to rank in 2017, citing different calculations from teams that don't factor in premium \"club\" seats. \"Certainly we'll have a ticket price that may be relatively higher than some teams,\" he said. \"But we really think that we're providing tremendous access and value to our season ticket holders.\" A premium dugout box ticket for 2017, including tax, will cost $29,089.76 \u2014 an average of $359 per game. The cheapest season ticket, for upper-deck outfield reserved, is $2,139.20 including tax, or $26 per game. After the 95-loss 2002 season, the Cubs introduced a three-tiered pricing system of \"value,\" \"regular\" and \"prime\" days that increased prices from 20 to 25 percent for a quarter of their home games. Now there are bronze (nine games), silver (12), gold (24), platinum (14), marquee (19) and diamond (three) tiers. The three diamond games are the home opener April 10 against the Dodgers, May 6 against the Yankees and July 22 against the Cardinals. The highest-priced non-premium seat, the club box infield, goes for $12,484.64 including tax ($154 per game) with a high of $189 for diamond games. Bleacher tickets range from $21 for bronze games to $79 for diamond games, plus tax, and will average $51 including tax. Bullpen box seats, priced as premium seating, will range from $111 to $239 for the second through fourth rows ($16,913.12 including tax for a season ticket) and from $118 to $289 for the front row ($19,882.24). The bullpens are moving underneath the bleachers in 2017, adding seats to the area. The American Airlines 1914 Club, under construction behind home plate, won't open until 2018. Significant ticket hikes aren't unusual for the Cubs when they believe demand is high. They increased prices by an average of 18 percent after the 1998 wild-card season, by 17 percent after the 2003 team lost in the National League Championship Series , by 17 percent after the 2004 team blew a late wild-card lead and by 17 percent after getting swept by the Dodgers in the 2007 division series.

Cubs tickets have been among the highest-priced in baseball even when the team has struggled. In 2002, when they lost 95 games, the Cubs had an average ticket price of $24.05, according to TMR, ranking fourth. By 2006, when they lost 96 games, the Cubs had the second-highest average price at $34.30 behind the Red Sox's $47.71. Their ticket prices have remained among the highest since because of Wrigley's relatively small capacity and iconic status and fans' willingness to pay the price to get inside. psullivan@chicagotribune.com ",

Kevin Hagen/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Kevin Hagen/Getty Images Former Vice President Al Gore talks to the media after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on Monday in New York City. Kevin Hagen/Getty Images In what may be the most unlikely meeting of the presidential transition process so far, former vice president, former Democratic presidential nominee, former senator and Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore met with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday. Gore has spent decades warning about the dire consequences of unchecked, man-made climate change, while Trump regularly called climate change \"a hoax\" during the campaign. Initially, the session was not even expected to include the president-elect. According to the transition spokesman, it was scheduled as a sit-down between Gore and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who is a member of the official transition team. Ivanka Trump, 35, is also an executive with the Trump Organization and Trump has described her as one of his most trusted advisers. There was no preview of the agenda for the former vice president and the president-elect's daughter. Politico reported last week that Ivanka, who's expected to play some of the social roles typically occupied by the first lady, is interested in making climate change one of her signature issues. Article continues after sponsorship Since the election, she has met with actor and climate change activist Leonardo DiCaprio to discuss the issue, when he, according to the New York Times , gave her a copy of his documentary film on the topic. A full 90 minutes after he entered Trump Tower, the golden elevator doors in Trump Tower's lobby opened and Gore emerged, according to pool reports. In a very brief statement to reporters staking out the lobby, Gore revealed that he spent most of his time upstairs meeting with Trump himself. \"I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground,\" said Gore. \"I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that.\" It's not clear exactly how Ivanka Trump's views on climate change differ from her father's and what influence she might have on him. He has proposed walking away from the 2015 Paris Agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. As a candidate, Trump championed the American coal industry, saying that environmental regulations had harmed the industry and cost the jobs of miners. ",

President-elect Donald Trump leaves a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 10, 2016. (NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP/Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter A Republican member of the Electoral College from Texas said Monday that he won't cast one of his state's 38 electoral votes for Donald Trump because \"I am here to elect a president, not a king.\" Dallas paramedic Chris Suprun previously indicated he would support Trump. But he now says the president-elect's postelection attacks on the First Amendment and the country's electoral process, as well as the billionaire businessman's continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas, changed his mind. Texas law doesn't mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state's presidential election , which Trump won by nine percentage points over Hillary Clinton. Suprun and the GOP 's other electors signed pledges at the state Republican convention in Dallas this summer promising to vote for their party's nominee, but those aren't legally binding. \"I'm expecting backlash, but that has been par for the course this campaign. People are unhappy. They're angry. But I'm angry, too,\" said Suprun, who said that prior to changing his mind he had received hundreds of emails, letters and phone calls urging him not to support Trump. Suprun said the Electoral College system \"is fine as it currently exists.\" His problem is just with its winner. \"I was told if we elected Donald Trump he would transform his personality into being presidential. He isn't,\" Suprun said. \"I wanted him to be presidential, but since the election he hasn't grown into our institution, he's attacked them. I am here to elect a president, not a king.\" Another Texas Republican elector, Art Sisneros, resigned last week rather than vote for Trump. Electors will vote to replace Sisneros when they convene Dec. 19 in Austin and in state capitals across the country to vote for president. Suprun said he was not resigning but also won't be voting for Hillary Clinton. \"I am not sure of who I will vote for, but would have to strongly consider someone like (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together,\" he said. Suprun said he was waiting to see if other electors will revolt and rally behind a Trump alternative like Kasich. \"I'm looking for someone we can all unify behind,\" he said. Associated Press ",

He told authorities he came to check out a fake news story involving Hillary Clinton. \u00a0Dec. 5, 2016 Flowers placed at the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in D.C. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Peter Hermann , Susan Svrluga and Michael E. Miller December 5 at 8:22 PM Follow @phscoop Follow @SusanSvrluga Follow @MikeMillerDC For 45 minutes, police said, Edgar Maddison Welch, cradling an AR-15 assault-style rifle, roamed the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant looking to prove an Internet conspiracy theory that the popular D.C. restaurant harbored juvenile sex slaves. The few patrons had fled before Welch shot off the lock to an inside door, sending a bullet into a computer tower. The North Carolina man then turned the gun on an employee who emerged from the back holding pizza dough. The worker ran out, unharmed. With D.C. police amassing outside on Sunday afternoon, Welch finally walked out with his hands up \u2014 but not before he finished his search. He had come to rescue the children, court papers say he later told police, and now was convinced that none was being harmed there. D.C. Magistrate Judge Joseph E. Beshouri on Monday ordered Welch \u2014 known to his friends by his middle name, Maddison \u2014 jailed until his next hearing on Thursday. He faces several gun-related charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon. Comet Ping Pong customers came out to support the restaurant after a gunman entered it with an assault rifle, firing it at least once. Several other businesses on the block have received other threats as well. (Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post) Assistant U.S. Attorney Sonali Patel said Welch was a danger to the community and a flight risk based on the notoriety of his alleged crimes. His lawyer with the Public Defender Service argued that her client should be released because he had no prior violent offenses. Welch, bearded and dressed in a white plastic jail jumpsuit for the D.C. Superior Court hearing, said only his name when asked to identify himself. Family and friends said they are struggling to understand how Welch apparently became so fixated on a fake news story that he drove from North Carolina with a Colt long rifle, a .38-caliber revolver and a shotgun, determined to take action. The viral Internet tale, which emerged shortly before the presidential election, falsely linked Hillary Clinton, her campaign chairman and the owner of Comet to the alleged sex-slave conspiracy. Welch, described by some friends as a devoted father to two young girls, toyed around with filmmaking and writing, and he had attended a community college. He is an avid hiker. He and his wife are separated, and he has custody of the children. One of Welch\u2019s closest friends of the past eight years said she does not think he intended to shoot anyone. \u201cHe most likely really believes the conspiracy theory,\u201d said Kathy Sue Holtorf, who produced one of his films and appeared with him in another. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy with the best of intentions. He probably saw himself as more on a hero mission to save children than anything else.\u201d The call about a man carrying an assault rifle into a pizza joint popular among teens and their parents frightened many D.C. residents and created a standoff that closed streets. In and beyond the nation\u2019s capital, it also raised fears about hoax stories proliferating the Internet and whether they are stoking new dangers from society\u2019s fringe. Even the White House weighed in on Welch\u2019s alleged crimes. \u201cEven without knowing precisely what the motives were, there\u2019s no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate,\u201d said Josh Earnest, a spokesman for President Obama. \u201cThat\u2019s concerning in a political context. It\u2019s deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.\u201d Loyal patrons to Comet Ping Pong are organizing an event Friday to urge people to stand with the owner and employees, even as it appears that Sunday\u2019s incident will not quell the stories. A new Internet conspiracy theory emerged Monday. Citing Welch\u2019s minor background as an actor, some claimed the gun incident was either staged or even a hoax altogether. And on Sunday night, Michael Flynn Jr., the son and top aide of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, tweeted that the Comet Ping Pong conspiracy theory might still be true. \u201cUntil #Pizzagate proven to be false, it\u2019ll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many \u2018coincidences\u2019 tied to it,\u201d Flynn Jr. tweeted. He later posted images of direct messages from CNN host Jake Tapper imploring him to stop spreading the rumors. As the story spread, Comet and other establishments along Connecticut Avenue have been subject to threats and vile social media banter, business owners said. Dustin Sternbeck, the D.C. police spokesman, said the department became aware last month of the fictional allegations about Comet. \u201cHowever, despite postings of offensive language, we did not receive reports of any specific threats. Officers advised the staff to immediately report to police any threats made against the establishment or individuals.\u201d The spokesman said police have contacted Comet\u2019s owner and others \u201cto address their concerns. We want to ensure the community that their safety is our priority as we have committed additional police resources to that area.\u201d A portrait of Welch based on interviews with his friends suggests he is an adoring father to his children but also someone unable to claim interest in a career, including following his father, who is a filmmaker, or his mother, who volunteered as a firefighter. He was a prolific hiker, profiled in 2009 by his local newspaper, the Salisbury Post, for hiking the 500-mile Colorado Trail. He attended Cape Fear Community College in 2008 and 2009, pursuing an associate of arts degree. \u201cMaddison is a sweet young man with a big heart,\u201d said Tajuana Tadlock, his aunt. \u201cWe are all in shock right now. We are still trying to get our minds around what happened. This is totally out of character for him. \u201cWe are all worried about him. He comes from a family that cares. \u201cWe all just want to put our arms around him and ask him, \u2018Why baby? What made you this upset? This isn\u2019t you.\u2019 \u201d Tadlock described her nephew as \u201cpassionate, tenderhearted. Loves his family. Loves his children, he is always concerned about his parents and children. We have not been able to talk to him yet, so we do not know what got him to this level. \u201cHe is a loving person, a loving dad. He has friends, church, family and friends. He is anybody\u2019s son.\u201d Other relatives, including his parents, Harry and Terri Tadlock Welch, did not respond to interview requests or could not be reached for comment. No one answered the door at the address listed for Welch in court records. The home is in a pocket of sparsely arranged ranch-style houses five miles outside of downtown Salisbury, a county seat along Interstate 85, about 50 miles north of Charlotte. Aaron Christie, a friend from West Rowan High School in North Carolina, said he hadn\u2019t talked to Welch recently but that he had strong political convictions and had faith in the Constitution. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter whether it was Democratic or Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had the ability to do something good for the people, you knew it was your responsibility to do something good for the people.\u201d But Welch was laid-back and happy, he said; he had never seen an angry moment with his family. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him hostile toward anybody. He was always levelheaded and calm, took a minute to think things over before he said or done things,\u201d Welch said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen him in three years. A lot can change over time.\u201d At community college, Welch wrote his first screenplay, \u201cMute,\u201d about a unique boy who meets a unique girl \u2014 a nine-minute short that was posted to YouTube and was produced by Holtorf when she was part of the area\u2019s independent film scene. He and Holtorf appeared as victims of vampires in a slasher movie, and he worked as a production assistant on a movie about a small-town sheriff pitted against a bootlegger. Holtorf said Welch dabbled but \u201cnever wanted to become an actor.\u201d His mother worked for the Locke Volunteer Fire Department on the outskirts of Salisbury, and for a time her son tried that job, too. \u201cHe hardly came around, hardly ran any calls,\u201d said Locke Volunteer Fire Chief Dusty Alexander. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t for him and he got out of it.\u201d Interviews with other friends and court records shows he also had trouble with drugs and alcohol, and in the past several months went on a rant about religion that offended his girlfriend's best friend. Danielle Tillman, 23, a friend of Welch\u2019s girlfriend, recounted meeting Welch for the first time several months ago. Tillman said a group had gathered for a party. She said she had taken acid and others were using drugs as well. The account was backed by Tillman\u2019s boyfriend at the time, Jacob Stephens. Tillman said Welch and his girlfriend began talking about religion. \u201cThey were preaching about Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cIt was super weird.\u201d Welch\u2019s Facebook page contains pictures of his children, of himself brandishing an assault-style weapon and of lists of psalms and proverbs from the Bible. \u201cLet us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up,\u201d one reads. Welch has one conviction, for driving while impaired in 2013 in Salisbury. He has been arrested several times in North Carolina, once on a drug charge, in 2007, and he was in a police report when his name appeared on a forged prescription, according to records from Salisbury police. He was twice a victim of assault by someone with a gun, though details were not immediately available. In October, police said, he was the driver of a car that struck and critically injured a 13-year-old boy. His most recent job is noted in 2013, in the impaired-driving case, where his grandmother wrote the court that he worked for his father\u2019s film company, Forever Young Productions, making daily deliveries and pickups of film prints. \u201cHe\u2019s not a nut,\u201d said Holtorf, 29, who lives in California and works as a film producer. \u201cHe talked about his two little girls, how proud he was of them, how he liked going to the park with them. He\u2019s not a conspiracy-theory nut. He\u2019s a well-educated man. Our conversations were normal, about kids and about his family and our friends in North Carolina.\u201d Jennifer Jenkins, John Woodrow Cox, Keith L.

Jackson is the favorite to win the award after a fabulous sophomore season. While his Cardinals limped into the postseason on back-to-back losses, Jackson\u2019s overall r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and unparalleled production has placed him in the Heisman driver\u2019s seat since the first weeks of the regular season. It\u00a0should be a week-long coronation for the product of Pompano Beach, Fla., who ended the regular season with 3,390 passing yards, 1,538 rushing yards and 51 total touchdowns. The last two quarterbacks to account for at least 20 touchdowns through the air and on the ground were Tim Tebow and Cam Newton, who both took home the Heisman. Here's a look at the other finalists: Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma Meanwhile, Mayfield led the Sooners to another Big 12 Conference championship and a return to the Sugar Bowl by throwing for 3,669 yards on a Football Bowl Subdivision-best 11.1 yards per pass attempt. If largely overlooked as a result of OU\u2019s two early losses to Houston and Ohio State, Mayfield closed with 22 touchdowns against just three interceptions in his team\u2019s final six games of the regular season. Jabrill Peppers, Michigan Peppers showed the multifaceted game defenders need to be a factor for the Heisman. In addition to his All-America play at linebacker for one of the nation\u2019s most punishing defenses, Peppers was a vital weapon in the Wolverines\u2019 return game, ranking first in the Big Ten and fifth nationally in yards per punt return. It would only make sense that Peppers would challenge for the Heisman while focusing primarily on defense. The last and only defense-first player to win the award also played for the Wolverines: cornerback and receiver Charles Woodson, who won the Heisman in 1997. Deshaun Watson, Clemson A reigning Heisman runner-up, Watson did outduel Jackson in Clemson\u2019s win against the Cardinals during the regular season. However, Watson had a publicized battle with turnovers as a junior, and largely failed to match or exceed his production from a breakthrough sophomore season. Not that Watson isn\u2019t worthy of another top-three finish. The engine behind Clemson\u2019s return to the College Football Playoff, he led the Atlantic Coast Conference in attempts, completions, passing yards and touchdowns during the regular season. Dede Westbrook, Oklahoma Westbrook was one-half of the nation\u2019s most prolific passing tandem, along with Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield. His 1,465 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns ranked second among all Power Five pass-catchers, while his 74 receptions were more than double the Sooners\u2019 next-most productive receiving option. Like OU as a whole, Westbrook\u2019s season took off in October. After accounting for just 17 catches in his first three games, Westbrook had 40 grabs for 881 yards and 11 scores in October alone, vaulting him into the Heisman race and helping the Sooners win another Big 12 title and reach the Sugar Bowl.

He was then asked if he would run for president.\u00a0 \"Yeah, I am,\" Biden said. \"Yeah, I am. We're going to run again.\" When pressed further, Biden backed away somewhat from his statement, saying, \"I'm not committing not to run.\u00a0I learned a long time ago fate has a funny way of intervening.\" Biden was on Capitol Hill to preside over the Senate as it cleared away procedural hurdles to a biomedical research bill he's supporting. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., got the Senate to rename a portion of the bill after the vice president's son Beau, who died of brain cancer last year. Biden's possible entry into the 2016 presidential race was a subject of intense will-he-or-won't-he speculation. He ultimately decided last October not to challenge eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The vice president previously sought the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008. He suspended his first campaign in September 1987 after becoming embroiled in a series of plagiarism controversies. In 2008, Biden ended his bid for the Democratic nomination after the Iowa caucuses and later endorsed then-Sen. Barack Obama. Biden will turn 78 shortly after the 2020 election. Ronald Reagan was just a few days short of turning 78 when he left office in January 1989, making him the oldest person to serve as president.
