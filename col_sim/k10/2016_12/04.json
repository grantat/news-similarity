The decision came two days before a court hearing was scheduled in the case. Saturday's court filing to withdraw the case said the Green Party-backed voters who filed the case \"are regular citizens of ordinary means\" and cannot afford the $1 million bond ordered by the court by 5 p.m. Monday. However, Green Party-backed efforts to force recounts and analyze election software in scattered precincts were continuing. Stein planned to make an announcement about the Pennsylvania recount Monday outside the Trump Tower in New York. Play NOV. 28: Jill Stein: This is about the American people 6:54 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161204020448if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/819163715716\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The court case had been part of an effort spearheaded by Stein to force recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three states with a history of backing Democrats for president that were narrowly and unexpectedly won by Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Related: After Trump Objection Fails, Michigan Heads Toward Presidential Recount A recount began Thursday in Wisconsin, while a recount could begin next week in Michigan. Trump's victory in Pennsylvania was particularly stunning: the state's fifth-most electoral votes are a key stepping stone to the White House, and no Republican presidential candidate had captured the state since 1988. Stein had said the purpose of Pennsylvania's recount was to ensure \"our votes are safe and secure,\" considering hackers' probing of election targets in other states and hackers' accessing of the emails of the Democratic National Committee and several Clinton staffers. U.S. security officials have said they believe Russian hackers orchestrated the email hacks, something Russia has denied. Stein's lawyers, however, had offered no evidence of hacking in Pennsylvania's election. They sought unsuccessfully in recent days to get various counties to allow a forensic examination of their election system software. Lawyers for Trump and the state Republican Party argued there was no evidence, or even an allegation, that tampering with Pennsylvania's voting systems had occurred. Further, Pennsylvania law does not allow a court-ordered recount, they argued, and a lawyer for the Green Party had acknowledged that the effort was without precedent in Pennsylvania. Play ",

    "text": "China Lodges Diplomatic Protest After Trump's Call With Taiwan's President By Melina Delkic Dec 3, 2016, 2:47 PM ET 0 Shares Ashley Pon/Getty Images; John Minchillo/AP Photo WATCH Donald Trump Speaks With Taiwan's Leader Sparking Potential Rift With China 0 Shares Email China has lodged \"solemn representations\" with the United States over a phone conversation Friday between President-elect Donald Trump and the president of Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing that China urged the relevant parties in the United States to handle Taiwan-related issues \"cautiously and properly\" to avoid \"unnecessary interference\" in the China-U.S. relationship. He did not describe details of China's complaint to the U.S., or say with whom it was lodged. \"There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory,\u201d Shuang said. \u201cThe government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China. This is a fact that is generally recognized by the international community.\" The president-elect's call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen broke with decades of delicate U.S. policy on China and Taiwan. Taiwan has held that it is an independent nation since it split from the Chinese mainland in a 1949 civil war. But the United States has maintained a \"one China\" policy since establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, meaning that it has not recognized Taiwan as its own country and rather as a part of China. Since then, no phone calls between a U.S. president-elect and a Taiwanese leader have been publicly reported, according to Center for Strategic and International Studies China expert Bonnie Glaser. The U.S. does have a \"robust unofficial relationship\" with Taiwan and commits to defending it in the event of a Chinese attack, according to the U.S. Department of State's website . The Associated Press In this Dec. 2, 2016 photo released by Taiwan Presidential Office, President Tsai Ing-wen, center, flanked by National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu, left, and Foreign Minister David Lee, speaks with Donald Trump via speakerphone in Taipei. According to a press release from the Trump transition team about the phone call, the Taiwanese president offered Trump her congratulations and he offered the same to her for her election victory this year. They discussed the \"close economic, political, and security ties between Taiwan and the United States,\" the Trump transition team said. The Taiwan president's office said in a statement that the telephone call lasted 10 minutes and that Tsai and Trump were joined by Taiwan's National Security Council secretary general Joseph Wu Chao-hsieh, foreign minister David Li Ta-wei, acting secretary general Liu Jianxi and spokesman Huang Yan. \"During the conversation, President Tsai and President Trump also exchanged views and ideas on the future governance, especially the promotion of domestic economic development and the longterm strengthening of national defense, so as to enable the people to enjoy a secure and better life,\" the statement from Tsai's office read. Meanwhile, Trump defended the move on Twitter on Friday night. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Earlier Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi initially downplayed the telephone call, describing it as \"just a small trick by Taiwan\" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV. \"The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations, and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,\" Wang was quoted as saying. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said there is \"no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues. We remain firmly committed to our 'one China' policy based on the three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.\" But the fact that the conversation took place at all is \"highly unusual\" and \"significant,\" said Dr. Claude Rakisits, of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, an expert in U.S.-South Asian affairs. \"The fact that Trump actually spoke with Taiwan [president] would irritate the communist leaders in China, in Beijing, because they would wonder, 'Is this an indication of the sort of relationship that one could expect between the U.S. and China during his presidency?'\" Rakisits told ABC News. \"I can\u2019t remember the last time a president in the U.S. actually called the president of Taiwan.\" A former Republican White House national security official said Trump's conversation with the Taiwanese leader \"will upset an apple cart that has needed upsetting for a long time.\" \"I've lived with this policy area my entire adult life and I've lived with the arguments around this for more than 25 years,\" the former national security official told ABC News. \"To me, I am thrilled that this call took place ... No one should be telling the U.S. president who he can and cannot talk to ... Especially if a very powerful competitor in the world is saying there's a risk of conflict over this territory, it's even more important for our leader to have communication with that leader.\" In the past, Trump has voiced support for a weapons deal with Taiwan, advocating a tough stance against China. Why is @BarackObama delaying the sale of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan? Wrong message to send to China. #TimeToGetTough \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2011 ABC News' David Caplan, Devin Dwyer, Chad Murray, Kirit Radia, Ali Rogin, Benjamin Siegel, Ryan Struyk and Karson Yiu contributed to this report.

Ben Bolch Contact Reporter Long after Rupp Arena had emptied, fans streaming through corridors in quiet resignation, Bryce Alford lingered in a corner of the 40-year-old building with his immediate and extended family. There were hugs, handshakes and smiles all around. Alford accepted congratulations from UCLA boosters and athletic department officials before posing for a photo with his father, Steve, and brother, Kory, everyone pulling in tight. Moments earlier, Bryce Alford had held his phone high above his head, snapping a picture of the scoreboard. The image could trigger delight for generations to come: UCLA 97, Kentucky 92. The No. 11 Bruins more than kept pace with the top-ranked Wildcats on Saturday in their first trip to this college basketball mecca. They nearly lapped them. In a stunning display of composure amid one of the most hostile environments in any sport at any level, UCLA took a giant step toward greatness. Then the Bruins downplayed ending Kentucky\u2019s 42-game home-court winning streak as if it were just another victory against an overmatched opponent. \u201cA lot of people just think we played out of our minds,\u201d UCLA freshman power forward T.J. Leaf said after a coming-of-age performance in which he tallied 17 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. \u201cI mean, we played a good game, nothing special. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d The Bruins (9-0) are a team that has made a compelling case to supplant the Wildcats (7-1) as the nation\u2019s best. They were shaky at the start and finish but oh-so-special over the game\u2019s deciding middle minutes. \u201cThey physically manhandled us,\u201d Kentucky Coach John Calipari said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that too often, especially in this building.\u201d There was a somewhat frightening finish for UCLA after  Derek Willis pulled  Kentucky to within 95-92 with 8.3 seconds left on a three-pointer following a flurry of Bruins turnovers. No biggie. Bryce Alford made two free throws  and teammate Gyorgy Goloman bounded onto the court from the bench with both arms raised in triumph after Kentucky missed a three-point attempt to seal the outcome. UCLA continued its balanced approach, all five starters scoring in double figures and point guard Aaron Holiday adding 13 points and four assists off the bench during what might have been a game-saving performance amid freshman Lonzo Ball\u2019s epic first-half struggles. Ball missed his first four shots, was beaten by a few De\u2019Aaron Fox crossover dribbles that led to Kentucky baskets and had four turnovers before making a three-pointer in the final seconds before halftime, shaking his head on the way back up the court as the Bruins went into the locker room with a 49-45 lead. Ball hardly sulked. He finished with 14 points, seven assists and six rebounds to go with his six turnovers, including a steal and a breakaway dunk that gave the Bruins an 80-71 lead after Kentucky had made a second-half surge. \u201cAfter the game he said, \u2018Hey, you know what, if I have a bad game like that, I\u2019m going to come through in the end,\u2019 \u201d Bryce Alford said, \u201cand we\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, we know. You don\u2019t have to tell us.\u2019 \u201d The moment wasn\u2019t too big for Ball or any of the UCLA freshmen. Backup center Ike Anigbogu had a block and a massive putback dunk that gave UCLA a 56-47 lead, part of a 27-17 run by the Bruins to start the second half. Leaf buried a three-pointer, drove the baseline for a dunk and made a fadeaway jumper to keep the Wildcats from making it a one-possession game until the final seconds. \u201cWhat Leaf did,\u201d Calipari said, \u201che basically dominated the game.\u201d UCLA\u2019s second victory over a top-ranked Kentucky team in as many seasons triggered some strong emotions among Bruins legends, particularly after they scored the most points against a Wildcats team coached by Calipari. \u201cUCLA WON!!!!\u201d Bill Walton tweeted. \u201cThey played so well, I am so happy!!!\u201d Said Tyus Edney, whose length-of-the-court basket against Missouri in the 1995 NCAA tournament ranks among the most iconic plays in team history: \u201cThis was fun.\u201d Josh Rebholz, a UCLA senior associate athletic director, tweeted that more than 500 tickets had been sold for the Bruins\u2019 game against Michigan next weekend at Pauley Pavilion in the hour after the game ended, leaving  fewer than 500 available. Ultimately, the Bruins showed that they wouldn\u2019t be intimidated by tradition, a scoreboard feature showing weekly highlights of five Kentucky players in the NBA or the scouts from 19 NBA teams on hand to see a handful of potential lottery picks in the June draft. \u201cWe talk about, \u2018Don\u2019t go in and jab around the ring to see if you belong. You\u2019re 8-0. You\u2019re playing well. Trust that you belong,\u2019 \u201d said Steve Alford, the Bruins\u2019 coach. \u201cThat was the key thing that guys did from the tip. They make me not think about anything except enjoying coaching them.\u201d ",

On Thursday the Senate voted to extend the Iran Sanctions Act by 10 years. The measure will now be sent to outgoing President Barack Obama to sign. Iran's state television quoted Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that the extension \"shows the lack of credibility of the U.S. government.\" On Friday, Bahram Ghasemi, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, issued a statement condemning the extension of sanctions against Iran and said the act is a clear violation of the landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and the world powers last year. Ghasemi said, \"The U.S. president has agreed within the framework of the nuclear deal that he would use his authority to prevent the legislation and enforcement of any measures in violation of the deal, such as the recent act by the Congress.\" The nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers lifted a variety of international sanctions in exchange for limitations on the Iranian nuclear program. However the U.S. still maintains its own separate set of sanctions, which are set to expire Dec. 31 if they are not extended. Ali Akbar Salehi, chief of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said on Friday that Iran will carefully consider how to respond. \"We will definitely make no emotional decisions but will make a decision based on prudence, vigilance and wisdom,\" he said. Earlier in November, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, warned that, \"Definitely, the Islamic Republic of Iran will react\" if the U.S. sanctions were renewed. State TV also reported quoted Iranian president Hassan Rouhani as saying that all signatories to the nuclear deal need to honor their commitments. \"The deal is a product of seven countries, and one country must not be allowed to undermine the deal based on its own desire,\" Rouhani said in a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Lavrentiev. 0 Shares ",

Officials said at an afternoon news conference that they remain focused on the recovery effort although they have been preparing for up to 40 deaths. \"We expect the number of deceased to go up,\" said Alameda County sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly. \"This is a very, very sensitive time.\" Emergency responders have had to delicately trudge through the rubble in the search for more victims, Kelly said. During the fire at the building \u2014 known as the Oakland Ghost Ship \u2014 the roof collapsed onto the second floor where the party was held, and parts of the second floor collapsed onto the first floor, officials said. Firefighters work at the scene the morning after a fire at a warehouse in Oakland on Dec. 3. John G. Mabanglo / EPA Fire Department Operations Chief Mark Hoffman said he saw no evidence of sprinklers. The first floor was an artists' collective made up of divided workspaces that Hoffman described as a \"labyrinth.\" Recovery crews were pulled out after the structure began to shift and became unsafe but later resumed. \"The building is very, very tricky to work,\" Kelly said, who expected crews to continue to work for the next 48 hours. \"We have water that's still coming down on top of our people. There's beams, there's all sorts of wreckage and debris that we have to maneuver through.\" The blaze happened at about 11:24 p.m. PT Friday (2:24 a.m. ET Saturday), while a party was being held in the \"warehouse-type structure,\" Oakland Fire Department Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said. At least 25 people were unaccounted for, she added. Hospitals received very few injured victims, Kelly said. \"It appears that people either made it out, or they didn't make it out,\" he told reporters. By Saturday afternoon, emergency personnel were in the \"recovery and identification process,\" Kelly said. He would only add that he expected \"a couple of dozen\" more bodies would need to be identified. Most of those who attended the party were in their 20s and 30s, and some were visiting from other countries, officials said, complicating identification efforts. Bob Mul\u00e8, a witness, told NBC News the building is a 24-hour artist collective. He said people started to smell smoke during Friday night's party.

The fire went up really really quickly.\" Mul\u00e8 suffered burns and was still waiting to hear whether his roommate escaped the blaze. The building was last designated as a warehouse and did not have permits to serve as either a residence or an event space, Darin Ranelletti, the interim director of Oakland's Planning and Building Department, said. Ranelletti confirmed his department had opened an investigation into the building Nov. 13 because of reports of blight and illegal construction inside the building. They were able to confirm the reports of blight, but they had not ascertained whether the reports of construction there were credible. \"We had an inspector attempt to enter the building,\" he said, adding that the inspector had made a visit Nov. 17. \"The inspection had not concluded, and it was still underway.\" Brandon Chase Wittenauer is missing after a fire at a warehouse in Oakland, California. via Facebook Danica Estrella told NBC News her 32-year-old brother, Brandon Chase Wittenauer, had been at the event and was still missing as of Saturday. The family was calling local hospitals trying to find Wittenauer, who is a full-time musician. Also among the missing was Feral Pines, an immediate family member confirmed to NBC News. Pines had also been at the event. Feral Pines is among those missing after a warehouse fire in Oakland, California. Courtesy of family Other relatives and friends were posting about their loved ones on Facebook, listing them as either safe or missing to spread the word. Distraught families gathered at an assistance center set up at the sheriff's substation. Dan Vega, whose brother is missing, told the San Jose Mercury News from the assistance center that the wait for answers was agonizing. \"I have my work boots, I have gloves, I just want to find him,\" he said. No smoke alarms went off after the fire, officials said. There were two known exits from the building, Kelly said. The owner of the building told NBC Bay Area through a family member that they rented the building for the last couple of years but did not regularly communicate with the tenants. The owner said they were \"so sorry to hear about the tragedy and those injured and killed,\" and were trying to figure out what happened, but declined to comment further for legal reasons. A task force was assembled to investigate the cause of the blaze. \"There's no reason yet to suspect arson, however you have to work these investigations at the worst-case scenario, and then downgrade from there,\" Kelly said. \"Something as simple as a cigarette could cause a fire that could lead to something like this.\" People place flowers near the scene of a warehouse fire on Dec. 3 in Oakland, California. Josh Edelson / AP Oakland police were looking into the history of the building and its occupancy. \"We're not going to find out all those answers right now. We're very much focused on identifying those who are still missing, locating those who have suffered loss inside who are deceased,\" said police spokeswoman Johnna Watson. According to records obtained by NBC Bay Area , the building was already under investigation for structural deficiencies before Friday's fire. The Oakland Planning and Building Department launched an investigation into the habitability of the warehouse less than a month ago, citing an \"illegal interior building structure.\" Also in November, a \"housing habitability complaint\" was filed describing how trash piles up in front of the building, creating a blight in the neighborhood, a search of enforcement records on the Oakland Department of Planning and Building website shows. Firefighters said \"some victims may have been trapped in Friday's fire since they couldn't escape down a makeshift, one-way stairwell leading to the second floor that was built out of wooden pallets,\" NBC Bay Area reported. Authorities said the pallet stairwell caught fire and was instantly incinerated. Flames rise from the top of a warehouse, which caught fire during a dance party in Oakland, California, on Dec. 3. Seung Lee / via Reuters Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf called the fire an \"immense tragedy.\" She met with a roomful of people who have loved ones who are missing and said she was unable to give them much comfort. \"It is painful to tell them that it will be a considerable amount of time before we can give them the information and the closure that they deserve,\" she said. \"But because of the devastating nature of this incident, we have been extremely limited in our ability to get access inside the structure,\" Schaaf said. Four bodies were recovered as of Saturday afternoon, Kelly said, but it is expected more bodies will be found as firefighters access a \"maze\" of twisted metal, wires and wood falling on top of each other. Fingerprints of those found were being rushed for identification, and officials are discussing bringing in cadaver dogs and robots to aid in the search, Kelly said. Fire crews are expected to be on the scene through Sunday and possibly into Monday morning, he said. Excavators will be punching holes into walls to allow access. The Oakland Athletics tweeted a link for donations for those affected and said it would match donations up to $20,000. The amount was later increased to $30,000. THANK YOU to every Oakland A's fan for helping us support our community. We will now match to $30,000. #OaklandBound https://t.co/xYHSzfb3Lz \u2014 Oakland A's \ufe0f (@Athletics) December 4, 2016 Elizabeth Chuck ",

    "text": "Trump's call with the Taiwanese president was his latest break from diplomatic norms Tsai Ing-wen Ritchie B. Tongo / European Pressphoto Agency Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen spoke Friday night with President-elect Donald Trump; no U.S. leader had spoken to the Taiwanese president in nearly 40 years. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen spoke Friday night with President-elect Donald Trump; no U.S. leader had spoken to the Taiwanese president in nearly 40 years. (Ritchie B. Tongo / European Pressphoto Agency) He praises enemies, he ignores allies, he upends decades of policy. And Donald Trump hasn\u2019t even been sworn in as president. In a series of telephone calls with foreign leaders apparently eager to congratulate the president-elect, Trump has broken many of the rules that govern delicate matters of international relations,\u00a0leaving State Department diplomats shocked and confused. The latest was Trump\u2019s decision Friday night to speak to the president of Taiwan , which no U.S. president or president-elect has done in nearly 40 years. The U.S.\u00a0has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China considers a rogue state and part of its national territory. Already, China has lodged a formal complaint about Trump\u2019s call with\u00a0Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, though given the stakes of relations between the world\u2019s two superpowers, it tempered its reaction by emphasizing that Trump was not yet setting U.S. policy. \"The one-China\u00a0policy\u201d that does not recognize an independent Taiwan \u201cis the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations, and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday, blaming Tsai for playing a \u201csmall trick\u201d on Trump. The conversation had several of the hallmarks of Trump\u2019s most notable\u00a0discussions with foreign leaders since being elected: unorthodox, out of step with current U.S policy\u00a0and prompted by opaque motives. \"We've been taken by surprise at every turn,\" one baffled national security staffer said\u00a0of the calls to foreign leaders. Trump offered no apologies, nor did his transition team make any comments. Instead, he defended the discussion\u00a0amid reams of criticism for having broken U.S. protocol by saying Tsai initiated it. \u201cThe President of taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\u201d Trump\u00a0 tweeted . Later, Trump added : \u201cInteresting how the US sells Taiwan\u00a0billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\u201d Under the Obama administration, the U.S. has sold $14 billion in weapons to Taiwan. The administration\u2019s Asia policy has centered on an effort to rebalance military and diplomatic resources toward the continent to counter the growing influence of China, though it has had limited success. Armand Emamdjomeh China was also one of Trump\u2019s frequent targets\u00a0during the campaign, and the call could have been a first salvo in changing U.S. policy under the Trump administration. He wants to increase tariffs on China, has threatened to label the country a currency manipulator and blames it in part for the loss of jobs in the U.S.\u00a0 But the sudden nature of the call with Tsai,\u00a0without informing other interested parties such as China or the White House, unsettled foreign policy experts. Trump's propensity to make and receive phone calls \"heightens concerns about Trump\u2019s foreign policy deftness,\u201d said\u00a0Jeffrey Bader, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . \"There are serious risks posed by his failure to take briefings by government professionals,\" Bader wrote in a blog post, \"and he appears to have little respect for the potential damage of actions taken without understanding long-standing U.S. national security concerns.\" Trump\u2019s call with Tsai also prompted concern because his\u00a0business empire is hoping to build in Taiwan. Similarly, after\u00a0Trump\u2019s conversation with  President Mauricio\u00a0Macri of Argentina, a journalist there suggested Trump might have asked for help with a permit to build a tower in Buenos Aires. Trump\u2019s people denied it. In conversations with British politicians, Trump asked about getting wind farms banned from land near one of his British golf courses. Trump has acknowledged that had happened. Trump has sought to put to rest questions about conflicts of interest between his business and the business of government by saying he\u2019ll step aside from operating the businesses during his presidency and will detail his plans in a Dec. 15 news conference. He has not addressed whether he will maintain ownership of his real estate and development holdings. Beyond the conflicts of interest, however, Trump is ignoring\u00a0\u00a0U.S. policy. In a telephone conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , Trump said Pakistanis\u00a0were \u201cexceptional people\u201d and \u201cone of the most intelligent people.\u201d \"Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people,\" Trump said, according to a summary provided by the Pakistani government. The overtures were consistent with Trump\u2019s blustery language, but they belied his attacks during the campaign on Pakistan as an evil sponsor of terrorism. Additionally, most Pakistanis practice Islam, and Trump has proposed banning Muslims\u00a0from entering the United States. \"You are a terrific guy,\" Trump told Sharif, whom the U.S. regards as corrupt. \u201cYou are doing amazing work which is visible in every way.\" The U.S. has diplomatic relations with Pakistan, but considers India, Pakistan\u2019s archenemy, as a closer friend. Indians were among many shocked by Trump\u2019s blithely friendly tone with Pakistan\u2019s Sharif. Trump has declined to receive most of the intelligence briefings that he is entitled to as president-elect and that might better prepare him for his dealings with foreign leaders. Trump aides are in place at the State Department to ready the agency for his administration. And\u00a0Trump does get information from the State Department, briefing books and\u00a0other sources, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway told CNN after his phone call with Tsai. The gap has left veteran government diplomats aghast at\u00a0Trump\u2019s handling of foreign affairs. In the case of the Taiwan call, the White House scrambled to emphasize that Trump\u2019s\u00a0conversation with Tsai does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy, said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council. \"We remain firmly committed to our \u2018one China\u2019 policy\u2026. \u00a0Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable\u201d relations.

    "text": "Early Trump supporter Palin suggests Carrier deal is 'crony capitalism' Published               December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Sarah Palin -- an early Donald Trump supporter and possible administration hire -- is questioning whether the president-elect\u2019s Carrier jobs deal is a case of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d The former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee says she\u2019s \u201cecstatic\u201d for Carrier employees. However, she also wonders whether Trump\u2019s successful bid to keep the manufacturer from moving 1,000 jobs from Indiana to Mexico is in fact a case of political influence on the free market, while acknowledging that the specifics of the deal remain unclear. Related Image Expand / Contract Sarah Palin \u201cWhen government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent,\u201d Palin wrote in an op-ed for the Young Conservative website. The deal purportedly involves the furnace and air conditioning manufacturer getting $6 million in tax subsidies and $1 million in training grants over 10 years. Fiscal conservatives repeatedly criticized outgoing Democratic President Obama of \u201cpicking winners and losers\u201d for providing tax credits and other incentives to so-called green energies like solar and wind power while introducing more federal regulations on coal-firing plants. \u201cRepublicans oppose this, remember?\u201d Palin wrote. \u201cWe support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.\u201d Palin is purportedly being considered for the post of Veterans Affairs secretary. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to help military veterans receive better health care through the agency and to keep the Carrier jobs from going to Mexico, part of his overarching promise to stop U.S. companies from moving operation from Midwest manufacturing states to countries with lower costs.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump expressed no misgivings about taking the call from President Tsai Ing-wen, which was arranged beforehand. He bridled at suggestions that he had committed a faux pas, writing on Twitter on Friday evening that it was \u201cinteresting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\u201d Nor did Mr. Trump or his aides make a gesture to reaffirm the One China policy, much to the chagrin of the White House. It fell to a spokesman for the National Security Council to affirm that the United States was not changing the policy. Under that policy, the United States formally recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan, as the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping , sought to bolster China\u2019s economy and create closer ties to the West. Photo President Richard M. Nixon greeted Chairman Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972 during Mr. Nixon\u2019s trip to China. Credit Associated Press Whether Mr. Trump views the call as the beginning of a change in approach toward Taiwan is not clear. A person close to him insisted that he was just being polite in taking Ms. Tsai\u2019s call. Among hard-line Republicans, there has always been a push to confront China by reaching out to Taiwan. In a statement on Friday, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who was briefly believed to be a candidate for Mr. Trump\u2019s defense secretary, praised him for taking the call, saying it \u201creaffirms our commitment to the only democracy on Chinese soil.\u201d President Ronald Reagan antagonized China by inviting a delegation from Taiwan to his inauguration. Aides to President George W. Bush pressed him to take a more confrontational approach with China until the attacks of Sept. 11 reordered his priorities, increasing the need for him to cultivate China on counterterrorism and other issues. Tensions over Taiwan peaked under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who in March 1996 ordered two aircraft carrier battle groups into the Taiwan Strait after China conducted missile tests to intimidate the island. For some China experts, shaking up the cross-strait relationship would not be the worst thing in the world. \u201cWe have had a status quo of sorts in the Taiwan Strait that has kept the peace, but it recently has not looked all that durable, nor was it very agreeable to most citizens of democratic Taiwan,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cWhether a new kind of Trumpian brinkmanship will now cause China to reconsider its hard-line position towards Taiwan, or to respond in a dangerous and militant way, remains to be seen,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump spoke harshly about China before and during the campaign, accusing it of concocting climate change as a hoax to undercut American manufacturers, branding it a currency manipulator (when it in fact is trying to prop its currency up), and threatening to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. And Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers have also advocated punitive responses to what they portray as unfair Chinese actions. A few days after he was elected, however, Mr. Trump spoke with China\u2019s president, Mr. Xi, and released a statement afterward that said the two men had a \u201cclear sense of mutual respect.\u201d Photo President Xi Jinping of China and President Obama at a ceremony in Hangzhou in September announcing the formal adoption of the Paris climate agreement. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Taiwan is also likely to seek a closer relationship with the United States. After many years under a Kuomintang government, which pursued closer ties with China, Taiwan elected Ms. Tsai as its second president from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Analysts said that Ms. Tsai, though not a firebrand, was seeking to diversify Taiwan\u2019s economic partners and carve out more space for it in international affairs. \u201cTsai Ing-wen was pretty shrewd in making the call in the first place,\u201d Mr. Huntsman said. There are also lingering questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Taiwan. The news media there has reported that the Trump Organization sent a representative to Taiwan to explore building a luxury hotel in a government-backed development near Taipei\u2019s airport. The Trump Organization does not dispute that one of its employees \u2014 assigned to promote hotel sales related to Asia \u2014 was in Taipei, the capital, in October for a work-related visit. The duties of the executive, Anne-Marie Donoghue, include trying to find guests for the company\u2019s hotels worldwide, and she is not involved in developing new real estate projects for Trump Hotels. Separately, the mayor of Taoyuan, where Taiwan\u2019s main airport is, told reporters in Taiwan last month that he had spoken in September with what appears to have been a different woman who suggested that she was associated with the Trump Organization and that the group was interested in discussing a hotel project. The mayor, Cheng Wen-tsan, did not respond Saturday to a request for comment. In a statement on Friday, Amanda Miller, the vice president for marketing at the Trump Organization, disputed that the company was pursuing any real estate deals in Taiwan. \u201cThere have been no authorized visits to Taiwan on behalf of Trump Hotels for the purposes of development, nor are there any active conversations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not planning any expansion into Taiwan.\u201d For the Chinese government, as for many other governments around the world, Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling diplomacy poses a challenge. At first, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, played down the episode, saying it was a \u201cpetty action by the Taiwan side\u201d that would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a formal complaint with the Obama administration. It urged the United States to \u201chandle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall U.S.-China relationship.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story David Shambaugh, the director of the China policy program at George Washington University, said Beijing\u2019s measured response made sense. But he said that if the Trump administration took more concrete steps to change time-tested ways of dealing with Taiwan, \u201cthey can expect additional pushback from China.\u201d Eric Lipton contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Megan Twohey from New York.

By Emily Rauhala December 3 at 10:13 AM Follow emilyrauhala The Washington Post\u2019s Jia Lynn Yang explains the backstory of relations between the United States, China and Taiwan and the ramifications of Friday\u2019s telephone call between President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. (Alice Li,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) BEIJING \u2014\u00a0On Friday, President Xi Jinping\u00a0 told \u00a0Henry Kissinger that he hoped for\u00a0\u201cstability\u201d in U.S.-China ties under the new administration. Nobody told Donald Trump. The president-elect broke with four decades of diplomatic practice by talking on the phone Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen,\u00a0a breach of protocol that could disrupt U.S.-China ties before the inauguration.\u00a0 The 10-minute phone call is believed to be the first time that a U.S. president or president-elect and a Taiwanese leader have spoken since the late 1970s. [ Trump speaks with Taiwanese president, a major break with decades of U.S. policy on China ] It left Beijing fuming and China-watchers the world over wondering,\u00a0\u201cIs this a slip-up or a major shift?\u201d The United States formally recognized the government in Beijing as representing China in 1978 and has pursued a \u201cOne China\u201d policy since 1972, when then-President Richard M. Nixon visited China. But although the U.S. government ended official relations with Taiwan in 1979, U.S. presidential administrations have maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan, which has become a thriving democracy in recent decades. Beijing remains hypersensitive to questions of Taiwan\u2019s status and is apt to treat any change in protocol or policy as a provocation \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a phone call. A spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Saturday that Beijing had lodged an official complaint with the United States.\u00a0Asked about the incident, Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the call as a\u00a0\u201cpetty\u201d move by Tsai. \u201cThe One China\u00a0principle is the foundation for heathy development of Sino-U.S. relations. We don\u2019t wish for anything to obstruct or ruin this foundation,\u201d\u00a0Wang said. Experts predicted continuing anger as Beijing takes stock over the weekend. \u201cThis is a heavy blow,\u201d said Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Nanjing University. Many questions remain about the conversation between Trump and Tsai. The president-elect tweeted Friday that Tsai called him, rather than the other way around. But Tsai\u2019s office later\u00a0 said \u00a0the call was arranged in advance by both sides.\u00a0 Analysts are divided on whether it represented a mix-up between the two governments or a more significant signal about the type of foreign policy that can be expected from the U.S. president-elect. \u201cMy guess is that Trump himself doesn\u2019t have clue,\u201d said\u00a0Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThat he had no idea about Beijing\u2019s neuralgia on Taiwan.\u201d Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Program at the University of California at San Diego, said it was an\u00a0\u201cimpulsive\u201d move and a\u00a0\u201cbad sign for Trump foreign policy.\u201d The call and Trump\u2019s subsequent\u00a0tweets raised fresh questions about who is advising the president-elect on Asia policy \u2014 and how.\u00a0 Paul Haenle, who\u00a0was on the\u00a0National Security Council staffs of former\u00a0president George W. Bush and President Obama and is now\u00a0director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said the incident showed the importance of Trump taking daily intelligence briefings, consulting with experts at the State Department and Department of Defense and quickly assembling a China team. Past administrations took a \u201cno surprises\u201d approach to Beijing, Haenle said. \u201cThe alternative \u2014 catching China by surprise on some of the most sensitive and long-standing areas of disagreement in our relationship \u2014 presents enormous risks and potential detriment for this consequential relationship.\u201d That means damage control before Inauguration\u00a0Day, experts said. That Trump is the president-elect and not yet the president leaves Beijing some room to maneuver, said\u00a0Shen Dingli, deputy dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University.\u00a0 \u201cIf he were president of the United States now, this could lead to a breaking-off of diplomatic relations between China and the U.S.\u201d \u201cHaving this mishap occur before he is president is better than having it occur after he is president,\u201d said Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cPrivately, I expect Beijing to find a way to give him an education on Taiwan.\u201d In a separate development Saturday, the Philippines\u2019 president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared details of a seven-minute conversation he held with Trump late Friday. According to Duterte, his plan to \u201ckill all\u201d the country\u2019s suspected drug users and dealers \u2014 a plan that has been condemned by the United States, the European Parliament and the International Criminal Court, among others \u2014 now has the backing of the U.S. president-elect. The campaign has left at least 4,500 Filipinos dead over about five months. During the call, Duterte said, Trump told him he was doing it the \u201cright way.\u201d \u201cI could sense a good rapport, an animated President-elect Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd he was wishing me success in my campaign against the drug problem.\u201d The comments, which have not been confirmed by Trump\u2019s team, could signal another significant twist in U.S.-Philippine ties. The Philippines is a former U.S. colony that has been a close partner of Washington for decades. Since sweeping to power last spring, Duterte has repeatedly lashed out at his longtime ally, threatening to ditch the United States for China and Russia. In September, when Obama raised questions about the bloody anti-drug crusade, Duterte lectured him on colonialism, referring to him with a slang term that translates, roughly, as \u201cson of a whore.\u201d In the weeks that followed, he made several surprise announcements on U.S.-Philippine military ties, calling for the ouster of U.S. Special Forces from the southern island of Mindanao and the end of joint U.S.-Philippine military exercises \u2014 only to backtrack repeatedly. But Trump\u2019s triumph in the U.S. presidential race saw Duterte switch direction again. Weeks after railing against \u201cuncivilized\u201d Americans, Duterte greeted the U.S. president-elect with an enthusiastic \u201clong live\u201d Trump. Duterte also mused that they might get along \u2014 because they both like to swear. The Afghan government said Saturday that Trump and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had also spoken. Ghani\u2019s office said that during their phone call Ghani congratulated Trump on his win and expressed the hope of further cooperation between their countries under Trump\u2019s administration.

The fires, described as the state's largest in 100 years, are believed to be human-caused, authorities said. Twelve of the victims died as a direct result of the firestorm, and one victim died of a heart attack while trying to escape a blaze, officials said at a news conference this morning. The briefing was held in Gatlinburg -- one the worst-hit cities in Sevier County. \"It certainly is distressing and saddening to all of us, and we are extending our sympathy to all the families that are involved,\" Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said. \"I can\u2019t describe you the feeling that we have over this tragedy, and, especially, the loss of lives.\" SLIDESHOW: SLIDESHOW: Wildfires Devastate Eastern Tennessee Town The identifies of six of the 13 deceased have been confirmed, Waters said. He emphasized that authorities want to make sure they are \"absolutely certain\" that they are accurate on the names of the deceased and that their immediate families have been informed before releasing such information to the public. Six victims were identified by officials today. - John Teglar, 71, and Janet Teglar, 70 -- who had been visiting from Canada - Jon Summers, 61, and Janet Summers, 60 -- who had been visiting from Memphis, Tennessee - May Vance, 75, a Gatlinburg, Tennessee, resident who died from heart attack related to smoke inhalation - Alice Hagler, 70, a Gatlinburg, Tennessee, resident At least 85 other people have been injured as a direct result of the fires, and more than 1,000 structures have been severely damaged or destroyed, according to Waters. Officials believe that 90 percent of the affected areas in the county will have undergone a preliminary search by this evening, Waters said. He added that \"we hope and pray\" the death toll does not climb. Bill May/Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts/EPA A school building burns as wildfires move through Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Nov. 28, 2016. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is continuing to follow up on leads to locate reported missing persons, Waters said. Anyone who wants to report a missing person, or knows of a missing person who has been found, is urged to call the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND. Homeowners and renters in Gatlinburg have also finally been allowed to go into the city to check on their properties as of this morning, Waters said. He added that officials hope to have Gatlinburg open to the public by Wednesday, Dec. 7. Property owners can also check on the condition of their properties via an interactive map at www.seviercountytn.org , Waters said. He added that it was important to note that the map will be gradually updated, so owners should check back frequently throughout the weekend.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam , Sen. Lamar Alexander and Sen. Bob Corker also attended the news conference this morning. Haslam said he has received calls of support \"from almost every governor in the country,\" as well as from President Obama, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \"We all love these mountains,\" Haslam said. \"It's a special place.\" Yin Bogu/Xinhua/Redux Pictures Local resident Ralph Cogdill checks the debris of his house which was ruined by a wildfire in Pigeon Forge, Sevier County, Tennessee, on Nov. 30, 2016. Alexander said though the fire was \"terrifying and impressive,\" the community's and nation's response to it \"is even more impressive.\" \"My heart breaks for the families who've lost loved ones and homes, but I know you'll be back because east Tennesseans are strong, tough and resilient,\" he said. Corker acknowledged that having 13 lives lost was \"an incredible tragedy,\" but he said he also wanted to give his \"hats off\" to the first responders and volunteers. Brian Blanco/Getty Images Volunteers and evacuees watch a news segment about the nearby fire in Gatlinburg, Tennessee at a shelter, on Nov. 29, 2016, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Towards the end of the news conference, a few reporters got into a heated exchange with officials. The reporters questioned if people in the area were given early enough notice to evacuate. Officials noted that an evacuation alert was sent out to mobile phones in the area around 9:04 p.m. Monday, though power outages made some notifications difficult to send. One official noted that if some people did not receive the alert sent out then, \"of course we're unsatisfied.\" Waters said at another news conference this afternoon that the storm was a tragedy and that authorities did the best they could. \u201cWe're going to evaluate the responses and what went on at the appropriate time,\" he said. \"That time is not now.\" 0 Shares ",

Brown was apprehended at the scene and was taken into custody without resistance, they said.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to make clear this was not a random act,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cThis victim was targeted by the suspect.\u201d Aguilar said police were interviewing possible witnesses at the campus police station across the street from the Mudd building, which houses the psychology department and classrooms used for biology, chemistry and other science courses. Clusters of students passed by the building, but walkways through the area were cordoned off.\u00a0 \u00a0 Paul Duginski Paul Duginski Earlier, in immediate response to the stabbing, USC issued a campuswide alert about the police activity on campus. \u201cNo danger to USC or the community,\u201d the text said. \u201cStay away from area.\u201d There were no signs\u00a0that the slaying had rekindled the widespread concerns about campus safety that flared after high-profile slayings of students from China in 2012 and 2014\u00a0prompted\u00a0USC to adopt\u00a0more extensive security measures. Murad Houry, a senior pre-med student, said the attack did not  make him feel less safe. He said it only made him more aware of how violence can occur anywhere and saddened that some students could be driven to such unimaginable acts. Mainak Sarkar , a former doctoral student, had killed himself after storming through a UCLA building and fatally shooting a highly regarded professor inside a small fourth-floor office. But the note Sarkar... The gunman was dead. Beside him, two semiautomatic pistols, extra magazines and a backpack. Mainak Sarkar , a former doctoral student, had killed himself after storming through a UCLA building and fatally shooting a highly regarded professor inside a small fourth-floor office. But the note Sarkar... (Matt Hamilton, Teresa Watanabe, Kate Mather and Richard Winton) When he heard the news, he said he immediately thought of the slaying of a UCLA professor earlier this year by one of his students. William Klug, a popular engineering professor, was shot and killed by Mainak Sarkar, 38, a former doctoral student who accused him of stealing his research and giving it to someone else.\u00a0 \u201cUCLA immediately came to mind,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cAnother stressed-out student, another professor.\u201d Houry, a resident assistant for many pre-med freshmen who took classes in the Mudd Building, texted all of them to\u00a0check on their safety. They were fine, he said, but he was preparing to offer support and a listening ear to them Friday night.\u00a0 Yesenia Brasby, a freshman pre-med student who had a chemistry class this semester in the building where the stabbing occurred, said he was surprised that it happened right next door to the police station. \u201cWe feel safe in our little bubble, but that's just not the case. Anything can happen anywhere,\u201d\u00a0she said. With the recent stabbings at Ohio State University and the UCLA shooting, she said, \u201cI feel like I always try to be aware of my surroundings now. Just because there's a gate [on campus]\u00a0doesn't mean something won't happen inside, on campus.\u201d Zhongtang Li, a teaching assistant and\u00a0fourth-year doctoral\u00a0student in\u00a0chemical engineering from Shanxi, China, said he was stunned when he learned of the slaying after encountering a campus police barricade and had to turn around and walk home. He said the stabbing seemed more frightening than a shooting because it was up close and personal. Li said he does not feel as safe as before and is second-guessing how he interacts with his own students.\u00a0 \u201cI think I\u2019m good with my students, but even so, I will be even more careful now on whether I'm going too hard on them,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m worried. It seems like more and more people are losing self-control ... USC is a good school, the students here work hard to come here, they have a good education \u2014\u00a0how can anyone act like this?\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for so long;\u00a0this is the worst thing to have happened on campus, the hardest to understand.\u201d He said he thinks about the other senseless violence that has\u00a0occurred in the area. \u201cRandom killings off campus, now a stabbing on campus,\u201d\u00a0he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to graduate as soon as possible,\u201d\u00a0he said, walking quickly away.

Acting on information gathered in the investigation, Louisiana State Police found and arrested Kavon Manuel, 20, at a home in the Lafayette area.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Manuel will be extradited to New Orleans to face a charge of second-degree murder and nine counts of attempted murder, New Orleans police said in a news release. The arrest comes after New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and state and federal law enforcement announced the Thursday night arrest of Jordan Clay, 20, as the other suspect in the incident . info Jordan Clay, who was arrested late on the night of Dec. 1, 2016, for second degree murder in connection to the shooting that happened on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on Nov. 27, 2016, is seen in this undated booking photo released by the St. Martin Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office. Close St. Martin Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office via AP Harrison said Clay and Manuel had an ongoing dispute and just happened to run into each other early Sunday on Bourbon Street. Killed in the cross fire was Demontris Toliver, 25, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The surviving victims included seven men and two women, ranging in age from 20 to 37. Police said none of the wounded had life-threatening injuries. \u201cWe made a promise to track down the suspects responsible and bring them to justice, and together, we made good on that promise,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI want to thank the Louisiana State Police, FBI, ATF and Lafayette Police Department for providing the resources we needed to get the job done.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately known if either Clay or Manuel had a lawyer. The French Quarter shooting erupted hours after Saturday\u2019s annual Bayou Classic football between Southern University and Grambling State University - and the tourist district was bustling with visitors after the Thanksgiving holiday. Harrison said the shooting, which occurred about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, had nothing to do with the classic matchup. He also said that between 30 and 40 police officers and EMS crews were in the district then and responded quickly. Landrieu praised that fast response Friday. Speaking at a news conference, he also said the shooters showed \u201ca complete disregard for the lives of those around them.\u201d Toliver\u2019s father Kim appeared at the news conference and held up pictures of his son. He asked \u201ceach and every one of y\u2019all to keep us in your prayers,\u201d saying that he has lost \u201ca part of my life.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Demontris Toliver was a tattoo artist and a New Orleans native. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

REUTERS Email Fresh off a deal with air-conditioning company Carrier , President-elect Donald Trump is now singling out another company leaving its Indiana plant for Mexico: Rexnord, which plans to nix 300 union jobs from their factory in Indianapolis. Mr. Trump sent a tweet Friday about Rexnord, charging that it was \u201crather viciously firing\u201d workers and vowing \u201cNo more!\u201d Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Rexnord Bearings announced the move to union officials in mid-November, saying it was going forward with plans to shift the plant\u2019s 300 union jobs and dozens of supervisory jobs to Mexico, according to a report by CBS News\u2019 local affiliate . The move is expected to begin in April and finish by June of next year. Rexnord did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The tweet came just one day after Mr. Trump announced the Carrier deal, which keeps about 800 manufacturing jobs in Indianapolis in exchange for massive tax subsidies amounting to $7 million over 10 years. Several hundred jobs will still be moving to Mexico. Backlash for the deal was swift, even as some Carrier workers called it a relief. Mr. Trump took heat from both sides of the aisle, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders saying in a Washington Post op-ed that it \u201csignaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives.\u201d And Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential nominee-turned-conservative pundit, criticized the arrangement as a threat to free market principles. Writing an opinion piece for the Young Conservatives website Friday, Palin blasted the deal as \u201cfavoring one business over others\u201d and setting \u201cinconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

This is what's known, so far, about the fatal fire. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) OAKLAND \u2014 California officials fear dozens may have died in a massive fire that swept through an Oakland warehouse where a concert was taking place Friday night. Nine people have been confirmed dead, and dozens of others remain missing, officials said. In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they expected the death toll to rise, but they did not know by how much. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting the worse \u2014 maybe a couple dozen victims here,\u201d Sgt. Ray Kelly, spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, told reporters. \u201cWe did not have a lot of victims go to the hospital,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt appears that people either made it out, or they didn\u2019t make it out.\u201d Drones equipped with thermal technology were being used to scan the building for possible survivors, Kelly said. Initial reports, however, were grim. \u201cThe drones were being used with a thermal imager,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very helpful technology. It allows us to focus in, and we can actually see the heat coming off of someone if they are alive. We didn\u2019t see any heat signatures of live people. Not to say that there\u2019s not, but the chances are very small.\u201d The three-alarm fire was reported at about 11:30 p.m. Friday at a building off 31st Avenue and International Boulevard, about three miles outside of downtown Oakland, according to the Oakland Police Department. [ This is how the devastating Gatlinburg wildfire erupted overnight ] The fire broke out during a party\u00a0featuring musician Golden Donna\u2019s 100% Silk West Coast Tour . Oakland\u00a0Fire Chief Teresa Deloach-Reed told The Washington Post that more than 50 people were\u00a0inside the building,\u00a0a warehouse known as the Oakland Ghost Ship\u00a0that served as a venue for artist exhibits and parties. The city planning and building department had previously investigated the warehouse due to complaints about trash outside the property and illegal internal structures built inside the warehouse, said Darin Ranelletti, the department\u2019s director. Complaints had been filed about the building as recently as November. Ranelletti said authorities are still investigating whether people were living in the building. Due to the building\u2019s zoning, neither habitation nor a concert would have been legal without permits. The building\u2019s interior featured a tangled network of antique furniture, artwork, musical instruments, wooden lofts, tapestries and oddities, such as mannequin parts, according to a Tumblr blog that appears to\u00a0show\u00a0the building. \u201cIt was a labyrinth,\u201d said Mark Hoffman, deputy chief of the Oakland Fire Department. The concert was being held on a second floor, where most of the nine bodies were later found. By the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the staircase to the second floor had burned away, Hoffman said. The building\u2019s instability slowed the recovery effort on Saturday. Officials said the building\u2019s roof had collapsed onto the second floor and, in many areas, the first floor as well. Firefighters and structural engineers spent much of the day shoring up the structure so it was safe to enter the building and recover the bodies. Authorities said it wasn\u2019t clear whether electrical issues, pyrotechnics, or errant candles or cigarettes had started the fire, and that an arson investigation would also be underway. Fire officials said the building did not have sprinklers. The fire is not being investigated as a crime, Officer Johnna Watson, a spokeswoman for the Oakland Police Department, said Saturday. Officials asked for patience and respect for the victims\u2019 families as they investigate the many questions that remain, including the fire\u2019s cause, the building\u2019s history, and whether the party\u2019s attendance exceeded its maximum occupancy. At a news conference on Saturday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said she had met earlier that day with a \u201croomful\u201d of people who were missing loved ones. \u201cThis is a devastating scene. This is complicated and it is going to take us time to do the methodical, thorough and professional investigation that these families deserve to find out what in fact happened,\u201d she said. The majority of those inside the building were young people, some of whom were from outside the Bay Area or the United States, Kelly told reporters. A fire broke out at a warehouse in Oakland, Calif., where a concert was taking place on the night of Dec.2, killing at least nine people. At least 25 people are reported missing. (Oakland Fire Dept.) The event\u2019s Facebook page \u00a0filled with inquiries on Saturday from people looking for their loved ones or offering their assistance to families and friends of the victims. Friends and family members of the concert goers also cobbled together a list of missing people in a shared Google docs spreadsheet, along with identifying features and contact numbers. Forty names were listed on the spreadsheet as of Saturday evening; seven were marked either safe or in the hospital. Deloach-Reed said fire officials will verify those names against the ones they have compiled. \u201cThis is pretty tragic for us,\u201d Deloach-Reed said. \u201cIt is hitting this community pretty hard. I don\u2019t even want to talk about how the families and friends are feeling. We have a community that\u2019s hurting.\u201d The warehouse is located on 31st Avenue, a short block off Interstate Boulevard, one of the main thoroughfares in East Oakland\u2019s Fruitvale neighborhood. The building itself was considered to be an \u201cartist collective,\u201d as city officials put it, with spaces there for artists to work. \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d Pete Veilleux, friend to several of the building\u2019s residents and the owner of a nearby native plant nursery called East Bay Wilds, said. \u201cIt was like an art gallery, but people lived there.\u201d Veilleux was walking with his 10-year-old dog, Lucy, hoping to get updates on the status of the people he knew who lived there. He was relieved to learn that some of them had made it out all right, but still didn\u2019t know what had happened to everyone. He said he visited the space often, but never attended parties that were hosted there, like the one that took place Friday night. \u201cI\u2019ve been there before the parties and after the parties, but I wasn\u2019t that into big parties,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the events because I don\u2019t like big parties.\u201d Such parties are a common part of the Oakland community, which features an eclectic underground club and music scene. Joel Shanahan, a Wisconsin-based electronic dance musician\u00a0whose stage name is Golden Donna and who was headlining the concert, survived the fire,\u00a0 according to the artist\u2019s Facebook page . \u201cJoel is safe but like many people he is heartbroken and has several friends among the missing,\u201d according to a Facebook post. At least two organizations, the\u00a0 Oakland A\u2019s \u00a0and\u00a0 Gray Area Foundation , set up online relief funds for the victims. More than $50,000 had been raised as of Saturday evening. The Golden State Warriors planned to hold a moment of silence to honor the victims from the fire before Saturday night\u2019s game against the Phoenix Suns at nearby Oracle Arena. A total of 72\u00a0firefighters responded to the fire, Deloach-Reed said. Crews\u00a0had to fight the blaze from outside\u00a0because it was too hot and intense for firefighters to go inside the building, she said. Battalion Chief Lisa Baker said three sides of the building were on fire, the San Jose Mercury News reported . [ Death toll rises to 13 in Tennessee wildfires as grim search for survivors continues ] A large blaze and thick smoke was seen coming from the building at about 3 a.m. Saturday. Watson, of the Oakland Police Department, said investigators have talked to people who either left the building before the fire broke out, or were able to escape. She declined to share further details. Deloach-Reed said this is the worst fire the city has seen since the Oakland hills firestorm \u00a0that killed 25 people in 1991. That fire, which rapidly spread through the Oakland hills wiped out nearly 3,500 homes, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . City officials made it clear it will take time for a full investigation and search-and-rescue mission to be completed. Kelly said it would take \u201ca minimum of 48 hours\u201d to recover all the bodies within the structure. News like that won\u2019t be much comfort to people like Danetta Logan. A postal worker with a route starting on 69th street, a few miles east of the warehouse, Logan was on the scene hoping to find a woman on her route, Mary Canteras, who she said had been alone and searching for her missing 14-year-old daughter since 4 a.m. \u201cI came here hoping to see her because she\u2019s been out here by herself,\u201d said Logan, who was in uniform. \u201cI talked to her, and she was out here and her phone was going dead, so I\u2019m sitting here hoping she calls back.\u201d While police couldn\u2019t confirm there were any minors present at the party, there appeared to be at least one, which was what made Logan most upset about the entire tragedy. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest problem with this,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a lot of babies that got let in.\u201d Bontemps reported from Oakland. Swanson and Guerra reported from Washington. 1 of 19 ",

Taiwan is self-ruled, but China claims the island nation as one of its provinces. On Saturday, China\u2019s foreign minister described this controversial call as a \u201clittle trick\u201d by Taiwan, and the Chinese government has already contacted the Obama White House to file an official complaint, CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett reports. Trump, breaking with U.S. policy, speaks with Taiwan's leader Meanwhile, the president-elect and his transition team are on defense, deflecting criticism and experiencing the delicacy of diplomacy. No U.S. president-elect has spoken with a Taiwanese head of state since diplomatic ties were severed in 1979 - until Friday. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team said the two discussed \u201cthe close economic, political and security ties ... between Taiwan and the United States\u201d and that President Tsai Ying-wen congratulated the president-elect on his victory. After hearing critcisms, Mr. Trump tweeted: The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Pointing out inconsistencies in U.S. dealings with Taiwan, Mr. Trump continued: Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 \u201cI think that President-elect Trump may not be fully aware of all of the details of the history of our relations with Taiwan,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, an expert on U.S.-China relations. New China concerns after Trump Taiwan call Glaser said America\u2019s unofficial relationship with Taiwan exists because of the 1972 \u201cone China policy,\u201d a U.S. agreement to accept the island nation of Taiwan as part of China\u2019s territory and not a sovereign nation. \u201cThe notion that the United States and an incoming president of the U.S. might be supporting a pro-independence agenda will be very, very worrisome to China, and it will cause some problems in the U.S.-China relationship potentially,\u201d Glaser said. Conway on \"spirited\" Harvard clash with Clinton aide, Carrier deal Senior transition adviser Kellyanne Conway said Mr. Trump intentionally took the call. \u201cHe either will disclose or not disclose the full contents of that conversation, but he\u2019s well aware of what U.S. policy has been,\u201d Conway said on CNN. During the campaign, Mr. Trump accused China of waging economic war on the U.S. through currency manipulation. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Fort Wayne, Indiana. But he also promised better relations with the communist government. \u201cI have a great relationship with China, made a lot of money dealing with China,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Atkinson, New Hampshire. \u201cChina is terrific.\u201d Upon hearing of the call, the White House said there has been no change of its long-standing policy on cross-strait issues, and it was firmly committed to the \u201cone China\u201d policy. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images The debate over encryption and government access to secured communications dates decades back. But for many Americans, it grabbed their attention in the early months of this year, in the aftermath of the Dec. 2, 2015, mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. It was a saga that unraveled over weeks . Looking for leads on the terrorist's iPhone, the FBI wanted to crack the PIN code on the device. The bureau got a court order and demanded that Apple write special software to thwart security measures that otherwise threatened to erase its content if muscled through. Apple refused to help and took its case public. The two sides battled it out in court , in Congress and in the media . Apple argued such software amounted to a master key and would encourage other countries, like China or Russia, to make similar demands for other iPhones. The law enforcement community said that increasingly secure encryption was making devices \"warrant-proof.\" FULL COVERAGE: The Apple-FBI Debate Over Encryption The conversation about encrypted devices quickly merged with that about encrypted communications. Ultimately, the FBI paid a mysterious third party and unlocked the phone without Apple's help. Over the following months, several bills appeared and faded in the outgoing Congress. The heat has subsided. The conversation moved on. Or so you might think. Article continues after sponsorship A few weeks ago, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. \u2014 a vocal opponent of insurmountable encryption \u2014 renewed his call for new laws to make sure that law enforcement has a way to extract the content of locked iPhones. \"In (Manhattan) alone, 423 Apple iPhones and iPads lawfully seized since October 2014 remain inaccessible due to default device encryption,\" the report from Vance's office says, arguing later: \"There is an urgent need for federal legislation that would compel software and hardware companies that design or build mobile devices or operating systems to make such devices amenable to appropriate searches.\" From a technical perspective, it's essentially a plea to turn back time. Judges Have More Power In Granting Warrants To Hack Digital Devices During and since the Apple-FBI standoff, the push for stronger encryption has been marching on. On the newer devices, Apple says it's just not technically feasible for the company to unlock passcodes or otherwise extract data, warrant or no warrant. Google, despite its struggle to push updated software to the fragmented market of various Android devices, is also promoting default encryption. WhatsApp, the most popular messaging platform, has doubled-down on encryption and has even introduced secured video chat. The list goes on. \"I don't see a situation where the government ... is going to force Apple to roll back encryption of the iPhone. I think that ship's sailed,\" says Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"Law enforcement has to deal with the fact that we live in the world of encryption. And the way the feds are dealing with it is embracing the hacking.\" Soghoian explains that encryption doesn't completely shut down surveillance but pushes it further out from the networks that deliver the communications \u2014 where they are scrambled \u2014 to the devices where it gets unscrambled for the user. Internet Freedom Wanes As Governments Target Messaging, Social Apps That's one of the reasons why internationally instant messaging apps and communications platforms have, for the first time, emerged as \"the most routinely targeted tools\" by governments. That's according to this year's Freedom of the Net report by the Freedom House, which found WhatsApp being the most restricted app around the world. Earlier this week, judges in the U.S. gained wider power to authorize government hacking of digital devices well beyond their districts. Reuters has reported that the newly re-elected Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who chairs the Intelligence Committee, is likely to reintroduce his encryption legislation requiring companies to build \"back doors\" into their products for the government \u2014 but this time, with the support of the incoming Trump administration. So far, none of Donald Trump's picks for security posts are experts on cyber, and details of his stance are relatively hard to surmise. During the Apple-FBI debate, Trump called for a boycott of Apple to pressure its compliance with the FBI's demand. But he hasn't voiced a specific position on encryption. Cyber Aggression Takes A Back Seat To Other Presidential Campaign Issues Also unclear is Trump's plan for the post of FBI director, occupied now by James Comey, who led the bureau's fight against Apple but also played a prominent role during the campaign-season controversy about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. One likely possibility, Soghoian says, is a behind-the-scenes push for the right of government authorities to compel app or device makers to deliver specially created software to particular phones. Also possible is an effort to make companies retain more data they collect about their users \u2014 including, for instance, unencrypted metadata, such as time and length of a conversation, rather than its content. This becomes even more relevant in the era when more and more things get connected to the Internet without being particularly secure. Encryption May Hurt Surveillance, But Internet Of Things Could Open New Doors And finally, there's the matter of state and local law enforcement. Investigations across the country have struggled with the lack of technical expertise and budget to tackle crimes involving tech devices. Soghoian worries that when the surveillance or hacking tools begin to trickle down, abuses will be particularly visible. For now, he expects prominent voices like Manhattan's Cyrus Vance to continue making their case. ",

By Dan Balz Chief correspondent December 3 at 3:00 PM Follow @danbalz Every four years, the Institute of Politics at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government assembles the managers of the presidential campaigns for a deep, post-election debrief. It is always illuminating and generally civil, with occasional fireworks. Because the 2016 election was unlike any other, this year\u2019s managers conference was also unlike any other. In the immediate aftermath of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory over former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, all the leading players said the right things. Trump called for healing and said that he would try to bring the country together. Clinton asked her supporters to give the newly elected president the space and opportunity to govern. President Obama, despite harsh words for Trump through the campaign, said that he would assure an orderly transfer of power in the spirit of reconciliation. But everyone knew or should have known that the wounds from an election that was as raw and divisive and negative as campaign 2016 would not be quickly healed. That especially includes those who were the principal antagonists, the people who ran the campaigns during the general election. At Harvard\u2019s IOP , it all gushed forth, creating perhaps the most contentious session that this series of conferences, which began in 1972, had ever seen. The general election session was the culmination of the two-day conference, which was organized in collaboration with Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Earlier sessions plumbed, separately, the Republican and Democratic nomination battles, as well as one about initial strategic assumptions of the many major-party candidates who sought the White House this year. On Thursday night, the dinner included a lively conversation among media executives, punctuated by some dissenting interjections from the audience, about the role of the news media, a topic that will be a continuing focus of debate as the new Trump administration takes and exercises power. Overall the sessions were tame, until the final Thursday afternoon, when the pent-up fury of the campaign finally erupted. Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane on Nov. 6. (Andrew Harnik/AP) My colleagues Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker provided a full account of what transpired when the leading advisers for Trump and Clinton sat across the table from one another for 2 1/2\u00a0 hours to offer a historical rough draft of how the general election campaign unfolded. The headline on their story described it as a \u201cshouting match.\u201d (For the sake of full disclosure, I helped to moderate the general election session, along with NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell and BuzzFeed\u2019s Katherine Miller.) [ Trump supporters appear willing to let him decide which promises to fulfill ] What captured the biggest headline was an explosive exchange between Clinton\u2019s communications director Jennifer Palmieri and Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway over whether the Trump team had run a campaign that had empowered the voices of white nationalists. Palmieri bluntly said Trump had done so and that she would rather have lost the election than run a campaign the way she asserted Trump did. Conway angrily stood her ground, denying the charge and contending that Clinton lost through her own inadequacies, as she and Palmieri spoke over and past each other. The combination of pain and resentment toward Trump among Clinton advisers was never much below the surface. This was an election that the Democratic nominee expected to win in what would have been a history-making event. Her advisers were confident of that victory until the moment late on the night of the election when their path to 270 electoral votes had been finally blocked by Trump\u2019s breaching of the \u201cblue wall\u201d in the northern industrial states. They were devastated by the loss. Campaign manager Robby Mook\u2019s explanation of why Clinton lost focused heavily on the intervention by FBI Director James B. Comey in the final 10\u00a0days. Mook said Comey\u2019s twin moves concerning the FBI\u2019s probe into Clinton\u2019s emails contributed significantly to the outcome, noting that late-deciders broke far more for Trump. He also acknowledged shortcomings by the campaign, including a failure to produce the kind of support among key parts of the Obama coalition \u2014 whether young voters, suburban women or African Americans \u2014 that the campaign had estimated she would need to win. What Mook and his colleagues found difficult to acknowledge, in part because they were there to shield their candidate from too much blame, was Clinton\u2019s weakness as a candidate and the hostility that she had engendered \u2014 fairly or unfairly \u2014 over a long period of time that hampered her inability to connect more effectively with enough voters. That will remain an important, if not fully measurable, aspect of what cost her the election \u2014 and it was something Trump\u2019s team was determined to assert throughout the discussion. If there was pain and resentment on the Clinton side (along with some expressed respect for what Trump\u2019s team pulled off), there was another emotion that emanated from Trump\u2019s advisers, an expression of grievance born of an apparent feeling of a lack of respect for what their candidate had done after so many said he was destined to lose. The same combativeness that marked the election was on display time and again during the discussion from Trump\u2019s side of the table \u2014 an anti-establishment sentiment of us-vs.-them that will probably animate Trump\u2019s presidency. President-elect Donald Trump's chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon decided not to attend an event at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, but protesters took to the streets of Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 30, regardless. (Twitter/Eli Gerzon of Jewish Voice for Peace) [ What Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks are saying about the president-elect ] There\u2019s no question that the newly elected president scored a great upset and deserves credit for running a far more shrewd campaign than his critics contended throughout the election. Some of those who attended the Harvard sessions as observers said afterward that the Trump team demonstrated more competence and skill as they discussed what happened than some of the caricatures of the operation as the contest was unfolding. But Trump\u2019s victory, however shocking to those who never anticipated it, was no landslide, as some of his advisers have claimed. He won 306 electoral college votes. While that is better than George W. Bush managed in both of his presidential campaigns, it is a smaller number than in the victories by Obama, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Beyond that, Trump now trails in the popular vote by almost 2.6\u00a0million votes, or 1.9\u00a0percentage points, according to compilations posted by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. His breakthrough victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which sealed his victory, were each by less than a percentage point and by a combined total of fewer than 80,000 votes. All that became another flash point over whether Trump had won a true mandate. When the Clinton team said no, Trump advisers bristled in response. We won, they said. Case closed. As the campaign managers were delivering their analyses Thursday afternoon, Trump was on the road to begin a series of rallies to thank his supporters. He started in Cincinnati, and it was as if the campaign had never ended, with the buoyant president-elect reveling in his victory. Chants of \u201clock her up\u201d echoed through the arena when he mentioned Clinton, and he laced his speech with another attack on the \u201cdishonest\u201d news media. Outside the arena, protesters signaled their unwillingness to reconcile. So it should have been no surprise that, in the conference room at Harvard University, the tensions between the two sides were so vividly displayed. The emotions are testament to the deep divisions that will continue to exist and to the long and challenging road ahead for the 45th president and for the country he will govern. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

During the briefing, Ryan repeated comments indicating that changes to Medicare would have to accompany any effort to repeal and replace President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

During the briefing, Ryan repeated comments indicating that changes to Medicare would have to accompany any effort to repeal and replace President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (Alex Wong / Getty Images) Mike DeBonisThe Washington Post House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made clear Thursday that he is willing to pursue a major overhaul of Medicare , including changes that could eventually put private companies in charge of the health care for tens of millions of American seniors. But talk of wholesale changes to the popular federal programs has key GOP lawmakers nervous about overshooting their electoral mandate. \"Save Medicare for another day,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. \"We want to begin immediately to repeal Obamacare . . . . Trying to deal with the solvency issues with Medicare at the same time falls into the category of biting off more than you can chew. It's an important issue, it's one I'm ready to address, but a little humility here would be in order. We can't do everything at once, and we shouldn't try.\" Ryan has long advocated for a major Medicare overhaul, one that would convert the 50-year-old public health insurance program for seniors and the disabled into a system that would help beneficiaries purchase private insurance. Republicans tend to call such a model \"premium support,\" saying it is the best way to control Medicare's long-term costs, while Democrats refer to it as \"voucherization\" or privatization and argue that it would mean less comprehensive coverage for vulnerable Americans. President-elect Donald Trump reassured voters during his insurgent political campaign that he would protect Medicare , Social Security and other popular federal assistance programs. But in tapping Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to be his Health and Human Services secretary, he has elevated one of the most... President-elect Donald Trump reassured voters during his insurgent political campaign that he would protect Medicare , Social Security and other popular federal assistance programs. But in tapping Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to be his Health and Human Services secretary, he has elevated one of the most... (Noam N. Levey and Noah Bierman) On Thursday, Ryan repeated comments he made shortly after the election indicating that changes to Medicare would have to accompany any effort to repeal and replace President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He spoke carefully about how far those efforts might go, but he did not rule out pursuing a premium support model for future retirees -- a stance Ryan has held for years, dating back to his days chairing the House Budget Committee, and one that was included in his recent \"Better Way\" policy agenda. \"We are going to have to do things to preserve and shore up this program,\" he said Thursday. \"The reforms that we've been talking about here in the House Republicans for many years are reforms that do not affect the benefits for anyone in or near retirement. But for those of us who are in the younger generations, the X Generation on down, it won't be there for us if we stay on the current path. So we have to do things to fix this program so we can guarantee that it's there intact for current seniors but also that there's something there for us when we retire.\" Those fixes, he said, \"are nothing different than what federal employees have: You get to choose among plans that are comprehensive and guaranteed to meet your benefits. Or if you want to stick with the current traditional program, you can do that as well.\" Ryan compared his plan to Medicare Advantage -- an option for seniors where the federal government pays a private insurer a flat rate for each beneficiary rather than directly paying a health care provider for services rendered -- calling that a program that \"works pretty darn well right now, that seniors like.\" Ryan also repeated a frequent talking point, that \"Medicare itself is on a path to going bankrupt\" though he did not specifically blame the Affordable Care Act as he has in the past. The Washington Post Fact Checker has concluded it is misleading to say that Medicare would go bankrupt and flat-out incorrect to blame Obamacare, which has extended the solvency of the key Medicare Part A trust fund by nine years.

But the president-elect appears to have downgraded plans to act aggressively to control rising drug prices,\u00a0handing the pharmaceutical industry an early... (Noam N. Levey) What also has Medicare's defenders nervous about a push for premium support is President-elect Donald Trump 's intention to nominate Rep. Tom Price , R-Georgia, as his secretary of health and human services. Price succeeded Ryan as chairman of the House Budget Committee, and, like Ryan, he has embraced premium support as a way to roll back federal entitlement spending over the long term. Also on Thursday, Rep. Kevin Brady , R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and a Ryan ally, also told the Associated Press that premium support remained on the GOP agenda, though he said the more immediate priority would be \"taking steps, small, in preparing for larger steps to save Medicare for the long term.\" Democrats, eager to seize on an issue important to voters that swung toward Donald Trump this year, have quickly mounted a fierce response to any suggestion that Medicare might be privatized. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., the incoming Senate minority leader, accused Republicans of \"plotting a war on seniors\" this week after Trump announced his intention to nominate Price to his cabinet. \"We say to our Republicans that want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day,\" he said. \"We're going to fight tooth and nail any attempt to privatize, voucherize or any other-ize you can think of when it comes to Medicare. To Republicans considering going down this path, my advice is simple, turn back.\" The treacherous politics of entitlement reform is one reason several Senate Republican polled this week said that they were not eager to pursue major Medicare changes -- at least not right away, as part of an Affordable Care Act repeal.

As congressional Democrats prepare to deal with a Republican White House ,\u00a0they appear ready to take the opposite approach, effectively challenging President-elect... (Lisa Mascaro) \"My guess is, we'll have our hands full doing what we need to do with Obamacare,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt , R-Missouri, a member of the Senate GOP leadership team. \"It's fair to say that Obamacare's done a lot of damage to Medicare. And because of that, it will necessarily become part of that discussion. But . . . I think it'd be a mistake to talk about specifics right now. We've got enough to do focused on first steps on Obamacare and we need to stay focused on that until we get that bill passed, and then we need to start looking at how you repair the damage done by Obamacare.\" Ryan on Thursday accused Democrats of trying to \"play Medi-scare politics, which is what they typically do every other Tuesday.\" That prompted Schumer to speak up again: \"The people who are genuinely and rightly scared are millions of American seniors who don't believe privatization of Medicare will be in their interest.\" Schumer and other Democrats are set next week to deliver a petition signed by more than a million activists urging Ryan and Republicans to keep their \"hands off Medicare.\" Could Republicans, with control of the White House and both houses of Congress, privatize Medicare? They might have to in order to enact a Trump agenda that includes a major tax cut and increased military and infrastructure spending without exploding the national debt. One major hurdle would be in the Senate, where the are likely to be 52 Republican senators and it typically takes 60 senators to pass legislation of any consequence. However, major parts of a Medicare overhaul -- perhaps the entirety of one -- could be passed through the budget reconciliation process which reduces the threshold to a simple majority of 50. Compare that to Social Security, the other major driver of long-term federal budget deficits, which is specifically exempted from reconciliation and thus must garner 60 votes. The other major hurdle is Trump, who on numerous occasions during the campaign said he would not cut Medicare, Social Security or Medicaid , the federal health care program for the poor. Ryan and many congressional Republicans favor significant reforms to all three. \"Every Republican wants to do a big number of Social Security,\" he said during an April 2015 speech in New Hampshire. \"They want to do it on Medicare. They want to do it on Medicaid. And we can't do that.\" \"I'll save Medicare,\" he said in a Fox News Channel interview the following November. \"You don't get rid of Medicare. You can't do that. People love Medicare, and it's unfair to them.\" But while Trump has never endorsed any specific Medicare reforms beyond eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, the health care agenda posted on his transition website includes this cryptic item: \"Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation -- and beyond.\" Ryan said Thursday he has not discussed Medicare with Trump, but he left the door open to use budget reconciliation to aggressively pursue GOP policies. \"This is our intention -- to use every tool we've got to make progress for the American people, to make good on the promises that were made,\" he said.

Allen says one of the cheerleader sponsors was killed. Authorities identified her as 52-year-old Elizabeth Pope.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re in a time of shock and grief and we\u2019re trying to piece everything together and figure out how do we best need to handle this when we have school on Monday,\u201d Allen said, according to CBS Odessa affiliate KOSA . The seven others were taken to hospitals in Big Spring and Lubbock. Four had been treated and released by Saturday afternoon.\u00a0 University Medical Center in Lubbock spokesman Eric Finley says three individuals remained hospitalized - two in critical and one in satisfactory condition. Photos from the scene showed the school bus with its front end crumpled against the damaged side of a tractor trailer rig. The wreckage from the crash was being removed from the site overnight following an investigation, KOSA reported . In a statement to KOSA, Iraan High School Principal Jim Braum said: \u201cOur community is tremendously grateful to the first responders from Big Spring, the folks who stopped to render aid, and the staff at Scenic View. The love and compassion they showed our kids and community are evidence that we still love one another in West Texas.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Woods shot a four-under 32 on the front but hit some adversity on the back of his third round at the Hero World Challenge. Back-to-back bogeys on holes 13 and 14 were plagued with mishits off the tee, leading to a two-over 38\u00a0on the back nine.

Bowe Bergdahl arrives for a pretrial hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C. Bergdahl, a former prisoner of war accused of endangering his U.S. comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan is asking President Barack Obama to pardon him before leaving office. White House and Justice Department officials say Bergdahl submitted the clemency request. If granted, it would allow Bergdahl to avert a court-martial trial scheduled for April. He faces charges carrying a maximum penalty of life in prison. (AP Photo/Ted Richardson, File) 0 Shares Email U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the former prisoner of war who's accused of endangering comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan, is asking President Barack Obama to pardon him before leaving office. White House and Justice Department officials said Saturday that Bergdahl had submitted copies of the clemency request seeking leniency. If granted by Obama, it would allow Bergdahl to avert a military trial scheduled for April where he faces charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. If the pardon isn't granted, Bergdahl's defense team said it will expand its legal strategy to the new administration by filing a motion arguing President-elect Donald Trump violated his due process rights with scathing public comments about the case. The pardon request to Obama, first reported by The New York Times and Fox News, was confirmed by White House and Justice Department officials who weren't authorized to discuss the matter by name. Bergdahl, of Hailey, Idaho, walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was held captive by the Taliban and its allies for five years. The Obama administration's decision in May 2014 to exchange him for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prompted criticism that included some Republicans accusing Obama of jeopardizing nation's safety. Some lawmakers were outraged that the administration didn't give Congress a 30-day notice about transferring the detainees, as required by law. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump was Bergdahl's most vocal critic, saying repeatedly the soldier is a traitor who would have been executed in the \"old days.\" During a July speech in Indiana, Trump lamented that Bergdahl could wind up with a light punishment. \"Remember the old days? A deserter, what happened?\" he said before pantomiming pulling a trigger and adding: \"Bang.\" Bergdahl's lead defense lawyer, Eugene Fidell, declined to comment Saturday on the pardon request. But Fidell said he plans to file a motion seeking dismissal of the charges against Bergdahl shortly after the January inauguration, arguing Trump violated Bergdahl's constitutional due-process rights. The defense has been noting Trump's comments about Bergdahl in what they've dubbed the \"Trump Defamation Log.\" A version included in the court record lists 40 such instances as of August. \"All of these things put together and repeated rally upon rally for basically a year have a cumulative effect that I think is totally at odds with the right to a fair trial,\" Fidell said in a phone interview. A spokeswoman for Trump didn't respond to emails seeking comment. There is precedent for a military judge to decide a president's comments have tainted a military prosecution. In 2013, a Navy judge cited comments by Obama when he issued a pretrial order that two defendants in sexual assault cases couldn't be punitively discharged if they were found guilty. The judge wrote that Obama's public comments about cracking down on sexual assault, specifically referencing dishonorable discharges, appeared to be demand particular results from military courts. \"People in the military do what their commanders tell them to do,\" said Eric Carpenter, a law professor at Florida International University who served as an Army lawyer. He said there's a risk that military jurors could punish Bergdahl because they think it's what their commander in chief wants, rather than deciding strictly on the evidence. Carpenter said he'd be surprised if the Army judge dismissed the charges entirely, but he could give the defense leeway to question potential jurors and reject them based on their answers about Trump. Bergdahl, who faces trial at Fort Bragg, has said he walked off his post in Afghanistan because he wanted to cause an alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Drew reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Japan's bombing of U.S. military bases at Pearl Harbor brings the U.S. into World War II. (Photo: AP) It was whaling, sugar and pineapples that first brought Pearl Harbor to America\u2019s attention. At the whaling industry\u2019s peak in 1846, nearly 800 whaling vessels made port calls in the Hawaiian Islands, mostly U.S.-flagged ships, according to Navy history and heritage command. The Navy was ordered to send regular patrols around the islands to protect the commercial whaling ships from pirates or rival nations. The impact on Hawaii, an exotic land where natives farmed and fished for centuries, was dramatic. Ship repair facilities cropped up, and Honolulu and Lahaina became bustling towns catering to hungry, thirsty and sometimes rowdy sailors. Bakeries, laundries, carpenter shops, blacksmiths and boarding houses sprang up overnight, according to a Navy history command account of those years. \u201cBusiness was booming,\u201d said Guy Nasuti, a Navy historian. Just when it seemed the growth would never stop, it did. The discovery of oil in 1859 in Pennsylvania devastated the whaling industry, since the need for whale oil for lamps and other uses drove much of the demand. The Civil War then devastated what was left of the fleet. The Confederate ship Shenandoah pursued Yankee whaling ships into the farthest reaches of the Pacific, successfully sinking many of them, in an effort to knock the air out of the Union economy. By the late part of the 19th century, Hawaii\u2019s whaling boom was over. But Washington didn\u2019t lose interest in using Hawaii as a toehold in the Pacific. The Civil War may have helped kill the whaling industry, but it provided Hawaii with another economic opportunity and America with another chance at getting a Pacific port. The North\u2019s boycott of Southern sugar led to an expansion in imports from Hawaii, helping to make sugar plantation owners rich. Pineapples would emerge as Hawaii\u2019s second-largest export crop. At about the same time, Washington was growing more interested in establishing a more robust naval presence in the Pacific. Hawaii was a natural choice. Maj. Gen. John Schofield and Brevit Brigadier Gen. B.S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii in 1873 aboard the USS California on a secret mission \u201cto examine the defensive capabilities and potential commercial facilities of the Hawaiian Islands,\u201d the Navy history said. \u201cWith one exception there is no harbor on the islands that can be made to satisfy all the conditions necessary for a harbor of refuge,\u201d Schofield wrote. \u201cThis exception is the harbor of the \u2018Ewa\u2019 or \u2018Pearl River.\u2019 \u201d Two years later, the United States and Hawaii signed a \u201creciprocity treaty\u201d allowing Hawaii to export sugar to the United States duty-free in return for a pledge that Hawaii would not lease the Pearl River inlet to any other country. Naturally, the sugar barons put pressure on King Kalakaua to sign the treaty. In return, the United States got what it viewed as access to a well-defended port in the Pacific. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii and, in the years following, \u201cbegan to look more seriously at the need for an American military presence in the Pacific,\u201d the Navy history said. Pearl Harbor again emerged at the center of America\u2019s Pacific ambitions. \"Tora, Tora, Tora\" is the Commemorative Air Force's recreation of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that signaled the beginning of the American involvement in World War II. \u00a0(Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK) In testimony before the House of Representatives, Schofield said Pearl Harbor would be an ideal harbor for a modern navy, said Steve Twomey, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who wrote Countdown to Pearl Harbor: The Twelve Days to the Attack. \u201cYou have to define modern navy in the era before airplanes,\u201d Twomey said in an interview. The harbor was sheltered with a narrow approach, which made it easily defendable from attacking ships. That terrain feature would, of course, become a vulnerability, as the fleet was bottled up and getting out meant navigating a narrow channel. In the early years of the 20th century, Pearl Harbor remained more of an outpost than the major naval base it would become in the years leading up to World War II, Twomey said. The islands had no oil or coal, and U.S. ships did not make it a permanent base. \u201cEverything the Navy needed had to be imported from the West Coast,\u201d Twomey said. It was a high point for the Navy and American global power. President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the Great White Fleet, consisting of 16 battleships, to circumnavigate the globe in 1907. Among the young officers participating in the cruise was Adm. Husband Kimmel, who would be commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet when Pearl Harbor was attacked more than three decades later. The base expanded gradually during the early part of the 20th century. By 1911, the channel to Pearl Harbor had been dredged enough to allow large vessels to navigate it, according to the Navy history. The USS California was the first deep-draft ship to navigate the channel. A coaling station, Marine barracks, an ammunition magazine, hospital and submarine base were soon added, the Navy history said. By 1940, Washington was worried about Japan, which was growing more militaristic and expansionist. Again, Pearl Harbor was the answer. President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the entire Pacific Fleet, nearly 100 ships, to Pearl Harbor to deter growing Japanese aggression. Roosevelt, a former assistant Navy secretary, was fascinated by the sea service and didn\u2019t hesitate to involve himself in the minutest details of naval policy. \u201cRoosevelt saw himself as a naval expert,\u201d Twomey said. The arrival of the Pacific Fleet brought Pearl Harbor to a new level. \u201cThe fighting strength of Pearl Harbor was at its peak,\u201d Twomey said. Pearl Harbor was also congested. It would take hours to get the entire fleet out to sea in the case of an attack. It was a vulnerability that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by some commanders. \u201cAll you had to do was drive down here when the fleet was all in,\u201d Army Lt. Gen. Walter Short said, according to Countdown to Pearl Harbor. \u201cThere was too little water for the number of ships.\u201d Not long afterward came the devastating attack. But Pearl Harbor\u2019s history didn\u2019t end on Dec. 7, 1941. The base remained a major supply facility for the Pacific theater during World War II and later served as a logistics hub for the wars in Korea and Vietnam. In 2010, the airfield and port were merged to create Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, and in recent years the Pentagon has said it plans to refocus on the Pacific as the U.S. troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan declined and concerns about China grew. \u201cAmerica needed Pearl Harbor,\u201d Nasuti said, referring to the years leading up to World War II. It still does. 63 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gyOsDO ",

Firefighters responded to the three-alarm fire at the warehouse in Oakland around 11:30 p.m. local time Friday. They fought the fire for hours before putting it out. Officials said there may have been as many as 100 people inside the two-story building in Oakland's Fruitvale district when the fire broke out. People either got out unscathed or were trapped inside the structure which had no sprinkers. \u2014 Oakland Firefighters (@OaklandFireLive) December 3, 2016 Police told KTVU the building houses a group of artists and their studios. Just before noon local time officials said they were beginning \"a recovery and identification process.\" \"This is just a tragedy,\" Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the sheriff in Alameda County said. The warehouse party featured musician Golden Donna\u2019s 100% Silk West Coast tour. Most of those who were killed were found on the second floor, the East Bay Times reported. Fire Chief Teresa Deloach-Reed said firefighters saw no evidence that smoke detectors were activated during the fire and there was no sprinkler system in the\u00a0building, according to the paper. The blaze is already being called one of the deadliest single-structure fires in Oakland\u2019s history, if not the deadliest, the paper reported. \u201cThis is a true loss for the city, for the firefighters who responded, and the people who lost family and friend. It\u2019s just tragic, a real tragedy,\u201d the paper quoted the fire chief as saying. At a morning news conference, Deloach-Reed said the warehouse space was divided by partitions and the only staircase to the second floor was made of wood pallets. \u201cThe way the building is situated, it made it difficult to escape,\u201d she said. She said the cause of the fire was under investigation. Friends and family of those unaccounted for were on social media early Saturday looking to confirm the whereabouts of their loved ones, according to the paper. Some people have posted images and messages on Facebook of people they believe are missing, while other have posted that they had escaped safely, the paper reported. A photographer who lives in the building told reporters the flames forced him to leave behind a friend who broke his ankle. \u201cIt was too hot, too much smoke, I had to get out of there,\u201d Bob Mule said, according to the East Bay Times. \u201cI literally felt my skin peeling and my lungs being suffocated by smoke. I couldn\u2019t get the fire extinguisher to work.\u201d Mule, who suffered minor burns, told KTVU he hoped his friend was alright. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

Joseph Lewis, Donzell Lloyd and Jwan Farley are charged with felony robbery in two robberies on Grace Street and Waveland Avenue on Dec. 3, 2016. (Chicago Police Department) Rosemary Regina Sobol Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Three men are accused of a pair of armed robberies in Lakeview early Saturday, police said. Joseph Lewis, 20, of the Far South Side, Donzell Lloyd, 19, and Jwan Farley, all of the South Side, are charged with three counts of robbery, according to police. The trio robbed one woman at 2:40 a.m. in the 900 block of West Grace Street and another woman five minutes later in the 1200 block of West Waveland Avenue, police said. The victims were walking alone on sidewalks when the attacks happened. In both attacks, Lewis and Lloyd and Farley drove\u00a0up in a car and blocked the women as they\u00a0walked\u00a0near alleys, and then got out and threatened them with guns while demanding their property, police said. A friend of one of the victims who was nearby spotted the license plate on the car and call 911. The friend helped responding officers when they got there; police stopped the car at 1600 North Lake Shore Drive and took them into custody after finding the victims\u2019 items, police said. Lewis, of the 11200 block of South Peoria Avenue, Lloyd, of the 8800 block of South Dante Avenue and Farley of the 8100 block of South Kenwood Avenue, are slated to appear in court Sunday.

The jury said they were deadlocked twice this afternoon, and after the second time, they requested additional explanation of the law in an attempt to reach a unanimous decision. Ultimately, the jury ended up breaking for the weekend without a verdict. Earlier this afternoon, the jury sent three notes to the judge, indicating their divisions and that specifically there was a single holdout. The holdup comes at the end of Slager's high-profile state murder trial. Slager, who is white, was accused of killing Walter Scott , an unarmed black man, at a traffic stop on April 4, 2015, in North Charleston while Slager was an officer with the city's police department. Witness video that surfaced shortly after the deadly encounter appears to show the moment Slager fatally shot Scott as he ran away. The video garnered national attention, propelling Slager into the spotlight. Slager was fired from the force after the shooting, according to The Associated Press. ",

Elizabeth Weise , USATODAY 3:26 p.m. EST December 3, 2016 x Share With a winter storm warning in effect through Saturday, the summits of Hawaii's Big Island could get more than two feet of snow. USA TODAY NETWORK In this image made from webcam video provided by Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the CFHT telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island is covered in snow on Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016. The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a winter storm warning for the summits of Hawaii's Big Island as wind and snow engulf the high peaks. (Photo: Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, AP) Hawaii's highest peak could get up to another foot of snow Sunday, on top of the 2 feet that have\u00a0fallen since Thursday, the National Weather Service says. A winter storm warning is in effect for the summits of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea through Saturday evening. \u201cThen we\u2019re expecting another round on Sunday and Sunday night,\u201d said Matthew Foster, a staff meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu. The initial storm started on Thursday and was slowing down Saturday, \u201cthough some freezing drizzle is still possible,\u201d Foster said. The next storm is currently about 400 miles west of the island of Kauai and should arrive over the islands sometime on Sunday, Foster said. \u201cThis one won\u2019t be quite as strong when it moves over the Big Island, so we\u2019re putting it as possibly 12 more inches of snow,\u201d he said. The rest of the island, and all of Hawaii, remains warm if somewhat wet, with heavy rains in some areas that have caused flash flooding. \u201cThe grounds are already saturated now, so it doesn\u2019t take much,\u201d Foster said. The snow at the peak of Mauna Loa is not uncommon because it is so high, nearly 14,000 feet. \u201cAs long as we have deep enough clouds to support ice crystals, and when you have cold enough temperatures at the summit level, you can get snowfall,\u201d said Foster. Mauna Loa and its sister peak of Mauna Kea are both volcanos. Mauna Kea is the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Snow on the peaks is not uncommon in the colder months of the year, though deep snow is rare. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see three to five snow events a year during the cold season. Some years we might not get any, some years we might get more,\u201d said Foster. The only other area of Hawaii that gets snow with any regularity is the Haleakal\u0101\u00a0volcano on Maui, which at about 10,000 feet gets snow once every five years or so, he said. 2250 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 31 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gzVpVj ",

The blaze began at about 11:30 p.m. on Friday. (Josh Edelson / AP) Through the early-morning hours, people used the page to seek information about friends and loved ones who attended the concert. Some frantically listed the names of missing people and posted their photos, hoping to learn their fates. \u201cMaking a new post with the names we currently have missing at the Sheriff's office. PLEASE comment if you know 100% if any of these people are safe,\u201d\u00a0one person wrote. \u201cThe police have asked for missing people\u2019s photos and identifying features. Piercings, tattoos, clothing they were wearing, weight, birthday, hair color etc. they asked to post on this Facebook event. Please post info here,\u201d\u00a0wrote another. Deloach-Reed told the East Bay Times that it appears \u00a0there were no smoke detectors or fire sprinklers in the building. She said the fire may have started near a makeshift stairwell, which might have made it more difficult for people to escape. \u201cThis is a true loss for the city, for the firefighters who responded\u00a0and the people who lost family and friends. It\u2019s just tragic, a real tragedy,\u201d she said. ",

REUTERS President-elect Donald Trump wished the Philippines well in its bloody war on drugs during a call with President Rodrigo Duterte Friday, according to statements by the Philippine leader. Duterte said in a video that Mr. Trump was \u201cquite sensitive\u201d to the nation\u2019s controversial drug crackdown, which has resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings since June, when Duterte first took office. \u201c[Trump] wishes me well in my campaign and said that we are doing it as a sovereign nation, the right way,\u201d Duterte said of the Friday call, in which he described an \u201canimated\u201d president-elect. \u201cI could sense a good rapport,\u201d the Philippines leader said. \u201cHe was wishing me success in my campaign on the drug problem. He understood the way we are handling it and he said that there\u2019s nothing wrong in protecting your country.\u201d Duterte said he appreciated the call from Mr. Trump -- who Duterte has posited in the past that he could be friendly with -- and also wished the incoming U.S. leader success. During his own contentious campaign for the Philippines presidency, Duterte had promised to use law enforcement to hunt down drug traffickers and users, warning the country was at risk to become a \u201cnarco state.\u201d 27 Photos The Philippines' deadly drug war \u201cWhen I become president, I\u2019ll order the police and the military to find these people and kill them,\u201d Duterte vowed during his campaign in March. \u201cThe funeral parlors will be packed.\u201d Since his inauguration, the Philippines president has made good on that promise, launching an anti-drug operation called \u201cDouble Barrel\u201d which has taken the lives of nearly 5,000 people, according to Duterte. The Trump transition team released its own statement on the Friday call between the two leaders, mentioning none of the details Duterte offered. \u201cPresident Rodrigo Roa Duterte of the Philippines offered his congratulatory wishes to President-elect Trump,\u201d the readout said. \u201cIn their conversation, they noted the long history of friendship and cooperation between the two nations, and agreed that the two governments would continue to work together closely on matters of shared interest and concern.\u201d Reuters reported the president-elect also invited Duterte to visit the White House during their phone conversation. Under the Philippines\u2019 new leadership, anxiety has blossomed over whether the U.S. and the Philippines, closely allied nations, would maintain its relationship. Duterte, known for his anti-U.S. stance, has previously blasted President Obama and the State Department for their condemnation of his drug war\u2019s gang-land style killings. Duterte famously once said in a speech that Mr. Obama can \u201cgo to hell\u201d and has called the U.S. leader a \u201cson of a whore.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

It was the site of clashes in late October that resulted in over 140 arrests. Moving further east alongside the signless border where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land meets private property, there are dozens of floodlights that shine down on pipeline workers who work through the night and bitter cold to finish a pipeline that is now more than 90 percent complete. \"We're here and we're not going anywhere.\" Their goal is to reach the banks of the Missouri where they then will have to cap the pipeline, pending an easement review being conducted by the Army Corps.

Scott Kilian The Obama administration has on multiple occasions asked that Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the project, voluntarily stop construction. The installation of hyper-beam lights here last month shows that request has been ignored. Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren, who remained publicly silent on the pipeline for months as protests forced a halt in the pipeline's construction, told NBC News in an interview last month that he was \"100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration,\" regardless of what the Army Corps ultimately decides. Warren labeled most of the protesters near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, who call themselves water protectors, as \"violent mobs.\" Play ",

There are at least another 25 people unaccounted for, Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said Saturday morning, according to The Associated Press. From television station KTVU : \"Alameda County Sheriffs Office Sergeant J.D. Nelson says the building is not safe enough to enter. He also says the coroner's office is preparing for 40 or more bodies. No bodies have been removed from the building. Nelson says this is the largest mass casualty they have prepared for since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.\" The fire started around 11:30 p.m. Friday, in a two-story warehouse in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood, according to the East Bay Times , during an electronic music show headlined by Golden Donna of Madison, Wisc. Friends posted on the event's Facebook page , searching for information about people still missing. More than 190 people had RSVP'd for the Facebook event as of Saturday. A Google document compiled for friends and family members to gather updates listed 28 people as missing, two people safe in the hospital and one safe as of Saturday morning local time. Article continues after sponsorship Fire Chief Reed described the space as a \"makeshift warehouse\" that people had converted into a \"live-work type facility.\" Most of those killed by the fire were on the second floor and there was no evidence of sprinklers, the fire chief said, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle . Video from the Oakland Firefighters Local 55 shows a massive blaze with plumes of smoke visible blocks away. \"We still have to do a more thorough search of the building and we don't know the potential number of other victims,\" Reed said, according to the East Bay Times, which added that no firefighters were injured. About 50 people lived in the building, the Times said, describing it as an \"artists' collective.\" \"It was too hot, too much smoke, I had to get out of there,\" photographer Bob Mule, who lives in the building, told the newspaper. \"I literally felt my skin peeling and my lungs being suffocated by smoke. I couldn't get the fire extinguisher to work.\" The roof of the building collapsed and firefighters were still waiting for the building to be safe enough to enter, KTVU reports as of Saturday morning.

Caption President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. \u00a0Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Trump said at a rally on Dec. 1, that he will nominate Mattis as defense secretary. Carolyn Kaster/AP By John Wagner and Sean Sullivan December 3 at 4:15 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @WaPoSean Just two weeks ago, President-elect Donald Trump appeared poised to assemble a Cabinet as unconventional as he is, drawing heavily from a band of quirky loyalists that included several from the fringes of the Republican Party. But as he moves rapidly toward assembling his roster of top advisers, Trump instead is pulling together a more orthodox GOP team than many expected, including a defense secretary nominee, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has received solid marks from the party establishment ahead of his formal unveiling Monday. The emerging Cabinet has gone a long way toward mollifying some of Trump\u2019s Republican critics, and several of the picks \u2014 including the wife of the Senate majority leader as transportation secretary \u2014 are tailor-made to encourage cooperation between the administration and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. The incoming team is preparing not only to implement longtime Republicans goals \u2014 such as repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes \u2014 but also to push for Trump\u2019s iconoclastic and controversial campaign promises on issues such as a border wall and trade. But the group and the president-elect are also fraught with conflicting views over key issues including Iran policy, Medicare and immigration, raising the risk of infighting and fractiousness both within the administration and with Congress. Several of Trump\u2019s early personnel picks were \u201cmore directly in your face, while others that have come forward since then are decidedly less so,\u201d said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. \u201cAt this point, I would say the Republican establishment that was so attacked by Trump during the campaign is doing pretty well in shaping his administration.\u201d Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Trump, who cast himself as a hard-edged populist during the campaign, is also moving faster in the pace of announcing his picks compared with recent predecessors. The biggest test of Trump\u2019s interest in broadening his inner circle still looms, with his choice of a secretary of state, one of the most important posts in any administration. Aides have publicly identified four finalists for the job, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. If Trump gives the nod to Romney, long one of his fiercest Republican critics, it would send a reassuring signal to the party\u2019s moderate wing and to the nation\u2019s foreign policy establishment \u2014 a need seen as all the more urgent after Trump caused a diplomatic uproar when he broke decades of precedent Friday by speaking directly with the president of Taiwan. But the prospect of picking Romney \u2014 who called Trump a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cphony\u201d during the campaign \u2014 has already sparked strong objections from some of Trump\u2019s die-hard supporters. Richard Viguerie, a longtime conservative activist, said that he, like many others, considers a potential Romney appointment a mistake but can understand Trump\u2019s thinking. \u201cHe knows he cannot fight two wars at the same time,\u201d Viguerie said. \u201cHe can\u2019t fight the Democrats and the establishment Republicans. They\u2019re still a big presence in Congress, and he probably wants to make nice with them.\u201d Several of Trump\u2019s more recent choices appear to have the imprint of Mike Pence, the vice president-elect. The Indiana governor and former House member is well-regarded by the party\u2019s conservative wing but has also served as a bridge to the party establishment. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood financier, is President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for treasury secretary. He spoke at Trump Tower Nov. 30. (The Washington Post) Trump turned to some of his staunchest and most controversial allies for his earliest White House picks, including former campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive, as his senior counselor. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who during the campaign led \u201clock her up\u201d chants directed at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, was named national security adviser. Trump\u2019s choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general also seemed in no small part a reward for his loyalty during the tumultuous campaign. Since then, however, Trump has shown a willingness to put rivals and others outside his orbit in key slots. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), who endorsed two of Trump\u2019s rivals at various points in the Republican primaries, was named as his choice to become the ambassador to the United Nations. And on Friday, Trump met in New York with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who left the door open to joining the Republican administration. Another Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) is also being eyed by the Trump team for a possible job. Other recent picks by Trump may be unconventional in some respects \u2014 they would be hard to imagine in the Cabinet of Jeb Bush or John Kasich, two of his primary rivals \u2014 but bring familiar credentials to the posts they have been asked to fill. For treasury secretary, Trump tapped Steven Mnuchin, a loyalist who served as finance chairman of his campaign. Mnuchin comes from a conventional place for recent treasury secretaries of both parties: He spent 17\u00a0years at the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs. Likewise, Trump rewarded campaign booster Wilbur Ross with his nod to be commerce secretary. Like many others before him, Ross is a successful businessman; in his case, though, he is known for his investments in distressed industries. For transportation secretary, Trump tapped someone as establishment as they come in Washington: Elaine Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush and held other posts in previous Republican administrations. She also happens to be the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a relationship that certainly cannot hurt Trump\u2019s promised effort to push a $1\u00a0trillion infrastructure plan through Congress early in his tenure. Many of Trump\u2019s choices will arrive with a history of toiling toward long-held Republican objectives that Trump embraced during his campaign. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), whom Trump reached outside of his immediate orbit to tap as health and human services secretary, is among the leading critics of the Affordable Care Act, the signature achievement of President Obama that Republicans have been seeking to dismantle since its enactment in 2010. Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire and conservative activist who Trump nominated for education secretary, has spent years pushing to expand voucher programs in several states that give families taxpayer dollars to pay for private and religious schools \u2014 objectives simpatico with Trump\u2019s call on the campaign trail to expand school choice. And Sessions has established himself as one of the harshest critics of illegal immigration on Capitol Hill, a credential that should bolster the work of a candidate who advocated deporting millions of undocumented workers and building an extensive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), an early Trump supporter who is serving as the transition team\u2019s liaison to Congress, said the Cabinet that Trump is building \u201cabsolutely\u201d signals that the president-elect will try to move swiftly on the agenda that he talked about on the campaign trail. \u201cThe people being picked to run the departments with jurisdiction over those issues, I think, are in 90-plus\u00a0percent lockstep with his positions,\u201d Collins said. Still, taken as a whole, Trump\u2019s emerging team is far more diverse \u2014 in Republican terms \u2014 than many speculated in the immediate aftermath of a campaign in which he surrounded himself with GOP has-beens such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. While Giuliani remains a finalist for secretary of state, the prospects for both men to hold sway in Trump\u2019s Cabinet seem to have faded. \u201cI think Giuliani and Gingrich are just loose fruits right now,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cNo one knows where to put them.\u201d With the choices he has made so far, Trump has pleased or at least calmed some of his chief Republican critics during the campaign. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who was a vocal critic of Trump during the campaign, noted positively that Trump has added former detractors to his team, including Haley for the U.N. post. \u201cWe\u2019re still not done. Still got some to go. But I\u2019ve been pleased with some of them,\u201d Flake said. That view was echoed by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who announced in August that she would not vote for Trump or Clinton. \u201cI think he\u2019s made some good appointments,\u201d she said. And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who continued to criticize Trump after ending his own GOP presidential bid, took to Twitter to praise the choice of Mattis as defense secretary, saying he would \u201cprovide great leadership.\u201d None of which is to say that governing will be easy for Trump \u2014 even with his party holding both the White House and Congress. Several stress points seem certain to surface between the populist president and more traditional Republican members of Congress, assuming Trump keeps his word on some key promises. The GOP takeover of the White House, for instance, has emboldened House Republicans to pursue an agenda that includes privatizing parts of Medicare, the popular program for seniors. It is uncertain how that will square with Trump\u2019s rhetoric as a candidate who sought to distinguish himself from other Republicans by pledging to leave Medicare and some other safety-net programs untouched. While Trump and congressional Republicans share a goal of repealing Obamacare, there has been less agreement over what exactly to replace it with. Trump has only promised something better. Trump could also face resistance on his immigration plans from some Republicans who argue that overreaching will prove costly at the ballot box among Latinos, a rapidly growing segment of the electorate that the party cannot afford to write off. And there are bound to be tensions on trade, where Trump\u2019s views are far more isolationist than what his party has long advocated. In some cases, Trump\u2019s nominees hold positions directly contrary to his. Mattis, for example, recently told Trump that he does not believe in the effectiveness of waterboarding, one of the \u201ctough\u201d interrogation techniques the president-elect has vowed to reinstate. Mattis favors working with allies to enforce the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has vowed to tear up. The defense secretary nominee also reportedly has told colleagues that he understands the relationship between global security and climate change, a phenomenon Trump has said he wants to address far less aggressively than the current administration. Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian, said that he sees numerous tension points ahead, spawned from what he called \u201ca marriage of convenience\u201d between the president-elect and other leaders of the Republican Party. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what kind of arrangement this marriage is going to need to keep going,\u201d Naftali said, arguing that making campaign promises a reality will be much tougher for Trump than continuing to tout them at campaign-style rallies, such as the one he held in Cincinnati on Thursday. \u201cHe can go out on the hustings and have great big rallies, and then he still has to come back to Washington and make sausage,\u201d Naftali said. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

By Aaron Blake December 3 at 9:33 AM Follow @aaronblake President-elect Donald Trump. (Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) One of the chief concerns of President-elect Donald Trump's detractors during the presidential campaign was that the brash and notoriously loose-lipped real estate executive wouldn't be able to handle the delicate balancing act that is diplomacy. It's one thing to make wild claims domestically; it's another to inflame a fellow world power with a careless word or two. Today, a fellow world power \u2014 China \u2014 is inflamed. And\u00a0 Trump's controversial conversation with Taiwan's leader , which broke nearly four decades of protocol when it comes to U.S.-China relations, harks back to another controversial bit of diplomacy: Trump's first big foreign visit as the Republican nominee to Mexico. That visit erupted into a major political problem for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and by the end of it, the two sides were offering different versions of what had happened. Similarly, Trump and Taiwan\u00a0seem to be at-odds about precisely what just occurred. Back in August, Trump claimed after a meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto that the they hadn't discussed Trump's plan to somehow force Mexico to pay for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his staff\u00a0 quickly differed with that account , saying he had told Trump that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall. \"At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" https://t.co/0hXHfX4oH2 \u2014 Jim Dalrymple II (@JimDalrympleII) August 31, 2016 A week later, Trump doubled down on his version of events \u00a0and seemed to suggest Pe\u00f1a Nieto wasn't being truthful, telling ABC News: \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that. He tweeted that long after the meeting was over. He didn't say that.\u201d Much as with Mexico, Trump and Taiwan are now apparently differing\u00a0about precisely what their call entailed. China considers Taiwan a province, and the United States has pursued a \u201cOne China\u201d policy since the 1970s. To that end, the leaders of the United States and Taiwan haven't spoken, that we know of, in decades, given such a dialogue generally symbolizes government recognition. After news broke of the call with\u00a0Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the backlash began, Trump explained that it was Taiwan who initiated the conversation, and he downplayed it as a \u201ccongratulatory call.\u201d The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. But a spokesman in the Taiwanese president's office clarified to Reuters that the call was agreed to beforehand . \u201cOf course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact,\u201d spokesman Alex Huang said in response to Trump's tweet. Taiwan's government also said the two sides discussed \u201cstrengthening bilateral relations\u201d and talked about their \u201cclose economic, political and security ties\" -- all words likely to make China cringe and suggestive of a more in-depth conversation than just a congratulatory call. As with Mexico, we can quibble about just how at odds the two versions of events are. Perhaps Taiwan did reach out first but there was some coordination before Trump picked up the phone. And Taiwan certainly has an interest in making the call out to be a big deal. The Washington Post's Jia Lynn Yang explains the backstory on relations between the U.S., China, and Taiwan, and the ramifications of Friday's telephone call between president-elect Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. (Alice Li,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and potential Trump foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell said Friday night that the flap was overblown . \u201cIt was totally planned,\u201d Grenell said. \u201cIt was a simple courtesy call. People need to calm down. The \u2018One China\u2019 policy wasn\u2019t changed. Washington, D.C.-types need to lighten up.\u201d But the situation raises real questions about who is advising Trump when it comes to diplomacy with Asia, as The Washington Post's\u00a0Emily Rauhala wrote . It also came just a day after the New York Times reported on building concerns about Trump's handling of other calls with world leaders \u00a0and his preparation level.\u00a0And the stakes are considerably higher with China than with Mexico and many other countries. Even if it wasn't meant to be a big deal, it's clearly become a big deal to China. China has now lodged an official complaint with the United States over the matter, though it appears to be giving Trump the benefit of the doubt and blaming Taiwan. China's foreign minister,\u00a0Wang Yi, called it a \u201cpetty\u201d move by Tsai. \u201cThe One China\u00a0principle is the foundation for healthy development of Sino-U. S. relations,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe don\u2019t wish for anything to obstruct or ruin this foundation.\u201d So the flap could just as soon blow over. But it's notable that yet another Trump diplomatic call has turned into a sort of he-said-they-said. And for those concerned that Trump doesn't have the discipline and knowledge to deal with the intricacies and very sensitive feelings involved in foreign policy and diplomacy, Trump is yet again proving their point by creating a needless headache over a \u201ccongratulatory call.\u201d politics ",

    "text": "Kendra Obom Activist from Washington state A young woman in a bright red \u201cI Stand with Standing Rock\u201d T-shirt walked up to Kendra Obom, who was staffing the volunteer tent in the huge camp on the banks of the Missouri River. \u201cWe just arrived, and we\u2019re looking for anything you need us to do,\u201d the woman said. \u201cGreat! We need a lot of help in kitchens and in construction,\u201d said Obom, 31, a cheerful woman with wind-burned cheeks and big glasses who fields hundreds of such questions every day. \u201cDo you have a preference?\u201d The young woman, a waitress from Florida, chose kitchen duty, so Obom sent her to a nearby tent to help prepare meals. Obom arrived here in early November, driving 25 hours in her Dodge minivan from Olympia, Wash., to join a movement she had been monitoring on social media, which was making her increasingly upset. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the long history of colonialism that our country has,\u201d said Obom, the daughter of two U.S. Marines and the founder of a school back home that provides outdoor education for urban youth. \u201cWe often don\u2019t hear about indigenous issues,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so when I saw what was happening here at Standing Rock and how much attention it was getting, I saw that it was an opportunity to amplify indigenous voices all over the country.\u201d She is among thousands of other non-indigenous people from around the country and world who have been drawn to Standing Rock. They chop firewood, build tepees, pick up trash, paint protest banners, help with recycling and composting, and attend training sessions on indigenous rights. Sometimes they join \u201cdirect action\u201d protests that have led to clashes with authorities and scores of arrests. Some who have been arrested and bailed out attend daily \u201carrestee meetings\u201d to get advice from volunteer lawyers. An encampment by the Missouri River at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation near Cannon Ball, N.D., where hundreds of people have gathered to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Sept. 3. (Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Obom stays away from the protests. She has found her niche helping to coordinate out-of-town volunteers as a way of \u201cshowing solidarity\u201d with a minority that has historically been \u201cdisenfranchised and marginalized.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important to not see other people as being so different from you that they deserve different human rights,\u201d Obom said. Obom was raised in North Carolina and Washington state, and both of her parents deployed to the Middle East in Operation Desert Storm. As a child, Obom said that she wanted to be in the military, and always slept with her parents\u2019 field handbooks under her bed. Eventually, she realized that she was too \u201csensitive and shy\u201d for the military: \u201cI felt like there had to be a way to connect with people that didn\u2019t involve so much yelling. And I really wanted to know how to make the world feel safer.\u201d She was deeply influenced by her mother, who was an ardent environmentalist. \u201cI was the kid who used to take a bath with just a bucket of water to help save the salmon,\u201d she said with a laugh. She soon found a gift for organizing. In elementary school, she would start clubs and pass out \u201cfeedback forms\u201d to her classmates to solicit suggestions for making the club better. In college, she studied nursing and counseling, and earned a degree in health and human development, which she has put to work in community activism with youth and women\u2019s issues. Now she was sleeping on the hard-packed ground in her small REI tent, pitched next to the tepee and campfire of an indigenous family that had taken her in. She hadn\u2019t had a shower in two weeks \u2014 and craved one. For lunch, she pulled a plastic bag of microwave chana masala \u2014 Indian chickpeas \u2014 out of her van, and ate it cold from the pack with a spoon. \u201cThis movement at Standing Rock has had incredible ripple effects,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who could previously ignore it now have to see it and recognize the threat of these things.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t spit your propaganda at me and then try to blame me because I\u2019m doing my job protecting my community.\u201d Play Video ",

    "text": "Lawsuit 'Likely' Amid New Texas Rules Over Fetal Remains By paul j. weber, associated press AUSTIN, Texas \u0097 Dec 2, 2016, 6:30 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this July 13, 2013 file photo, abortion rights advocates, left, protest in the State Capitol as anti-abortion rights supporters pass them in Austin, Texas. New Texas rules requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains could face a court challenge before taking effect. Regulations set to go into effect Dec. 19, 2016, would prohibit facilities from continuing to dispose of fetal remains as biological medical waste. Lawsuits have blocked similar measures in Louisiana and Indiana, where the law was signed by Gov. Mike Pence, who's now the vice president-elect. (AP Photo/Tamir Kalifa File) 0 Shares Email New Texas rules requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains are likely to face a court challenge before taking effect, an abortion-rights attorney said Friday, months after the U.S. Supreme Court knocked down sweeping abortion restrictions in the state. The new regulations, which the state plans to implement starting Dec. 19, are the latest battleground in Texas over abortion and would prohibit facilities from continuing to dispose of fetal remains as biological medical waste. Lawsuits this year blocked similar measures in Louisiana and Indiana, where the law was signed in March by governor and now Vice President-elect Mike Pence . About 35,000 public comments poured into the Texas Health and Human Services Commission about the rule change, and funeral home operators worry about interment and cremation costs. The revisions came at the behest of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and were first proposed in July \u2014 just four days after the Supreme Court struck down anti-abortion measures that would have left Texas with 10 abortion clinics, down from more than 40 in 2012. \"This is such an obvious end-run against the Supreme Court decision,\" said David Brown, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was involved in the Supreme Court case. He said a lawsuit over the fetal remain rule is \"highly likely\" but could not say with certainty. His and other abortion-rights groups have accused Texas of trying to create more barriers to abortion and shaming women into not ending a pregnancy. State health officials have denied those claims and framed the change as partly a matter of public health. But the state health department also wrote in response to public feedback that \"the state's history of protection of the unborn\" factored into the decision. The rules state that fetal tissue must be buried or cremated regardless of the stage of gestation. Internment is defined under the rules as \"placement of the ashes in a niche, grave, or scattering of ashes.\" Indiana officials have argued that its law was passed as \"a legitimate means of ensuring human remains are treated with dignity and respect.\" A federal judge blocked that rule in June, along with another that would have banned abortions sought because of a fetus' genetic abnormalities. Michael Land, a funeral director and spokesman for the Texas Funeral Directors Association, said it has been common practice for funeral homes to cremate fetal tissue from miscarriages as a matter of charity for grieving families. Now, he said, \"we can't keep giving away all this merchandise at no cost.\" \"Nothing like this in a number of years has left us with such open questions,\" Land said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Paul J.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story \u201cI\u2019ve always seen Russia as the guardian at the gate, as the easternmost outpost of our people,\u201d said Sam Dickson , a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan lawyer who frequently speaks at gatherings of the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and anti-immigrant positions. \u201cThey are our barrier to the Oriental invasion of our homeland and the great protector of Christendom. I admire the Russian people. They are the strongest white people on earth.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Fascination with and, in many cases, adoration of Mr. Putin \u2014 or at least a distorted image of him \u2014 first took hold among far-right politicians in Europe, many of whom have since developed close relations with their brethren in the United States. Such ties across the Atlantic have helped spread the view of Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia as an ideal model. \u201cWe need a chancellor like Putin, someone who is working for Germany and Europe like Putin works for Russia,\u201d said Udo Voigt , leader of Germany\u2019s National Democratic Party. That far-right group views Chancellor Angela Merkel as a traitor because she opened the door to nearly a million migrants from Syria and elsewhere last year. \u201cPutin is a symbol for us of what is possible,\u201d Mr. Voigt said. The Obama administration has accused Russian interests of meddling in the presidential campaign by spreading fake news and hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the emails of John Podesta, a leading figure in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But efforts by Russia, which has jailed some of its own white supremacist agitators, to organize and inspire extreme right-wing groups in the United States and Europe may ultimately prove more influential. His voice amplified by Russian-funded think tanks, the Orthodox Church and state-controlled news media, like RT and Sputnik, that are aimed at foreign audiences, Mr. Putin has in recent years reached out to conservative and nationalist groups abroad with the message that he stands with them against gay rights activists and other forces of moral decay. He first embraced this theme when, campaigning for his third term as president in early 2012, he presented Russia not only as a military power deserving of international respect, but also as a \u201ccivilizational model\u201d that could rally all those in Russia and beyond who were fed up with the erosion of traditional values. The Kremlin has also provided financial and logistical support to far-right forces in the West, said Peter Kreko, an analyst at Political Capital , a research group in Budapest. Though Jobbik, a neo-Nazi party in Hungary and other groups have been accused of receiving money from Moscow, the only proven case so far involves the National Front in France, which got loans worth more than $11 million from Russian banks. Russia also shares with far-right groups across the world a deeply held belief that, regardless of their party, traditional elites should be deposed because of their support for globalism and transnational institutions like NATO and the European Union. But this means different things to different groups and people. Mr. Putin, for example, has \u201ca natural interest in making a mess in Europe and the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Kreko said. Photo Richard B. Spencer of the National Policy Institute moderating a panel discussion in Washington last month. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times But for Mr. Heimbach, whose Traditionalist Worker Party uses the slogan \u201cGlobalism is the poison, nationalism is the antidote,\u201d the term \u201cinternational elites\u201d is often an anti-Semitic code for Jews, though he denied any racist intent. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Putin has never personally promoted white supremacist ideas, and has repeatedly insisted that Russia, while predominantly white and Christian, is a vast territory of diverse religions and ethnic groups stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Nor has he displayed any sign of hostility toward Jews, a fact that has infuriated some of Russia\u2019s more extremist nationalist groups. In fact, Mr. Putin\u2019s agenda is not purely ideological. It is as much about accomplishing strategic goals like destabilizing Europe and NATO, or forcing the European Union to rescind the sanctions it applied after his forays into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. This has not stopped people like Richard B. Spencer , who runs the website AlternativeRight.com and directs the National Policy Institute , an alt-right group based in Montana, from hailing Mr. Putin as a protector of the white race. Not all of the alt-right has fully embraced the Russian leader. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s new chief strategist, who until he entered the White House ran Breitbart News, which he has called a platform for the alt-right, has a complicated view of Mr. Putin. In a speech in 2014, he said that Mr. Putin ran a \u201ckleptocracy,\u201d but also that \u201cwe, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what he\u2019s talking about as far as traditionalism goes.\u201d Mr. Spencer, who held a much-discussed conference in Washington in November, produced a video last year in which he claimed that \u201can understanding\u201d between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin might bring together Slavic and American Caucasians and eventually \u201cforetell a unified white world.\u201d This summer, he echoed those remarks when he told The Nation magazine, \u201cI think we should be pro-Russia because Russia is the great white power that exists in the world.\u201d In an interview this past week, Mr. Spencer \u2014 he made headlines at his conference by shouting \u201cHail Trump!\u201d \u2014 offered a more measured version of this sentiment, referring to Mr. Putin as \u201ca normal leader in an abnormal world.\u201d \u201cHe wants to conserve his nation and his people,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cHe recognizes certain enemies and certain traditions that should remain, like the church and the state. These are very normal conservative ends.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Spencer acknowledged that Mr. Putin did not share his ideology, but played that down, saying, \u201cWe can look to Putin as someone we can admire and understand.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s fans in Europe generally avoid white supremacist ideas, at least in public, but have also praised him for his nationalistic pride and his views on Islamic extremism, immigration and traditional sexual mores. When ordinary people see that \u201ca man can kiss a man in the street in Germany, they look to the east and Russia and see that this kind of a new life has been stopped there,\u201d said Mr. Voigt, the German far-right leader. \u201cFor us, this is hope.\u201d Mr. Voigt added that he and his party \u201cagree 100 percent with Putin\u2019s position\u201d on homosexuality: \u201cWe are absolutely against gender politics for my country and for Europe.\u201d Not all of Europe\u2019s right-wing populists are smitten with Mr. Putin, though most tend to see him much more favorably than their own entrenched elites. \u201cI\u2019m more a fan than not,\u201d said Tom Van Grieken, the leader of Vlaams Belang, a Belgian group that champions independence for the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. \u201cHe does a good job for Russian interests. But I\u2019m not sure he is good for the rest of the world.\u201d Photo Donald J. Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist was protested last month in Los Angeles. Mr. Bannon ran Breitbart News, which he has called a platform for the alt-right. Credit David Mcnew/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images In Mr. Putin\u2019s favor, Mr. Van Grieken insisted that Russia had been demonized by a Belgian establishment that \u201cis a slave to America,\u201d adding, \u201cPutin is not black or white, but 50 shades of gray.\u201d Last year, in an effort to unite disparate and occasionally feuding far-right groups and to place Russia squarely at the center of the expanding movement against liberal elites, a Russian political party, Rodina, organized a gathering of nationalist figures from Europe, the United States and elsewhere in a cramped conference room at St. Petersburg\u2019s Holiday Inn. Fyodor V. Biryukov, a leader of the Rodina, or Motherland, party, said it was the first time that activists in the vanguard of \u201ca new global revolution\u201d had gotten together to rail against same-sex marriage , political correctness, radical Islamists and New York financiers. He said the Kremlin had not supported the event, \u201cbut \u201cdid not bother us, either.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Among the Europeans at the conference were representatives from Britain First, a far-right nationalist party, and Golden Dawn, the Greek neo-fascist group. At least two Americans were also there. One of them was Mr. Dickson, the former Klan lawyer, who flew in from Atlanta and gave a speech that ended with a cry in halting Russian: \u201cGod save the czar!\u201d The other was Jared Taylor , the founder of the white supremacist think tank American Renaissance, who said that the descendants of white Europeans risked being swept away by a wave of Africans, Central Americans and Asians. In recent years, Mr. Taylor has struck up ties with European groups, inviting officials from the National Front, Vlaams Belang and the British National Party to speak at his American Renaissance events. \u201cThere is a worldwide awakening of nationalism among European countries \u2014 and I include the United States in that,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cAll across Europe, we are seeing the rise of parties expressing the idea that Europe, in order to remain Europe, must remain European. I have a feeling of intense kinship for those that wish to preserve their nation and their culture.\u201d Mr. Heimbach has made three trips to Europe in the last three years, meeting with officials from the Golden Dawn in Greece, the New Right in Romania and Mr. Voigt\u2019s National Democratic Party in Germany to discuss fund-raising and organizing strategies. In Prague in September, he addressed members of the Workers\u2019 Party of Social Justice, which opposes NATO and the European Union, has sought to criminalize homosexuality and has called for the Czech Republic to restore relations with Russia. \u201cWe white Americans can never be truly separated from our European brothers and sisters,\u201d Mr. Heimbach told the crowd, \u201cbecause we are all bonded together by shared blood, heritage and destiny.\u201d Tomas Vanas, the Czech party\u2019s chairman, said in a telephone interview this past week that he stood together with Mr. Putin and others to resist \u201cthe perverse liberal values of the Western world.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story From home in Ohio last month, Mr. Heimbach described his visits to Europe as field trips that help him learn how to make the white nationalist movement in the United States a \u201creal political force.\u201d He also spoke about creating a broader, worldwide network, which he called, with a nod to Comintern, the old Communist International, \u201cthe Traditionalist International.\u201d In this, as in many things, Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, now the home of a new global alliance of far-right groups called the World National-Conservative Movement, was the template. \u201cRussia has already taken its place on the global stage by organizing national movements as counterparts to Atlanticist elites,\u201d Mr. Heimbach said. \u201cIntellectually, they\u2019ve shown us how it works.\u201d Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic \u201cThe idea that you can repeal the Affordable Care Act with a two- or three-year transition period and not create market chaos is a total fantasy,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University. \u201cInsurers need to know the rules of the road in order to develop plans and set premiums.\u201d Details of the strategy are in flux, and there are disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. In the House, the emerging plan, tightly coordinated between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Pence, is meant to give Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters the repeal of the health law that he repeatedly promised at rallies. It would also give Republicans time to try to assure consumers and the health industry that they will not instantly upend the health insurance market, and to pressure some Democrats to support a Republican alternative. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to wait,\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, told reporters this week. \u201cI would move through and repeal and then go to work on replacing. I think once it\u2019s repealed, you will have hopefully fewer people playing politics, and everybody coming to the table to find the best policy.\u201d Under the plan discussed this week, Republicans said, repeal will be on a fast track. They hope to move forward in January or February with a budget blueprint using so-called reconciliation instructions, which would allow parts of the health care law to be dismembered with a simple majority vote, denying Senate Democrats the chance to filibuster . They would follow up with legislation similar to a bill vetoed in January, which would have repealed the tax penalties for people who go without insurance and the penalties for larger employers who fail to offer coverage. That bill would also have eliminated federal insurance subsidies, ended federal spending for the expansion of Medicaid , and barred federal payments to Planned Parenthood clinics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in the Senate, Republicans would need support from some Democrats if they are to replace the Affordable Care Act. The budget reconciliation rules that would allow Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act have strict limits. The rules are primarily intended to protect legislation that affects spending or revenues. The health law includes insurance market standards and other policies that do not directly affect the budget, and Senate Republicans would, in many cases, need 60 votes to change such provisions. Repealing the funding mechanisms but leaving in place the regulations risks a meltdown of the individual insurance market. Insurers could not deny coverage, but they would not get as many healthy new customers as they were expecting. Hospitals would again face many uninsured patients in their emergency rooms, without the extra Medicaid money they have been expecting. Even a delay of two to three years could be damaging. Health policy experts said the uncertainty could destabilize markets, unnerving insurers that have already lost hundreds of millions of dollars on policies sold in insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Photo Republicans hope to pressure vulnerable Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia to support a replacement of the health care law. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times \u201cInsurers would like clarity on the shape of the replacement plan to continue participating on exchanges if Obamacare is repealed,\u201d Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners who follows the insurance industry, said Friday. Republicans are hoping that Mr. Trump will be able to use his bully pulpit to lean on vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in states Mr. Trump won, such as Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. \u201cWhen that date came and you did nothing, if you want to play politics, I think the blame would go to people who didn\u2019t want to do anything,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. But Democrats may not be so quick to break. \u201cIf they are looking at fixing what\u2019s there, I\u2019ve been wanting to work with Republicans for years now,\u201d said Mr. Tester, whose state cast just 36 percent of its vote for Hillary Clinton. \u201cBut if they are going to take away provisions like pre-existing conditions, lifetime caps, 26-year-olds, I think they are barking up the wrong tree.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story And some moderate Republicans see peril in repealing first and replacing later, favoring instead a simultaneous replacement to ensure a smooth transition. \u201cWe are firing live rounds this time,\u201d Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said. \u201cIf we repeal under reconciliation, we have to replace it under normal processes, and does anyone believe that the Senate Democrats, with their gentle tender mercies will help us?\u201d Republicans said they would work with the Trump administration on replacement legislation that would draw on comprehensive plans drafted by Mr. Ryan and Representative Tom Price, the Georgia Republican picked by Mr. Trump to be his secretary of health and human services. Any legislation is likely to include elements on which Republicans generally agree: tax credits for health insurance; new incentives for health savings accounts; subsidies for state high-risk pools, to help people who could not otherwise obtain insurance; authority for sales of insurance across state lines; and some protection for people with pre-existing conditions who have maintained continuous coverage. Republicans said they hoped that the certainty of repeal would increase pressure on Democrats to sign on to some of these ideas. Democratic leaders, for now, feel no such pressure. Republicans \u201care going to have an awfully hard time\u201d if they try to repeal the health law without proposing a replacement, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next Democratic leader. \u201cThere would be consequences for so many millions of people.\u201d Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

    "text": "Universities exploring 'sanctuary' status for immigrants Published               December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2013 \u00a0Universities and colleges in several states are considering labeling themselves \"sanctuary campuses\" amid fears from immigrant students and pressure from activists following the election of Donald Trump. College administrators in New Mexico \u2014 the state with the highest percentage of Latino residents\u2014 are looking into proposals that would grant immigrant students living in the country illegally protections while they pursue their studies. Meanwhile, advocates in California, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota and Texas are pressing their state and private universities to provide sanctuary to these immigrant students, known as DREAMers. \"We urge you to declare the University of San Diego a sanctuary campus for students, faculty, staff and community members now facing, among other things: the threat of deportation under President-elect Donald J. Trump's policy proposals, and the specter of hate speech and bigoted violence in our campus community,\" read a letter from alumni to administrators of the private Roman Catholic university. Related Image Expand / Contract Universities and colleges in several states are considering labeling themselves \"sanctuary campuses\" amid fears from immigrant students and pressure from activists following the election of Donald Trump. (AP) Trump's alma mater \u2014 the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 even has renewed its pledge to block federal agents without a warrant from removing students in the country illegally. \"Let us be unequivocally clear: We are and remain resolute in our commitment to Penn's undocumented students and will do all that we can to ensure their continued safety and success here at Penn,\" University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann and other administrators wrote in a letter released Wednesday. Students and professors at University of Illinois campuses are circulating petitions to make their schools sanctuary campuses. One such group in Chicago gathered more than 1,700 signatures and turned them over to school leaders. A Nevada education philanthropist also is pushing for UNLV, College of Southern Nevada and Nevada State College.to declare themselves sanctuary campuses. The movement comes after Trump promised to end an executive order that granted temporary status to immigrant students living in the country illegally. During his campaign, he also promised to launch a \"deportation force\" and withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities. Trump has not said anything about sanctuary campuses. Still, New York's Columbia University recently announced plans to offer sanctuary and financial support to immigrant students. And last month, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth said the Connecticut school would be a sanctuary campus and would not voluntarily help the federal government deport students. On Thursday, Connecticut College President Katherine Bergeron announced that her institution also would be a sanctuary campus. The specifics of advocates' sanctuary demands vary. Some are asking colleges not to cooperate with federal authorities on immigrant issues, while others want administrators to block federal immigration authorities from searching campuses. University of New Mexico President Bob Frank said university lawyers were looking into sanctuary status after a group of professors came to his office last month to deliver a letter with more than 900 signatures. The Santa Fe Community College board of regents declared itself a \"sanctuary campus\" this week. GEORGIA LAWMAKER PUSHES TO BLOCK 'SANCTUARY SCHOOL' FUNDING University of Illinois leaders have tackled the issue at the flagship Urbana-Champaign location, about 150 miles from Chicago, saying a working group will review the legal ramifications of making the roughly 44,000-student campus a sanctuary. The University of Illinois at Chicago petition, which cites the presidential election, asks university leadership to \"ensure the safety and protection of undocumented , Muslim and all students, staff and their families who may be targeted or put under surveillance by formally declaring UIC as a sanctuary campus.\" While on the campaign trail in March, Trump abruptly canceled a scheduled campaign rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago amid spirited student protests. Not all schools are considering sanctuary campus status despite letters, petitions or even protests. New Mexico State University President Garrey Carruthers said Friday in a memo to employees and students that NMSU doesn't discriminate on the basis of immigration status or require proof of citizenship for admission. However, NMSU respects \"the diversity of opinion\" and won't declare itself a sanctuary or ban federal agents from campus because that would jeopardize federal funding, he said. Eastern New Mexico University officials also said they are not considering sanctuary proposals. The California State University system announced recently it won't use the \"sanctuary\" term at any of its 23 campuses, but it won't cooperate with any new federal policy that targets immigrant students living in the country illegally. This week, the University of California announced steps to protect students in the country illegally, saying it won't assist federal immigration agents or turn over confidential records without court orders. It also said it won't provide information for any national registry based on race, religion or national origin. If Trump ends the program launched by President Barack Obama called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the status of immigrant students will vary by state. Some states do not allow students living in the country illegal to attend college at in-state tuition rates. SANTA FE MAYOR VOWS TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS However, state colleges in New Mexico allow immigrants suspected of living in the country illegally to attend at the in-state tuition rate. The state also lets the same students access financial aid if they graduate from a New Mexico school and maintain a high grade-point average. Community colleges in Chicago, which offer free tuition to qualifying students regardless of immigration status, beefed up anti-discrimination policies this week to include immigration status. In 2011, Illinois established a privately backed scholarship fund for students living in the country illegally. Pending legislation at Illinois' Capitol would let immigrant students get financial aid regardless of their legal status. Advertisement ",

    "text": "LOCAL OBITUARIES Sammy Lee, diver who became first Asian American to win Olympic medal, dies at 96 Two-time Olympic gold-medal diver Sammy Lee, who was USC's oldest surviving Olympian, died Friday, Dec. 2, in Newport Beach after suffering complications from pneumonia. He was 96. Nathan Fenno and Valerie J. Nelson Contact Reporter Sammy Lee learned to dive at Pasadena\u2019s Brookside Park pool, which until 1940 allowed people of color to use the facilities only on Wednesdays, the day before it was drained and refilled. His most reliable place to work out was waterless \u2014 a diving board installed over a sand pit he dug in his coach\u2019s backyard. The inescapable racism \u201cinspired me to perform,\u201d Lee, the son of Korean immigrants,\u00a0once said.\u00a0\u201cI was angered, but I was going to prove that in America, I could do anything.\u201d Lee\u00a0overcame discrimination to become the first Asian American to win an Olympic medal and the first diver to win back-to-back gold medals in two different Olympics \u2014\u00a0in London in 1948 and Helsinki in 1952. A retired doctor who also coached Olympians, Lee died in Newport Beach on Friday after suffering from pneumonia. He was 96. In a Facebook post Saturday announcing Lee\u2019s death, his daughter-in-law, Gina Lee, described him as\u00a0a \u201ctrue giant, a fearless leader, a magnificent and loving family man and a hero amongst the Olympic and Medical world....he dove into our hearts and will be truly missed.\u201d At 12, he was exposed to the Olympics while riding in his father\u2019s Model T truck through Los Angeles streets decked out for the 1932 competition. When his father explained that the Games crown \u201cthe greatest athletes in the world,\u201d Lee vowed to become an Olympic champion. That summer, while playing at a Highland Park pool, a friend challenged him to do more than a single flip off the diving board. With his friend jumping behind him to provide extra lift, Lee immediately did a 1 1/2 somersault and ran home to tell his family he had found his sport, the Journal of Olympic History reported in 2002. His Olympic quest began in earnest in the summer of 1938, while he was sneaking in practice dives between meets at the Los Angeles Swimming Stadium near the Coliseum. He looked over to see a bear of a man named Jim Ryan, who needled him to do a swan dive. \u201cI did what I thought was this perfect dive,\u201d Lee told the Journal. \u201cHe said, \u2018Who taught you that?\u2019 When I told him, he said, \u2018I want you to go over and kick him right in the butt. He\u2019s trying to ruin you.\u2019 \u201d Ryan was nursing a grudge that rivaled his huge frame. He had coached Farid Simaika of Egypt to the gold at the 1928 Olympics but because of a \u201cscoring error,\u201d Simaika took home the silver instead, the Journal recounted. The gold went to Pete Desjardins, an American. Cursing the judges, Ryan vowed to return with a nonwhite diver who could win without question. \u201cYou are that diver,\u201d Simaika told Lee. \u201cThat is why he is so tough on you. You will have to earn that gold by doing dives so well that they will not notice your color but only your diving.\u201d While attending Occidental College, Lee had become the 1942 national champion in platform and 3-meter springboard diving and won the platform title again in 1946. But World War II canceled the 1940 and 1944 Games, delaying his Olympic debut. He finally reached the Games in 1948. As a 28-year-old lieutenant in the Army Medical Corps, Lee feared he had belly-flopped on his last dive at the London competition, a then-unprecedented 3 1/2 somersault, but he emerged from the water to discover it had been rated almost perfect. \u201cI just walked on water out of that pool,\u201d he later recalled. He already had won the bronze medal in the 3-meter springboard. Conflict again nearly kept Lee\u00a0from competing in his second Olympics when he\u00a0felt duty-bound to serve in the Korean War. His military superiors thought otherwise. \u201cMajor Lee, we\u2019ve only got one doctor who can win an Olympic gold medal. We\u2019ve got hundreds of doctors who can repair the wounded. You can go, but you better win,\u201d one of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s staff members told him, The Times reported in 2000. At the Helsinki Games in 1952, the 5-foot-1 Lee won his second gold medal in platform diving\u00a0on his 32nd birthday. The next year, he received the Sullivan Award, given to the nation\u2019s outstanding amateur athlete. As a diving coach, Lee was known as a great but insistent teacher. He coached Bob Webster, the second U.S. diver to win two back-to-back\u00a0Olympic gold medals in the  platform, and four-time American gold medalist Greg\u00a0Louganis, who lived with Lee\u2019s family before winning a silver medal in the platform at at the 1976 Olympics when he was 16. Lee also coached the 1960 U.S. Olympic diving team\u00a0and the 1964 Japanese and Korean Olympic teams. As a coach, he paid it forward. He never asked for payment, he told The Times in 1966, because his coaches had never charged him. \u201cHe gave me one of the greatest gifts an individual can give another. He gave me self-esteem and a belief in myself,\u201d\u00a0Webster said. \u201cWithout Sammy, I don't know what I would\u2019ve done in diving or went on to do in life.\u201d Just out of high school in Santa Ana, one of Webster\u2019s friends suggested Lee give him a chance. Lee watched Webster dive at the Memorial Park pool during a lunch break. \u201cI was nervous as can be,\u201d\u00a0Webster said. \u201cAfter one or two sessions, he said, \u2018I think you can make the Olympic team.\u2019\u00a0I said, \u2018What?\u2019 \u201d Webster visited Lee last week at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach. Lee couldn't speak, but he opened his eyes wide and recognized Webster. \u201cI wanted to make sure I was able to tell him how much he meant to me in my life,\u201d Webster said. Louganis said he, too, was shaped by Lee\u2019s mentorship, learning \u201cat\u00a0a very early age the responsibility of being an ambassador not only to my sport of diving but to the world.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAt a time of intolerance, being Korean, he broke down racial barriers, setting an example of what it meant to be an Olympian,\u201d Louganis said. He was born Samuel Rhee on Aug. 1, 1920, in Fresno to Soonkee Rhee, a farmer, and the former Eunkee Chun. His father decided his son should use the surname \u201cLee\u201d because \u201cso many Americans believe I mean Lee when I say Rhee,\u201d his father said in \u201cNot Without Honor,\u201d Lee\u2019s 1987 biography. After a fire destroyed their farmhouse, his family moved to Los Angeles in 1925, eventually opening a grocery and a chop suey restaurant in Highland Park. At Franklin High School, Lee was the L.A. city diving champion when he ran for student body president against the advice of the vice principal, who warned that a nonwhite student had never won. \u201cMy fellow classmates do not look at me as Korean,\u201d Lee later recalled responding. \u201cThey look at me as a fellow American.\u201d He won the election. He went to\u00a0Occidental on scholarship and graduated six months after his father died in 1943. Lee joined the Army Reserve, which paid his USC medical school tuition. But he had trouble keeping up with his studies. \u201cEvery time I did poorly on an exam, I would go to the pool to dive and relax,\u201d he told the Journal. He said he became a great diver and an average medical student. Salvation came from an unlikely source \u2014 students in fraternities that barred minorities from joining but invited him to their study groups. Because the military needed doctors, Lee sped through medical school in three years, graduating in June 1946. Assigned to an Army hospital in Pasadena, he was given a month\u2019s leave to train for the 1948 Olympic tryouts. He finished his residency as an ear, nose and throat specialist at Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco. The military stationed him outside of Seoul, South Korea,\u00a0during the last two years of the Korean War. When he was discharged from the Army in 1955, he and his Chinese American wife, Roz, tried to buy a house in Garden Grove, but the agent had been told not to sell to nonwhites, Lee said in his biography. The ensuing media coverage elicited outrage in the community. A Jewish developer who said he had known discrimination sold the Lees a model home in another Garden Grove tract and threw in the furniture for free. Eventually, the family bought a house with a pool in Santa Ana so Lee could coach at home. As a doctor, Lee practiced in Santa Ana into his early 70s, when he retired to golf, swim and play tennis \u2014 often all on the same day. In 2013, Lee disappeared briefly after a routine afternoon excursion to the Los Caballeros Racquet & Sports Club in Fountain Valley. Lee, who suffered from dementia , was reported missing after he failed to return home. He drove through three Southern California counties in his Mercedes \u2014\u00a0license plate \u201c2 GOLDS\u201d \u2014\u00a0before being found the next evening disoriented, but unharmed, in Pico Rivera.\u00a0 While he was serving in Korea, Lee was summoned to treat Syngman Rhee, a family friend who was then president of South Korea. For years, Rhee had wanted to ask Lee to dive for Korea in the Olympics, The Times reported in 1988. Lee said he replied: \u201cI was born an American. I think like an American. Only my face is Korean.\u201d In addition to his wife, Lee is survived by a daughter, Pamela; a son, Sammy; and three grandchildren.

    "text": "LOCAL L.A. Now Officials fear up to 40 dead in fire during concert at Oakland warehouse At least nine people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. Russ Mitchell , Peter H. King , Liam Dillon , Tracey Lien and Paige St. John Contact Reporters Authorities said they were preparing to deal with dozens of fatalities after a fire raced through a converted warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. Nine bodies have been recovered, but Alameda County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly said officials were prepared for up to 40 fatalities. He said many of those inside the warehouse were young, some from foreign countries.\u00a0 Firefighters were beginning to move through the burned-out remains of the building looking for victims. The building\u2019s roof caved in, and debris will make the search effort difficult, Kelly said. As of 2:20 p.m., officials said the number of fatalities remained at nine but that the search was continuing. Kelly stressed that the death toll was likely to rise \u2014\u00a0but by how much remains unclear.\u00a0Officials said there were at least 12 survivors, one of whom went to a hospital for treatment. There is no known cause of the fire. While arson is not suspected, Kelly said investigators are on scene and nothing has been ruled out. Officials said the\u00a0warehouse isn\u2019t currently considered a crime scene.\u00a0 Officials believe there likely are more fatalities because there are friends and family who still have not heard from some people who attended the concert. Kelly said there were relatively few injuries\u00a0among those who escaped. \u201cThis is just a tragedy, and there are no easy answers,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis is not an easy task.\u201d He said it could take two days to complete to search for victims.\u00a0Officials are bringing in cranes, bulldozers and excavating equipment to access the west side of the building. Cadaver dogs may also be used. Officials\u00a0are fingerprinting people, and four of the nine bodies have been removed. Witnesses described a horrific fight for survival as people tried to flee the flames. Al Garcia, who owns a store next to the warehouse, said he talked to two people\u00a0who said they were 17 and 18 years old who got out of the building. \u201cThey said that black, billowing smoke was coming down the stairs,\u201d said Garcia, 62. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see anything in front of them, anything behind them. The only reason they got out was they heard voices outside. The voices directed them to where they were going.\u201d The teens said they paid $10 to get into the warehouse party, which they found online, Garcia said. \u00a0 Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times City records cited allegations of at least three code violations at the building this year. In one complaint, city inspectors said there was complaint of an illegal building on the property as well as piles of trash. \u201cThis property is a storage [facility], but the owner turned it into a trash recycling\u00a0center. The yard became a trash collection site, and the main building was [remodeled] for residential,\u201d according to city records. City building and safety officials said Saturday afternoon that there was an open investigation into the warehouse and that inspectors had found evidence of blight. The building was permitted for use as a warehouse, not for housing. They said that a party or concert at the property would have required a permit, which had not been granted. They also said there was no evidence of fire sprinklers or alarms in the building. Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo, who represents the district where the fire broke out, said neighbors have regularly complained about the building \u2014\u00a0particularly the fact that it had piles of trash and debris outside. \u201cWe would complain to the manager that they had all that nonsense outside of his building, blocking sidewalks, blocking streets. And \u2026 \u00a0he always had an attitude,\u201d he said. Gallo said he did not know whether people were living inside the warehouse. Asked whether\u00a0the building had residential permits, he said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cThe reality is, there are many facilities being occupied without permits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re occurring on Oakland\u2019s streets, especially in neighborhoods like mine.\u201d The property is one of several owned by Chor N. Ng, according to her daughter, Eva Ng, 36.\u00a0She said\u00a0the warehouse was leased as studio space for an art collective and not used as a dwelling. \u201cNobody lived there,\u201d\u00a0she told The Times, adding,\u00a0\u201cIt was an art collective.\u201d She said she had asked her leaseholders about the issue and had been reassured that nobody lived in the building. \u201cThey confirmed multiple times. They said sometimes some people worked through the night, but that is all,\u201d\u00a0she said. The second floor had two exits, both wooden stairs, she said, adding that she believes the building also had smoke detectors.\u00a0She was not familiar with comments by fire officials that the makeshift stairs consisted of packing crates. Ng added that her mother felt terrible about the tragedy. Kevin Longton, who lives at the Vulcan Lofts, less than a mile from where the fire took place,\u00a0said the warehouse was well-known for holding rave-style dance parties. He went to one about a year ago, never saw any sprinklers and felt the place was an accident waiting to happen. \u201cIt was a tinderbox,\u201d Longton said. Inside, he said, were two floors with a huge open space on the first floor with lots of nooks and crannies. People had cordoned off loft-style sections on the first floor and decorated them with fabrics and curtains. More than a two dozen old pianos were strewn about the floor.\u00a0 \u201cThere were people living there,\u201d Longton said. \u201cI\u2019m sure of that.\" The building was the site of a concert\u00a0Friday night called the\u00a0 Golden Donna 100% Silk 2016 West Coast Tour , according to a concert Facebook page. Organizers of the concert\u00a0posted a statement describing the fire as an \u201cunbelievable tragedy, a nightmare scenario. ...\u00a0We are a very tight community of artists and we are all praying, sending love and condolences to everyone involved and their families.\u201d Witnesses said the warehouse, known locally as the Oakland Ghost Ship,\u00a0was a collective where artists lived and worked. Through the early-morning hours, people used the Facebook page to seek information about friends and loved ones who attended the concert. Some frantically listed the names of missing people and posted their photos, hoping to learn their fates. ",

Former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in an op-ed for the Young Conservatives website called the deal, which was reportedly negotiated by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an example of government intervention that could lead to \"crony capitalism.\" Palin said in the op-ed \"I am ecstatic for Carrier employees!\" But she wrote that while she didn't yet know the full terms of the deal, the negotiation could signal an abandonment of fiscal conservatism and stimulus packages that, if pursued, would mean the country is \"doomed.\" Carrier Corp. had planned to move a factory in Indianapolis to Mexico, taking 1,400 jobs with it. Under the proposed deal with Carrier's parent company United Technologies, the company would receive $7 million in financial incentives over 10 years in exchange for a guarantee that Carrier would retain at least 1,000 jobs and invest $16 million into its Indiana operation, a source familiar with the talks has said. Sarah Palin speaks during a panel discussion before a preview of the film \"Climate Hustle\" on Capitol Hill April 14, 2016, in Washington. AP The deal was touted by Donald Trump, who has pledged to keep jobs in the United States. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, said in the op-ed that the package could encourage other businesses to threaten to leave the country in order to receive similar breaks, effectively motivating industries to blackmail the government. \"Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember?\" Palin wrote. \"Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.\" Palin wrote that she was hopeful the Trump administration is aware of the pitfalls of what she called \"burdensome federal government imposition.\" \"Gotta' have faith the Trump team knows all this. And I'll be the first to acknowledge concerns over a deal cut by leveraging taxpayer interests to make a manufacturer stay put are unfounded \u2014 once terms are made public,\" Palin wrote in the op-ed. A request for comment from Trump's transition team was not immediately returned. Play ",

Kelly said that they have located a \u201ccouple dozen people\u201d who were believed to be missing, but they still believe there will be about two dozen more victims.\u00a0 \u201cWe still have a lot of families who are in that unknown stage,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0 Investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened when a fire broke out during a party at a renovated Oakland warehouse. But... There are nine confirmed fatalities in the fire, which broke out at a warehouse that was being used as a residential artist colony, but officials said there are \u201ca couple dozen\u201d victims they have to identify. These nine bodies were \u201ceasily accessible,\u201d said Kelly. Based on the difficulty to getting inside the building, officials can only identify nine fatalities so far. According to fire officials, the roof collapsed onto the second story, which then collapsed onto the first story.\u00a0 Fire officials said Saturday afternoon that they had to halt the recovery process because parts of the building had been deemed too unsafe, but by 3:30 p.m. PST, the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s office tweeted it had begun the recovery process again. Recovery operations have started again. \u2014 Alameda Co.

And for them to hopefully get good news and have peace as soon as possible,\u201d his friend Richardine Bartee told CBS2. Firefighters used chain saws and axes Saturday to cut through the debris of the cluttered building in a gritty neighborhood of the San Francisco Bay Area city, where the fire broke out about 11:30 p.m. Friday.\u00a0 CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid reports that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has joined local firefighters to investigate. Police say many victims in the Oakland, California, warehouse fire were in their 20s. The deadly fire broke out during a party. CBS San Francisco... There were numerous violations against the building, and there were no permits issued for people to live in the building, officials said on Saturday. Fire officials said there were no evidence of sprinklers.\u00a0 Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloche-Reed said at least another 25 people were unaccounted for in what authorities were calling the most deadly building fire in the city in recent memory. The victims were believed to be young people in their 20s, Kelly said. He earlier said as many as 40 may have perished and that the coroner was preparing for a \u201cmass casualty event\u201d that could include victims from other countries.\u00a0 The warehouse was known as the \u201cOakland Ghost Ship.\u201d Its website showed pictures of a bohemian, loft-like interior made of wood and cluttered with rugs, old sofas and a garage-sale like collection of pianos, paintings, turntables, statues and other items. A fire broke out on Dec. 2, 2016 at a warehouse in Oakland, California. CBS SF Bay Area The website included advertisements for various electronic music parties. On Friday night, there was an event featuring musician Golden Donna\u2019s 100% Silk West Coast tour. Panicked friends and family posted messages on the group\u2019s Facebook page trying to find out if their loved ones were among the dead. Those searching for the missing were sent to a local sheriff\u2019s office, where Dan Vega was anxiously awaiting news. He had been unable to find his younger brother or his brother\u2019s girlfriend. Vega said he was not sure if the two were at the party Friday night but that his brother likes to go to raves and he had not been able to reach him Saturday. His girlfriend\u2019s car was still parked at a transit station in San Bruno, south of San Francisco. Fighting tears, Dan Vega said he\u2019s frustrated authorities hadn\u2019t been able to tell him anything about his 22-year-old brother. A charred wall is seen outside a warehouse after a fire broke out during an electronic dance party, resulting in at least nine deaths and many unaccounted for in the Fruitvale district of Oakland, California, Dec. 3, 2016. REUTERS \u201cI just want to go over there. I have my work boots on, I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d Vega said. \u201cJust give me some gloves. I\u2019ll help out any way, shape or form, I don\u2019t care. This is infuriating. I don\u2019t know where my brother\u2019s at. I just want to find him.\u201d It was not immediately clear what started the fire, Deloche-Reed said. She said 50 to 100 people were believed to have been at the party when the fire started and that clutter \u201cmade it difficult for people to escape.\u201d The warehouse was partitioned into artist studios and was packed with furniture, mannequins, statues, lamps, and other objects and did not have a clear entry or exit path, the fire chief said.

Ronald Gasser, 54, shot McKnight three times from the driver's seat of his Infinity in the New Orleans suburb of Terrytown at around 2:43 p.m. Thursday, authorities said. He remained at the scene following the shooting until law enforcement arrived and admitted to the shooting , the sheriff's office said. In a press conference on Friday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand alluded to Gasser's previous arrest, but he could not recall the details. The sheriff's public information office commander, Col. John Fortunato, explained later in an email that Gasser had been arrested 10 years ago \u2014 Feb. 20, 2006 \u2014 at the same intersection where the shooting occurred. According to Fortunato, Gasser followed an individual who had attempted to report him for reckless driving into a service station, where he verbally assaulted the individual and then struck him with a closed fist several times. The gas station is located at the intersection of Holmes Boulevard and Behrman Highway in Terrytown, which is near where Thursday's shooting occurred. Gasser was issued a misdemeanor summons for simple battery, but the charge was ultimately dismissed, Fortunato said. He didn't know why the charge was dismissed, but said the office would provide more information when they had fully researched the occurrence. The victim's cousin Roxanne Lundy grieves  as the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office investigates the homicide of former NFL player Joe McKnight at Behrman Highway and Holmes Blvd. in Terrytown on Dec. 2. Michael DeMocker / The Times-Picayune After the shooting on Thursday, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office took Gasser into custody, but he was released later that night and no charges were filed . Normand was dismissive of criticism he has received for releasing Gasser. \"People can Monday morning quarterback what we've done,\" he said in a press conference on Friday. \"Mr. Gasser is not going anywhere. He has been completely cooperative with us in every request that we've made. The issue at the end of the day is that we will do a very thorough and deliberate investigation.\" McKnight's family said they want a thorough investigation. \"At this point we just want to just take everything day by day. We don't want to jump to any conclusions,\" Johanna McKnight, McKnight's sister, said Saturday. \"We don't want anything to be rushed or come to judgment, we just want everything to be done right,\" she said. A peaceful crowd of about 80 people gathered at the location of the shooting on Friday night to hold a vigil.

Political Committees Form In Support of Political Run by First Lady By Jordyn Phelps Dec 3, 2016, 12:42 PM ET 0 Shares Star Ralph Freso/Getty Images Michelle Obama waves to the crowd as she speaks at an Arizona Democratic Party Early Vote rally in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Oct. 20, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona. 0 Shares Email While First Lady Michelle Obama and the president have repeatedly shot down the notion that the first lady would ever consider running for political office -- let alone the presidency -- that hasn't stopped political committees from filing with the Federal Elections Commission to support a potential candidacy. One of the groups, Ready for Michelle PAC, filed with the elections commission on Oct. 31 and says on its website that its goal is to \"get the ball rolling by identifying a network of supporters, volunteers, and donors\" to support the first lady should she seek public office. Donald Garrett, who leads the group, told ABC News that the group has currently collected about 1,000 signatures though an online petition, in addition to just under $1000. The only catch, as the group itself acknowledges, is that the first lady would have to be convinced to run. \"If she can be convinced to run, we can provide her with an early advantage against any opponents,\" the website says. But that could be a tall order. As recently as the day after Election Day , President Obama ruled out the possibility that his wife would ever enter the political arena. \"Michelle will never run for office,\" President Obama told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview Nov. 9. \"You can see the incredible resonance she has with the American people. But I joke that she's too sensible to want to be in politics.\u201d The name of the group, Ready for Michelle, harks back to the early calls for Hillary Clinton to seek the presidency. The super PAC Ready for Hillary formed shortly after Clinton stepped down as secretary of state. Two other groups, Ready for Michelle 2020 and Friends of Michelle 2020, have also filed with the elections commission within the last month. \"Let\u2019s put an Obama back in the White House in 2020,\" says the Ready for Michelle 2020 website. The web address listed on Friends of Michelle 2020\u2019s FEC filing isn\u2019t currently operable. 0 Shares ",

When the Blackhawks came out for warmups at the Wells Fargo Center , one of their key players, goaltender Corey Crawford wasn't with them on the ice. Instead, he was under the knife, and now he will be on the shelf. Crawford developed appendicitis hours before Saturday's 3-1 loss to the Flyers and... (Chris Hine) They needed an amateur who would cost nothing and with the Flyers' help they found Semborski, who was pressed into duty. When Semborski saw a Chicago area code pop up on his phone, he said, he knew this was for real. \"Someone named Tony\" had called him \u2014 Hawks' senior director of team services Tony Ommen. \"I seriously had to take my skates off from coaching and just come (Wells Fargo Center) as fast as I could,\" said Semborski, who said he got the call only two hours before the game. \"I still couldn't believe it was happening as I was walking in. Disbelief can't quite quantify what Semborski felt. The Bloomsburg, Pa., native who graduated from Temple last December barely had time to call his family to let them know what was happening. His parents couldn't make it from about 135 miles away in Bloomsburg in time. \"This was a dream come true,\" Semborski said. \"It was so cool just hanging out with those guys. They made me feel welcome right away, started joking around. \"The Flyers asked around and people threw my name out I guess. I really don't know how it happened. I'll have to get to the bottom of that and thank some people.\" Eric Semborski on being the Blackhawks emergency backup goaltender Eric Semborski talks about being the Blackhawks emergency backup goaltender. (Chris Hine/Chicago Tribune) Eric Semborski talks about being the Blackhawks emergency backup goaltender. (Chris Hine/Chicago Tribune) See more videos The Hawks embraced the chance to razz their new teammate. They called him out for showing up late and for not wearing a suit to the game. They put his number on the board and told him he had to contribute $200 to the team's holiday party. \"I told them you better take credit, because that's all I have,\" Semborski said. Soon after arriving, it was time for warmups. Semborski came out in a No. 50 jersey that had Crawford's name removed and his name on it. Semborski looked a little slow as pucks zoomed by him during his time in net as he was comprehending what was happening. \"That was the best 20 minutes of my life skating with them,\" Semborski said. \"It was pretty cool. \u2026 I was a bit rusty. No matter how much I play I'm not going to be ready for them. It was fast. I couldn't even catch my breath because I was trying to take it all in.\" Photos from the game on Dec.. 3, 2016,\u00a0in Philadelphia. Late in the game, the Hawks were trailing 3-1 and had pulled starter Scott Darling for an extra attacker. If the Flyers had scored an empty netter, Semborski said the Hawks were going to put him in the game. But it never came to be. Semborski said he has been a lifelong Flyers fan and called their 2010 Stanley Cup Final loss to the Hawks \"one of the hardest things I ever watched.\" He added: \"But today, that's all forgotten. I'm a Hawks fan.\" Because he signed an amateur tryout agreement, Semborski did not make any money for his appearance, but he got pucks, hats and he will get a jersey from the Hawks. If the Hawks win the Stanley Cup, he doesn't want his name on the Cup. \"I want a ring,\" he said with a laugh. If nothing else, at least he will have one heck of a memory. ",

The phone call, described by Taiwan's presidential spokesperson as a \"friendly talk,\" is believed to be the first time a U.S. president or president-elect has had contact with a Taiwanese leader since before the U.S. cut off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 For China and Taiwan, the tension stretches back much further than that. An island unto itself Taiwan \u2014 located just over 100 miles off China, across the Taiwan Strait \u2014 has a population of more than 23 million people and is an economic powerhouse, despite its history of political woes. Over the years, it bounced between Japanese and Chinese rule, and after World War II, was put under martial law by the Chinese mainland. The island of Taiwan, whose government refers to itself as the Republic of China (ROC) \u2014 not to be confused with mainland China \u2014 became home to the Chinese nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek after they were pushed out of the mainland by Mao Zedong's communist forces in 1949. Locals on a warehouse rooftop display the national flag while watching Taiwan fighter jets practice emergency landing drills on a closed section of highway during the annual Han Kuang military exercises in  2014, in Chiayi, central Taiwan. Wally Santana / AP file By the time Taiwan began to untangle itself from martial law in the 1970s, there had been widespread human rights violations, including protesters killed for marching for free democracy independent of communist rule. Taiwan had been a one-party authoritarian state until it came to an official end in 2000 with the election of an opposition party candidate as president. But it views its future differently from how the mainland does. China feels there's a \"one country, two systems\" structure in place at the moment and that Taiwan will eventually be folded back into China entirely, while Taiwan maintains it should have its own government and become its own country. How the U.S. views Taiwan The U.S. has taken China's side for years: It recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government in 1979 when it ended diplomatic relations with Taiwan. A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said after Trump's phone call that the administration remains \"firmly committed to our 'one China' policy.\" \"There is no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues,\" spokesman Ned Price said Friday. How this could affect U.S.-China relations In light of the region's sensitive relations, Trump's phone call quickly setting off diplomatic alarm bells. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi referred to the call as a \"petty\" move by Tsai. \"The One China principle is the foundation for healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations. We don't wish for anything to obstruct or ruin this foundation,\" Wang said. Beijing filed a complaint with the U.S. over the break in protocol, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said. In America, Democrats pounced on Trump. \"His foolish phone call threatens our national security,\" the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. Related: Donald Trump's Call With Taiwan President Was No Surprise: Official \"The wrong message could be received, so he should be fully briefed by the State Department before those communications,\" added Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., who's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway insisted Trump was \"fully knowledgeable\" about the situation prior to the phone call. \"His foolish phone call threatens our national security.\" While the U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, it sold the island $12 billion worth of arms in the 1970s as part of an agreement that commits Washington to helping Taiwan defend itself. Trump took to Twitter to downplay the phone call. \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" he tweeted.

We Are One America,\" read the sign that 53-year-old Justin Normand held outside the Islamic Center of Irving near Dallas \u2014 a photo of which has gone viral since it was posted online last Saturday. Since the election, Normand and his husband Gary Cathey, who are both practicing Presbyterians in their church, have been looking for a way to show some compassion and unity with their neighbors. \"I have been in a malaise and at a loss since Election Day,\" Normand posted on Facebook in a response to the photo going viral. \"What to do? With myself? With my time? To make things better, or even just to slog through?\" Justin Normand outside the Irving mosque holding the flowers was taken Saturday, Nov. 29. Justin Normand But Normand didn't just slog through. On a Friday afternoon last week he decided to make a sign, drive to the nearest mosque, and stand on the public sidewalk. He turned his sign towards the mosque. \"This was about binding up the wounded. About showing compassion and empathy for the hurting and fearful among us. Or, in some Christian traditions, this was about washing my brother's feet,\" explained Normand in a post liked over 75,000 times on Facebook. Cathey said his husband was fully committed to sending a strong message of support for those that are feeling vulnerable following a contentious presidential election cycle. The FBI recently said that there was an increase of 67% in hate crimes against Muslim Americans in their annual hate crime report . \"He wanted to pass a message to a group he felt was targeted,\" Cathey said. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a video statement Nov. 18 that the FBI was investigating a rash of hate crime reports across the nation following the elections. \"I know that many Americans are concerned by a spate of recent news reports about alleged hate crimes and harassment. Some of these incidents have happened in schools. Others have targeted houses of worship. And some have singled out individuals for attacks and intimidation,\" she said. \"The FBI is assessing, in conjunction with federal prosecutors, whether particular incidents constitute violations of federal law.\" Justin Normand outside the Irving mosque.

Dadabhoy, president of the Valley Ranch Islamic Center, said that Normand visited his center too and his actions show how to live your faith \u2014 whatever it may be. \"Given the heightened levels of anxiety that minority communities have felt recently, Justin's small, and simple act of kindness has had a very positive impact on our congregation,\" he said. \"With the plethora of concerns amongst people, seeing a sign that shares such a beautiful message of unity reminds them of the hope that our faith teaches us.\" The viral onslaught began when an anonymous passerby snapped a photo of Justin that afternoon and posted it online Saturday morning. Normand had no idea the post had garnered such attention when he went back out to the Islamic Center of Irving on Saturday. A woman walked up to him with an offering of flowers and asked, \"Did you know that you've gone viral?\" Cathey was surprised by the reaction of the internet but insisted that the story was not about them, but rather the message that so many people responded to. \"It struck a chord with people who wanted to hear a positive message,\" he said. \"This was in the heart of a lot of people and we are really humbled.\" Emmanuelle Saliba ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic To that end, General Mattis has advocated working more closely with allies in the region to strengthen ties with their spy agencies and to expand naval exercises, including international efforts to stop Iran from using mines to cripple the flow of oil and other global traffic. As the head of Central Command, the general pushed for \u201cmaintaining and diversifying the U.S. military presence in the Middle East amidst the Iraq drawdown, budget pressures and the rebalance to Asia,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. Three years later, General Mattis\u2019s hard-line views on Iran have not softened as he points out the country\u2019s \u201cmalign influence,\u201d whether it is shipping weapons to rebels in Yemen or training Shiite militias bound for Syria or Iraq. \u201cThe Iranian regime, in my mind, is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East,\u201d General Mattis said in April at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cIran is not a nation-state; it\u2019s a revolutionary cause devoted to mayhem.\u201d Sunni allies in the Persian Gulf, who have criticized the Obama administration for improving relations with Shiite-majority Iran, cheered General Mattis\u2019s selection. \u201cHe brings a fingertip feel and familiarity to the region that will serve our interests much better, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019ll pour in a whole bunch more troops,\u201d said Vice Adm. Mark I. Fox, who served under General Mattis as head of the Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf. Photo General Mattis was nominated in 2010 by President Obama to lead United States Central Command. His tour was cut short in 2013. Credit Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times Normally, an examination of a president-elect\u2019s top pick for the Pentagon would look at the policy differences between the incoming president and the nominee. But it is difficult in this case because Mr. Trump has publicly expressed so many conflicting views on national security. (He supported the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq but says he did not. He said during the campaign that he would reinstate waterboarding \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d but appeared to backtrack on that assertion last week during an interview with The New York Times, after listening, he said, to General Mattis\u2019s views.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, it is difficult to see how the two men would find agreement on Mr. Trump\u2019s professed admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, given that General Mattis, like most military officers at the Pentagon, has a healthy skepticism for the Russian leader. General Mattis\u2019s selection also raises potentially consequential questions about the issue of civilian control of the military, a standard set by the framers of the Constitution. The founding fathers were adamant that the country be led by a civilian president who exercises control over the military as commander in chief so that the nation will not become a military state. Similarly, the leader of the Defense Department is always a civilian who is superior to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation\u2019s top military official. General Mattis\u2019s retirement from the Marines in 2013 means that he would need a congressional waiver to be defense secretary because American law requires a seven-year waiting period between active duty and serving in that role. There is little doubt that General Mattis, who is well liked by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the head of the Armed Services Committee, will be able to get that waiver. Mr. McCain said he was pleased with the general\u2019s nomination, saying in a statement that he \u201clooked forward to moving forward with the confirmation process as soon as possible in the new Congress.\u201d But Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said she plans to vote against the waiver. \u201cWhile I deeply respect General Mattis\u2019s service,\u201d she said in a statement Thursday night, \u201ccivilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.\u201d Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump met with General Mattis at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., last month. Credit Drew Angerer/Getty Images The congressional waiver has not been used in 66 years, since Gen. George C. Marshall, then five years out of active service as the Army chief of staff, received a waiver to be President Harry S. Truman\u2019s defense secretary. General Mattis\u2019s selection has also resurfaced an accusation from \u201cThe Only Thing Worth Dying For,\u201d a 2010 book by Eric Blehm, a former Army Special Forces officer who wrote that the general was unwilling to help a group of Green Berets after they were hit by an American smart bomb in Afghanistan in 2001. In the book, Mr. Blehm accuses General Mattis, then a brigade general, of refusing to send helicopters to rescue the Green Berets. The general declined to be interviewed for the book. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump has so far shown an affinity for retired military officers as he assembles his government. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has been named national security adviser, while Mr. Trump\u2019s aides sounded out Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, a former commander in Afghanistan, for defense secretary. David H. Petraeus, a former C.I.A. director and a retired four-star Army officer who served as the military\u2019s top commander in Afghanistan and Iraq, has been under consideration for secretary of state. But the nomination of General Mattis could make Mr. Petraeus\u2019s selection less likely, because Democrats will object to the prevalence of retired generals in jobs that normally go to civilians. While General Mattis is revered by Marines and enlisted soldiers, several military officials interviewed on Friday raised questions about whether his proven combat skills as a military leader will be the right tools to overcome the calcified bureaucracy that is the Defense Department. A defense secretary must navigate the politics of the White House and Congress while balancing and, in some cases, steering the views of his top military officers. When Robert M. Gates served as defense secretary during the most bloody periods of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he overruled senior generals and forced through a speedy development of more heavily armored MRAPs \u2014 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles \u2014 to save American lives from roadside bombs. Generals outside the war zone were reluctant to spend so much money on a new vehicle that had not been part of their long-term planning and budgeting. Kitty Bennett contributed research.

Newslook President-elect Donald Trump, left, and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. (Photo: Evan Vucci, Chiang Ying-ying, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's break\u00a0with diplomatic precedent by speaking with the president of Taiwan is yet another signal that the unconventional path candidate Trump took to\u00a0victory in the general election will likely guide him in the White House, some analysts and government officials said Saturday. The implications of Trump's latest action \u2014 the first such direct communication with a Taiwanese leader since the U.S. broke diplomatic relations in 1979 \u2014 are not immediately clear. Yet some foreign policy experts said there are serious potential ramifications to pursuing such an unorthodox course. \"Unfortunately, President-elect Trump has waded into the thicket of U.S.-Taiwan relations without any apparent briefings by senior State Department officials intimately familiar with this long history,'' Jeffrey Bader, a former principal adviser to President Obama on Asia, said Saturday in a written statement. \"This phone call will likely to be interpreted by Beijing as something much more than a personal chat.'' China: Trump-Taiwan president call was 'small trick' The U.S. formally severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979 after\u00a0President Jimmy Carter\u00a0formally recognized\u00a0Beijing\u00a0as the sole government of China. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Saturday that State officials \u201csupported requests from the transition team for some of their communications\u2019\u2019 with foreign leaders.\u00a0Government officials, however, had no advance knowledge of Trump's plan to speak with Tsai Ing-wen. As recently as Monday, secretary of State John Kerry was lauding growing cooperation with China on climate change and development, progress resulting from careful negotiations with the nation. \"Unlike the Cold War, which was often a zero-sum competition for influence, we have a chance today to establish unprecedented levels of coordination among donors and investors,'' Kerry told the Women's Foreign Policy Group in Washington. \"This is a topic that I\u2019ve already discussed with Chinese officials, and they have agreed to make cooperation on development one of the pillars of our bilateral ties. \"Imagine that,'' Kerry said, \"China and the United States cooperating on global development. That cooperation is something the world has never seen before, but it\u2019s starting already to happen now, and I believe if we grow it, it can make a major difference in the generation to come.\" Trump talks to Taiwan's leader, breaking precedent By early Saturday, however, China had lodged a formal complaint with the U.S., over the Trump call, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declaring that \"Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.'' \"The one China principle is the political basis of the China-US relationship,'' Shuang said in a statement Saturday. \"We urge the relevant party in the U.S.\u00a0to honor its commitment to the one China policy and ... and properly deal with Taiwan-related issues in a discreet manner, so as to avoid unnecessary disruptions to the overall China-U.S. relationship.'' Trump addressed the matter Friday night in his signature way, issuing a tweet claiming that \"the president of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.'' That tweet was followed by another:\u00a0\"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.'' Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Saturday that Trump's interactions so far with foreign leaders may represent an uneasy \"a new chapter'' in such dealings involving an American president. \"We'll have to see whether this is the beginning of a new chapter where the president-elect, after his inauguration, conducts foreign policy that is shoot-from-hip, twitter-storm style, where he gets in twitter fights or takes unscheduled calls from foreign leaders in ways that break\u00a0with decades of precedent,'' Coons said on CNN. \"We we know from the campaign is that the president-elect Trump promised to shake things up,'' the senator said, \"and he made a number of concerning, even alarming proposals,'' including a reconsideration of the U.S.'s future commitment to (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) NATO.'' Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser and spokeswoman, disputed any suggestion that the president-elect was not aware of the potential gravity of such a communication with Taiwan. \"President-elect Trump is fully briefed and fully knowledgeable about these issues,'' Conway said on CNN. 684 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gA7o5d ",

The government has ordered hundreds of protesters to leave the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires camp, on federal land in southern North Dakota by Monday, although demonstrators say they\u2019re prepared to stay until changes are made to the route of the four-state, $3.8-billlion pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others say the pipeline north of the reservation could pollute drinking water and threatens sacred sites.\u00a0 The North Dakota Department of Transportation and Morton County Highway Department will be key players in any evacuation plans, Wilz said, noting that those agencies worked to keep roads clear around the protest site during a recent storm that dumped more than a foot of snow.\u00a0 U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement Friday that the Department of Justice has offered community policing resources to local law enforcement as \u201cwinter begins to take hold.\u201d \u2018\u2019Our first concern is the safety of everyone in the area - law enforcement officers, residents and protesters alike,\u201d Lynch said.\u00a0 Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said Lynch contacted him by phone Friday to discuss the situation.\u00a0 \u201cWhile I appreciate the Attorney General taking the time to reach out to me, neither assistance for law enforcement nor a timeline for resolution was offered,\u201d Kirchmeier said in a statement. \u201cI hope the dialogue continues, but it\u2019s time for more actions from the federal government, not more words.\u201d\u00a0 The North Dakota National Guard is prepared to help with any emergencies, said Jeff Zent, spokesman for Gov.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 4 To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs The 5 best ways to invest $10,000 Arielle O\u2019Shea, NerdWallet 2:42 p.m. EST December 3, 2016 Stacks of money wrapped in $10,000 bundles (Photo: Landon_S, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Your definition of windfall may vary, but there\u2019s little argument that $10,000 is a healthy chunk of cash \u2014 certainly enough to give you cold feet when deciding how to invest it. The good news is there are a lot of options: $10,000 is enough to more than meet most online broker minimums. We\u2019ve slimmed things down to five of the best ways to invest $10,000. Feel free to mix and match; there\u2019s no rule that says you have to throw it all into one pot. 1. Get your 401(k) match A guaranteed investment return is as rare as free money, and a 401(k) match gives you both: When you put dollars into the account, your employer puts dollars in, too. How many dollars depends on your plan\u2019s matching arrangement, but 50% to 100% of your contributions up to a limit of 3% to 6% of your salary is a pretty common range. (If you want to do the math to see how much your match could be worth, try our 401(k) calculator .) This $10,000 windfall may give your budget the room it needs to finally start meeting that match, if you\u2019re not already. The hitch: You typically can\u2019t just make a lump-sum deposit to a 401(k), so you have to get a little creative if you want to get this cash into your plan and capture matching dollars while you do it. Put the $10,000 into a savings account, then set your 401(k) contribution to the level your employer matches. When that contribution is swiped out of your paycheck, repay yourself from the money in savings. 2. Max out an IRA An IRA is like a 401(k) you open on your own, which means no match. But it has other benefits, including a wide investment selection, and if you don\u2019t have a 401(k) at work, an IRA is far and away the next best thing. That\u00a0$10,000 is more than enough to max out an IRA for the year. The annual contribution limit is $5,500 right now (with an extra $1,000 allowed for those 50 or older). Max out and then select one of these other options for the rest of your cash. \u00bb MORE: How to invest your IRA 3. Get guidance from a robo-adviser Robo-advisors are what they sound like: robots \u2014 or specifically, computer algorithms \u2014 that manage your money. A $10,000 investment is enough to open an account at the majority of these companies, including Wealthfront, which manages the first $10,000 for\u00a0free. \u00bb MORE: The best robo-advisers At other advisors, you\u2019ll pay a fee of around 0.25% to 0.35% (Wealthfront\u2019s fee on assets above $10,000 is 0.25%). That fee includes the cost of management, but it doesn\u2019t include investment expenses. Robo-advisors typically use exchange-traded funds and index funds, which are fairly low-cost passive investments that track sections of the market, like the S&P 500. 4. Invest in commission-free ETFs and low-cost mutual funds If you grimaced at the mention of that robo-adviser management fee, you might be the DIY type. You can pretty easily piece together a diversified portfolio of funds yourself with $10,000. Index funds, a type of mutual fund, typically have an investment minimum, but $10,000 is more than enough to buy into several. ETFs are a kind of index fund that trades like a stock. You buy them for a share price \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s the minimum investment \u2014\u00a0and it could be as low as $50. If you also have a 401(k), you might want to use these individual funds to fill holes in the investment choices offered by the plan \u2014 401(k)s have a scaled-down mutual fund selection, and the ones that make the list can be high-fee. 5. Try your hand at investing in stocks This is kind of DIY turned up a notch \u2014 index funds and ETFs are baskets full of stocks (or bonds, depending on the type of fund you\u2019ve selected). When you use them, you get exposure to stocks without actually having to pick individual stocks. But maybe you want to invest in stocks. Go for it, with one caveat: For a long-term goal like retirement, it\u2019s best to stick to the options above and limit stock trading to 10% of your portfolio or less.

(Photo: Mark Zerof, USA TODAY Sports) LEXINGTON, Ky.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Isaac Hamilton scored 19 points, T.J. Leaf had 17 with 13 rebounds and No. 9\u00a0UCLA shot 53%\u00a0to beat No. 1 Kentucky 97-92 on Saturday, its second upset of the top-ranked Wildcats in as many years. The Bruins (9-0) matched their season scoring average to win this showdown of college basketball\u2019s winningest schools in their first-ever visit to Rupp Arena, and end the Wildcats\u2019 42-game home winning streak. Kentucky (7-1) cut a 14-point second-half deficit to 95-92 on Derek Willis\u2019 3-pointer with 8.3 seconds remaining but Bryce Alford\u2019s two free throws with 7.4 left sealed the victory. Besides hitting 35 of 66 from the field, UCLA outrebounded Kentucky 41-38 and limited the Wildcats to 41 percent shooting. It was the most points scored against a Kentucky team coached by John Calipari. Hamilton and Leaf led another balanced offensive performance that featured 14 points by Lonzo Ball, Alford and Thomas Welsh, and 13 by Aaron Holiday. Malik Monk had 24 points and De\u2019Aaron Fox added 20 for Kentucky. THE BIG PICTURE UCLA: The nation\u2019s third-highest-scoring team (97.0 points per game) was right on pace with a 49-45 halftime lead built with 58 percent shooting, including 6 of 12 from long range. Holiday was the hottest to start, making all four baskets with two 3-pointers. Ball (nation-leading 9.6 assists per game coming in) followed up a three-point first half with 11 after the break and finished with seven assists. Kentucky: The Wildcats overcame a 3-of-9 start to reach 50 percent from the field in the first half before a 1-of-8 spell to close the opening 20 minutes. They never got it going in the second half despite making 5 of 13 from long range. POLL IMPLICATIONS The Bruins\u2019 second consecutive win over Kentucky figures to move them up in the coaches poll and into the top 10 in the AP poll. Kentucky should tumble a few spots, though not many. UP NEXT UCLA: Hosts Michigan on Dec. 10 in the first meeting between the schools since 2011. The Bruins lead the series 11-5 but have lost the last two in the series. Kentucky: Hosts Valparaiso on Wednesday night. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE HOOPS Posted!

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Jill Stein, at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in August. Win McNamee/Getty Images Jill Stein has ended her statewide ballot recount effort in Pennsylvania. Lawrence M. Otter, a lawyer for the former Green Party presidential candidate, withdrew the lawsuit filed with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania early Saturday evening. \"Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinary means,\" the filing states. \"They cannot afford to post the $1,000,000 bond required by the Court.\" Stein elaborated on Twitter, asking: \"How odd is it that we must jump through bureaucratic hoops and raise millions of dollars so we can trust our election results?\" How odd is it that we must jump through bureaucratic hoops and raise millions of dollars so we can trust our election results? #Recount2016 \u2014 Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) December 4, 2016 Last month, Stein launched a fundraising campaign to pursue a recount in Pennsylvania, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 three states President-elect Donald Trump narrowly won en route to his electoral college victory. That campaign \u2014 which sought to \"ensure the integrity of our elections,\" according to her website \u2014 proved wildly successful, raking in nearly $7 million in donations to fund the former candidate's efforts. Stein subsequently filed her request for a statewide recount in Pennsylvania on Monday, just days after she officially requested a recount in Wisconsin. In Michigan, where Trump was certified the winner only last week , the situation proved to be a bit more complicated: Stein requested a recount there \u2014 only to have her request tangled by an objection from the Trump campaign. After the state's Board of State Canvassers deadlocked on the issue Friday, the Detroit Free Press reports a hand recount in Michigan appears set to proceed next week. Article continues after sponsorship Hillary Clinton's campaign reluctantly said it would participate in the proceedings, \"to ensure our campaign is legally represented,\" according to campaign lawyer Marc Erik Elias. In Pennsylvania, though, Stein's withdrawal brings an abrupt conclusion to a statewide effort that began there less than one week ago. Though \"Recounts will still proceed in a handful of Pennsylvania precincts, but it is far from the statewide recount that Ms. Stein was hoping for,\" The Wall Street Journal reports . At this time, there is no indication that Stein's campaign plans to drop its efforts in Wisconsin \u2014 where The Associated Press reports a recount is already underway \u2014 or in Michigan. ",

A line of powerful thunderstorms was about to hit Haralton County, Georgia. Just after lunch, the tornado sirens began blaring across town. And inside her classroom, cell phones beeped and buzzed \u2013 warning students of dangerous weather. Tornado Warning. Click here for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! \u201cWhen something like that happens, you worry about kids being upset, people being nervous. I have two kids of my own at the elementary school. You\u2019re immediately worried.\u201d Mrs. Labbe told me. \u201cAlready running through my head, I\u2019m praying and thinking \u2013 how can I calm these kids if anybody does start to panic?\u201d And just like that something remarkable happened \u2013 many of the teenagers began to spontaneously sing. It turns out a number of the students sheltering in the hallway were members of the school\u2019s show choir. They sang several songs \u2013 but it was the one filmed by Mrs. Labbe and posted on her Facebook page that went viral. It was a beautiful rendition of a popular Christmas song, \u201cMary Did You Know.\u201d \u201cThey started singing and everybody calmed down,\u201d she said. Mrs. Labbe is a devout Christian. She is the leader of the school\u2019s Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter. And when she heard those young people singing --- well \u2013 it was just breathtaking. \u201cI could feel the Spirit fill the hallway as they sang,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just a real calming feeling when they started singing that song.\u201d Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man? Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand? Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod? And when you kiss your little baby, you have kissed the face of God And just as the show choir concluded the song, their classmates applauded and then the principal announced that the storm had passed. Students shuffled off to class and teachers resumed their lessons and life returned to normal at Bremen High School. As the songwriter wrote, the storm was calmed with His hand.

Still, on this recent night, agents would recover 66 pounds of marijuana with a street value of roughly $53,000. Watch Weekend Nightly News at 6:30 ET tonight for more on this report But chasing drug smugglers wasn't the only thing keeping them busy. During two days that NBC News spent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, it became clear that Castro and her colleagues were dealing with a sudden surge of families from Central America who are running toward those officials \u2014 not from them. U.S. Border Patrol agents and a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper apprehend a man who they say has a previous sexual assault conviction in the United States. He was caught moments after crossing the Rio Grande from Mexico. David Douglas / NBC News Many of the families are eager to be caught so they can apply for asylum or temporary protected status as they try to escape the violence back home. Apprehensions on the Southwest border, along the Rio Grande, are rising. There were 46,195 in October \u2014 that was almost 20,000 more than the same month two years ago and the largest spike since the massive surge of unaccompanied minors during the summer of 2014. Castro said the biggest difference this time around is that the Border Patrol is better equipped to deal with the influx. A new processing center has the capacity to hold 1,000 migrants at a time. In November, the federal government even sent 150 more border patrol agents to the McAllen area in the southern tip of Texas. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent Marlene Castro, a 19-year veteran of the agency. David Douglas / NBC News \"Some people sell everything they own to make the trip over here,\" Castro said. \"They run the risk \u2014 the women, of getting raped; the men, of being robbed \u2014 and they still come over here.\" And if the flow seems never-ending, so does the debate over how best to secure the border. Related: Most Americans Don't Want Undocumented Immigrants to Leave, Poll Says During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump promised to build a \"big, beautiful\" wall to stop the flow of immigrants crossing the border illegally. He referred to some of the Mexicans coming into the country as \"rapists\" and in a testy exchange during one presidential debate, he called some of the migrants \"bad hombres\" who should not be here.

Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool Andy Savage, defense attorney for former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager, awaits a verdict from the jury on Friday. Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool Updated at 6:40 p.m. ET The jury in the murder trial of former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager told the judge on Friday afternoon that it's having trouble coming to a unanimous verdict. They will resume deliberating Monday. Slager is accused of murder for shooting Walter Scott multiple times as he ran away from the officer in 2015, after a routine traffic stop. The jury heard nearly a month of testimony in the case, including testimony from Slager. Friday was the third day of deliberations. The jurors had three options if they hoped to avoid a mistrial: a guilty verdict on murder or voluntary manslaughter, or an acquittal. Former S.C. Police Officer Takes The Stand At His Murder Trial But, as a series of Friday afternoon notes from the jury to the judge made clear, one of the 12 jurors could not agree with the other 11 on a guilty verdict. In a letter read from the bench by Judge Clifton Newman, the dissenting juror wrote, \"I understand the position of the court, but I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict. ... I expect those who hold opposing views will not change those views.\" \"We all struggle with the death of a man and with all that has been put before us,\" the letter continued. \"I still cannot convict the defendant. At the same time my heart does not want to tell the Scott family that the man who killed [Walter Scott] ... is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.\" Two other notes to the judge were both from the foreperson of the jury, who wrote in the first, \"It's just one juror who has the issues,\" and in the second, \"That juror needs to leave, he is having issues. Thank you. Sorry for all the notes.\" Article continues after sponsorship Around 4 p.m., Judge Newman asked the foreperson to clarify in writing whether the jury was hopelessly deadlocked. At that point, attorneys for the defense requested a mistrial, and the jury sent another note saying it was \"hopelessly deadlocked.\" But when the jury reentered the courtroom, the foreperson did not confirm that the jury would be unable to reach a unanimous verdict if they were given more time, saying instead that they felt more information about the law would have been helpful. About half an hour later, the foreperson told the judge the jury wished to keep deliberating. Earlier in the day, the judge refused to answer a question from the jury about the difference between \"fear\" and \"passion,\" which seemed to relate to the question of whether Slager acted in self-defense when he shot Scott. At one point in the afternoon, Judge Newman called the jury into the courtroom and encouraged members to break the deadlock. \"You should not give up your firmly held opinions just to be in agreement,\" Newman said, but \"the majority should consider the minority's position, and the minority should consider the majority's position.\" The judge said: \"If you cannot agree on a verdict, I must declare a mistrial. In that case, it doesn't mean anyone wins. It just means at some other time I will try this case with some other jury sitting where you now sit. The same participants will come, and the same lawyers will ask basically the same questions and get basically the same answers.\" As The Two-Way has reported, cellphone video from a bystander appears to show Slager shooting Scott multiple times in an empty lot at a distance of more than 15 feet. When Slager took the stand earlier this week, he said in his testimony that he had been \"in total fear\" during the incident, and contended, as he has previously, that Scott had taken his Taser stun gun. Video of the shooting does not appear to show any Taser in Scott's hand. The City of North Charleston has already approved a $6.5 million civil settlement with Scott's family in connection with the killing, and Slager is also facing separate federal civil rights charges for shooting Scott. As we've reported, \"in that indictment , federal prosecutors accuse Slager of deliberately misleading investigators by telling them he had fired his weapon 'while Scott was coming forward at him with a Taser.'\" The indictment continues, \"In truth and in fact, as defendant MICHAEL SLAGER then well knew, he (SLAGER) repeatedly fired his weapon at Scott as Scott was running away from him.\" ",

Brown, who was arrested shortly after the stabbing, is being held on $1 million bail. Though details of the motive weren\u2019t released, Los Angeles Police Officer Meghan Aguilar says Tjan was specifically targeted and that the attack wasn\u2019t random. A David Brown is listed as a graduate student in psychology on USC\u2019s website. Tjan oversaw graduate students in the department, and was killed in the building that houses the lab he ran. Los Angeles Police Officer Meghan Aguilar said Tjan was killed inside the Seeley G. Mudd building in the heart of campus. Aguilar could not say who called police but said it wasn\u2019t the professor or the student. USC President C. L. Max Nikias identified the professor killed as Bosco Tjan in a letter addressed to the USC community. The victim\u2019s age was originally reported as 25. Later, police said they could not immediately confirm the man\u2019s age, CBS Los Angeles reports . Public records list Tjan\u2019s age as 50. Tjan joined USC in 2001, taught in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and served as co-director of the Dornsife Cognitive Neuroimaging Center, Nikias said. \u201cAs the Trojan family mourns Professor Tjan\u2019s untimely passing, we will keep his family in our thoughts,\u201d Nikias said. The USC Department of Public Safety said in a statement that investigators believe the attack \u201cwas the result of a personal dispute.\u201d Chris Purington, project manager at Tjan\u2019s lab, said he never heard of anyone having a problem with Tjan - a married father of one son - and had no idea who would have wanted him dead. \u201cHe was somebody who really cared about people. I know he cared about me,\u201d Purington said through tears. \u201cHe mentored people and he looked out for them. He spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to be a mentor and guide people.\u201d He said the professor gave him a job both after he graduated from USC and after graduate school at the University of California-Berkeley. Purington traveled with Tjan for various science conferences and said that everyone knew and loved the professor. \u201cPeople talk about scientists as very cold or robotic. Bosco is a guy that he could talk to anybody about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t move through a room without being sidetracked in all these conversations. \u201cHe just had this energy about him. Kinetic might be the word,\u201d Purington said. \u201cHe had a huge impact on my life.\u201d USC was rocked last year by the beating death of graduate student Xinran Ji, who was attacked and beaten by several people as he walked back to his off-campus apartment late at night after attending a study session. After Ji\u2019s murder USC officials sought to reassure parents of Chinese exchange students that the campus and its surrounding areas are safe. In 2012, Chinese graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were shot to death as they sat in their BMW about a mile from campus. USC has 44,000 students enrolled, including more than 10,000 international students. A highly competitive school, it enrolled only about 16 percent of the more than 54,000 people who applied for its freshman class this year. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "December 2, 20166:01 PM ET The Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters went to court Friday to prevent or halt election recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, less than two weeks before the states would have to complete the tasks to meet a federal deadline to certify their election results. 5 Fact Checks From Trump's Cincinnati 'Thank-You Tour' Kickoff The legal actions seeking to block or halt the recounts in three states Trump narrowly won could cause delays that would make them extremely difficult or impossible to complete on time. Even if the recounts happen, though, none would be expected to give Democrat Hillary Clinton enough votes to emerge as the winner. The recounts were requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who says they're necessary to ensure that voting machines weren't hacked, even though there's no evidence that they were. Critics say Stein is simply trying to raise money and her political profile while building a donor database. Wisconsin Agrees To Presidential Vote Recount At Third-Party Candidates' Requests \"In an election already tainted by suspicion, previously expressed by Donald Trump himself, verifying the vote is a common-sense procedure that would address concerns around voter disenfranchisement,\" Stein said in a statement. \"Trump's desperate attempts to silence voter demands raise a simple question: why is Donald Trump afraid of these recounts?\" Wisconsin is the only state where a recount is underway. It began Thursday, and one of the state's 72 counties had already completed its task by Friday, with Clinton gaining a single a vote on Trump. Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. Two pro-Trump groups, the Great America PAC and the Stop Hillary PAC, along with Wisconsin voter Ronald R. Johnson went to federal court late Thursday to try and stop the recount. U.S. District Judge James Peterson on Friday rejected their request for a temporary restraining order to immediately halt the recount, saying there was no harm in allowing it to continue while the court considers their lawsuit. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Dec. 9. The lawsuit says Wisconsin is violating the U.S. Supreme Court's 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling because it doesn't have uniform standards to determine which votes should be counted in a recount. They also argue that it threatens due process rights because it may not get done by the federal deadline to certify the vote, putting Wisconsin's electoral votes in jeopardy. Article continues after sponsorship Clinton Campaign Says It Will Participate In Recount Efforts If states miss the deadline, Congress would allot their electoral votes. The Wisconsin Department of Justice was reviewing the lawsuit, said Johnny Koremenos, spokesman for Attorney General Brad Schimel. Michigan's elections board deadlocked Friday on a Trump campaign request to deny Stein's recount request and on how a recount would be conducted. Both Republican members voted to prevent the recount while both Democrats voted to allow it, meaning it likely would begin Wednesday unless the courts intervene. It also would be conducted by hand, as Stein requested. In separate lawsuits against the state, Michigan's Republican attorney general and Trump asked state courts to prevent the recount, saying Stein should not be allowed to seek one because she finished so far behind Trump and Clinton that she couldn't have won, even if some votes were miscounted. Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in all three states. The Michigan courts appeared unlikely to rule immediately, with one asking for a response from state elections officials by Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, a hearing is scheduled for Monday on Stein's push to secure a court-ordered statewide recount there. Republican lawyers filed a motion that was posted on the court's website Friday accusing Stein of engaging in legal antics and saying her recount request endangers Pennsylvania's ability to certify its electors by the federal deadline. Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the votes in all three states suggest that there could have been tampering with the vote, perhaps through a well-coordinated, highly complex cyberattack. Elections officials in the three states have expressed confidence in their results. Trump defeated Clinton in Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. His margin of victory in Michigan was even slimmer, at about 10,700 votes out of 4.8 million cast. An updated count Friday by Pennsylvania election officials showed Trump's lead over Clinton in that state had shrunk to 49,000 from 71,000, as more counties wrap up final tallies. That put Trump's lead at 0.8 percent, down from over 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast. It's still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount. ",

The settlement was reached Friday. The law levies hefty fines against those who offer to rent out their entire living space for less than 30 days. Supporters say it's necessary because some property owners take apartments that could be homes for city residents out of circulation. Airbnb said the law rewarded the hotel industry at the expense of ordinary New Yorkers. It says it'll work with the city on how the law will be enforced. Democratic Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal who wrote the law calls the settlement \"an astounding about-face\" by Airbnb. 0 Shares ",

This marks the 15th year that Art Basel has been held in the Miami area. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) 0 Shares Email \"Fidel, may you rot in hell.\" That was the stark message on a mural outside a popular thrift store in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood that had dozens waiting in line to sign their name. The trendy neighborhood is known for graffiti art outside most businesses. This year, the death of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro came just days before nearly 100,000 art buyers, gallery owners and celebrities flooded South Florida for Art Basel Miami Beach. Art galleries in Wynwood host many of the events. An artist called the Give Good Works store and asked to paint something Saturday to commemorate Castro's death. Murals along the store's front wall are a common outlet for artistic expression. Artists did several during the election, including one that said 'no walls' referring to President-elect Donald Trump's promise to build a wall along the Mexican border. Regina Macdonald, part owner of the store, said about 100 people signed the wall. Many were passionate. It drew no complaints, she said. \"We try not to synthesize it too much. I thought, 'Really, do we want to say that?' ... And people went crazy. There were lines down the street.\" One message read, \"The tyrant is dead,\" and another said: \"Hope he chokes. Trump you're next.\" The mural was removed Wednesday and replaced with a drawing of a woman with flowing, psychedelic pink hair holding a cup of coffee that read \" Cuba Libre.\" Just a few miles away on Wednesday, hundreds of Cuban exiles in Miami rallied for freedom and democracy on the communist island. Macdonald said the decision to replace the mural was not because of criticism but simply because they like to change things up. \"Wynwood is very much a forum for art. People come here to express themselves ... when there's something hot politically going on, we put it on the wall,\" she said. 0 Shares ",

A Commonwealth Court hearing had been scheduled in the case for Monday, and the $1 million bond was due later that day. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has spearheaded a recount effort in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states where Republican Donald Trump won narrowly over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein brought her call for an election recount in several key battleground states to Pennsylvania on Monday, filing a petition on behalf of state voters just hours ahead of a deadline to contest the Nov. 8 results. The lawsuit filed in Commonwealth Court... (Laura Olson, Peter Hall and Steve Esack) Trump and the Pennsylvania GOP had asked the court to throw out the Green Party-backed request. The GOP argued there's no evidence or even allegation that tampering with the state's voting systems occurred and that the law doesn't specifically allow a court-ordered recount. The Green Party's quest for a recount included an examination for malware inside voting machines and systems and was met with resistance. Some county officials said they had already done an audit of network security, or that granting outside access to their election systems would violate state law. Hillary Clinton and one for U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey . A group of about a dozen observers \u2014 lawyers from New York and Philadelphia and neighbors from Lower Macungie... A recount of votes in six Lehigh County election districts turned up few discrepancies Wednesday, shifting the outcome by three votes for Hillary Clinton and one for U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey . A group of about a dozen observers \u2014 lawyers from New York and Philadelphia and neighbors from Lower Macungie... (Peter Hall) Pennsylvania's top elections official, Secretary of State Pedro Cortes, a Democrat, said there was no evidence of any sort of cyberattacks or irregularities in the election. Still, Pennsylvania is viewed as perhaps the nation's biggest target to hack. It's a swing state with a large number of electoral votes crucial to winning the White House and its election systems are seen as relatively vulnerable. The Green Party's seat-of-the-pants recount effort also targeted Michigan and Wisconsin, states that, like Pennsylvania, had supported Democrats for president and were narrowly won by Trump. A forensic audit of election software is more important in Pennsylvania than in many other states, say nonpartisan election watchdogs. That's because the vast majority of Pennsylvania voters cast ballots on a machine that does not show voters a paper receipt, independent of the machine software, to verify that the machine faithfully recorded their votes.

(Photo: Mark D. Smith, USA TODAY Sports) NORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 With his best receiver sidelined, Baker Mayfield still boosted his Heisman Trophy resume. Mayfield passed for 288 yards and three touchdowns, and No. 7 Oklahoma defeated No. 10 Oklahoma State 38-20 on Saturday in a matchup that decided the Big 12 champion and likely guaranteed the Sooners a trip to the Sugar Bowl. Mayfield performed well throughout, despite finishing the game without Biletnikoff Award finalist Dede Westbrook. The speedster caught four passes for 111 yards before being knocked out of the game in the second quarter on a crushing hit by Oklahoma State safety Jordan Sterns. Mayfield threw two touchdown passes after Westbrook left the game, and the offense didn't miss a beat, finishing with 629 yards. \u201cHe was just fantastic, he was just exactly what he needed to be,\u201d Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said of Mayfield. \u201cHe gave our guys chances to make plays, he handled the ball great himself, had a few key runs for us, threw the ball. The guy\u2019s really, really talented. To be able to do what he did, there\u2019s not many guys who could do what he did today.\u201d Mayfield finished fourth in the Heisman balloting last year, but he didn\u2019t get an invitation to New York for the ceremony. He wants to go this year, and he wants Westbrook to get an invitation, too. After the game, Mayfield wore a pin from the school with both his and Westbrook\u2019s names on it. Mayfield crossed out his own name with a marker to make sure Westbrook wasn\u2019t forgotten. \u201cDede is the best player in the country,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cI still want to hold Dede\u2019s hand all the way to New York.\u201d Mayfield should be a Heisman front-runner heading into next season, too. He said after the game that he plans to return for his senior season. \u201cComing back, be here for another year,\u201d he said. \u201cOpportunity for a three-peat (Big 12). The ultimate goal is why I came here \u2014 to win a national title.\u201d Samaje Perine rambled for 239 yards on a career-high 37 carries and Joe Mixon caught a touchdown pass and busted a 79-yard touchdown run for the Sooners (10-2, 9-0 Big 12, No. 9 College Football Playoff). It was the second straight time the teams met in the regular-season finale to determine the conference champion. Oklahoma beat the Cowboys 58-23 last season. In this year\u2019s showdown, Mason Rudolph completed just 11 of 25 passes for 186 yards for Oklahoma State (9-3, 7-2, No. 10 CFP). His top target for the season, James Washington, caught just two passes for 50 yards on eight targets. \u201cJust a rough day,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cI\u2019ll take all the responsibility for the lack of production, especially in the second half. Obviously, it needed to be better.\u201d IMAGES FROM WEEK 14 IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Sheriff: McKnight Shooting Was 'Road Rage'; Defends Case By rebecca santana, associated press HARVEY, La. \u0097 Dec 2, 2016, 10:36 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - This is a 2013 file photo showing New York Jets running back Joe McKnight. Former NFL player McKnight has been shot to death following an argument at an intersection with another motorist. Jefferson Parish (La.) Sheriff Newell Normand says it happened about 2:43 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Terrytown, a suburb of New Orleans. (AP Photo/File) 0 Shares Email The shooting death of an ex-NFL player in a New Orleans suburb was a \"road rage\" incident that began on a nearby bridge, a sheriff said Friday, as he urged against a rush to judgment and defended his handling of the case. Joe McKnight was shot Thursday afternoon in Terrytown, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. Authorities identified 54-year-old Ronald Gasser, who stayed at the scene, as the shooter and released him overnight, sparking criticism. At a news conference Friday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said the altercation that ended with McKnight's death started on a nearby bridge \u2014 possibly when one of the two men cut the other off \u2014 and then proceeded into streets of the New Orleans suburb. He didn't say which driver cut off the other. Authorities said Gasser shot McKnight three times from inside his car with a semi-automatic handgun while McKnight was standing outside. Witnesses reported the two had been in a heated argument, the sheriff said. Normand defended his handling of the case, saying the investigation was ongoing. No charges have been filed. Some protesters upset at Gasser's release gathered outside the sheriff's office earlier Friday. Speaking of Gasser's release, the sheriff said the state has certain \"statutes\" that provide a defense to certain crimes but did not go into further detail. \"The easiest thing for me would have been 'Book him, Danno.' Right?\" Normand said, referring to the police saying made popular on \"Hawaii Five-0.\" But Normand urged caution. \"Mr. Gasser is not going anywhere. He has been completely cooperative with us in every request we have made,\" he said. \"We will do a very through and deliberate investigation.\" But news late Friday that Gasser was involved in a similar altercation with a driver a decade ago will likely raise further questions about who was the aggressor. Normand said in a press release late Friday that in February 2006, Gasser chased down and beat another driver in what appeared to be the same intersection where McKnight was shot and killed Thursday. In the 2006 incident, a man observed a truck driving erratically and called a number on the truck, speaking to a man later identified as Gasser. Gasser and the man got into a fight on the phone and then Gasser followed the man to a service station, confronted him and hit him several times. Gasser drove away and the victim called 911. Investigators found Gasser and issued a misdemeanor summons for simple battery, which was later dismissed. Authorities said they are trying to determine why it was dismissed. Normand earlier Friday didn't go into details from the investigation, saying he didn't want to taint any prospective witnesses that might still come forward. But he did reject a number of accounts in local media speculating about the shooting. In particular, Normand said there was no video of the incident and that Gasser did not stand over McKnight and fire shots into him. Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich backed that up, saying Knight's three wounds were not consistent with being shot from above. McKnight's grandmother said family members are still seeking information about the player's death and why Gasser was released. Barbara Franklin told The Associated Press relatives are \"trying to find out our own selves\" just what happened. Of Gasser, she said by phone, \"He might be released now, but God is going to bring about justice in it.\" McKnight is the second former NFL player this year to die in the New Orleans area in an apparent road rage incident. Former New Orleans Saints player Will Smith was killed in a shooting last April sparked by a traffic altercation. Normand said no gun was found outside either vehicle. A sheriff's office spokesman, Col. John Fortunato, said authorities are searching both vehicles. Fortunato said McKnight didn't have a weapon on his person or near his body when found. Gasser couldn't immediately be reached by The Associated Press. His release raised questions about what exactly led to the shooting. Arthur A. Lemmann, a New Orleans-based attorney not connected to the case, cautioned that it was too early to tell but it could indicate Gasser says he acted in self-defense. \"It's not the end of the matter ... but what it indicates to me is that there was some basis to believe that the homicide was justified. And the most typical justification of a homicide is self-defense,\" Lemmann said. McKnight played three seasons for the New York Jets and one with the Kansas City Chiefs . He spent this season in the Canadian Football League . McKnight was considered the nation's No. 1 running back recruit when he came out of Louisiana in 2006 and signed with the University of Southern California. He was drafted by the Jets in the fourth round in 2010. In a mostly somber New York Jets locker room, former teammates remembered McKnight. Only a handful of players remain from those New York teams, but the impact McKnight left was clear. \"In my rookie year, he was like the first guy who actually talked to me here,\" said quarterback Geno Smith, who was drafted in 2013. \"Joe was cool, man. He was funny. Just a real laid-back guy, always kept you laughing and always a smile on his face.\" A few veteran players declined to comment in the locker room because they were so upset by the news, but later issued statements through the team. \"My memories from him are working hard,\" cornerback Darrelle Revis said. \"He came in his rookie year and it was a little rocky for him trying to learn the system. And then his second year, he took off as an explosive kick returner and he won us numerous games.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press reporters Jeff Amy in Jackson, Mississippi, and Dennis Waszak Jr. in Florham Park, New Jersey contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Rebecca Santana on Twitter @ruskygal. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "info <p>A Tacoma Police mobile command vehicle remains parked behind yellow tape, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, near the home in Tacoma, Wash. where Tacoma Police Officer Reginald \u201cJake\u201d Gutierrez was fatally shot while responding to a domestic violence call Wednesday, Gutierrez died later in the day at a hospital.&nbsp;</p> Close AP Photo/Ted S. Warren SEATTLE -- The gunman had already shot a police officer, threatened to kill two children and barricaded himself upstairs in a house for 11 hours when one of the kids, a 6-year-old boy, escaped. As the suspect held a little girl as a human shield , his movements exposed him to a sheriff\u2019s marksman who targeted him through a window and killed him with a shot to the head, allowing the 8-year-old girl to break free from his grasp and run to safety, authorities disclosed Friday about the killing of Bruce R. Johnson in Tacoma, Washington.\u00a0 \u201cOnce we were able to assess that the kids were still alive, it went into play,\u201d sheriff\u2019s spokesman Ed Troyer said of the SWAT team\u2019s plan to end the standoff in a suburban neighborhood south of Seattle. \u201cHe had a choice to put the guns down. We weren\u2019t about to let those kids get hurt.\u201d\u00a0 Law enforcement officers gather at Tacoma General Hospital, where a Tacoma Police officer was taken after being fatally shot while responding to a domestic violence call, Nov. 30, 2016, in Tacoma, Wash. Close AP Johnson was the subject of an officer safety bulletin in mid-November after he was spotted walking through the Tacoma Mall armed and dressed like a plainclothes cop, CBS affiliate KIRO reports .\u00a0 The bulletin obtained by KIRO shows Johnson walking through the Tacoma Mall Nov. 15 wearing a Sheriff\u2019s Department hat, a set of handcuffs on his belt and carrying what appeared to be a soft rifle case. A still picture taken from mall surveillance video shows the 38-year-old Johnson carrying the rifle case over his right shoulder as he walked past shoppers. The bulletin states Johnson became irate when mall security tried to talk to him. After a brief exchange with security Johnson purchased some coffee and left making obscene gestures and yelling, \u201cSee, see what they are doing to me?\u201d Tacoma police stopped Johnson as he drove away and spotted an unloaded 20-gauge shotgun in the front seat of his car. info Close Asked why he was attempting to look like a police officer the bulletin states Johnson replied that he \u201cliked police and wanted essentially to fit in with law enforcement.\u201d The standoff began Wednesday night after Police Officer Reginald \u201cJake\u201d Gutierrez, 45, was fatally shot when he and his partner went into the house to investigate a domestic violence call. Gutierrez\u2019s partner returned fire and helped get Johnson\u2019s wife safely out of the house. Other officers came under fire as they worked their way into the house and pulled Gutierrez out. He later died in surgery. Police escorted his body to a funeral home Friday as people lined the streets to pay their respects. The 17-year veteran officer is survived by three daughters and a granddaughter. A fund has been set up to help the children, and the department is overseeing another fund to help with memorial services. Police went to the house Wednesday after Johnson\u2019s wife told animal control officers that he had locked her out of the house. The officers called police. Several adults and the two children had been in the home earlier in the day, but it was not initially clear whether everyone had escaped when the shooting started, Tacoma police spokeswoman Loretta Cool said. \u201cOthers were saying the kids went down to the park, but nobody could confirm where they were,\u201d Cool said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a sighting of them the whole time, no noise.\u201d As officials negotiated with Johnson, the SWAT team moved into the basement and then to the main floor of the house, cornering him upstairs, Troyer said. That\u2019s when they confirmed the kids were still inside. Johnson had threatened to kill the children, and officers heard screaming and gunshots during the standoff, but once the officers determined the children were still alive, they executed a plan to get them out. Before they could act, the 6-year-old boy bolted down the stairs and onto the porch. Johnson held onto the girl, but the activity exposed him to the marksman outside. It only took one shot, and Johnson was dead. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "Many of those who observed the general\u2019s time at the agency described him as someone who alienated both superiors and subordinates with his sharp temperament, his refusal to brook dissent, and what his critics considered a conspiratorial worldview. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those qualities could prove problematic for a national security adviser, especially one who will have to mediate the conflicting views of cabinet secretaries and agencies for a president with no experience in defense or foreign policy issues. Traditionally, the job has gone to a Washington veteran: Condoleezza Rice, for instance, or Thomas E. Donilon. The Last Word The new job will give Mr. Flynn, 57, nearly unfettered access to the Oval Office. Whether it is renewed bloodletting in Ukraine, a North Korean nuclear test or a hurricane swamping Haiti, he will often have the last word with Mr. Trump about how the United States should react. For Mr. Flynn, serving as the president\u2019s chief adviser on defense and foreign policy matters, represents a triumphal return to government after being dismissed as agency director in 2014 after two years there. Heading the agency, the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence arm, was supposed to be the capstone of a storied career. Through tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Flynn had built a reputation as a brash and outspoken officer with an unusual talent for unraveling terrorist networks, and both his fiercest critics and his outspoken supporters praise his work from those wars. In numerous interviews and speeches over the past year, Mr. Flynn, who did not respond to requests for comment for this article, has maintained that he was forced out as director for refusing to toe the Obama administration\u2019s line that Al Qaeda was in retreat. The claim has made the general something of a cult figure among many Republicans. \u201cD.I.A. has always been a problem child and it remains that way,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cFlynn tried to get in there and fix things and he was only given two years until they ran him out because they didn\u2019t like his assessment.\u201d The congressman added: \u201cThey didn\u2019t have an excuse to fire him, so they made it up. Nobody has been able to fix that place.\u201d But others say he was forced out for a relatively simple reason: He failed to effectively manage a sprawling, largely civilian bureaucracy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the agency, \u201cFlynn surrounded himself with loyalists. In implementing his vision, he moved at light speed, but he didn\u2019t communicate effectively,\u201d said Douglas H. Wise, deputy director from 2014 until he retired in August. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tolerate it well when subordinates didn\u2019t move fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a senior military officer, he expected compliance and didn\u2019t want any pushback.\u201d The Boss Is Always Right Founded in 1961, the Defense Intelligence Agency has long been in the shadow of the Central Intelligence Agency, and with the end of the Cold War it lost its primary mission of collecting and analyzing information about the Soviet military. Strained by a decade of conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was performing an uncertain role within the constellation of American spy agencies when Mr. Flynn arrived at headquarters in mid-2012. The agency\u2019s system of human intelligence collection was perceived as largely broken. The effort to rebuild it was underway when Mr. Flynn took control in 2012, but he made it immediately known that he had a dim view of the agency\u2019s recent performance. During a tense gathering of senior officials at an off-site retreat, he gave the assembled group a taste of his leadership philosophy, according to one person who attended the meeting and insisted on anonymity to discuss classified matters. Mr. Flynn said that the first thing everyone needed to know was that he was always right. His staff would know they were right, he said, when their views melded to his. The room fell silent, as employees processed the lecture from their new boss. Current and former employees said Mr. Flynn had trouble adjusting his style for an organization with a 16,500-person work force that was 80 percent civilian. He was used to a strict military chain of command, and was at times uncomfortable with the often-messy give-and-take that is common among intelligence analysts. Some also described him as a Captain Queeg-like character, paranoid that his staff members were undercutting him and credulous of conspiracy theories. At times, the general also exhibited what a number of officials described as tone-deafness on the larger strategic challenges confronting the nation. The most glaring example came in early March 2014, just after Russia had seized Crimea. American officials were weighing whether to impose sanctions in response, but Mr. Flynn was pushing ahead with plans to travel to Moscow to build on an existing intelligence-sharing initiative with his Russian counterparts. He also wanted to invite Russian military intelligence officials to Washington to discuss the threat of Islamist militants. His superiors ordered both canceled. Advertisement Continue reading the main story By the end of his tenure, he had largely cut out senior staff members from significant decision-making, relying instead on a small circle of trusted advisers he had come to know during his overseas military deployments. His bosses \u2014 Michael G. Vickers, the under secretary of defense for intelligence, and James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence \u2014 came to think that the agency was adrift, and that Mr. Flynn refused to address its biggest problems. \u201cRegrettably, he got engaged in an increasingly bitter and organizationally paralyzing feud with his senior staff when he should have been focused on building the intelligence capabilities\u201d of the agency, said Mr. Vickers, who was Mr. Flynn\u2019s immediate boss at the Pentagon. During his tour in Iraq, he served under Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, running intelligence for the military\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command, whose relentless campaign of raids and airstrikes hollowed out Al Qaeda in Iraq. When General McChrystal went to run the war in Afghanistan in 2009, Mr. Flynn signed on as his intelligence chief. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a staid intelligence officer. He was aggressive. He was about the mission,\u201d said Richard M. Frankel, a former senior F.B.I. official who worked with Mr. Flynn at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \u201cHe can have sharp elbows because he is about the mission.\u201d He burnished his reputation as an intelligence officer \u2014 but also for controversy. He co-wrote a paper, \u201cFixing Intel,\u201d that offered an early hint of his disdain for the civilian intelligence analysts he would later clash with at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Published by a Washington think tank, it bluntly stated that \u201cthe U.S. intelligence community is only marginally relevant to the overall strategy,\u201d infuriating officials at the D.I.A. and the C.I.A. More problematic from the military\u2019s perspective was Mr. Flynn\u2019s willingness to share intelligence with other countries. He returned to Washington at the end of 2010, and found himself under investigation for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, arguably the most capable faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan. His superiors eventually concluded that he was trying to prod Pakistan to crack down on the Haqqanis (they have yet to do so), and the general remains unapologetic about sharing intelligence with British and Australian forces. \u201cThey\u2019re our closest allies! I mean, really, we\u2019re fighting together and I can\u2019t share a single piece of paper?\u201d he said in an interview last year. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Around the same time, he was also getting to know Michael A. Ledeen, a controversial writer and former Reagan administration official. The two men connected immediately, sharing a similar worldview and a belief that America was in a world war against Islamist militants allied with Russia, Cuba and North Korea. That worldview is what Mr. Flynn came to be best known for during the presidential campaign, when he argued that the United States faced a singular, overarching threat, and that there was just one accurate way to describe it: \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d He has posted on Twitter that fear of Muslims is rational, written that Islamic law is spreading in the United States, and said that Islam itself is more like a political ideology than a religion. The United States, he wrote in \u201cField of Fight,\u201d a book about radical Islam he co-wrote with Mr. Ledeen, is \u201cin a world war, but very few people recognize it.\u201d Implicating Iran Mr. Flynn saw the Benghazi attack in September 2012 as just one skirmish in this global war. But it was his initial reaction to the event, immediately seeking evidence of an Iranian role, that many saw as emblematic of a conspiratorial bent. Iran, a Shiite nation, has generally eschewed any alliance with Sunni militants like the ones who attacked the American diplomatic compound. For weeks, he pushed analysts for evidence that the attack might have had a state sponsor \u2014 sometimes shouting at them when they didn\u2019t come to the conclusions he wanted. The attack, he told his analysts, was a \u201cblack swan\u201d event that required more creative intelligence analysis to decipher. \u201cTo ask employees to look for the .0001 percent chance of something when you have an actual emergency and dead Americans is beyond the pale,\u201d said Joshua Manning, an agency analyst from 2009 to 2013. Beyond Benghazi, American officials said that in time, the general grew angrier at what he saw as the Obama administration\u2019s passivity in dealing with worldwide threats \u2014 from Sunni extremist terrorism to Iran. He also saw the C.I.A., an organization he had long disdained, as overly political and too willing to advance the White House\u2019s agenda. In particular, he became convinced that the C.I.A. was refusing to declassify many of the documents found at Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, because they seemed to undercut the administration\u2019s narrative about Qaeda strength at the time Bin Laden was killed. \u201cIf they put out what we knew, then the president could\u2019ve not said, in a national election, Al Qaeda\u2019s on the run and we\u2019ve killed Bin Laden,\u201d Mr. Flynn said before the latest election, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election bid. \u201cEven today, he talks about Bin Laden as though that was a stroke of genius. I mean, c\u2019mon!\u201d Adam Goldman and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

USA TODAY NETWORK Firefighters assess the scene where a fire tore through a warehouse party early Dec. 3, 2016 in Oakland. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AP) OAKLAND \u2014 At least nine people are dead and\u00a0as many as two dozen others also may have perished in a massive fire that broke out late Friday in an Oakland warehouse and artists collective in what Mayor Libby Schaaf on Saturday called a \"terrible tragedy.'' Alameda County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ray Kelly said it could take at least 48 hours to tally the number of casualties because of the continuing danger posed to firefighters by the unstable and charred remains of the structure in the city's Fruitvale district. The fire\u00a0broke out during an electronic music party\u00a0at the warehouse, which had illegally been turned into artists studios and living spaces. At 4:15 local time Kelly said that firefighters had removed four of the nine bodies officials could see when they went into the entrance of the building. These were being fingerprinted, and Oakland officials were working quickly to identify them for the anxious families who are awaiting word of their loved ones. The Oakland Fire Department is bringing in tractors, bulldozers and a crane Saturday night to get into the ruined building in a search for the bodies of the dead. \"We're going to have to cut a hole through the building. It's blocked at the entrance so we have to gain access on\u00a0the other side,\" Kelly said. \"It's very twisted debris in there. There are wires and beams and wood. It's all fallen in on itself. We're thinking about bringing in cadaver dogs and robots to get into all the crevices,\" he said. \"This is a devastating scene,'' the mayor said at a briefing Saturday afternoon at a makeshift podium within sight of the building, adding that the investigation and recovery effort would be a \"complex'' undertaking. Schaaf said she had met earlier Saturday with a roomful of people still searching for loved ones\u00a0but could not say exactly how many may have perished in the blaze. \"It was painful to tell them that it will take a considerable amount of time'' to determine the number of victims,\u00a0Schaaf said.\u00a0\"Our focus right now is on the victims and their families and ensuring that we have a full accounting for everyone who was impacted by this tragedy.\" Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed told reporters that most of the dead were found on the second floor of the building.\u00a0She\u00a0said it took about five hours to put out the blaze in the\u00a0building, which did not appear to have sprinklers.\u00a0The building didn\u2019t have a clear exit path, she said.

Firefighters were only able to get in about 20 yards before they had to pull back before the building itself was too unsafe. \u201cThe walls were moving,\u201d Hoffman said. Firefighters worked to shore up the building so they could safely search for bodies. The search was able to get underway about 3:30 p.m. Saturday but will\u00a0likely take\u00a0days, Schaaf said. City officials confirmed Saturday that building authorities had opened an investigation\u00a0just last month into complaints about the safety of the structure. That inquiry was ongoing when the fire struck. An inspector from Oakland\u2019s Department of Planning had attempted to enter the building on Nov. 17 in response to complaints of illegal building and blight in the lot next door, but was unable to get in, Oakland's \u00a0Planning and Building Director\u00a0Darin Ranelletti\u00a0said\u00a0Saturday. Whether the inspector couldn't get in because he was refused entrance or simply because no one was at home wasn\u2019t immediately known. Fire officials\u00a0said the search of the building was stymied when the\u00a0roof collapsed. Because of the precarious state of the structure, officials with the coroner\u2019s office was unable to begin recovering bodies until nearly seven hours after the fire\u00a0struck. The scent of\u00a0the smoldering building could be detected from blocks away Saturday afternoon. \"One of the issues was that leading up to the second floor there was only one way up and down,\" Reed told reporters. \"It was my understanding that the stairwell was kind of makeshift, that they put it together with pallets.\" Around 1:30 p.m., firefighters began unloading lumber to the building to shore up dangerously damaged walls and ceilings so crews could continue the gruesome task of searching for bodies in the charred remains of the two-story stucco structure. Drones launched to find victims Kelly\u00a0said investigators had\u00a0launched drones with thermal imaging capability over the gutted building to help officials find additional victims. \"Our focus right now is on the victims and their families and ensuring that we have a full accounting for everyone who was impacted by this tragedy.\" \" \u2014 Libby Schaaf (@LibbySchaaf) December 3, 2016 One witness who escaped the blaze, Bob Mule, told the East Bay Times that a friend hurt himself and asked for help getting out. Mule said he tried, but couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cIt was too hot, too much smoke; I had to get out of there,\u201d said Mule, a photographer and artist who lives in the building and suffered minor burns. \u201cI literally felt my skin peeling and my lungs being suffocated by smoke. I couldn\u2019t get the fire extinguisher to work.\" \u2014 Oakland Firefighters (@OaklandFireLive) December 3, 2016 About 50 people are believed to have been\u00a0inside the building at the time of the blaze, according to fire department officials. Kelly said most of the victims were believed to be in their \u00a020s and 30s, and some were thought to be visitors from other countries. Kelly said the investigation will be slow, because of the state of the scene. \"It's just a task to get through the front door with all the debris and wreckage that's there,\" Kelly said. \"We're slowly making our way in, and we have to go systematically because any misstep on the part of our people could mean they get injured or fall through a floor or have something fall on top of them.\" An electronic-music party\u00a0dubbed\u00a0Golden Donna 100% Silk was set for Friday night at the warehouse, called\u00a0 \"The Ghost Ship\u201d by the artists who used it. Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo, whose district includes the warehouse, told the San Francisco Chronicle that the building \u201chas been an issue for a number of years.\u201d \u201cPeople have been living inside, and the neighbors have complained about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these young people that were in there were underage. They frequently had parties there.\u201d Friends and family took to social media Saturday to post and seek information on loved ones\u00a0who might have been there.The sheriff's office has\u00a0set up a family notification and assistance center at the Alameda County Building. Authorities were\u00a0asking family and friends who believe they have loved ones who may have been in the warehouse to contact the sheriff's department. \"We are hoping for the best,\" said Terry Ewing, whose girlfriend was planning on attending the party and was among the missing. The Fruitvale neighborhood, where the building is located, has long been a majority Latino area. The streets are lined with taco shops\u00a0and Latin grocery stores and shops for sending money and goods to various countries in Central and South America. It also is home to increasing numbers of artists, musicians and others, of all races and ethnicities, many of whom have been priced out of San Francisco. Whether the people who lived in the units in the building\u2019s second floor were new to the area or were long-time residents wasn\u2019t known. Hushed groups of neighbors gathered at the area in front of the building where it was possible to see the soot-blackened front over the police tape, mostly speaking in Spanish. Blessed Vorgar, 23, has lived two blocks from\u00a0the building since she was 12. \"God have mercy on them,\" she said of those who had died.\u00a0 14919 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 124 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gzuoBi ",

A former NFL player has become a partner with an affiliate of a medical marijuana company based in Illinois. Eugene Monroe , former offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens , was named a full-time partner and co-CEO of Green Thumb Industries in Pennsylvania, the parent company of which is GTI Investments... (Robert McCoppin) The reigning NBA Coach of the Year acknowledged he tried marijuana twice in the past 18 months while dealing with debilitating back pain that still affects him this season. Sure, it caught the team by surprise, West said, because \"it came out of nowhere.\" Kerr told Comcast SportsNet Bay Area's Warriors Insider Podcast with Monte Poole on Friday that he used medicinal marijuana but it didn't help \u2014 and painkillers have often been worse. \"I have no idea if I would, maybe I would have failed a drug test, I don't even know if I'm subject to a drug test or any laws from the NBA,\" Kerr said. \"I tried it and it didn't help at all.\" He was expected to further address the marijuana use before Saturday night's game against Phoenix at Oracle Arena. Green said he hasn't needed painkillers nor has he tried marijuana, never having a serious injury or requiring surgery. Guard Klay Thompson would support drugs for medicinal use only. \"Steve's open-minded, and obviously with the way the world's going, if there's anything you can do that's medicinal, people are all for it, especially when there's stuff like Crohn's disease out there, glaucoma, a bunch of stuff, cancer. But not recreationally, that should not be of its use ever. There's a medicinal side to it that people are finding out have benefits, especially people with really high pain.\" California was the first state to embrace legal, medicinal marijuana two decades ago. Twenty-eight states and Washington, D.C., now allow marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. ",

Hmm, thinking about it Steve Weisman, Special for USA TODAY 12:34 p.m. EST December 3, 2016 People are so freaked about being cyber secure, 39% in a recent poll would give up sex for a year for a guarantee that their computers would be hack-free. (Photo: Thinkstock) Although the question of whether you would give up sex for a year in return for total cybersecurity seems like an odd question, it is one that was posed to 2,000 adults in a poll recently taken by\u00a0Harris. \u00a0The response to the question was startling. \u00a0According to the poll, 39% of Americans are so fearful of their cybersecurity that they said yes. Unfortunately, you can never totally control your own cybersecurity.\u00a0 Often people become victims of identity theft and other cybercrimes due to the neglect and failure of companies and government agencies to properly secure our personal information. \u00a0An example of this was the massive data breach at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) where sensitive personal information of more than 20\u00a0million people was stolen.\u00a0 However, although we will always only be as secure as the companies and agencies with the weakest cybersecurity that store our personal information, there are many simple steps we can take to dramatically increase our personal cybersecurity and none of them entail giving up sex for a year. Here is a list of steps you can take: 1.\u00a0 \u00a0Use strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts so that even if there is a data breach at one account, all of your other accounts will not be in jeopardy. \u00a0A strong password contains capital letters, small letters and symbols.\u00a0 A password base made up of a phrase such as \u201cIDon\u2019tLike Passwords!!!\u201d is strong and can be personally adapted for each \u00a0of your accounts by merely adding a few letters at the end to distinguish the particular account, such\u00a0as \u00a0adding \u201cAma\u201d to the base password to become your Amazon password. 2.\u00a0 Many email hacks have been accomplished by the hacker answering the victim\u2019s security question with information readily obtained through public sources or even from the postings of the victim on social media.\u00a0 The simple solution to this problem is to create a nonsensical answer to your security question.\u00a0 No hacker will be able to discover it and the answer is generally so silly that it is easy to remember.\u00a0 For example, you could make \u201cfiretruck\u201d the answer to the question as to what is your mother\u2019s maiden name. 3.\u00a0 Install security software on all of your electronic devices including your computer and smartphone.\u00a0 It is also important to keep that security software updated with the latest security patches as soon as they are issued.\u00a0 Many hackers exploit software vulnerabilities for which security patches have already been issued, but their victims have been slow to install. 4. \u00a0As I've said before\u00a0\u2014 Trust me, you can't trust anyone. \u00a0Don't provide personal information to anyone who contacts you by email, phone or text message unless you have absolutely confirmed both the legitimacy of the communication and the need for the information. \u00a0Scammers go \"phishing\" for this information all the time. Be especially leery of \"spear phishing,\" where the phishing email or text message has been tailored with information to target you individually. This approach has been responsible for most of the major data breaches in recent years, including against the entertainment company\u00a0Sony and the OPM. 5.\u00a0 Limit as much as possible the information you put on social media that can be used to make you a victim of identity theft or susceptible to spear phishing.\u00a0 The more personal information that is available about you online, the easier it is to make you a victim of identity theft.\u00a0 In particular, your Social Security number can be readily abused to make you a victim of identity theft, so limit the places that have it to those that really need it.\u00a0 Your doctor doesn\u2019t need it although doctors commonly ask for it. 6.\u00a0 Use enhanced authentication techniques such as biometrics or a security key. This key\u00a0is a small device that can be attached to your key ring and inserted into a USB port in your computer or phone to confirm your identity.\u00a0 Another commonly used form of dual-factor authentication involves having  a  one-time code  texted to your smartphone each time you want to access an online account.\u00a0 If Jennifer Lawrence had  exercised this option  for her iCloud account, she would have had a backstop against a phishing attack that successfully targeted her\u00a0in 2014. Instead, the cybercriminal\u00a0easily obtained her her iCloud password and gained access to personal, nude photos. 7. \u00a0Be on the alert for ransomware, which has become a major problem for individuals, companies and government agencies.\u00a0Cyberciminals use ransomware to lock\u00a0your computer and\u00a0\u00a0then threaten\u00a0to destroy all of your data unless you pay a ransom \u00a0 One way to avoid this  is to merely backup all of your data regularly on the Cloud, a portable USB drive or both. Before  coming to Bentley University, I taught in the Massachusetts state prison system, where one of my \u201cstudents\u201d was serving two consecutive life sentences, which technically meant that when he died he would begin  his second sentence.\u00a0 He told me that  he angrily asked the judge, \"How do you expect me to do two consecutive life sentences?\u00a0\"To which the judge responded, \u201cJust do the best you can.\u201d Cybersecurity is not as difficult as serving two life sentences, but the lesson is the same.\u00a0 While nothing you can do will absolutely guarantee that you will be cybersecure, just by doing the best you can and following some simple steps, you can dramatically increase your cybersecurity and even leave yourself some time for sex.
