    "text": "Dec 15 2016, 2:20 pm ET Gov. Chris Christie Accused of Pushing 'Revenge Bill' to Punish Press for Bridgegate Coverage by Corky Siemaszko advertisement New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is pushing a bill that would hit the newspapers that hounded him over the Bridgegate scandal where it hurts \u2014 the bottom line. The proposed legislation would torpedo the state law that requires governments, businesses and people to publish legal notices in print newspapers. TODAY Instead, government agencies and municipalities would get the green light to post the notices on their websites, thus depriving already struggling newspapers a big source of revenue. Assemblyman John Wisniewski called it a \"revenge bill.\" \"This is nothing more than a politically-motivated crackdown on the press in New Jersey,\" said Wisniewski, a Democrat. State Senator Loretta Weinberg said the bill surfaced out of the blue on Monday and that if Christie was really interested in helping municipalities save money, which is the stated goal of the proposed legislation, \"there are lots of other things he could have proposed.\" \"Those of us who know New Jersey politics, who know how Gov. Christie works, are not shocked that the governor could be behind this,\" Weinberg, who is also a Democrat, told NBC News. Related: Bridgegate: Two Former Aides to Chris Christie Convicted in Lane-Closure Scandal Wisniewski and Weinberg both pushed for the investigation that resulted in convictions last month of two key Christie allies who conspired to cause a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge to punish the Democratic mayor of a nearby town for not endorsing the Republican governor's bid for re-election. Christie, whose political fortunes faded as a result of the scandal, has denied knowing in advance about the scheme. In response to a question from NBC News asking whether the bill was payback for the New Jersey newspapers' aggressive coverage of Bridgegate, Christie spokesman Brian Murray released a statement. The George Washington Bridge spans the Hudson River between Fort Lee, N.J., and New York. Mel Evans / AP file \"Once again the team of Weinberg and Wisniewski don't let the facts get in the way of their George Washington Bridge obsession,\" he said. \"This legal notices reform bill, which will save taxpayers and citizens going through foreclosure $80 million annually, was first proposed in 2010, not 2016. It had nothing to do with the press then and nothing to do with them now.\" Michael Darcy, executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, said Murray is correct that this bill was first proposed six years ago. But it died a year later and Darcy said it was Christie's office that revived it now. \"I don't know for sure,\" Darcy said, when asked why Christie decided to try and make this law again. \"This is being fast-tracked.\" That said, Darcy said his group supports the legislation. He said it gives municipalities the option of posting legal notices online but also allows them to continue advertising in print newspapers if they so desire. The Star-Ledger, New Jersey's biggest newspaper, said it's not clear the bill will save anybody money, but 200 to 300 reporters statewide would lose their jobs if this revenue source dried up. \"If you want to give state and local politicians free reign to do their dirty business in the dark, this bill is a Godsend,\" the paper's board wrote in a Wednesday editorial . \"If you want to hasten the decline of the press in the era of Donald Trump, this one is for you. Be ready to rely more on fake news posted on Facebook.\" Corky Siemaszko ",

    "text": "GREAT REVIVALS Rose Reading Room and Met Breuer New York got one of its beloved public spaces back. Credit Eric Hammarberg, an engineer at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, for ensuring all that delicate, ornamental plaster on the decorated ceiling of the Rose Reading Room atop the 42nd Street library , which had begun collapsing, won\u2019t fall down. And the former Whitney Museum of American Art on Madison Avenue, rechristened Met Breuer , was also restored. Beyer Blinder Belle, the New York architecture firm, performed an act of thoughtful and immaculate preservation. This once-reviled 1960s building, now with its patina of age, is finally coming to be recognized for what it is: a practical Modernist landmark of exceptional finesse and a surprisingly good neighbor. Photo The Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center at Columbia University\u2019s medical campus near the George Washington Bridge. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times \u2018STUDY CASCADE\u2019 Vagelos Center The Roy and Diana Va gelos Education Center , devised by Diller Scofidio & Renfro (in collaboration with Gensler), is a whimsical 110,000-square-foot exclamation mark on Columbia University\u2019s Upper Manhattan medical campus near the George Washington Bridge. The 14-story tower\u2019s camera-ready face looks south. It presents a cheerfully teetering stack of cantilevered terraces, indoor bleacher seats, lounges and stairs. They spill toward a handsome wood-lined amphitheater linked by steps to the sloping sidewalk. One can picture a giant pinball bouncing from the top of Vagelos and rolling down Haven Avenue. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The architects call this sunny, wide-open south side the \u201cstudy cascade.\u201d Offices and classrooms fill the more conventional north half of the tower, which is clad in a fritted milky curtain wall that\u2019s less striking outside but mitigates solar heat gain. State-of-the-art anatomy classrooms tucked behind the cascade are part of a deceptively pragmatic layout. A restrained palette \u2014 of white, orange and Douglas fir panels stained a burnt sienna \u2014 balances the sculptural gymnastics. The other day I found students poring over their laptops in the ground-floor lounge. Some grumbled a little about minor early-days stuff like not enough electrical outlets, but they all said they loved the architecture. I do, too. It\u2019s what medical schools generally aren\u2019t: playful, welcoming, warm. And when the sun sets, the center becomes a beacon in the neighborhood. Photo The Jerome L. Greene Science Center by Renzo Piano is a nine-story, 450,000-square-foot glass-and-steel hub for neuroscience at Columbia. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times \u2018FACTORY FOR IDEAS\u2019 Greene Center Farther south, Columbia\u2019s 17-acre Manhattanville campus began to take shape this fall with the construction of an arts hub and completion of the Jerome L. Greene Science Center , an urbane glass-and-steel behemoth by Renzo Piano rising beside the aged No. 1 subway viaduct, near the intersection of Broadway and 125th Street. The building is a nine-story, 450,000-square-foot nexus for neuroscience. Four steel-frame glass blocks surround a glassy core with meeting rooms. The basic shape is nothing pyrotechnic, but, as usual with Mr. Piano, the nub is in the details and in the light. A double-skin curtain wall, the two layers separated by a muffling pillow of air, lets light flood in while reducing the rumble of the elevated subway. I write these words inside another of Mr. Piano\u2019s buildings, staring from a glass cubicle through several more layers of glass across a birch-filled courtyard. My colleagues across the court look almost immaterial. The Greene Center engineers even greater illusions of ethereal weightlessness, the layered glass membranes held in equilibrium by a clockwork of steel beams and cables, tinted powder blue. Like church spires, tall twin smokestacks announce the campus from afar, declaring the center a factory for ideas. The industrial nostalgia recalls Mr. Piano\u2019s ship-shaped new Whitney Museum and is clearly meant to substitute midcentury symbols of modern commerce for the usual classic emblems of institutional authority. A plaza stands in for the ancient agora. The center will anchor one side of the evolving Manhattanville project, with its multidisciplinary aspirations, underground passageways for Columbia people and variety of street-level public spaces. These are intended partly to appease angry former residents of the neighborhood troubled by Columbia\u2019s gentrifying expansion, and also to signal that the university is opening itself up. Mr. Piano envisions a kind of Italian piazza, democratic and energized. We\u2019ll see how further development follows through on that promise.

Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times HIGH-WATER MARK Governors Island Several weekends this summer, I hopped the ferry with the family for Governors Island. Back in 2003, the federal government sold the island to the city, which got a derelict former military base that included some lovely historic officers\u2019 homes. Leslie Koch was hired in 2006 as president of the Trust for Governors Island . She enlisted Adriaan Geuze of West 8 , the landscape architecture firm. Ms. Koch and her team spent years just watching how people used the island, seeing what was wanted. They responded with food carts, mini-golf, Adirondack chairs, bike shares, children\u2019s programs and art projects. The last, most ambitious phase of redevelopment was completed this summer: man-made hills (cost: $71 million, half public, half private money). A hill with twisty slides for kids became an instant sensation; another features a sculpture by Rachel Whiteread. The tallest has a killer view of the Statue of Liberty and much of the skyline. Mr. Geuze\u2019s design for the island established a high-water mark for resilient planning, taking into account not just sea rise and storm surges but also social cohesion. Watch the mix of parents and children around the slides, sprinklers and food carts on a warm summer Saturday afternoon. Governors Island is New York as a diverse and joyful city. Mr. Geuze and Ms. Koch, who stepped down this year, deserve medals. Now City Hall has to find tenants to help pay for the island\u2019s upkeep. Big office or apartment towers would undo much of what has been accomplished. Here\u2019s hoping that some venturesome, well-endowed university or cultural institution is seeking a beautiful home. Photo Via 57 West, apartments soaring 467 feet, redrew Manhattan\u2019s western skyline. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times PYRAMID ON THE HUDSON Via 57 West Most rental apartment towers end up vanilla-brick or glass nonentities, invisible at best. Not Via 57 West. No building redrew the city\u2019s western skyline more ingeniously than Bjarke Ingels\u2019s first completed project in New York: a warped, mountainous pyramid hugging the Hudson River at 57th Street. Already filmmakers have exploited it in \u201c Doctor Strange .\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The shape is not a pyramid, actually, but a hyperbolic paraboloid, rectangular on the ground, with a swooping roof-facade, a bit like the billowed sail of a ship, sweeping upward from 12th Avenue to the mast\u2019s peak at the northeast corner of the site, 467 feet high. Looking from 11th Avenue and 58th Street, the 32-story building resembles a spire. From elsewhere, it unfurls, its saw-toothed balconies, angled toward the Hudson, making hundreds of facets in the stainless-steel skin, which shimmer with the changing light. This is a building very much designed outside in, notwithstanding that the Danish Mr. Ingels has trumpeted the nice \u201cScandimerican\u201d stylings of the lounges and handsome oak-and-brick lobby and the community-enhancing function of the landscaped private courtyard at Via 57, which recalls his design for the 8 House in Copenhagen. Sliced from the center of the building, the courtyard leads to riverfront terraces with outdoor grills and a host of indoor amenities. I\u2019ll be curious to know how much this fosters community. The amenities require a fee. Twenty percent of the 709 apartments are set aside for subsidized tenants, in return for which the developer enjoyed the usual tax breaks. Otherwise, Via 57 seems to market itself toward brokers and Westchester doctors who can pay top dollar for the light but sometimes cramped apartments off double-loaded corridors, a hike from the nearest subway. Of course, tenants are also paying for the pleasure and cachet of living in a striking work of architecture. New York\u2019s former planning commissioner Amanda Burden deserves a shout-out here for pushing Douglas Durst, the developer, and Mr. Ingels to cook up something bold at such a conspicuous site. The three of them have given the city a new spectacle. Photo A sour design note in Greenwich Village, where the Metropolitan Transportation Authority built a $180 million emergency ventilation plant in Mulry Square. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times VENTING Mulry Square Fan Plant O.K., I get one Grinch moment, not about the $4 billion shopping mall attached to a PATH station at ground zero or the election of a president who, among other things, believes privatization is the answer to what ails the nation\u2019s infrastructure. No, I want to grouse about one of the sadder excuses for architecture completed this year. You can nominate your own candidate. This one is a kind of sleeper, at Mulry Square, at the intersection of Greenwich and Seventh Avenues, in Greenwich Village. There the Metropolitan Transportation Authority finished building a $180 million emergency ventilation plant. The site is opposite the new St. Vincent\u2019s Triangle Park and AIDS Memorial. Once upon a time, this is where I stood guard as a fourth-grade street-crossing monitor from P.S. 41, the school up the block, until my boss and classmate Trippy West suspended me for reporting late at the end of a lunch period. But I digress. Neighborhood groups, along with the city\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission, acknowledging the necessity for a \u201cfan plant,\u201d pleaded for years with the authority for a design less hideous than a windowless concrete bunker and a few forlorn benches. Transit officials paid no attention. With a chain-link fence around the base and part of a fake-brick townhouse facade, topped by a curtain-rod cornice, the facility seems an intentional slap in the face of every New Yorker who hoped for a structure that, if not actually good, might at least be innocuous. Photo The Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at Greenwich Avenue and 13th Street, from the early 1930s, is an Art Deco gem and a neighborhood landmark. Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times It\u2019s also a reminder that infrastructure projects like this were once occasions for civic-minded expressions of architectural ambition. Walk just a few blocks from Mulry Square to the three-story Metropolitan Transportation Authority substation at Greenwich Avenue and 13th Street, built during the early 1930s. Its geometric decorations, embossed aluminum doors, limestone frieze, Flemish brick coursing and square turrets make it one of New York\u2019s Art Deco gems and a neighborhood landmark. The contrast between the bunker and the substation can make you weep. But it also proves what a difference good architecture makes, to New Yorkers\u2019 daily lives and to the long-term welfare of the city.

We will do everything we can to keep incidents like this from happening again.\" The snub took place at Warrensburg High School on Monday evening just before players from Center High School were introduced. Video of the incident showed at least 20 students \u2014 many dressed in overalls, cowboy hats and camouflage \u2014 turning their backs to the basketball court. One person is seen waving a Trump/Pence campaign sign. The video was first posted by Center High School alum Antonia Nunn and has been shared more than 7,000 times. Since Trump's win, many states across the country have seen an increase in racially-motivated incidents. RELATED: Hundreds of Hate Crimes Reported Since Election: SPLC Nunn, 20, who attended the game to support her younger brother who plays on the Center High basketball team, told NBC News that she was uncomfortable and in shock at the game. \"For someone to hold up a Trump sign and turn their backs where there was an all-white basketball team and an all-black basketball team, it came off as racist. I thought 'Are you kidding me?'\" She added that the crowd booed and yelled \"oink oink\" throughout the game. Warrensburg Superintendent Scott Patrick told NBC News that he didn't think the incident was racially motivated and that the school has had a tradition of students turning their back when the opposing team's players were introduced. \"It's not something that is condoned,\" said Patrick. \"\u2026I think one of our students who held the Trump/Pence sign probably didn't think of the ramifications of what they were doing.\" Patrick has also said there will be consequences for the students involved on Monday night but the details of what that would entail were still being ironed out. \"We will continue to talk to our students about what we expect from them in the way of behavior at events like these,\" he said. \"It's very painful for some people,\" Kelly Wachel Public Relations Director of Center School District said of the actions taken at Monday night's game, noting the high school is 75 percent African-American. She added, \"Part of our feeling is that it takes an incident like this or a wake up call for someone to see how inappropriate this action is.\" Aliyah Frumin ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Donald Trump poses next to Miss Universe 2013 Gabriela Isler after the 2013 Miss Universe competition in Moscow Nov 9, 2013. (Photo: Alexander Nemeno, AFP/Getty Images) 8004 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 126 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s controversial soft spot for Russia\u00a0is based on decades of courting\u00a0wealthy Russians to buy condos in his luxury high-rises and invest in his other real estate ventures, a close\u00a0look at his business dealings reveals. Trump first traveled to Moscow in the 1980s, to discuss renovating hotels there.\u00a0After several bankruptcies made it hard\u00a0to raise money in the United States for his high-end hotel and condominium projects since the 1990s,\u00a0Trump, and\u00a0later\u00a0his children, traveled to Moscow to talk deals and attract buyers,\u00a0according to interviews with people who have worked with Trump over the years and news accounts. They show far greater commercial ties between Trump and Russia\u00a0than generally known. Real estate brokers in New York, Florida and Dubai told USA TODAY that Trump properties still attract high-end buyers from Russia, as well as from other countries. Trump continues to push back on Russia hacking claims Dolly Lenz, a real estate broker in New York, said she sold about\u00a065 units in Trump World Tower, a condominium tower at 845 U.N. Plaza in Manhattan, to Russian buyers looking for real estate investments in the late 1990s.\u00a0\u201cI had contacts in Moscow looking to invest in the United States,\u201d Lenz said. \u201c\u2019What do you have to recommend?\u2019 They all wanted to meet Donald. They became very friendly.\u201d Graham: Russians hacked me and they hacked DNC's Podesta, too Ilya Reznik, who said he\u2019s sold dozens of condominiums to Russians in Trump properties in south Florida, said his clients like\u00a0Trump\u2019s reputation for high quality luxury that\u2019s priced right.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re businessmen, not too many politicians,\"\u00a0Reznik said. Gil Dezer, whose family built six Trump buildings with their own money in south Florida, said Russians buy Trump properties for the brand name. Dezer\u00a0developed the property under Trump\u2019s name, meaning Trump received a royalty fee at the time of the sale, \u201cand the name stays on the building, subject to a list of requirements in the condo documents,\u201d he said. Back in 2008, Trump\u2019s son\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0told investors in Moscow that\u00a0the Trump Organization had trademarked the Donald Trump name in Russia and planned to build housing and hotels in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi, and to sell licenses to other developers, according to the Russian daily\u00a0Kommersant. \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York,\u201d Trump Jr. said at the time. \u201cWe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. There's indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the Russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble.\" These\u00a0business dealings explain Trump's comfort level with a country \u2014\u00a0and its authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin \u2014 at a time when President Obama and both parties in Congress are alarmed over a series of Russian actions, the most recent being CIA allegations that the Russian government interfered in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. Russian President Vladimir Putin presents ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson with a Russian medal at the St. Petersburg economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 21, 2012. President-elect Donald Trump\u0092s chose Tillerson as his top diplomat in charge of the State Department. \u00a0(Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AP) Trump this week named Rex Tillerson, the CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil\u00a0as his nominee for secretary of State. The nomination of Tillerson, who received an excellence award from Putin in 2014 and has partnered with Putin's ally and Russian oil executive Igor Sechin, has alarmed Republican and Democratic members of Congress. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Company lawyer Michael Cohen told the Financial Times in October:\u00a0\u201cThe Trump Organization does not have any properties in Russia and the press\u2019 fascination with this narrative is both misleading and fabricated. Perpetuation of this false connection ... or any connection with Russia altogether \u2014\u00a0is yet another example of the press\u2019s liberal bias towards Mr. Trump.\u201d NBC News: Intelligence officials say Putin personally involved in election hack The Obama administration and Congress also have assailed Putin for seizing Crimea from Ukraine and for teaming up with Syrian President Bashar Assad in a brutal military campaign against rebels that has killed civilians estimated in the hundreds of thousands. Trump, however, has ignored Putin's crackdown on individual freedoms and praised his strong leadership style, called the CIA allegations about election meddling \"ridiculous,\" suggested during the campaign that he might be willing to let Russia keep Crimea\u00a0and raised the prospect of working with Russia to end Syria's long civil war. LASTING ACQUAINTANCE\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sergei Millian, president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti in April that he developed a lasting acquaintance with Trump while organizing the developer\u2019s trip to Russia for the Millionaire Fair in 2007. \"That was when Trump invited me, as the head of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce, to the horse races at the Gulfstream racetrack in Miami,\u201d Millian said. \u201cThen later we met in his office in New York.\" Millian said he and Trump signed a contract to develop real estate projects in Russia and former Soviet states. Nothing ever got built in Russia, but around 2007 and 2008, Russians \u201cwould buy up dozens of apartments in Trump properties in the U.S.,\u201d Millian said.\u00a0\u201cThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014\u00a0what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen,\u201d Millian\u00a0told ABC News last summer. Michael D\u2019Antonio, who wrote the Trump biography The Truth About Donald Trump,\u00a0said that when it comes to Russia, \u201cI don\u2019t think they (the Trumps) were considering investing money in Russia. I think they were trying to get money out of Russia.\u201d Trump\u2019s efforts to do business in Russia look\u00a0like a string of failed projects. Posted!

By Renae Merle December 15 at 1:51 PM Follow @renaemerle NEW YORK \u2014 In what some are calling the \u201cTrump rally,\u201d investors are pushing U.S. stock markets to new heights in anticipation that the president-elect will work with the Republican-led Congress to lower taxes and pass more business-friendly policies. In the five weeks since Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win, traders have rushed into the market, accelerating gains that had been building all year. Their enthusiasm had the Dow Jones industrial average flirting with a record-high 20,000 mark that once would have seemed unattainable in 2016. For now, many are willing to look past potential stumbling blocks that lie ahead for the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve , for instance, is beginning to raise interest rates\u2014it bumped up a key lending rate Wednesday, a move that traditionally has added costs for businesses\u2014and the global economy is bracing for Britain's pending departure from the European Union. There\u2019s also the risk that Trump himself could disrupt global trade with protectionist policies, perhaps stirring a backlash from China. Investors have already learned to beware of Trump\u2019s Twitter account: The president-elect sent shares in Lockheed Martin, and the rest of the defense industry, tumbling after lashing out at the cost of the company\u2019s F-35 fighter jet earlier this week. Boeing, too, has felt his wrath and a pharmaceutical industry that once looked forward to less red tape reeled when the president-elected vowed to bring down drug prices. Even before Trump\u2019s election, some market analysts were warning that stock prices were too high given recent corporate financial results. Specialist trader Mario Picone wears a \"DOW Almost 20,000\" cap as he works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters) \u201cA pullback in this market would certainly be healthy. Trees don\u2019t grow to the sky,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Trump, too, spent much of his presidential campaign raising caution about the rising U.S. stock market, calling it a \u201cbig, fat, ugly bubble\u201d and warning that investors would soon be \u201cwiped out.\u201d (His spokesman said he sold his entire portfolio in June). And yet, as shares have pushed even higher, Trump\u2018s supporters have embraced the rally as a referendum on his pro-business policies, creating ever higher expectations for quick results once he assumes office. Just Thursday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that U.S. builders\u2019 confidence jumped to the highest level in more than a decade. \u201cThis notable rise in builder sentiment is largely attributable to a post-election bounce, as builders are hopeful that President-elect Trump will follow through on his pledge to cut burdensome regulations that are harming small businesses and housing affordability,\u201d Ed Brady, chairman of the trade group, said in a statement. The Dow, an index of 30 large publicly owned companies, has long been viewed as a proxy for the broader market, but its movements can be affected by big swings in individual stocks. About 20 percent of the Dow\u2019s rise over the last month is due to one company that market analysts say could benefit greatly from Trump\u2019s policies: Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street giant\u2019s stock has soared amid expectations that his administration will roll back regulations put in place to rein in the banking sector after the 2008 financial crisis. It hasn\u2019t hurt that Trump picked Goldman veterans to lead the Treasury Department and chair his team of economic advisors. Goldman Sachs has not been the only beneficiary. Virtually every other sector of the market has also felt a lift in recent weeks. Investors are enjoying the ride. Many traders have talked openly about holding onto their shares this year in hopes the taxes they pay on gains could be lower next year. Institutional investors and other big traders, meanwhile, have shifted money out of bonds, a traditional safehaven during economic turbulence, to snap up more stock and ride the momentum. The combined market value of the 500 companies tracked by the Standard & Poors 500 has climbed nearly $1 trillion since Trump was elected. \u201cIt is the difference between investing for a slow-growing economy and investing for strong growth,\u201d said Jeff Carbone, a managing partner for Cornerstone Financial Partners. In nearing the 20,000 threshold, the Dow has staged an improbable recovery in a year that started with massive selloffs as economists worried about China\u2019s rocky economy and falling oil prices, and then panicked when Britain voted to leave the European Union. Now, investors who began the year hoping to just break even are experiencing one of their most profitable periods in years. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t change when the Dow hits 20,000. That is simply a psychological barrier,\u201d said David Schiegoliet, a managing director at U.S. Bank. But \u201cit can\u2019t be ignored because market psychology can be self fulfilling. It could generate enthusiasm that will turn markets even higher.\u201d Much of that enthusiasm appears tied to expectations that Trump will usher in a period of deregulation and lower taxes. Trump has also, for example, that said he would lower the corporate tax rate and encourage companies that currently hold more than $2 trillion in profits overseas, where it can\u2019t be taxed by the Internal Revenue Service, to bring that money back to the United States. Those companies may try to use some of the cash they bring back to pay dividends for shareholders or to buy back their stock, reducing the supply and pushing up the prices for the shares that remain, market analysts said. Lower corporate taxes could also help revive the market for companies wishing to go public, which has languished in recent years, market analysts say. Only about 105 companies are expected to go public by the end of the year, half as many as would occur during a typical year, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of funds focused on initial public offerings. \u201cEverything we see now says that 2017 should be a very strong year for IPOs,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. But there are also warning signs. Twenty years ago, Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller developed a system for determining whether stocks may be overvalued by comparing the stock price of companies listed on the S&P with corporate profits over a 10-year period. A high ratio indicates that stocks may be too expensive, the theory goes. That ratio climbed to 27.9 last week , a relatively high level. But even for Shiller, Trump complicates the picture. When the ratio is \u201chigh like it is now, it suggests that returns will be weak,\u201d he said. But Trump \u201cis a unique political figure and it is difficult to measure his affect on the market.\u201d \u201cTrump seems to have some powers of persuasion, inspiration that have propelled the economy since he was elected,\u201d Shiller said. \u201cIn the long term it might not work out as well, but at least in the short run\u201d it is propelling stocks forward. Even some Trump enthusiasts are beginning to worry the recent market exuberance may be overblown. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn was one of Trump\u2019s earliest and most vocal Wall Street supporters and when stocks initially tumbled upon his election, Icahn left the Republicans\u2019 victory party to snap up about $1 billion in stock, later lamenting that he hadn\u2019t bought more. But now, Icahn told CNN , \u201cit\u2019s gone too far.\u201d \u201cI personally think it\u2019s a little overdone,\u201d Icahn said of the stock market\u2019s rise. business ",

Tyler was recovering at home from hypothermia. The boys were carving out a fort in a 10-foot bank of snow when a public works truck \u2014 its driver unaware that they were there \u2014 dumped a load of cleared snow on top of them, Bell said. \"This is a true tragedy,\" Bell said. \"Tyler tells his dad and my officers in the emergency room ... that he heard what he believed was beeping sounds, and the next thing you know, it went black.\" Near-whiteout conditions are forecast around Lake Erie as the western storm moves in later, the National Weather Service said.

The snow did help out police in Michigan, however. Two men, ages 17 and 19, were arrested Thursday morning on suspicion of trying to rob a gun store in Roseville, about 10 miles northeast of Detroit. The men, who haven't been identified, hooked a tow strap to the store's security bars and tried to pull them off with their pickup truck \u2014 which promptly got stuck in the snow, NBC station WDIV of Detroit reported. The men fled on foot, but they were found and arrested 3 miles away, police said. They weren't hard to find. Cops simply followed their footprints in the snow. Alex Johnson ",

It took a 12-person panel a little over two hours to convict Roof on all 33 counts stemming from last year's massacre at the historic Emanuel AME Church, including the two dozen that fall under federal hate crime statutes. \"We find the defendant Dylann Storm Roof guilty.\" the jury foreman said 33 times as Roof stood in the courtroom, his face blank and betraying nothing. When that was over, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel asked Roof a series of questions about whether he understood that 18 of the counts he was convicted of carried the death penalty, and whether he still wanted to represent himself during the penalty phase. Each time, Roof replied with a one-word answer. \"Yes,\" he said. The jury will break for Christmas and return after the holidays on Jan. 3 to begin debating whether the 22-year-old mass killer spends the rest of his life in prison \u2014 or die.

Massacre survivor Felicia Sanders, who testified at the trial, said the guilty verdicts were \"music to my ears.\" \"I wasn't expecting anything less,\" she said. \"I knew it was going to be guilty, guilty, guilty completely.\" But Sanders said she was outraged that Roof did not look at her even once during the trial. \"You slaughtered nine people and you sit there and don't even look,\" she said. \"You can't even give me anything to speak to you...you can at least look back at me.\" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she hoped the verdict would bring closure. \"It is my hope that the survivors, the families & the people of South Carolina can find some peace in the fact that justice has been served,\" Haley tweeted.

Lindsay Graham said \"if there was ever a justified guilty verdict, this was the case.\" \"As the killer now awaits sentencing, I want the families of those lost that day to know one thing: we are all still with you,\" the state's Sen. Tim Scott added. \"While this chapter is now closed, the rest of the book has yet to be written.\" The verdict came after prosecutors and the defense made their final arguments. Prosecutor Nathan Williams called Roof \"a man of intense hatred.\" \"These nine people exemplified a goodness that was greater than his message of hate,\" Williams said. It is my hope that the survivors, the families & the people of South Carolina can find some peace in the fact that justice has been served. \u2014 Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) December 15, 2016 Defense attorney David Bruck did not contest that Roof killed nine people in cold blood on June 17, 2015. The question that remains, he said, is \"why?\" \"Why did Dylann Roof do this?\" he said. \"Why was he motivated?\" During the trial, Bruck put no witnesses on the stand. Nor did he raise any objections when prosecutors played Roof's videotaped confession to the FBI, which was made following his arrest on June 18, 2015 in Shelby, North Carolina, for the jury. Police tape surrounds the parking lot behind the AME Emanuel Church as FBI forensic experts work the crime scene, in Charleston, South Carolina on June 19 2015. Stephen B. Morton / AP In it, Roof admitted he was guilty and that the motive was to spark a race war. He told the FBI men he was surprised he was able to kill as many people as he did with his .45-caliber Glock pistol. \"What I did is still minuscule to what they're doing to white people every day,\" he insisted on the tape. The jury also heard testimony from 70-year-old survivor Polly Sheppard , who told the court Roof spared her for a sick reason. \"I'm going to leave you here to tell the story,\" Roof said, Sheppard testified. Sheppard told the court that amid the mayhem she somehow managed to find a cell phone on the floor and call 911 for help. \"Please come right away,\" she said on the call. \"There've been plenty of people shot.\" Throughout the trial, Roof barely looked at the victims' families or reacted to the wrenching testimony from Sheppard or law enforcement. Even when the testimony was interrupted by sobs from the gallery, the admitted killer with the bowl haircut sat stone-faced, staring off into the distance. Gabe Gutierrez ",

Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said Thursday that the letter clearing the girl\u2019s family from suspicion in her 1996 death is not binding and his office is still investigating the case. Authorities have said they\u2019re looking at new DNA testing technology that they hope will further the investigation. The move comes after an investigation by the Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder and KUSA-TV in Denver that the news organizations say uncovered flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing. Garnett says much of the new testing will target previously screened items to see if new information can be gleaned. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

(Photo: FEMA) 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Because of yet another mix-up with bioterror pathogens, a federal terrorism response training center in Alabama says it mistakenly exposed more than 9,600 firefighters, paramedics and other students to a deadly toxin over the past five years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Center for Domestic Preparedness blames an outside laboratory for a series of shipping errors since 2011 that resulted in the first-responder training center using in its classes a potentially lethal form of ricin powder. The a poison, made from castor beans, is capable of killing at small doses. The training center says it submitted order forms asking for a type of ricin extract that is unlikely to cause serious harm. But officials from Toxin Technology, the Florida company that sent nine shipments to the center since 2011, told USA TODAY that its ricin products were all accurately labeled as \u201cRCA60\u201d \u2013 a scientific name for the whole ricin toxin, which can be deadly. It\u2019s unclear why training center staff didn\u2019t recognize for years that they were working with a far more dangerous substance. There is no antidote to treat ricin poisoning. After issuing repeated statements to USA TODAY since Monday solely blaming the vendor, on Thursday FEMA administrator W. Craig Fugate called for the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General to investigate. The training center had already suspended all training with biological agents, which include training with a less-dangerous strain of anthrax. Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said he\u2019s stunned that over the past five years the training center never verified that that it was receiving the less-toxic ricin product it thought it was ordering. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond careless and outrageous. It's almost malfeasance,\u201d Ridge said. Nobody was sickened by the exposures, FEMA spokeswoman Alexa Lopez said. Students, who were being trained to detect the presence of biological agents, were wearing protective gear during the exercises. Workers at the Anniston, Ala., training center prepared ricin training materials in special biosafety cabinets designed to protect against exposures. Still Ridge and other national security experts say the ricin mix-up is just the latest high-profile incident showing lax safety practices at U.S. biodefense facilities. Hundreds of government, military, private and university laboratories nationwide possess potential bioterror pathogens, which the government calls \u201cselect agents,\u201d such as those that cause anthrax, botulism and plague. They\u2019re used in scientific research and the development of vaccines, medical treatments and for creating and testing detection and personal protection equipment. In 2014, CDC mistakes with anthrax specimens that were believed to be killed resulted in dozens of the agency\u2019s lab workers being potentially exposed to the deadly bacteria. In 2015, the Pentagon discovered that an Army lab in Utah had been mistakenly shipping live anthrax \u2013 labeled as killed \u2013 to dozens of labs in the U.S. and abroad for more than a decade. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert at Rutgers University, said what happened at the FEMA training facility with ricin is the latest incident in which \u201cincompetence by a federal agency\u201d has resulted in a mix-up between biological specimens that were thought to be killed or inactivated \u2013 yet weren\u2019t. \u201cThe only way those running security agencies will get this message in their heads, is if violators are held accountable,\u201d Ebright said. But that hasn\u2019t happened, he said. A USA TODAY investigation in 2015 found hundreds of safety incidents at labs nationwide and a lax and secretive system of oversight of potential bioterror pathogens that hides serious incidents from the public. Inside America's secretive biolabs \u201cThese kinds of things are continually going to happen until biosafety gets elevated to a major level,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security. While the research done into bioterror pathogens is important, the public\u2019s trust and support for it will be eroded if safety isn\u2019t improved, he said. Investigators from the Federal Select Agent Program, which regulates labs and other facilities that work with potential bioterror pathogens, traveled this week to the company that supplied the ricin to the FEMA training center. The program is jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Neither the CDC nor FEMA would name the vendor that supplied the ricin to the training facility when asked by The Anniston Star, which first revealed the incident, nor to USA TODAY. USA TODAY determined through its reporting the vendor was Toxin Technology in Sarasota, Fla. Information provided to USA TODAY by officials at Toxin Technology and the FEMA training center conflict in several ways and raise significant questions about how ricin materials were ordered and shipped over the years. FEMA in its statements has repeatedly said the material mix-up was \u201cdue to an error by the supplier\u201d and that the \u201cintended use declaration\u201d forms the training center submitted to the vendor specified the center was seeking \u201cRicin Chain A.\u201d The ricin toxin has two components, referred to as A and B chains. The B-chain needs to be present, experts said, to allow the A-chain to enter and damage cells. FEMA officials say their intent was to use the A-chain ricin in its programs because it was safer and would still react with detection equipment during training classes as if it were the more dangerous whole ricin toxin. \u201cIn November 2016, while making a purchase of ricin A-chain for training, staff at FEMA\u2019s Center for Domestic Preparedness recognized an ongoing discrepancy in the documentation related to the type of ricin being provided,\u201d FEMA said in a statement. But the agency wouldn\u2019t provide any details about what kind of documentation and discrepancy was involved. However the ordering catalog for Toxin Technology does not list any A-chain ricin products \u2013 only a whole ricin product. FEMA told USA TODAY the product it ordered wasn\u2019t in the company\u2019s catalog. \u201cIt was a specialty product rather than a standard catalog item,\u201d the agency said. Raoul Reiser, who founded Toxin Technology in 1984 and sold it to a partner about three years ago, told USA TODAY that he remembers supplying A-chain ricin products to the FEMA training facility while he was there. Reiser said that while the A-chain ricin product wasn\u2019t in Toxin Technology\u2019s catalog, it was purchased by many customers as far away as Singapore who learned about it through word of mouth. \u201cWe never made the ricin at Tox Tech, we were just repackaging and reselling what Vector Labs was selling,\u201d Reiser said. He said Toxin Technology would buy the A-chain ricin in liquid form from the international biological supply company, then turn it into a powdered form for resale. Yet officials at Vector Laboratories told USA TODAY their records show they never sold A-chain ricin to Toxin Technology \u2013 only a product that contained the whole ricin toxin. David Weber, Vector Labs chief commercial officer, said the company checked its records going back to early 2005 and found the only product it shipped to Toxin Technology on numerous occasions through August was a whole ricin product. Reiser said he was surprised to hear this. \u201cI was under the impression we were buying the A-chain toxin, not the holotoxin,\u201d he said Wednesday night. He said all of the purchasing was handled at Toxin Technology by Paul Bina. Bina, who is currently listed on Toxin Technology\u2019s website as vice president and lab manager, said he doesn\u2019t know why Reiser would have been under the impression the product sold by the company was A-chain ricin. Bina told USA TODAY that he was at the company when it first started selling ricin products and it sold only two and both were whole toxin products. They were labeled as RCA60 in the company\u2019s catalog, website and \u201con all shipping and manufacturing records,\u201d he said. Bina said: \u201cI instructed to purchase the RCA60 from Vector Labs for this purpose. At no time did we ever have Ricin A Chain and at no time did we ever repackage RCA60 and sell it as Ricin A Chain.\u201d Bina said that when he left the company in 2010 for a few years, the ricin products were still being correctly identified as \u201cRCA60.\u201d When he returned, Bina said the multiple lots of ricin produced while he was away \u201cwere still all correctly identified as \u2018RCA60\u2019 on all shipping and manufacturing documents.\u201d After USA TODAY asked FEMA to produce documents showing how the ricin products it received were labeled, the agency called for the inspector general investigation. Bill Rose, manager of Toxin Technology, said it is company policy not to discuss its clients. But he told USA TODAY on Thursday that the company is in the process of contacting all recipients of its ricin products to ensure they are aware they received the whole toxin products. But he said that a review of the company\u2019s available sales and shipping records show the information sent with the products correctly showed they were \u201cRicin RCA60.\u201d GAO finds more gaps in oversight of bioterror germs studied in U.S. labs Although ricin is a select agent, under federal regulations, it\u2019s exempt from regulation if it is held in amounts less than 100 mg. So while Toxin Technology is regulated by the select agent program, the FEMA training center \u2013 which\u00a0never possessed more than 70 mg of ricin \u2013 is not. \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d said Ridge, who has been co-chairing a Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense that issued a report calling for strengthening U.S. readiness for bioterrorism and response to emerging disease. The panel, co-chaired by former Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman and sponsored by the Hudson Institute think tank, issued a follow-up report this week noting that Congress still hasn\u2019t done a comprehensive reassessment of the Federal Select Agent Program. 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hT6qOC ",

    "text": "Egypt Likely to See More ISIS Attacks, Needs to Change How it Fights Terror, Analysts Say By RANDA ALI Dec 15, 2016, 1:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Egypt Mourns 25 Christians Killed in Church Explosion 0 Shares Email In the wake of a bombing that killed 24 people at a Cairo church, some analysts warn the largest country in the Arab world may face more attacks by ISIS. Sunday\u2019s assault on civilians in the Egyptian capital signals that ISIS, which on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the attack, is escalating its offensive in the country and shows the need for the country to change how it fights terrorism . Egypt\u2019s leadership downplayed the significance of the attack. In a speech Monday, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi called it a \u201cdesperate blow\u201d by terrorists. \u201cThey are trying to shake us,\u201d he said shortly after he identified the assailant as a 22-year-old suicide bomber , Mahmoud Shafik. \u201cThey have been trying for three years in vain.\u201d Since the 2013 Sissi-led ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt 's government has fought an Islamist insurgency in northern parts of the Sinai Peninsula while at the same time waging war against domestic opponents, jailing thousands of members of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood as well as secular dissidents. Islamic militants have for the most part avoided targeting civilians in Egypt. But since the Sinai-based Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014, the group\u2019s tactics have changed and over time it has copied ISIS' practice of indiscriminately killing civilians. In 2015, Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis downed a Russian plane leaving from the popular tourist area of Sharm El-Sheikh, killing all 224 aboard. The attack was a hard blow to Egypt's country's already struggling economy. Tourism, the country's main source of foreign currency, has since the attack had its biggest losses in 20 years. El-Sissi has dismissed claims that security flaws allowed the attack to occur and has called for stricter laws to fight terrorism. But some analysts told ABC News that Egypt needs to end mass arrests and instead focus on individual perpetrators of violence if it wants to effectively prevent more attacks. \"Targeting the perpetrators and avoiding mass arrests and collective punishment is key to ensuring the state achieves justice and prevents violence, while also maintaining legitimacy and respecting the rights of citizens,\" said Allison McManus, research director at Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. McManus warned that mass arrests of dissidents can lead to radicalization happening inside Egyptian prisons, \"where the disenfranchised come into contact with those seasoned in extremist violence.\" The suicide bomber implicated in Sunday's attack is said by his family to have been tortured while in police custody in 2014. McManus added that the country needs to create space for \"peaceful political engagement.\" \"Egypt is currently implementing repressive social and legal strategies to criminalize protest, organizing, and expression [and] that will be counterproductive to long-term stability,\" she said. Another analyst agreed that Egypt needs to be more focused on ISIS. \"While Egypt has succeeded in keeping ISIS elements contained to a part of north Sinai, it has yet to face the full dedicated focus of ISIS planners and returning fighters with high levels of expertise,\" said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow in the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. The country needs to develop a more nimble and targeted approach that relies on intelligence to better understand and disrupt terrorist networks, Awad said. \"If the government does not revise its intelligence and counterterrorism approach, Egypt may be unable for some time to successfully detect ISIS cells and [may] be surprised with possible sophisticated attacks like we saw in Europe,\" he added. 0 Shares ",

Fifty-two percent of the tested pharmacies sold the medications without mentioning the potential interaction. (Chicago Tribune) The Chicago Tribune tested 255 pharmacies to see how often stores would dispense risky drug pairs without warning patients. Fifty-two percent of the tested pharmacies sold the medications without mentioning the potential interaction. (Chicago Tribune) Sam Roe , Ray Long and Karisa King Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune The Tribune reporter walked into an Evanston CVS pharmacy carrying two prescriptions: one for a common antibiotic, the other for a popular anti-cholesterol drug. Taken alone, these two drugs, clarithromycin and simvastatin, are relatively safe. But taken together they can cause a severe breakdown in muscle tissue and lead to kidney failure and death. When the reporter tried to fill the prescriptions, the pharmacist should have warned him of the dangers. But that's not what happened. The two medications were packaged, labeled and sold within minutes, without a word of caution. The same thing happened when a reporter presented prescriptions for a different potentially deadly drug pair at a Walgreens on the Magnificent Mile. And at a Wal-Mart in Evergreen Park, a Jewel-Osco in River Forest and a Kmart in Springfield. In the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind, the Tribune tested 255 pharmacies to see how often stores would dispense dangerous drug pairs without warning patients. Fifty-two percent of the pharmacies sold the medications without mentioning the potential interaction, striking evidence of an industrywide failure that places millions of consumers at risk. CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy retailer by store count, had the highest failure rate of any chain in the Tribune tests, dispensing the medications with no warning 63 percent of the time. Walgreens, one of CVS' main competitors, had the lowest failure rate at 30 percent \u2014 but that's still missing nearly 1 in 3 interactions. In response to the Tribune tests, CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart each vowed to take significant steps to improve patient safety at its stores nationwide. Combined, the actions affect 22,000 drugstores and involve additional training for 123,000 pharmacists and technicians. \"There is a very high sense of urgency to pursue this issue and get to the root cause,\" said Tom Davis, CVS' vice president of pharmacy professional services. CVS, which filled about 1 billion prescriptions last year, said the company would improve policies and its computer system to \"dramatically\" increase warnings to patients. Walgreens said it would, among other changes, increase training for pharmacists. \"We take this very seriously,\" said Rex Swords, Walgreens' vice president of pharmacy and retail operations and planning. Dangerous drug combinations are a major public health problem, hospitalizing tens of thousands of people each year. Pharmacists are the last line of defense, and their role is growing as Americans use more prescription drugs than ever. One in 10 people take five or more drugs \u2014 twice the percentage seen in 1994. Some pharmacists who were tested got it right, coming to the counter to issue stern warnings. \"You'll be on the floor. You can't have the two together,\" said one pharmacist at a Walgreens on Chicago's Northwest Side. Said a Kmart pharmacist in Rockford: \"I've seen people go to the hospital on this combination.\" But in test after test, other pharmacists dispensed dangerous drug pairs at a fast-food pace, with little attention paid to customers. They failed to catch combinations that could trigger a stroke, result in kidney failure, deprive the body of oxygen or lead to unexpected pregnancy with a risk of birth defects. Location didn't matter: Failures occurred in poor neighborhoods on the South Side as well as in affluent suburbs and the Gold Coast. Even the Walgreens at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago failed its test. The newspaper also tested independent pharmacies, many of which take pride in providing personalized care. As a group, they had a higher failure rate than any retail chain, missing risky drug interactions 72 percent of the time. Chains overall failed 49 percent of their tests. The Tribune study, two years in the making, exposes fundamental flaws in the pharmacy industry. Safety laws are not being followed, computer alert systems designed to flag drug interactions either don't work or are ignored, and some pharmacies emphasize fast service over patient safety. Several chain pharmacists, in interviews, described assembly-line conditions in which staff hurried to fill hundreds of prescriptions a day. Wal-Mart, operator of 4,500 U.S. pharmacies, failed 43 percent of its tests. The company said it would update and improve its pharmacy alert system and train pharmacists on the changes. Kmart failed 60 percent of the tests. Phil Keough, pharmacy president for Sears Holdings, which owns Kmart, said he was disappointed with the results. \"While not happy, we also take this as an opportunity to look in the mirror and see where we can get better,\" he said. Costco, a membership warehouse club whose pharmacies are open to the general public, failed 60 percent of the tests; the company declined to comment. The Tribune also tested two Chicago-area chains: Jewel-Osco, which failed 43 percent of the time, and Mariano's, 37 percent. Jewel-Osco declined an interview request and instead emailed the Tribune a one-sentence written statement: \"Osco pharmacists have a history of providing knowledgeable, exemplary care to our customers and their health, well-being and safety is our primary concern.\" Mariano's also declined to answer questions. The chain said in a written statement: \"None of our pharmacists are intentionally disregarding drug interactions or patient safety.\" The chain wrote, \"Our pharmacists look at each patient profile which includes patient history, allergy profile, pre-existing conditions and other factors such as age, all of which must be considered when assessing the potential for a drug interaction.\" But in the Tribune tests, pharmacists at Mariano's stores rarely asked for all of that information. Last line of defense In the fight to protect patients from dangerous drug interactions, doctors shoulder significant responsibility. They are the ones who write the prescriptions. But one physician may not know what another has prescribed, and research has found that doctors' knowledge about specific interactions is often poor. In filling prescriptions, pharmacists are uniquely positioned to detect potential drug interactions, warn patients and prevent harm. Pharmacists themselves say that is one of their primary duties. Yet little data exists about how well they perform in real-world situations. The Tribune set out to find the answer. To select drug pairs to be used in the tests, the newspaper enlisted the help of two leading experts on drug interactions: pharmacy professors Daniel Malone of the University of Arizona and John Horn of the University of Washington. Five pairs were chosen, three of which posed life-threatening risks. Another could cause patients to pass out. A fifth included an oral contraceptive and could lead to unplanned pregnancies. According to the two experts, all of the drugs had been on the market for years, and the pairs presented well-established interactions that pharmacists should easily catch. \"No-brainers,\" Horn called them. Writing the prescriptions was Dr. Steven C. Fox, a Chicago physician who treats many elderly patients on multiple medications. He knew the risks of interactions firsthand. Fox wrote the prescriptions in the names of 18 Tribune journalists, 15 of whom conducted tests in the field. They presented the prescriptions written in their names or, in some instances, their colleagues' names. The reporters tested 30 stores at each of seven leading chains as well as numerous independent pharmacies. Most stores were in the Chicago area; some were in Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. Reporters presented the prescriptions together or a couple of days apart, then waited to see if the orders would be filled. Read the story In Illinois, pharmacists who detect a serious interaction must contact the prescribing doctor to see if the order is correct or if an alternative therapy is available, according to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. Pharmacists are then supposed to alert the patient. Carmen Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, said the professional standard is clear. \"Anytime there's a serious interaction, there's no excuse for the pharmacist not warning the patient about that interaction,\" he said. In the Tribune study, a test was considered a pass if the pharmacist attempted to contact Fox about the interaction or warned the reporter. Drug information leaflets placed inside the bag or stapled to the outside were not considered sufficient to warrant a pass. Illinois regulators said these materials typically are not adequate replacements for verbal warnings; some of the materials don't warn about specific interactions, and experts say patients frequently throw out the leaflets without reading them. After the tests, reporters called many of the pharmacists to inform them of the results and to discuss the findings. Why were so many pharmacies missing dangerous drug combinations? Speed vs. safety Mayuri Patel, a pharmacist at a Wal-Mart in west suburban Northlake, said she typically fills 200 prescriptions in a nine-hour shift, or one every 2.7 minutes. At another Wal-Mart where she was trained, it was even busier, she said: \"We were doing 600 a day with two pharmacists with 10-hour shifts.\" That works out to one prescription every two minutes. In the Tribune tests, she caught a potentially deadly drug pair, warning the reporter at the counter: \"This is a common interaction.\" It is difficult to say why so many pharmacists failed the same test, but interviews and studies point to a possible explanation: the emphasis on speed. Several stores dispensed risky drug pairs with no warning in less than 15 minutes. At a Kmart in Valparaiso, Ind., it was 12 minutes. At an independent pharmacy on the North Side, it was five. The Tribune found that pharmacists frequently race through legally required drug safety reviews \u2014 or skip them altogether. According to Illinois law, pharmacies are required to conduct several safety checks, including whether the dose is reasonable and whether the medication might interact with other drugs the patient is taking. But in the Tribune tests, pharmacies rarely asked what other medications testers were using. \"They're cutting corners where they think they can cut,\" said Bob Stout, president of the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy, which sampled data from two retail chains in the state and found that pharmacists spent an average of 80 seconds on safety checks for each prescription filled. \"What happens, I found on the board, is people stop doing (safety) reviews,\" Stout said. \"They're not going in looking at patient records.\" Drug combinations E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Tribune reporters presented pharmacies with prescriptions for drugs that are known to be harmful or even fatal if taken together, but 52 percent of the time the prescriptions were filled without warning. Tribune reporters presented pharmacies with prescriptions for drugs that are known to be harmful or even fatal if taken together, but 52 percent of the time the prescriptions were filled without warning. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Most pharmacies use computer software designed to flag drug interactions. But experts say computer alerts are so common that pharmacists can get \"alert fatigue\" and ignore many of the warnings. At the same time, chain pharmacies are increasingly promoting quick service. Drive-through windows are now common, and services like CVS' walk-in MinuteClinics appeal to consumers' preference for speed. These efforts may send a message to patients that speed is more important than quality health care. Patients have internalized that message and feel entitled to short wait times, pharmacists said. \"The patient will get mad if you call the doctor and take time,\" said Sadia Shuja, a pharmacist at Skypoint Pharmacy in Schaumburg who caught a dangerous drug pair in the Tribune tests. \"Sometimes they think it is fast food.\" To ease workload, most pharmacies employ technicians to manage tasks that require less medical expertise. Arsen Mysllinj, a Kmart pharmacist in Rockford who passed the Tribune test, said technicians at his store and others often screen for drug interactions after entering patients' drug orders into a computer. If interactions appear, he said, the technicians are trained to print out the warning on the screen and hand it to a pharmacist. It would be better, he said, for pharmacists to do the screening. Kmart said that in light of the test results, it would review its relevant policies, computer systems and training programs. Unionized pharmacists, including those in Illinois, have periodically pushed for minimum staffing rules, but those efforts have not gone far. Some pharmacists say time spent pitching company promotions could be better spent on patient safety. In the Tribune tests, the majority of Kmart pharmacists dispensed risky drug combinations without warning testers. But several did take time to try to enroll the reporters in the company's savings program. 'Scorecard' pressures At CVS, prompt service isn't just a vague goal. It is a carefully measured metric that the chain uses, along with other assessments, to grade its pharmacies and rank them against one another, records and interviews show. Several current or former CVS pharmacists criticized the practice, saying it pressures them to focus more on corporate criteria than on drug interactions and other safety checks. \"You get stressed, and it takes your mind away from the actual prescriptions,\" said Chuck Zuraitis, head pharmacist at a CVS in south suburban Park Forest and a union steward for Teamsters Local 727, which represents 130 CVS pharmacists in the Chicago area. His pharmacy was not among those tested. Performance and business metrics are common at big chain pharmacies and in other industries. Supporters say they make companies more efficient and responsive to customers. In 2012, the nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication Practices conducted a national survey of 673 pharmacists and found that nearly two-thirds worked at stores that track the time it takes to fill prescriptions. About 25 percent worked at companies that guaranteed short wait times. Of the pharmacists at stores that advertised quick service, 4 in 10 said they had made a medication error as a result of hurrying to fill a prescription within a set time. In 2013, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy called on states to prohibit, restrict or regulate company policies that measure the speed of pharmacists' work. But, the association says, little has changed in state law. Internal CVS records obtained by the Tribune show that the company tracks numerous pharmacist tasks, including whether prescriptions are filled in the time promised to customers and whether voicemails are retrieved in a timely fashion. \"Every prescription is timed,\" said Deepak Chande, a former head pharmacist at a CVS in southwest suburban Worth, \"and this is the worst of the pharmacist's nightmares.\" Deepak Chande E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Deepak Chande, a former head CVS pharmacist in southwest suburban Worth, says pressure is intense to fill prescriptions quickly. Deepak Chande, a former head CVS pharmacist in southwest suburban Worth, says pressure is intense to fill prescriptions quickly. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) If pharmacists fall behind, the backlog pops up in color on their computer screens, said Chande, also a former union steward. \"It's an unreal pressure,\" he said. \"Your mind is kind of frantically trying to obey it.\" CVS officials declined to be interviewed about metrics but issued a statement and answered questions in writing. The company said prescriptions do not have to be filled quickly, but it expects pharmacists to have medications ready by the time promised to the customer. Records show that head pharmacists receive a monthly \"WeCARE Scorecard\" that tracks the percentage of prescriptions filled by the times promised. The pharmacies are ranked by district, by region and nationwide. CVS' computer system prioritizes prescriptions based on patients' requested pickup times, with preference given to customers with urgent needs \u2014 for instance, someone on his way home from the hospital after surgery. Pharmacists can reset a promised pickup time if they think it cannot be met, the company wrote. The color indicators on computer screens are meant to help pharmacists with prioritizing their work, CVS said. The company also wrote that several years ago it removed a red indicator for prescriptions that had gone beyond the promised pickup time because pharmacists \"felt the color red denoted something negative or alarming.\" \"We switched to an 'orange' indicator to inform a pharmacy team which prescriptions may not be ready before a customer's expected arrival time,\" CVS wrote. Another CVS metric, documents show, tracks how many patients sign up for automatic refills. Zuraitis said posters on pharmacy walls record how many flu shots have been administered. \"You feel like you're trying to sell people something,\" he said. CVS said automatic refills help patients stay on schedule with the drugs they need to treat chronic conditions. The company said it measures the number of flu vaccinations offered to customers to help support the recommendation by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that people receive a flu shot annually. At Walgreens, officials said the company collects business metrics as a way to monitor staffing levels and service. The firm said it does not use them in a manner that emphasizes productivity over patient safety. Alethea Little, a Walgreens pharmacist in west suburban Forest Park who properly warned a tester, said metrics are no excuse for missing drug interactions. \"Our flu shot goal is 10 a day, 12 a day, 50 a day,\" she said. \"And the phone rings off the hook. You just got to do what you got to do, essentially.\" Squeezed by chains Independent pharmacies face a different kind of pressure: intense competition from the big chains. B.M. Patel, a pharmacist for 40 years who owns Riteway Pharmacy on Chicago's Northwest Side, missed the test interaction but didn't make excuses. \"It was a mistake,\" he said. \"Maybe I should be paying more attention.\" But he also said small pharmacies know that if they don't fill a prescription, the customer might simply go to a nearby chain store. Business at his store, he said, \"is not good. I can still survive, but not too long. We don't really know how long it's going to last.\" The number of independent stores has been shrinking nationwide. In Illinois, the number dropped about 9 percent from 689 in 2013 to 624 last year, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association. Several independents tested by the Tribune looked like classic drugstores, offering medications alongside greeting cards, stuffed animals and candy bars. Others were less inviting. One dispensed drugs behind a thick window; at another, a reporter had to knock several times to gain entry. In Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood, independent pharmacist Audrey Galal passed her test while working at a Mexicare Pharmacy, a small storefront on a block of brick buildings. The store is in the process of closing, she said, in part because of competition from chains. Galal said she did not think small drugstores would knowingly sell harmful medications, but they might be reluctant to turn away business. \"These pharmacists are acting like businesspeople, just trying to keep their pharmacies afloat instead of being clinicians,\" said Galal, who now works at a Mexicare in Little Village. Audrey Galal E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Pharmacist Audrey Galal recognized the danger when presented with a pair of prescriptions at the independent Mexicare Pharmacy in Chicago\u2019s Pilsen neighborhood and did not dispense the drugs. She doubts small drugstores knowingly sell harmful combinations but says they might be reluctant to turn away business.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Andy Politis, a pharmacist and part owner of Oakmill Pharmacy in north suburban Niles who passed the test, said he was surprised how many independents failed. \"The independent guys should be better because they don't have the same pressure as the big stores with so many prescriptions,\" he said. B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive of the national community pharmacists group, said the results were alarming. \"It's something that shouldn't happen \u2014 both for chains and independents,\" he said. \"Even one is too many.\" Several independents said the findings prompted them to make changes. After failing its test, Summit Medical Pharmacy in the southwest suburbs beefed up internal checks and worked with a software company to ensure that even minor drug interactions are detected. Since then, the new system has flagged several interactions that led to consultations with doctors and patients, head pharmacist Pankaj Bhalakia said. \"We changed the whole system,\" he said. \"I don't think there could be a problem in the future.\" sroe@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Yahoo shares fell 4.7 percent, or $1.91, to $39 in afternoon trading. Verizon shares rose 40 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $52.03. The digital heist disclosed Wednesday occurred in August 2013. Yahoo previously disclosed that its outside forensic experts were investigating the creation of forged cookies that could allow an intruder to access users\u2019 accounts without a password. Based on the ongoing investigation, the company believes an unauthorized third party accessed the company\u2019s proprietary code to learn how to forge cookies,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe outside forensic experts have identified user accounts for which they believe forged cookies were taken or used. Yahoo is notifying the affected account holders, and has invalidated the forged cookies.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d security expert Avivah Litan of Gartner Inc.\u00a0 Two hacks, more than 1 billion accounts\u00a0 Yahoo didn\u2019t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn\u2019t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion.\u00a0 Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks.\u00a0 In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected.\u00a0 But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice \u2014 once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases.\u00a0 That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can\u2019t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you\u2019ve changed your password and questions since September.)\u00a0 Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn\u2019t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn\u2019t the work of ordinary criminals.\u00a0 That means most Yahoo users probably don\u2019t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo\u2019s plans to fall into Verizon\u2019s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company\u2019s services wouldn\u2019t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business.\u00a0 After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the \u201cnew development before reaching any final conclusions.\u201d Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions.\u00a0 At the very least, the security lapses \u201cdefinitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,\u201d Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn\u2019t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms.\u00a0 \u201cThis just adds to fuel to the fire and it won\u2019t help Yahoo\u2019s cause,\u201d said Eric Jackson, a longtime critic of the company\u2019s management.

WFAA, ABC's Dallas affiliate, reports that a Tarrant County, Texas, jury found Fred Couch, 51, guilty of a misdemeanor of false identification of a peace officer in a 2014 case involving police in North Richland Hills, an affluent Dallas\u2013Fort Worth suburb. Fred Couch \u2014 whose teenage son, currently in custody, caused a car accident in 2013 that killed four people and severely injured another \u2014 pleased not guilty to the charge against him on Tuesday, his trial's first day of testimony. According to WFAA, Fred Couch told North Richland Hills officers who were responding to a disturbance call that he was a reserve police officer in the town of nearby Lakeside. And to make matters worse, police said they found on him a badge reading \"Lakeside Police Search and Rescue.\" He faces a maximum of 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine, WFAA reports. 0 Shares ",

And there are at least 28\u00a0for sale at prices over $75 million. The huge majority of these luxury homes are for sale in and around New York, the nation\u2019s largest city. Los Angeles and the areas around it are also well represented. Beyond these, most of the homes are in playgrounds of the rich, such as Aspen, East Hampton and Key Largo. 24/7 Wall St. provides a list of the 35 most expensive homes in America each day.

    "text": "WATCH Trump in Denial as Officials Blame Spymaster Putin for Election Hacks 0 Shares Email Ever the master spy, Russian President Vladimir Putin , a former KGB colonel, was personally involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and efforts to interfere in the American elections, U.S. and foreign intelligence officials tell ABC News. A representative for Putin today called the reports \u201cfunny nonsense,\u201d but American intelligence agencies are failing to see any humor in the bold Russian cyberattacks and the apparent role of the Russian president. People in the intelligence community directly involved in uncovering and tracking the Russian hack say a new flow of information has directly connected Putin to what began as a lower-level effort by the Russian military to infiltrate the computers of both Republican and Democratic figures. Once the hackers were successful in breaching the Democratic National Committee\u2019s systems, Putin became more directly involved with the effort, the intelligence sources say. Russian officials have consistently denied any hacking activities around the U.S. election. In October the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security released a joint statement that read, \u201cThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s seniormost officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d The appearance of documents from the DNC on WikiLeaks in July kicked off a period of seemingly endless negative news stories, embarrassed the Hillary Clinton campaign and led to the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Five months later, the hack continues to dominate headlines. Since winning the election, Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions that the Russians were behind the hacking. Last weekend, acrimony between Trump and the intelligence agencies that he\u2019ll soon control reached a boiling point, with the two sides engaging in a war of words over the details of Russia\u2019s cyberactivities that played out in national newspapers and television programs. More: Trump Engages CIA in War of Words Over Russian Election Hacking Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has ordered a full review of the hacks, and the White House said it will be completed and presented to Congress before the inauguration on Jan. 20. While sources say a number of retaliatory actions have been recommended \u2014 including going after secret bank accounts believed to belong to Putin \u2014 no responding action has been taken. ",

WKMG-TV ORLANDO, Fla. -- The widow of the gunman who carried out a deadly shooting at a Florida gay nightclub before he was killed has filed a petition in a California court to change the name of their son. An online docket from Contra Costa County, California, shows that Omar Mateen\u2019s wife, Noor Salman, filed the petition on Wednesday on behalf of the 4-year-old boy, who is partly named for his father. A hearing is scheduled for February. No other details are provided in the online docket. Contra Costa County is in the San Francisco metro area.  Salman moved there from Florida after her husband was killed in a shootout with SWAT team members during the June 12 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Forty-nine patrons were killed.\u00a0 Orlando nightclub mass shooting victims Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) during a three-hour standoff.\u00a0 The fence around Pulse opened early Monday for an intimate ceremony marking six months since the mass shooting, CBS Orlando affiliate WKMG-TV reported .\u00a0 Survivors, staff and family members of victims killed during the massacre held a moment of silence at 2:02 a.m., the exact time gunman Mateen started shooting.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 15, 2016 4:33 PM EST NEW YORK -\u00a0 The latest hack impacting more than one billion Yahoo accounts has users all over the world worried about how to protect their digital privacy. News that the struggling internet company was breached back in 2013 \u2014 coming on top of a separate hack that exposed some 500 million Yahoo users \u2014 should serve as a reminder that everyone\u2019s email and personal information is vulnerable to hacking. \u201cThey got users\u2019 names, birthdays, they got encrypted passwords \u2014 though the passwords may not have been encrypted with secure technology \u2014 and they got answers to security questions, so if you had a Yahoo account and you typed in your mother\u2019s maiden name or the name of your first pet \u2014 all of that information was accessed by hackers,\u201d NewYorker.com editor and CBS News contributor Nicholas Thompson said on \u201c CBS This Morning .\u201d Safeguards you can take include creating strong passwords and changing them when you have to. Yes, all this is a pain, and it\u2019s not your fault that the tech industry hasn\u2019t been able to stem the rise in security breaches. But if you do nothing, you could be putting your personal or financial information \u2014 or even your identity \u2014 at risk. Should I change my password? It\u2019s a good place to start. While some security experts argue that it\u2019s more important to pick a complicated password than to change them frequently, if you haven\u2019t changed your Yahoo password since 2013 do it now. And even if you have changed your Yahoo password in the last three years, you might want to do it anyway. Breaches are often worse than they first appear. LinkedIn disclosed earlier this year that a 2012 breach affected 117 million accounts \u2014 not the 6.5 million previously thought. What\u2019s a good password?\u00a0 The more complicated and lengthy a password is, the harder it will be for hackers to guess. Can you trust Yahoo after a hack affecting 1 billion users? Don\u2019t include your kids\u2019 names, birthdays or references to any other personal details. Hackers routinely troll Facebook and Twitter for clues to passwords like these. Obvious and default passwords such as \u201cPassword123\u201d are also bad , as are words commonly found in dictionaries, as these are used in programs hackers have to automate guesses. Long and random combinations of letters, numbers and other characters work best. Your password reset questions should be as unique as possible too, and don\u2019t be tempted to recycle those either. This was some of the information stolen in the Yahoo hack . And with the help of social media, it\u2019s not hard for hackers to find those little personal tidbits like what your mother\u2019s maiden name is, or the name of your hometown. Yahoo recommended that users who haven\u2019t updated their passwords since 2014 do so now. These passwords were encrypted through a tool known as bcrypt.\u00a0 Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO ALliance, a nonprofit that vets login systems, told CNET.com that this form of encryption is able to be burst through with enough persistence by hackers. \u201cYahoo users with relatively weak or obvious passwords should take the recommended precautions,\u201d he said. Is it OK to reuse passwords? No. Avoid using the same password for multiple sites, so that a break of your school\u2019s PTA site wouldn\u2019t lead hackers to your online banking account. You can make things easier on yourself by using a password-manager service such as LastPass or DashLane. They remember complex passwords for you \u2014 but you have to trust them. Last year, LastPass disclosed \u201csuspicious activity\u201d and told users to change their master passwords. Some web browsers such as Apple\u2019s Safari and Google\u2019s Chrome also have built-in password managers. They work if you switch devices but not if you switch browsers. What more can I do? Multi-factor identification \u2014 which asks users to enter a second form of identification, such as a code texted to their phone \u2014 will provide additional protections. It\u2019s now commonplace for many email and social media accounts. Even if hackers manage to get your password they would be unable to get in without the code texted to your phone. Tech companies are also working on a number of futuristic solutions, including biometrics and photo-based \u201c selfie passwords ,\u201d but it will take some time for them to be fully developed, tested and rolled out for widespread use.\u00a0 Should some accounts be trashed? Delete or deactivate accounts you no longer use. Has your Yahoo email account been filled with spam since before the invention of smartphones? Maybe it\u2019s time to say goodbye. Could an entire city be hacked? Nicholas Thompson\u2019s advice is straightforward:\u00a0\u201cDelete your account.\u201d Thompson stressed that all of the reporting since the initial word of the hack has made it clear that Yahoo \u201cde-prioritized security.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSecurity is expensive,\u201d he said, taking critical aim at Yahoo. \u201cIt\u2019s  like putting bars on your windows. It costs money, and it makes the view a little less pretty.\u201d That goes for social media too \u2014 close down accounts you don\u2019t use anymore (remember Myspace ?). This often can be done through your account settings, as long as you still have your password to sign in. What about social media security? And while we\u2019re on the subject of social media , make sure you restrict posts to just your actual friends. You can adjust that in the settings. Some companies try to help their users with this. Facebook , for example, occasionally prompts its users to review who can see their personal information and how strong their security settings are. Nonetheless, assume that everyone everywhere can see what you\u2019re posting. That\u2019ll keep hackers from harvesting those juicy details they can use to crack into your accounts. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "WATCH Legendary Sideline Reporter Craig Sager Remembered 0 Shares Email Craig Sager never once thought about giving up as he battled cancer for more than two years. \"Man, life is too beautiful, too wonderful, there's just too many things,\" he said in late August. \"It's not just you. It's your family and kids and all. Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can.\" The end for the beloved TNT broadcaster came Thursday when the man known as much for his outrageous wardrobe as his relationships with the NBA's elite succumbed to the disease he fought so hard to overcome. Turner Sports announced his death without disclosing details. He was 65 and had worked basketball games for TNT for nearly a quarter-century. \"There will never be another Craig Sager,\" Turner President David Levy said. \"His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports.\" His son, Craig Jr., posted a loving video tribute to his father, tweeting: \"We packed a lifetime and then some into these 28 years together.\" Sager's passing brought out condolences from every corner of the NBA and Hall of Famer Larry Bird expressed what many were feeling. \"He was as identifiable with the NBA as any player or coach,\" Bird said. \"The league will not be the same without him.\" Magic Johnson echoed those sentiments on Twitter. \"The NBA family lost a legend who changed the way sideline reporters did their job. RIP Craig Sager,\" Johnson said. It wasn't just the NBA community that mourned his passing , with Vice President Joe Biden and Drake expressing sadness at the loss. Sager had two bone marrow transplants with his son as the donor before undergoing a third one from an anonymous donor at the end of August in Houston to fight an aggressive form of leukemia. To no one's surprise, he was characteristically cheerful . \"It really isn't all that painful, not physically,\" he said then. \"I think the hardest toll is mentally and emotionally. I have this thing of positive thinking. I think if you think something is going to be right and you think positive then you feel that way and if you feel that way you'll act that way. I try not to get down.\" Sager announced in April 2014 that he had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, and he missed the playoffs and much of the following season as he underwent the first two transplants. Sager revealed in March 2016 that his leukemia was no longer in remission. He said doctors told him the typical prognosis was three to six months to live. He was overwhelmed by how news of his fight spread and people across the world started talking about the Sager Strong campaign. \"At first was our family's fight,\" Sager said. \"Then because of TV and TNT and people seeing me in the stands and I talk to people and then it got bigger and then that inner circle became an endless world to tell you the truth.\" Sager then started gaining inspiration from everyone who shared their story or reached out to show support. \"They saw that I refused to give up and I refused to give in and that I'm still fighting it and they saw a lot of inspiration in what I was doing,\" he said. \"Now I feel I'm not only fighting for what I want and what my family wants, but for everybody out there who has cancer or will.\" His battle brought out the soft side of Gregg Popovich, the prickly San Antonio Spurs coach with whom he had many memorable exchanges during in-game interviews. Sager never faulted Popovich for his gruff attitude during those interviews, saying \"he's trying to win a game. He doesn't want to talk to some reporter.\" \"Later, he said, 'You're still going to be media on the court, but off the court can I call you and see how you're doing?' I said: 'Heck yes,'\" Sager recalled in August. \"Just keep treating me the way on the court you always do. He said: 'I wouldn't want it any other way.'\" After learning Sager had died, Popovich spoke somberly for close to two minutes before a game in Phoenix. \"A day like this, basketball has to take a back seat, as we all think about somebody who was very unique, very special,\" Popovich said. \"Whether you really knew Craig or not, you got the feeling that he was a very special person in a lot of different ways, and right now I just feel for his family.\" \"He was a way better person than he was a worker, even though he was amazing in that regard. He loved all the people around him and everybody felt that,\" he said. \"The most amazing part of him is his courage ... if any of us can display half the courage he has to stay on this planet, to live every life as if it's his last, we'd be well off.\" Sager sported suits in every color of the rainbow and plenty of shades not found in nature, from teal to fuchsia to magenta. He would match plaid blazers with paisley ties or striped shirts \u2014 all in bold hues. Kevin Garnett once told him to burn an entire outfit. In a 2016 interview with HBO's \"Real Sports,\" Sager recalled how Popovich reproached him for trying to stand out. Sager explained to him: \"Coach, you don't understand. If I'm not wearing bright colors and if I don't feel lively, it's not me.\" Sometimes lost in the glare of his wardrobe was Sager's relentless nature as a reporter. Every time Popovich would give a terse non-answer, an unfazed Sager would pepper him with another question. Sager's persistence was on display at the start of his career, when the 22-year-old found himself in the middle of one of the most famous moments in sports history. Making $95 a week in 1974 as the news director at WSPB \u2014 a Braves-affiliated AM radio station in Sarasota, Florida \u2014 Sager risked getting fired by deciding to hop a flight to Atlanta for a game with Hank Aaron a home run away from breaking Babe Ruth's career record. With a last-minute credential, Sager was stuck in the third-base photographers' well. As the historic homer sailed out of the park, Sager, without thinking, sprinted onto the field and wound up chasing Aaron down the third-base line. When Aaron's teammates mobbed him at home plate, Sager can be seen in his trench coat in the middle of the scrum. The next day, Sager caught a 5 a.m. flight to Sarasota to be back for his morning drive responsibilities, and his tapes from the game wound up in Cooperstown. Sager worked as a reporter on the Olympics, Major League Baseball playoffs, the NFL and the NCAA Tournament, among other sports. But he was indelibly connected to the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver said the \"true original\" was respected for his reporting \u2014 and his inspiring fight. Bulls star Dwyane Wade sold paisley ties during the 2016 playoffs to raise money to combat blood cancers. \"Craig was as vital to the NBA as the players and coaches,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \"Craig earned widespread respect for his insightful reporting and inspired so many most recently with his courage.\" Sager got to cover his first NBA Finals in 2016 through an unusual arrangement between TNT and ESPN, which invited him to join its coverage. He marked the occasion by wearing a blazer with a royal blue floral print. In an interview with LeBron James after Game 6, the Cavaliers star turned the tables to giddily ask Sager a question: \"How in the hell do you go 30-plus years without getting a Finals game?\" He was self-deprecating when asked what the outpouring of support from across the NBA meant to him. \"It means that I'm not just the nuisance that they see on the court when I'm trying to talk to them when they want to be somewhere else,\" he said in August. And Sager loved everything about his job. \"I try to get there three hours before the game, talk with the ushers and the security guards, the coaches and the fans,\" Sager said in 2015. A native of Batavia, Illinois, Sager attended Northwestern, where he walked onto the football and basketball teams, and served as the school's \"Willie the Wildcat\" mascot for three years. He worked at several TV and radio stations in Florida after college before spending two years in Kansas City. Sager joined CNN in 1981 after handling the network's first live remote report during the 1980 baseball playoffs. Sager was in Dallas for a game in April 2014 when he felt ill and sought treatment from Mavericks team physician Dr. Tarek Souryal, who had previously performed Sager's knee surgery. With a dangerously low hemoglobin count, Sager had six blood transfusions over a 24-hour period before returning to Atlanta. After that came the treatments and his public battle with leukemia. Earlier this year, Sager was involved in the television coverage of the NCAA Final Four and had a memorable postgame interview with Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. \"I'm proud of you,\" Boeheim told Sager on air after the Orange lost in the national semifinals. \"I'm really proud of you and what you're doing. You're a fighter and that's something we all should really aspire to be. You're setting an example that we all should be really happy to try to follow.\" Sager replied, \"Well, thank you very much.\" And then the professional broadcaster did what professional broadcasters do - he went to his next question, one about Syracuse's famed 2-3 zone, without missing a beat. \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP freelance writer Jose M.

It takes 270 votes to win, because the 12th Amendment requires a candidate to get a majority. Members of a group calling itself The Electors Trust, including Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, say they've been contacted by dozens of electors seeking legal advice. Many are asking, must they vote as their states did? Related: Why We Have the Electoral College A total of 29 states have laws that bind the electors, requiring them to cast their votes for whichever candidate won that state's popular vote. But the laws are weak, providing only nominal penalties. The Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote. But the justices have never said whether it is constitutional to enforce those pledges. Courts in Colorado and Washington state have rejected pleas from electors to be released from requirements to vote as their states did. In California, a federal judge scheduled a hearing for Friday morning on a similar request from an elector, Vinzenz Koller, who said he he cannot vote for Hillary Clinton. Elsewhere, Christopher Suprun, a Texas paramedic, said he will not vote for the candidate who won his state's election. \"Donald Trump lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief,\" he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Another Republican elector from Texas, Art Sisneros, resigned in late November. A vote for Trump \"would bring dishonor to God,\" he said. Eighteen actors and other artists, including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing, urged Republican electors in a video that went viral to \"go down in the books as an American hero\" and vote for anyone other than Trump. In a letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, 68 presidential electors from 17 states asked for a briefing on why the U.S. believes Russia was behind cyberattacks intended to influence the election. However the intelligence community said it will not discuss the Russian hacks until a review ordered by President Obama is completed in January. Related: U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack While the electors are generating an usual amount of attention, it is unlikely to have much effect. Republican officials say party lawyers have been in contact with the 306 Republican electors and believe only a few may vote for someone other than Donald Trump. A survey by the Associated Press reached a similar result. After interviewing 330 of the 538 electors, the AP found \"widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the hustle of anti-Trump maneuvering can derail him.\" Pete Williams ",

Credit Chris Seward/The News & Observer, via Associated Press RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Gov.-elect Roy Cooper of North Carolina on Thursday angrily attacked the Republican-led state Legislature for what he called an unprecedented effort to strip his powers before he takes office, and to advance Republican policies that have led to fierce ideological battles in the state. Mr. Cooper, a Democrat, defeated the incumbent Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and as the state attorney general, he said he was scrutinizing the legality of the Republican proposals. \u201cThey will see me in court,\u201d he warned. After Republicans, who have large majorities in the General Assembly, called a surprise special session Wednesday, they introduced measures that included ending the new governor\u2019s control over election boards, requiring State Senate approval of his cabinet members and stripping his power to appoint University of North Carolina trustees. If the measures pass and are signed into law by Mr. McCrory, they would drastically limit Mr. Cooper\u2019s power when he takes office Jan. 1. In a news conference, the governor-elect blasted lawmakers for plotting secretly for weeks to introduce the bills. He compared the move to the enactment this spring of North Carolina\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d known as House Bill 2, which nullified protections for gay and transgender residents. Some say the law, which brought boycotts by sports leagues and some businesses, contributed significantly to Mr. McCrory\u2019s loss. His was the only governor\u2019s seat in the country that Republicans failed to hold on Election Day, even as Donald J. Trump won here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe don\u2019t want another disaster like House Bill 2,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cThis is exactly why we had problems with House Bill 2, because they wanted to do it in secret,\u201d he said. Mr. McCrory conceded the race last week after a nearly monthlong challenge of the vote, a hard-fought race after four years in which unified Republican control of state government brought a wave of restrictions on voting access, abortion and gay rights. Democratic leaders accused Republicans of trying to undo the election results. \u201cThis is an unprecedented, shameful and cowardly power grab from the Republicans,\u201d said Jamal Little, a spokesman for the state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cAfter losing the governor\u2019s office, the G.O.P. -controlled General Assembly is attempting to hold on to power that voters took away from them.\u201d A Republican leader in the House, David R. Lewis, defended the moves, telling reporters on Wednesday that Republicans would \u201cwork to establish that we are going to continue to be a relevant party in governing the state.\u201d Other Republicans said there was a precedent for the Legislature checking the power of a governor. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the state Republican Party, asked in a Facebook post \u201chow is this different\u201d than what Democrats in the General Assembly did to a Republican governor, James G. Martin, in the 1980s. Mr. Cooper rejected the comparison. \u201cThat is just not true,\u201d he said when asked by reporters. \u201cWhat is happening now is unprecedented.\u201d The most sweeping changes Republicans propose would limit Mr. Cooper\u2019s ability to appoint top members of his administration, and in some cases would limit their powers. The State Senate would have to approve cabinet secretaries, who are now the governor\u2019s sole discretion. The Legislature seeks to reduce the governor\u2019s influence over the state Board of Education and to enhance the power of the state education superintendent, who is a newly elected Republican. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Cooper said the changes would set the stage to channel taxpayer dollars into private-school vouchers. Similarly, he said that Republicans sought to take control over the appointments of the departments of commerce, revenue and environmental policy. Their goals, he said, were part of a conservative policy wish list: corporate tax loopholes and weakening clean air and water protections. \u201cMost people might think that this is a partisan power grab,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cBut it is really more ominous.\u201d Under one Republican bill, which lawmakers will debate and vote on beginning Thursday, the state and county election boards would be revamped to remove them from the partisan control of the governor. Under current state law, the governor names five members to the state Elections Board, which in turn appoints the 100 county boards. Now, Republicans seek to make the boards balanced equally between the two parties. Mr. Cooper\u2019s election, which was decided by only about 10,300 votes, or 0.2 percent, put a spotlight on North Carolina\u2019s elections boards as they examined voting challenges in dozens of counties brought by McCrory supporters, who claimed that dead people and felons had voted. The challenges stretched on for nearly a month, and it was not until last week that Mr. McCrory conceded. Still, the state board rulings in the canvass procedure did not necessarily favor Mr. McCrory. Most of the votes his supporters challenged proved inconsequential. Rumors bubbled up after Mr. Cooper\u2019s election that Republicans in Raleigh would add seats to the State Supreme Court. The court gained a 4-to-3 Democratic majority after the election last month of Judge Mike Morgan. Republicans denied a \u201ccourt-packing\u201d plan, and no such bill was introduced. But a bill was filed to add party labels in State Supreme Court elections. It was seen as a response to the election of Mr. Morgan, who some observers thought won because voters mistakenly thought he was a Republican. The special legislative session was announced only at midday on Wednesday, and it came as a surprise to Democrats. Lawmakers had just ended a two-day special session, the third of the year, called to enact relief for victims of natural disasters.

In the House, one Democratic representative after another rose to protest that the session was unconstitutional. ",

Russia does not extradite its citizens and has shown that it will not easily be deterred through public shaming. At times, the American authorities have enlisted local police officials to arrest suspects when they leave Russia \u2014 for vacation in the Maldives, for example. But more often than not, the F.B.I. and Justice Department investigate and compile accusations and evidence against people who will almost certainly never stand trial. The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. \u201cYou can indict 400 people. They don\u2019t care,\u201d said Robert E. Anderson Jr., who until last year served as the F.B.I.\u2019s most senior executive overseeing computer investigations. The American government divides the cybersecurity world into two categories: attacks directed or sponsored by governments, and those conducted by criminals. But Russian hacking defies easy categorization, American officials say, because the Russian government tacitly supports many private hackers and occasionally taps them for freelance government work. That has complicated investigations and upended the normal diplomatic order.

The Americans said they were investigating a hacker who had installed malicious code in the software that some American businesses used to process credit card transactions. The hacker was stealing millions of credit card numbers and selling them in an underground digital marketplace. The agents provided a name \u2014 Roman Seleznev \u2014 and the aliases he used online. His father was a member of the Russian Parliament. The Secret Service had followed his digital trail to Vladivostok, Russia, and they asked for help catching him. Within weeks, all evidence of Mr. Seleznev\u2019s online identity vanished from the internet. Rather than advancing the case, the Russian government had set it back, the American authorities believed. Prosecutors described their blunt conclusion in court documents: \u201cFurther coordination with the Russian government would jeopardize efforts to prosecute this case.\u201d The American authorities were left to pursue Mr. Seleznev by themselves. In another computer crime case, in 2014, the Justice Department shut down two worldwide computer networks that had been used to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting victims. Called Operation Tovar, it was among the department\u2019s most complicated computer investigations and involved intelligence agencies around the world. The target was a 30-year-old Russian named Evgeniy M. Bogachev. Safely in Russia, he watched as the F.B.I. made him a most-wanted fugitive and offered a $3 million reward for his capture. Photo Evgeniy M. Bogachev is wanted by the F.B.I. for his involvement in a cybercrime case in which millions of dollars were stolen from unsuspecting victims. Credit via F.B.I. In that case the F.B.I. was actually able to identify the person sitting at the keyboard. More often, the authorities identify aliases or internet addresses but cannot prove who is behind them unless the hackers get sloppy. In the Seleznev case, for example, the authorities searched a Yahoo email account that was used to register some of the servers in the credit-card scam. Agents found, among other things, receipts for flowers that Mr. Seleznev had sent to his wife. In the D.N.C. case and other election-year hacks, the authorities have concluded that people affiliated with the Russian government are to blame. But even if intelligence officials can identify who is behind those attacks, naming the actual perpetrators is even harder. One senior federal law enforcement official said this week that investigators still had many unanswered questions. If it can be done, naming and prosecuting the hackers would follow a path set in 2014, when the Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army on charges of hacking into American networks. The indictment links the men to specific email addresses and aliases, but does not reveal how the authorities made those connections.

Credit Joshua Bright for The New York Times The office party can be a chance for co-workers to get together in a relaxed setting to celebrate the holidays. Or it can be a memorable event for all the wrong reasons. \u201cGetting on top of the boss\u2019s desk and dancing \u2014 not a good idea,\u201d John A.

These sorts of things have happened and given the H.R. teams great headaches.\u201d Phyllis G.

Of those who attended such parties, 11 percent reported experiencing negative physical and social effects from drinking, including passing out, needing to apologize to colleagues, and having their behavior hurt their standing at work, according to a company statement. \u201cDrinking too much at a workplace party is one of the quickest ways to derail your career,\u201d Doug Tieman , Caron\u2019s president and chief executive, said in the statement. Party organizers should try to strike a balance between treating workers as adults and curbing potentially bad behavior, experts said. \u201cCorporations hope that everyone will drink in moderation\u201d said Laura E. Prather , managing principal of the Tampa, Fla., office of Jackson Lewis, which specializes in employment law. \u201cAnd that never happens.\u201d She recalled one supervisor who overindulged in alcohol and loudly \u201cgushed\u201d to a subordinate about the outstanding performance review, raise and bonus she would get. Although the employee did get a bonus and raise, neither was for the maximum, Ms. Prather said. The supervisor\u2019s comments at the party set unrealistic expectations and made another subordinate who was within earshot fear that he would fare poorly because the boss said nothing to him at the party about his performance, Ms. Prather said.

Got it By Dustin Waters and Kevin Sullivan December 15 at 6:57 PM Follow @sullivank A jury finds Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof guilty of federal hate crimes resulting in the death of nine black parishioners at a historic church in South Carolina last year. (Reuters) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Dylann Storm Roof, a ninth-grade dropout who learned to hate black people on the Internet, was convicted Thursday of 33 counts of federal hate crimes for slaughtering nine black parishioners at a church Bible study meeting here last year. A federal jury took less than two hours to reach its decision, following a seven-day trial in which Roof, 22, a self-described white supremacist, chose to remain silent and motionless amid a barrage of testimony and evidence so thorough and devastating that his mother, watching from the third row, suffered a heart attack on the first day. \u201cHe executed them because he believes they are nothing but animals,\u201d prosecutor Nathan Williams said in his closing argument, addressing a somber jury that had seen crime-scene photos of all the dead, including Susie Jackson, 87, the oldest victim, into whom Roof had emptied an entire 11-round magazine from his Glock .45-caliber pistol. [ \u2018Evil, evil, evil as can be\u2019: Emotional testimony as Dylann Roof trial begins ] As Williams spoke, a photograph of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney was shown on the screen. The pastor, who had offered Roof a seat next to him at Bible study, was wearing a crisp white shirt and new suit now stained by blood from the five bullet wounds in his neck, back and arm. Roof\u2019s grandmother, sitting in the courtroom while the image was displayed, wiped a tear from her eye. Read the victims\u2019 stories View Graphic Read the victims\u2019 stories Judge Richard M. Gergel dismissed the jury for the holidays and told them to return on Jan. 3, when they will hear prosecution and defense arguments about whether Roof should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without parole. Roof also faces a separate state murder trial in January, which also carries a potential death penalty. Many friends and relatives of the dead attended the trial, in the historic heart of the city where the Civil War began, and many sat with their eyes closed tight as they listened to the verdict. \u201cThere\u2019s no win in this. We still have grieving families, a grieving community. There\u2019s some closure, but there\u2019s no win in this thing,\u201d said Kevin Singleton, 43, whose mother, Myra Thompson, was killed. \u201cWe just want to move forward and put this behind us and try to get on with our lives. Nothing good came out of any of this.\u201d [ Scene in Charleston: \u2018At the end of the day, we are just looking for justice.\u2019 ] But some allowed themselves a moment of gratitude. The Rev. Sharon Risher, whose mother, Ethel Lance, was among the dead, said she was \u201coverjoyed that this part is done.\u201d At the moment the verdict was read, she said, the family members \u201clooked at each other with smiles, like, \u2018Hallelujah, God is still in the miracle-working business.\u2019 \u201d Roof\u2019s guilt in the killings was essentially uncontested; prosecutors showed the jury Roof\u2019s interview with FBI agents in which he calmly confessed to the killings and complained that he was \u201cworn out\u201d after pumping more than 60 bullets into his victims. Prosectors introduced and played Dylann Roof\u2019s two-hour video confession during the third day of Roof\u2019s federal death penalty trial. (U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina) Under federal law, he was charged with hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms violations. He was also charged with attempting to commit those same offenses against two adults and a child who survived. [ The white flight of Derek Black ] His attorney, David Bruck, a death penalty specialist, told the jury he expected them to find Roof guilty, but he repeatedly tried to inject the notion that Roof was mentally or emotionally unstable. He was consistently cut off by Gergel, who said that was relevant only in the penalty phase of the trial. Roof has said he will represent himself during that phase, and Bruck was apparently trying to help his client in advance of that by giving the jury some justification to spare his life. \u201cConsider the mad energy, the rationale, the senselessness,\u201d Bruck said as the prosecution mounted objection after objection. \u201cThe fact that one is a racist does not tell you what else is going on. And what else is going on is what you should be thinking about.\u201d The federal death penalty is rarely imposed; the last time was more than a decade ago. Roof had offered to plead guilty and accept life in prison, but the U.S. Justice Department determined that the circumstances were so egregious that they warranted seeking Roof\u2019s execution. The crime stood as a new and hideous chapter in the long history of racial killings in America. Prosecutors read lines from a journal found in Roof\u2019s car and the manifesto he posted online, and they told jurors that Roof wanted to incite a race war. Prosecutors presented evidence that Roof chose the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic monument known as Mother Emanuel, because of its spiritual and symbolic importance to the black community. [ What happens next if Dylann Roof is sentenced to death ] Roof told FBI interrogators that he \u201chad to\u201d kill blacks because they rape white women; computer records showed that he had researched \u201cblack on white\u201d crime and spent time on white supremacist sites. He said he chose Mother Emanuel because it was the South\u2019s oldest black church and he \u201cknew that would be a place to get a small amount of black people in one area.\u201d During the trial, prosecutors documented Roof\u2019s meticulous planning in the seven months leading up to the killings. Data collected from his GPS showed that he had made at least six trips to Charleston, visiting historic plantations and studying the church. He videotaped himself on several occasions taking target practice with his Glock in the back yard of his home. Photos showing Roof posing with the Confederate battle flag prompted South Carolina officials to remove the flag from the state capitol in Columbia. 1 of 10 ",

In 2012, he said the investigation revealed that there was probable cause to believe Mr. Obama\u2019s long-form birth certificate was a computer-generated forgery and that the selective service card completed by Mr. Obama in 1980 was likely a fraud. The facts say otherwise. Hawaii officials repeatedly confirmed Mr. Obama\u2019s citizenship, and the courts rebuffed a series of lawsuits. Arpaio insisted he wasn\u2019t investigating whether Mr. Obama was a U.S. citizen but examining an allegation that the document was fraudulent. But critics say it was a calculated swipe at the identity and legitimacy of the nation\u2019s first African-American president.

The sheriff said the posse would reimburse his office for the costs of the deputy\u2019s travel and time. At one time, Arpaio said the posse spent $40,000 in donations on the investigation.

Rick Perry is about to lead a critical agency that he once planned to abolish \u2014 if only he had remembered the department's name. But it's not so much his gaffe proposing the imminent demise of the Department of Energy that has scientists and policy experts worried. Instead it's what Perry, a vocal climate change skeptic, plans to do once he takes over. Perry staunchly rejects action to reduce carbon emissions. As recently as 2011 he said publicly that the \"science is not settled\" on whether man-made global warming is even real, claiming that a \" substantial number \" of scientists manipulated their data in a scheme to boost their funding. Play When Perry wanted to abolish the Energy Dept. 3:49 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161216102853if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/832426051560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> He is now set to join an administration flush with fellow cabinet picks who are openly hostile toward the concept of climate change, all with President-elect Donald Trump at the helm, who has called climate change a hoax orchestrated by the Chinese. Perry's appointment means the heads of the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department are all cozy with the oil and gas industry, a dynamic that will likely slant future energy policy toward that direction, said Kim Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It could mean a significant weakening of the climate change regulations and initiatives during the Obama administration that have started us on the path toward lowering our carbon emissions,\" Kimmell added. \"I'm not confident that Rick Perry is fully cognizant of the role that DOE plays in keeping our nuclear deterrent safe, secure and reliable\" Still, Perry has a mixed record that includes promoting clean energy options during his tenure as Texas governor \u2014 particularly when renewable energy was good for business. And he is credited for helping turn Texas into the largest wind producer in the country. This leaves some experts optimistic that those investments will continue to be a win-win for the economy as well as the environment. Related: Trump Announces Rick Perry as Pick for Energy Secretary \"Irrespective of whether Perry believes in the science of climate change, what he is going to find is that the science of economics will drive a lot of these energy investment decisions,\" said Alex Perera, global director of the World Resources Institute's Electricity Initiative. Perry also faces scrutiny for potential business conflicts. According to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission report , Perry pulled in $236,820 for his spot on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. It's not likely that Perry will take over the Department of Energy only to burn it to the ground. For one, a critical role of the department is to manage and maintain the U.S. nuclear stockpile. But therein lies Perry's biggest weakness, according to critics who are skeptical that he appreciates the full scope of his new role. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks during a news conference in Austin, Texas, on Feb. 24, 2016. Eric Gay / AP file Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, issued a statement that slammed Perry for being \"utterly unqualified\" for the job. \"I'm not confident that Rick Perry is fully cognizant of the role that DOE plays in keeping our nuclear deterrent safe, secure and reliable,\" Heinrich said. Perry has big shoes to fill in stacking up to the qualifications of his predecessor and overcoming his infamous \"oops\" moment from the 2011 debate where he forgot which federal agency he hoped to abolish. Outgoing Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz is a renowned nuclear physicist. By contrast, aside from the former Texas governor's two failed presidential runs, Perry's last gig was a stint on the reality competition show \"Dancing with the Stars.\" Amanda Sakuma ",

Trump at a \u201cthank you\u201d rally in West Allis, Wis., on Tuesday. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump on Thursday falsely stated that the United States government had waited until after the election \u201cto complain\u201d that Russia had hacked into American political organizations to interfere in the presidential race. But in doing so, he raised substantive questions about the Obama administration\u2019s slow response to a cyberattack that proved successful. In another of his provocative, early-morning posts on Twitter, Mr. Trump cast doubt on the government\u2019s conclusion that Russia had carried out the hacking with the approval of the highest levels of the Kremlin, suggesting instead that the finding was a case of postelection sour grapes by President Obama. \u201cWhy did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, ignoring the fact that the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., formally blamed Russia on Oct. 7 \u2014 a full month before Election Day \u2014 for the cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee and other organizations. In September, meeting privately in China with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Obama not only complained, the White House says, but warned him of consequences if the Russian activity did not halt. \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. The Twitter post was the latest move by the president-elect to accuse the intelligence agencies he will soon control of acting with a political agenda, and to dispute a well-documented conclusion that Moscow carried out a meticulously planned series of attacks and information releases devised to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. In the message, Mr. Trump again sought to dismiss the evidence of Russia\u2019s misdeeds as the unfounded complaints of sore losers casting about for reasons to reject the results of the election. But Mr. Trump also seized upon questions that have roiled the White House and the highest echelons of the Obama administration: Why did it take months after Russia\u2019s breaches had been discovered for Mr. Obama to publicly name Moscow as the culprit? And why did Mr. Obama opt not to openly retaliate, through sanctions or other measures? Advertisement Continue reading the main story White House officials say the warning to Mr. Putin at a September summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, constituted the primary American response. But when the administration decided to go public a month later with its conclusion that Russia was responsible, it did so in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security, not in a prominent presidential appearance. And there was no promise of economic sanctions against the individuals or organizations responsible. Officials said they worried that any more public response to the hacking would raise doubts about the integrity of the election, something that Mr. Trump was already seeking to do in campaign appearances in which he insisted that the election was \u201crigged.\u201d ",

    "text": "CBS News Dec 15, 2016 5:44 PM EST From the podium at the State Department on Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry compared the slaughter underway in Aleppo to the 1995 Srebrenica genocide . Using that vivid, symbolic imagery Kerry came as close as he\u2019s allowed to calling it ethnic cleansing. Without specifically naming the Iranian-backed Shiite militias believed to be carrying out door-to-door killings in a small pocket of besieged Aleppo, he referenced the \u201cunleashing of a sectarian passion\u201d to carry out \u201cnothing short of a massacre.\u201d He called for \u201csafe passage\u201d and \u201ccorridors of evacuation\u201d from this area, and for supplies of aid to be allowed in. He appealed for a halt to what he described as a slaughter of civilians, medical personnel, and aid workers by the \u201cAssad regime.\u201d Civilians still trapped as Syria ceasefire breaks down Kerry did mention his \u201cunderstanding\u201d that 1,000 people had been allowed out in buses and convoys to move toward the Turkish border. However, he said the U.S. has heard that a convoy of injured had been fired on the \u201cregime forces and allies.\u201d He also said he\u2019s tracking reports of men aged 18-40 who \u201cwent missing days or even weeks ago\u201d or being \u201cdetained or forced to fight\u201d when they\u2019re allowed to exit. Kerry acknowledged one positive development: Russia pledged to assist in the monitoring of evacuations and allow in the International Red Cross, Syrian Arab Crescent, Red Arab Crescent to help with the monitoring. Turkey also said it will accept more evacuees for aid and treatment. Thousands of civilians flee Aleppo Kerry \u2013 who has privately, repeatedly, and unsuccessfully advocated for the White House to back up his diplomacy with the use of limited military force \u2013 said talks were the best way forward from this point. He blamed Russia and those allied with the Assad regime for the past failures. All of the countries nominally backing the rebels are willing to negotiate \u2013 specifically he named Turkey and Qatar \u2013 but he said Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies have not been willing to live up to the international agreement for a political transition in Syria. He called for peace talks to start with the recognized political opposition.\u00a0 European and American diplomats tell CBS News that they estimate there are around 30,000 civilians trapped in this pocket of besieged Aleppo.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The 22-year-old man charged with killing nine black worshipers at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. faces two death penalty trials, a first in U.S. history. Jenny Jarvie Dylann Roof , the white supremacist charged with fatally shooting nine black\u00a0members of a Bible study class in South Carolina, stood stiffly in a federal courtroom Thursday as the jury forewoman\u00a0repeated eight words, over and over again: \u201cWe find the defendant, Dylann Storm Roof, guilty.\" After about\u00a0two hours of deliberation, the jury found Roof guilty of all 33 counts in the June 17, 2015, massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, including committing a hate crime against black victims, obstructing the exercise of religion\u00a0and using a firearm to commit murder. Roof, wearing a blue cable-knit sweater, stared blankly ahead as the verdicts were read, resting the tips of his forefingers on a wooden table and nervously twisting\u00a0his mouth. But the\u00a0verdicts\u00a0were not a surprise. Jurors had watched Roof confess in a taped FBI interview. They had heard from two survivors who identified him as the shooter. They had seen closed-circuit television\u00a0footage of him exiting the scene of the massacre with the murder weapon in his hand. After U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel\u00a0thanked the jury\u00a0of three blacks and nine whites, the family members of the victims, including survivors Felicia Sanders and Jennifer Pinckney, exited the court smiling. Republican Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley issued a statement saying, \"It is my hope that the survivors, the families, and the people of South Carolina can find some peace in the fact that justice has been served.\u201d\u00a0 The stage is now set for the punishment phase, scheduled to begin Jan. 3. In a rare move, Roof, a\u00a0high school dropout, has chosen to defend himself in the sentencing phase, when the jurors will decide whether to impose life in prison or death.\u00a0The move\u00a0effectively relegates defense attorney David Bruck\u00a0to a back seat for a critical part of the trial. Roof\u2019s case is the first in which the federal government has sought the death penalty under the 2009 Matthew\u00a0Shepard\u00a0and James\u00a0Byrd\u00a0Jr.\u00a0Hate Crimes Prevention Act. If the jury decides to impose the death penalty, Roof will be the first person in U.S. history sentenced to death in a federal hate-crimes trial. After presenting a mass of evidence,  prosecutors wrapped up their case earlier Thursday, arguing the jury had a simple task to hold the \u201ccold and calculated\u201d 22-year-old accountable for \u201cevery round he fired.\u201d \u201cA man of immense hatred walked that room shooting person after person after person,\u201d Asst. U.S. Atty. Nathan Williams told the jury. \u201cA man whose actions show him to be a person of tremendous cowardice, shooting them when they had their eyes closed, shooting them when they were in prayer.\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt in this case,\u201d Williams said\u00a0as he ran through charges that Roof committed hate crimes resulting in death. \u201cHe targeted those individuals because of their race.\u201d \u201cThey were praying. They were shot,\u201d he said as he outlined charges that Roof had engaged in the obstruction of the exercise of religion. \u201cThis is easy.\u201d Bruck\u00a0did not  dispute the government\u2019s evidence. \u00a0Instead, he urged jurors to dig deeper and look \u201cbeyond the surface\u201d in considering what motivated his client to commit the crime. \u201cReaching a conclusion about what these crimes were, and who committed them, is pretty straightforward,\u201d Bruck told the jury. \u201cThe issue in this case from the beginning has been, and it continues to be, why?\u201d Roof, the lawyer said, was \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cillogical,\u201d and full of \u201cmad energy.\u201d \u201cThere is something wrong with his perceptions,\u201d Bruck said. Repeatedly,  Gergel reprimanded Bruck for bringing up  Roof\u2019s mental state. The Department of Justice  brought 33 charges against Roof: 12 counts of committing a hate crime against black victims, 12 counts of obstructing the exercise of religion\u00a0and nine counts of using a firearm to commit murder. It is seeking the death penalty on the basis of Roof\u2019s \u201clack of remorse\u201d and his \u201canimosity towards African Americans.\u201d Prosecutors  spent six days methodically outlining their case against Roof, introducing a long procession of first responders, FBI\u00a0agents, expert witnesses and survivors of the massacre at Emanuel AME Church. \u00a0 ",

Chuck Burton/AP hide caption toggle caption Chuck Burton/AP North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, accompanied by his wife, Ann McCrory, speaks to supporters at a postelection rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Nov. 9. McCrory was not re-elected. Chuck Burton/AP The Republican-controlled North Carolina Legislature has introduced measures to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic governor. Roy Cooper, the state's current attorney general, beat current Republican Gov. Pat McCrory by a slim margin in the November election. McCrory initially refused to concede until a vote recount proved he had lost by about 10,000 votes. On Wednesday, the state Legislature met for a special session called by Republican lawmakers ostensibly to pass a disaster relief bill for Hurricane Matthew. But once the relief bill had been passed, the Legislature moved to introduce a slew of new laws which, if passed, would go to McCrory to sign. Ending 'Closest Governor's Race' In N.C. History, Pat McCrory Concedes The proposed laws strip the incoming governor of powers his predecessor held, including the power to appoint his Cabinet without legislative approval, the power to appoint trustees for the University of North Carolina and the power to oversee the state's election board. The five-member election board \u2014 which is currently controlled by the governor, who can appoint up to three members from his or her own party \u2014 would be reduced to four members, two from each party. Such a change could have ripple effects, since the state body appoints members to county election boards across the state. Three of North Carolina's county election boards faced a legal challenge in November after they attempted to revoke the voting rights of thousands of registered voters shortly before Election Day. A federal judge blocked the move . Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature and will continue to do so when the new session begins in January. If McCrory signs the bills, Cooper will wield significantly less power when he takes office. Article continues after sponsorship The Charlotte Observer reported on Cooper's response to the 11th-hour changes to the state's executive branch powers: \" 'Major changes in the way state government operates should be done deliberately, with input from all parties, particularly something as important as elections and making sure people have the opportunity to vote,' said Cooper. ... 'They shouldn't be pushed through in the dark of night.' ... \" 'It's time for them to go home,' he said. 'It's time for us to get ready for the long session,' the legislative session that starts next month.\" The special session of the Legislature also considered newly proposed bills to increase the maximum class size in North Carolina schools and make changes to a proposed highway project before the new administration takes over.

GOP lawmakers began debating a bill on Thursday that would severely cripple the state's executive office by requiring Senate confirmation for cabinet appointments, cutting the number of employees who work directly for the governor by 1,200 and eliminating the governor's power to pick certain university trustees. In a surprise move, the measure was introduced Wednesday during a special session ostensibly called by the General Assembly to consider relief for Hurricane Matthew victims. Lawmakers did indeed approve a $201 million aid package earlier in the day, but then moved onto a series of measures aimed at curbing the power of Cooper, who beat Republican incumbent Pat McCrory last month by about 10,000 votes. Related: N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory Concedes Election to Democrat Roy Cooper A separate bill introduced on Wednesday would also divide the members of county election boards \u2014 who are typically appointed by the governor \u2014 equally between the two parties, while requiring control of the state Board of Elections to alternate every other year. The legislation would give Republicans control of the chairmanship in even years , when major elections take place, and Democrats control in odd years. Another proposal introduced Wednesday would make the state Supreme Court election partisan by requiring candidates to be listed on the ballot alongside their political party. It's unclear how many of the measures will become law, if any do at all. But at a news conference Thursday, Cooper, who is currently the state attorney general, said his office was reviewing them anyway, adding that he would sue if lawmakers approved anything he deemed unconstitutional. \"Most people might think that this is a partisan power grab, but it is really more ominous,\" Cooper said at the news conference in Raleigh. \"This is about thwarting the governor's ability to move us forward on education and health care and clean air and water.\" The legislature's action came on the heels of a bitter and drawn-out gubernatorial race that saw McCrory's campaign and supporters raise multiple questions about the legitimacy of the election results \u2014 accusations his critics saw as an attempt to undermine the will of the voters. After filing complaints in about half of the state's 100 counties, which turned up no evidence of widespread voter fraud, McCrory conceded last week \u2014 a full month after voters cast their ballots.

Colchicine, foreground, and verapamil are potentially fatal when taken together. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) To determine how often area pharmacies would dispense potentially dangerous drug pairs without warning customers, the Tribune launched what would become the most extensive testing project of its kind. In all, 255 tests were conducted, most of them in Chicago or its suburbs. Five national chain pharmacies with a large presence in the Chicago area were tested \u2014 CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Costco \u2014 as well as local chains Jewel-Osco and Mariano's. Reporters also tested a randomly selected group of independent pharmacies. The five drug pairs used in the tests were chosen in consultation with national experts on drug interactions. The drug combinations In choosing the test pairs, the goal was to find combinations in which each drug had been on the market for many years, the drugs could cause serious harm when taken together, and the interactions should have been well-known to pharmacists. The Tribune selected five pairs with the help of two pharmacy professors who are leading experts in drug interactions: Daniel Malone of the University of Arizona and John Horn of the University of Washington. Three of the combinations were potentially fatal: the antibiotic clarithromycin and the cholesterol drug simvastatin; clarithromycin and ergotamine, a migraine medication; and the blood pressure drug verapamil and colchicine, used to treat gout. Another pair \u2014 the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the muscle relaxant tizanidine \u2014 could cause patients to pass out. The fifth pair was griseofulvin, an anti-fungal medication, and a hormone-based oral contraceptive sold under various brand and generic names. Taking griseofulvin can render the birth control pills ineffective and lead to unexpected pregnancy with a risk of birth defects. According to Malone and Horn, drug safety databases used by pharmacies rate each of the pairs chosen as a major, severe or contraindicated interaction, with the exception of the pair that includes the oral contraceptive. That interaction is classified as moderate by Micromedex but major by Medi-Span and severe by First Databank. The prescriptions Writing the prescriptions was Dr. Steven C. Fox, a Chicago physician licensed by the state of Illinois. He wrote the orders in the names of 18 Tribune journalists, 15 of whom conducted tests in the field. Those reporters presented the prescriptions written in their names or, in some instances, their colleagues' names. All prescriptions were for first-time medications as opposed to refills. The test locations The 255 tests were conducted from October 2015 to June 2016. Seven chains were tested 30 times each to limit chance results. No single location was tested more than once. Because fewer than 30 Kmart and Costco stores are in the Chicago area, reporters tested some of these stores in downstate Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. The newspaper also sought to test 30 Target stores but stopped after CVS acquired Target pharmacies during the study. Thirteen tests at Target were completed, and the results are included in the study's statistics. The Tribune chose 32 independent pharmacies for testing at random from a list of locations obtained from the state. All were in Chicago or suburban Cook County. Individual chain stores were not picked randomly, as stores within a large chain generally share the same computer systems and policies. Still, reporters attempted to select chain stores that represented a diverse cross-section of the area. Doing the tests The reporters presented each pharmacy with prescriptions for one of the five drug pairs. Each pair was tested the same number of times at each chain. Most prescriptions were dropped off at the same time; some were presented a couple of days apart. In some cases, the prescribing physician called in an order. Drug orders were not run through insurance. Reporters did not identify themselves as Tribune staffers but used their own names and answered all questions truthfully. The reporters typically waited at the pharmacy for the orders to be filled, taking notes about what transpired from the time they dropped off the prescriptions to when they picked up the medications. In many tests, conversation was extremely limited. Reporters' notes were then entered into standardized data collection forms. All purchased medications were cataloged and stored in a secure location. Reporting the results A pharmacy was considered to have failed the test if its staff did not either attempt to contact the doctor about a drug interaction or orally warn the tester. Information leaflets placed inside the bag or attached to the outside were not considered sufficient to warrant a pass. After the tests, the Tribune called many of the pharmacists to inform them of the results and discuss the findings. Some of their comments are included in the story. The Tribune is not identifying all of the individual stores in its article because each location was tested only once, a sample size too small to draw conclusions about a particular store.\u00a0 ",

Sports broadcaster Craig Sager died Thursday at age 65. (Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) 2830 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Craig Sager, NBA sideline reporter for Turner Sports, died Thursday, the network announced. Sager, 65, battled a rare form of\u00a0cancer for more than two years, undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy and other treatments. He worked 26 seasons as a sideline reporter for Turner Sports\u2019 NBA broadcasts\u00a0on TNT,\u00a0making a name for himself with his colorful suits and oft-stilted interviews with longtime San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich during TNT\u2019s NBA broadcasts. \u201cEven though he does what he does design- and fashion-wise, it\u2019s part of the shtick,\u201d Popovich told HBO\u2019s Real Sports. \u201cBut his questions are always sensible. They\u2019re answerable and he does it with fun. He does it with humor. I react to that very positively, so we have a good time together.\u201d Sager worked his first NBA Finals as a sideline reporter in June\u00a0as ESPN added him to its broadcast of Game 6. He FaceTimed with University of Pittsburgh running back and cancer survivor James Conner before the game. \u201cI lost 57 pounds and about 100 yards off my tee shot,\u201d Sager told Conner. Sager was originally diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in 2014, which forced him to miss 11 months of work. His sense of humor, however, didn\u2019t take a break. \"My favorite time of year \u2013 city to city, round by round, 40 games in 40 nights,\" Sager said in a statement in April 2014,\u00a0\"A dramatic turn has matched me with acute myeloid leukemia. From the sidelines to being sidelined, 40 veins and 40 electrolytes. Too bad, I had some probing questions for (Popovich).\u201d After chemotherapy and a bone transplant, Sager was in remission and returned to TNT\u2019s NBA broadcasts in March 2015. He also covered March Madness for Turner Sports that year. Just weeks after his return, Sager suffered a relapse. More chemotherapy therapy and a stem cell transplant again pushed his leukemia into remission. Like the bone marrow transplant, the stem cells were harvested from his son, Craig Sager Jr. The disease was again in remission before a reoccurrence, which Sager announced in March 2016. This time, he underwent a clinical trail and continued to work for Turner Sports. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been lucky all of my life,\u201d Sager Sr. told the USA TODAY Sports Network.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I was due for an unlucky situation.\" Share The sports world flooded social media with tributes to the longtime NBA sideline reporter. Sager, a native of Batavia, Ill., attended Northwestern University, where he was a walk-on on the school\u2019s football and baseball teams. He also served as the Northwestern\u2019s mascot, Willie the Wildcat, for three years. Sager was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame this week. \"Craig Sager was a beloved member of the Turner family for more than three decades and he has been a true inspiration to all of us,\"\u00a0David Levy, President of\u00a0Turner said in a statement. \"There will never be another Craig Sager. His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports. While he will be remembered fondly for his colorful attire and the TNT sideline interviews he conducted with NBA coaches and players, it\u2019s the determination, grace and will to live he displayed during his battle with cancer that will be his lasting impact. Our thoughts and prayers are with Craig\u2019s wife, Stacy, and the entire Sager family during this difficult time. We will forever be Sager Strong.\u201d Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich both wore colorful ties to honor Craig Sager NBA teams will be observing a moment of silence in Craig\u2019s memory. \u201cI -- along with the entire NBA family -- am deeply saddened by the passing of Craig Sager,\" Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"Craig was as vital to the NBA as the players and coaches.\u00a0A true original and an essential voice on Turner Sports\u2019 NBA coverage for 26 seasons, Craig chronicled some of the most memorable moments in league history and was a ubiquitous presence with his splashy suits and equally colorful personality.\u00a0Craig earned widespread respect for his insightful reporting and inspired so many most recently with his courage.\u00a0Our hearts go out to his wife, Stacy; his children, Kacy, Craig Jr., Krista, Riley and Ryan; and his friends and colleagues.\u201d The players association released a statement Thursday afternoon. \u201cCraig Sager was a one-of-a-kind reporter who embodied the spirit of the game of basketball in a truly colorful fashion.\u00a0Through his work, he was able to connect players, coaches and fans to the game we all love. \u00a0The passion and fight he displayed during his battle with cancer is an inspiration to us all.\u00a0Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Sager family at this extremely difficult time.\u201d Posted!

Arcan Cetin, accused of fatally shooting five people at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash., appears in court in September. (Brandy Shreve / Associated Press) Rick Anderson As bad as it was, the violence unleashed by a gunman this fall at a mall in Washington state\u00a0could have been substantially worse, police say, if fate and gun laws had not intervened. More than 30 moviegoers watching \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d in a Burlington mall theater could have been sitting targets had the suspect, a troubled, 20-year-old fast-food worker named Arcan Cetin, been able to buy other firearms that day and enter\u00a0though a theater exit door he had propped open with his cellphone in what police say was an ambush plan, newly released records show. The phone\u2019s placement brings to mind the bloodshed at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in\u00a02012 that left 12\u00a0dead and 70 wounded. Gunman James E. Holmes had propped open an exit door in order to retrieve firearms from his car. \u201cI suspect,\u201d said Burlington Police Det. Adrian Kuschnereit,\u00a0\u201cthat this theater room and the\u00a0people inside of it may have been a planned target for a shooting.\u201d But  because of\u00a0Cetin\u2019s strange behavior and reluctance to go through a background check, a gun store clerk refused to sell him a .45-caliber handgun hours before the suspect went to the mall.  And Cetin\u2019s cellphone, wedged in the theater exit door, was spotted by a moviegoer and removed. Cetin was able to kill five people at the mall, shooting them at close range inside a Macy\u2019s store before he ran out of ammunition. In interviews and hundreds of pages of police investigative documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times through a Public Records Act request, Cetin is portrayed as volatile, obsessed with guns\u00a0and the product of an unstable childhood. He expressed no remorse.\u00a0 After his cellphone was discovered at the theater, a\u00a0nervous Cetin, who had earlier bought a ticket to another movie, \u201cSnowden,\u201d\u00a0showed up in the lobby claiming he\u2019d lost his phone, according to court records. It was returned and he left. \u00a0 Rachel Marsh, right, and Selena Orozco, both 15, attend a prayer service after the mass shooting that left five dead at a mall in Burlington, Wash. Ted S.

Rachel Marsh, right, and Selena Orozco, both 15, attend a prayer service after the mass shooting that left five dead at a mall in Burlington, Wash. (Ted S. Warren / Associated Press) A half hour later, just before 7 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 23, security video showed Cetin entering another door at the Cascade Mall, carrying a semi-automatic Ruger .22 rifle that he had stolen from his stepfather\u2019s closet, according to authorities.\u00a0. Unlike Holmes, who carried out his rampage in Aurora swathed in black body armor, Cetin wore a T-shirt and shorts. Investigators say he\u00a0moved swiftly around the\u00a0Macy\u2019s cosmetics area, shooting and killing five victims at close range. In some cases, he stalked them as they crawled away and tried to hide behind clothes racks and sales counters. Then he shot them point-blank, police say. \u00a0 After the ammunition in his magazine-equipped rifle gave out, he casually set his empty weapon on a counter and joined others hurrying out of the mall, the documents say. \u00a0 Four victims were shoppers: Sarai Lara, a 16-year-old cancer survivor; \u00a0Belinda Sue Galde, 64, a probation officer; Wilton \u201cChuck\u201d Eagan, 61, a longtime Boeing worker; and 95-year-old Beatrice Dotson.\u00a0Also killed was Shayla Kathleen Martin, 52, a Macy\u2019s employee. The Turkish-born Cetin, whose social media web pages show him posed with assault-style weapons and feature photos of serial killer Ted Bundy, is being held on $2-million bail while prosecutors weigh\u00a0whether to seek the death penalty. (Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has suspended executions during the time he\u2019s in office, citing \u201ctoo many flaws\u201d in the judicial system.) According to a transcript of an interview with detectives, Cetin was asked what, theoretically, he would call someone who went into a store and killed five people. \u201cA murderer,\u201d he answered. \u201cOK, so what are you?\u201d a detective asked. \u201cA murderer.\u201d \u201cAre\u00a0you sorry at all?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer that,\u201d Cetin said. \u201cCold. Ice cold,\u201d said the detective. After the mall killings, Cetin drove his used Chevrolet Cavalier an hour south to Seattle, had a salmon dinner and spent the night in his car. When he woke up,\u00a0he read about himself on his cellphone\u00a0and saw his picture on Fox News. He drove back to his home in\u00a0Oak Harbor, where he was arrested. \u00a0\u00a0 Authorities say a surveillance video shows an armed Arcan Cetin at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash.. Washington State Patrol Authorities say a surveillance video shows an armed Arcan Cetin at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash.. Authorities say a surveillance video shows an armed Arcan Cetin at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash.. (Washington State Patrol) Documents reveal that just hours before the rampage at the mall,\u00a0Cetin played his favorite video game, \u201cCall to Duty: Black Ops III,\u201d which allows the gamer to assume the role of a futuristic cyborg soldier slaughtering his enemies. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI asked him,\u201d an investigator wrote, \u201cif killing these people [in Macy\u2019s] was similar to a video game\u2026. Cetin did not provide a response.\u201d Cetin\u2019s former girlfriend, who had earlier left the Burlington area, told investigators he\u00a0was\u00a0often angry and that she came to fear him. \u00a0He had assaulted his stepfather several times and once punched his mother in the face, according to court records.\u00a0 \u201cThe only person he talked to was me,\u201d the former girlfriend told investigators, adding Cetin would become jealous if she spent time with others. He failed to take his prescription to combat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, she told the investigators,  and aggravated his mood swings with excessive use of alcohol and marijuana. After she broke up with him following repeated bouts of rough sex, she moved near Tacoma. \u201cHe messaged me on Facebook,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand said he was going to come down here and rape me.\u201d The former girlfriend,\u00a0who worked at a Macy\u2019s near Tacoma, never worked at the Burlington store but had told him it was her favorite Macy\u2019s. Witnesses told police that the shooter shouted\u00a0a woman\u2019s name as he killed his victims, but the name has not been disclosed.\u00a0 Cetin, brought to the U.S. from Turkey by his mother and stepfather when he was 8, described himself to investigators\u00a0as a devout Sunni Muslim who prayed five times a day,\u00a0read the Koran and went by the nickname the Turk. On his social media sites, police discovered, Cetin had posted photos of Islamic\u00a0State \u00a0leader Abu Bakr Baghdadi and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\u00a0 ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story If the Trump administration withdraws from environmental, antitrust or financial regulations , the attorneys general say they will plug regulatory holes that may gape wide open, deploying state laws like New York\u2019s Martin Act, which allows the state attorney general to pursue wide-ranging investigations on Wall Street. They have pledged to defend undocumented immigrants, and to combat hate crimes that many believe were unleashed by Mr. Trump\u2019s polarizing campaign. Photo Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a former state attorney general, in Dallas in May. He has rallied crowds with the line, \u201cI go to the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.\u201d Credit LM Otero/Associated Press And if Mr. Trump\u2019s policies veer toward the unconstitutional, several of the 10 current and incoming Democratic attorneys general interviewed recently said they would apply a remedy favored by Mr. Trump himself: a lawsuit. The strategy could be as simple as mirroring the blueprint laid out by their Republican colleagues, who made something of a legal specialty of tormenting President Obama . Conservative attorneys general in states including Texas, Virginia and Florida have sued the Obama administration dozens of times, systematically battering Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care, environmental and immigration policies in the courts. One of them, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, who used his office to bayonet Mr. Obama\u2019s clean-energy regulations, was just chosen by Mr. Trump to become the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Schneiderman \u2014 who established himself early as a nuisance to Mr. Trump when he sued him over Trump University, negotiating a $25 million settlement \u2014 pounced on the Pruitt selection, calling him \u201can agent of the oil and gas industry\u201d and promising to push an E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt to uphold environmental laws. Ms. Healey has also expressed concern about the nominations of Mr. Pruitt and Mr. Tillerson. The jockeying to begin hostilities with the Trump administration is a measure of how the country\u2019s widening political divide has transformed the offices of state attorneys general into legal laboratories and sharpened them into political scalpels. They were once primarily local law enforcement figures who rarely pursued issues beyond state borders. But with the growth of their clout and ambition over the last three decades, they have become magnets for lobbyists, campaign donors and other corporate representatives looking to intervene in regulatory policy and tip investigations, a New York Times investigation found in 2014.

Liberal states later collaborated to force the E.P.A. under President George W. Bush to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, winning a Supreme Court decision that made it easier for the states to sue the federal government. It was under Mr. Obama that states came into their own as political activists. One group of Republican attorneys general began holding weekly conference calls to strategize ways to weaken the Affordable Care Act months before it became law in March 2010, filing their lawsuit minutes after Mr. Obama signed the bill.

Credit Margo Reed/The Philadelphia Inquirer, via Associated Press For the moment, the precise shape of Trump-branded targets is hard to make out. At the annual meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., two weeks ago, bipartisan bewilderment about the president-elect\u2019s true intentions abounded. (Republican state attorneys general will slightly outnumber Democrats in 2017.) \u201cPeople are coming up to me and saying, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019\u201d said James E. Tierney , a former attorney general of Maine, who ran a program studying attorneys general at Columbia Law School. Mr. Tierney, a Democrat, now lectures at Harvard Law School. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eye-rolling down here, in both parties, like, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d Even as attorneys general from blue strongholds like California, Massachusetts and New York hasten to brand themselves as leaders of the opposition, many of their Democratic colleagues are striking a less antagonistic note as they wait to see how Mr. Trump will govern. One incoming attorney general, T.J. Donovan of Vermont, said he was ready to collaborate with the federal government to tackle the heroin epidemic in his state, among other issues \u2014 and to dissent when necessary. \u201cLet\u2019s be patient and wait and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, let\u2019s be prepared.\u201d Mr. Schneiderman, it seems, is not straining to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt. Since Election Day, he said in an interview, he has spoken to several attorneys general about teaming up, as Democratic attorneys general have already done to defend Mr. Obama\u2019s clean-power plan against Republican legal challenges. \u201cLife just got a lot more exciting for those of us at the state level who are now the first line of defense,\u201d said Mr. Schneiderman, adapting a favorite catchphrase of Republican attorneys general. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Their litigiousness turned attorneys general like Greg Abbott, now the governor of Texas, into right-wing luminaries. He often rallied crowds by saying, \u201cI go to the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.\u201d Next year, there is likely to be no shortage of Democrats who can say the same about Mr. Trump. The states\u2019 rights arguments that Republicans have made gospel for nearly eight years \u2014 that states must serve as a check against federal overreach \u2014 are likely to become convenient for Democrats. So are the legal tactics that Republican attorneys general used to stifle Obama administration programs, including filing lawsuits in front of friendly local judges to win nationwide injunctions against policies they hoped to stop, said Amanda Frost, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. Graphic: 20 Things Donald Trump Said He Wanted to Get Rid of as President With Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension, attorneys general of both parties may shuck any remaining veneer of nonpartisanship, even as they continue to wade across party boundaries on investigations involving consumer protection or pharmaceutical pricing. According to Paul Nolette, a political-science professor at Marquette University, who studies attorneys general, Republican attorneys general filed partisan legal briefs in only five Supreme Court cases during the Clinton administration, a figure that rose to 97 in the first seven years of the Obama administration. \u201cThings are being driven more by partisan politics,\u201d Mr. Nolette said. \u201cOn virtually every hot-button issue you can imagine, A.G.s are signaling where they stand.\u201d As Mr. Abbott and Mr. Pruitt found, there are certain advantages to occupying a high-profile law enforcement office with an anti-Washington megaphone. Josh Shapiro, the incoming Democratic attorney general of Pennsylvania, said he had turned down a run for the Senate this year in favor of the attorney general race. \u201cI believe it to be the most impactful job in government today,\u201d he said. Other Democrats said they were watching how Mr. Trump would treat the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the Federal Trade Commission. Under Mr. Obama, attorneys general have grown used to working closely with both agencies on consumer and antitrust issues \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s been the golden years,\u201d said Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic attorney general of Iowa \u2014 and several said they feared federal regulatory might would shrivel under the new administration, leaving states to try to hold the line with far fewer resources.

    "text": "Lawyer claims link between ex-NY police chief and unsolved Long Island murders By Cristina Corbin Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Dec. 15: A woman, identified only as \"Leanne,\" 30, told reporters during a press conference that former Suffolk County Police Chief, James Burke, paid her for sex. \u00a0(FoxNews.com) The lawyer for the family of a prostitute whose body was found near a suspected serial killer's dumping ground claimed Thursday that a disgraced former New York police chief regularly hired women for rough sex in a home near the scene. Attorney John Ray held a press conference Thursday with a prostitute, identified only as \"Leanne,\" who claims she was paid to have sex with former Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke in 2011. The remains of four prostitutes, each covered in burlap and dumped in thick bramble on the south shore of Long Island, N.Y., along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, were discovered five years ago in a case that remains unsolved. Ray represents the family of Shannan Gilbert, a New Jersey escort whose body was found near the other women and whose death may also have been a homicide. Burke, who reportedly blocked the FBI from investigating key evidence in the murders, is currently serving time in federal prison in a separate case. Burke was sentenced to 46 months for beating up a man who stole sex toys and other items from his car and then later orchestrating a cover-up. Burke has not been named a suspect or person of interest in the Long Island serial murders. \"The allegations against my client don\u2019t warrant a comment,\" Burke's attorney, John Meringolo, told FoxNews.com Thursday.\u00a0 On Thursday, \"Leanne,\" told reporters she met Burke at a party in Oak Beach in June 2011. According to the woman, Burke paid her $400 for \"rough sex\" at the home, a few miles from where the murdered prostitutes were found. The woman claims Burke hired her again for sex two months later. According to an affidavit, the woman claims she observed Burke \"roughly pull a young woman by her hair to the ground\" at the party, which included cocaine. She said in sworn testimony that Burke was introduced to her as a \"a high police official.\" In August 2011, the woman said she met Burke for sex a second time in a bathroom at an undisclosed location. \"He insisted upon oral sex, which was given,\" the affidavit states. She described Burke as \"aggressive\" to reporters and said he called her a \"whore\" before throwing $300 or $400 in cash at her. \"I was a little dehumanized,\" she said. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the Long Island serial killer investigation told FoxNews.com last month that Burke was being eyed as a person of interest in the murders, though the FBI declined to comment on the case. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said federal investigators were questioning Burke's former girlfriends after learning he had a \"violent past.\" This is not the first time Burke -- once Suffolk County's top cop -- has been linked to prostitution. A 1995 internal affairs report by the Suffolk County Police Department shows Burke -- then a sergeant -- had a months-long relationship with a convicted prostitute and drug dealer named Lowrita Rickenbacker, according to Newsday,\u00a0 which obtained a copy of the report . The report claimed Burke once left Rickenbacker alone in his car with his gun belt and service weapon resting on the backseat. The report also said Burke engaged in a sexual act with Rickenbacker at least once inside his patrol car. Despite the report, Burke continued to rise through the ranks of the Suffolk County Police Department -- one of the highest paid police departments in the country. In 2000, Burke was promoted to lieutenant. In 2002, he was named chief of detectives by Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota and, in 2012, he became the Suffolk County police chief. It was the search for Shannan Gilbert that led to the discovery of four other women's remains -- the work of a suspected serial killer. Gilbert, 23, of Jersey City, N.J., disappeared May 1, 2010, after visiting a client in the gated community of Oak Beach on a barrier island off Long Island's south shore. On December 10, 2010, a police dog and his officer stumbled across the first set of remains. In the following days, police found three more women in varying states of decomposition. The women were identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes,\u00a0Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello. They were all sex workers in their 20s found stuffed inside burlap bags along Ocean Parkway, a 15-mile road that spans Jones Beach, roughly a mile from where they would later find Gilbert's body, in December 2011. After the discovery of Gilbert's remains, the medical examiner ruled her cause of death \"undetermined,\" and police theorized she drowned while running through a marsh in a drug-induced state -- calling her death unrelated to the four other victims. But that finding was called into question in March 2015, when Dr. Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, and a Fox News contributor, examined Gilbert's skeletal remains inside a Nassau County funeral home at the request of her family.\u00a0 Baden observed the hyoid bone -- a small horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck -- had a \"rough edge\" on one side, suggesting a fracture. A fracture to the hyoid bone is a hallmark sign of a strangulation. \"The hyoid shows some breakage,\" Baden said at the time. \"If it is a fracture, that would be strong evidence Ms. Gilbert was strangled to death by neck compression.\" FoxNews.com's\u00a0Robert Gearty contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Driver Charged in Deadly Chattanooga Bus Crash to Appear Before Grand Jury By Morgan Winsor Dec 15, 2016, 1:22 PM ET 0 Shares Chattanooga Police Department via AP WATCH Toxicology Test Results Released on Chattanooga Bus Driver 0 Shares Email The driver charged in connection with a deadly Tennessee school bus crash that killed six children will appear before a grand jury. After a lengthy preliminary hearing this morning in Hamilton County General Sessions Court, Judge Lila Statom sent Johnthony Walker\u2019s charges of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving to the grand jury, who will ultimately decide on an indictment. While making her decision, Statom said she found probable cause for formal charges. The defendant, who is currently in custody, will remain in prison on a $107,500 bond pending the grand jury\u2019s decision. Police say Walker was carrying 37 students from Woodmore Elementary School in Chattanooga on the bus he was driving when it crashed on Nov. 21 at around 3:20 p.m., killing six young children and injuring several others. Two children remained hospitalized as of today, according to police. The investigation into the crash is ongoing. Walker was arrested hours after the incident and charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, as well as reckless endangerment and reckless driving. A sixth vehicular homicide charge will be added for the child who died in the hospital days after the crash, according to The Associated Press. Walker\u2019s attorney, Amanda Dunn, has said she expects her client to plead not guilty if indicted. Grieving Parents, Students Speak About Fatal School Bus Crash in Chattanooga Families of the young victims sat in the Hamilton County courtroom today as witnesses, including two officers with the Chattanooga Police Department\u2019s traffic division, were called for testimony. Officer Joe Warren, who was on scene the day of the deadly crash, said Walker was estimated to be traveling around 50 mph on Talley Road when the crash happened and there\u2019s no evidence that he applied the brakes while the bus was overcorrecting, based on \"side-slip\" tire marks that investigators found on the road. The narrow, curvy street is a residential area with a speed limit of 30 mph, according to police. Warren said video footage from the vehicle shows Walker using his cellphone on the bus. The officer did not specify at what point Walker was using the phone and did not say if he was texting or talking. The defense attorney argued that the footage shows her client using his phone for a couple minutes while the bus was stationary as a child disembarked. Walker put the device down when he started driving again, Dunn said. She also argued that the same video footage shows Walker trying to help at least two children out of the bus after the crash.

Craig Sager accepts the Jimmy V Perseverance Award during the 2016 ESPYS in Los Angeles in July. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images) By Matt Crossman December 15 at 3:58 PM Craig Sager, a television sportscaster whose outlandish outfits, decades interviewing the biggest names in basketball and public fight with cancer made him a beloved personality in the National Basketball Association, has died, within days of his induction into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame on Dec. 13. He was 65. His death was announced by Turner Sports, where he worked as a broadcaster. Other details, including the date and place of his death, were not immediately available. Mr. Sager, who covered NBA games for TNT for 26 years, was diagnosed in 2014 with acute myeloid leukemia. He missed 11 months while undergoing treatment, and his absence from the cable network turned the already popular figure into a sympathetic and inspiring one. In an April 2016 cover story , Sports Illustrated called Mr. Sager \u201cperhaps the most revered figure in the league.\u201d Known mostly for his work on the NBA sidelines, Mr. Sager also traveled the world to cover the Olympics, World Cup soccer, the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament, the Super Bowl and the World Series, among other sporting events. His flair for the dramatic was a hallmark of his earliest professional appearances. Craig Sager in 2015. (David Banks/Associated Press) When he was 22 and working for $95 a week at a radio station in Sarasota, Fla., Mr. Sager talked his boss into letting him cover an Atlanta Braves baseball game on April 8, 1974. After Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run to break Babe Ruth\u2019s career record that night, Mr. Sager ran onto the field and was at home plate by the time Aaron arrived. As he interviewed Aaron and family members on the field, Mr. Sager wrote at BleacherReport.com, \u201cThe TV people were yelling at me to get out of the shot because when they cut to Hank, I was right there with him.\u201d He remained conspicuous after that, not the least for his deliberately awful choice in clothing. Mr. Sager understood his role was to entertain, and what he called his \u201clively\u201d wardrobe served that purpose. He wore loud ties and louder jackets. He was often the target of teasing from players and coaches, who compared him, in no particular order, to a pimp, a Christmas ornament and an ice cream man. He rarely, if ever, wore the same outfit twice. He said a reporter once counted the sport coats in his house and stopped at 137 without even checking all of his closets. For big events, Mr. Sager picked out especially wild ensembles \u2014 the suit he wore for the Sports Illustrated cover was a vivid turquoise. \u201cSports are supposed to be fun, and so I have fun with the way I dress,\u201d Mr. Sager told BleacherReport.com. \u201cI used to get reprimanded, but then at the 2002 All-Star Game, Commissioner [David] Stern was making fun of me, and then his wife says, \u2018David, stop that. I like those suits.\u2019 And once I won the commissioner\u2019s wife over, it all changed. It was a huge breakout moment.\u201d Jalen Rose, who played in the NBA for 13 years and is now an analyst for ESPN, said in an interview that Mr. Sager was highly respected among players because underneath his garish get-ups was a reporter who spent hours on the phone and at the arena digging for information. 1 of 71 Remembering those who have died this year. Caption Remembering those who have died this year. Craig Sager Craig Sager, a television sportscaster whose outlandish outfits, decades interviewing the biggest names in basketball and public fight with cancer made him a beloved personality in the National Basketball Association, has died, within days of his induction into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame on Dec. 13. He was 65. Read the Sager obituary Kevin Winter/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. When Rose was drafted as the 13th pick in 1994 by the Denver Nuggets, he was disappointed because he expected to be chosen earlier. During their first interview, Mr. Sager asked about his frustration, without sugarcoating the issue. \u201cHe\u2019s really knowledgeable about the sport and diligent in getting his job done,\u201d Rose said, adding that NBA players viewed getting interviewed by Mr. Sager as a sign they had arrived in the big time. Craig Graham Sager was born in Batavia, Ill., on June 29, 1951. He told Sports Illustrated that he got his joie de vivre from his mother, who was once arrested at one of his high school basketball games for going onto the court to complain about the referees. Whatever his high school skills, Mr. Sager was unsuccessful in making the football and basketball teams when he entered Northwestern University. He settled instead for a job as the team\u2019s mascot, Willie the Wildcat. He lived the mascot persona even when it was not game time, often carrying a small trampoline in the trunk of his car. \u201cI\u2019d go to bars and get hammered and take it out and show off, do these flips,\u201d he once told The Washington Post. He moved to Florida after graduating in 1973, working at times as a bouncer and sailing instructor to flesh out his meager radio salary. Eventually, he switched to sports broadcasting and landed at CNN in the early 1980s when the cable network was in its infancy. He spent the rest of his career at sister networks owned by Turner Broadcasting, later part of Time Warner. Mr. Sager owned a large collection of sports memorabilia, including a piece of horse dung that he took from the stall of Seattle Slew, winner of the Triple Crown in 1977. To obtain it, Mr. Sager said he slept the night before the race in a neighboring stall at the invitation of Seattle Slew\u2019s trainer after the two of them spent the evening drinking vodka tonics and Budweiser. He also owned a bra from Morganna, the infamous and pneumatic \u201ckissing bandit\u201d who ran onto baseball fields to kiss players. She gave it to him because he bailed her out of jail after she was arrested for running onto the field during the 1979 Major League Baseball All-Star game. His first marriage, to Lisa Gabel, ended in divorce. In 2001, he married Stacy Strebel, a former dancer for the Chicago Bulls. Besides his wife, survivors include three children from his first marriage and two children from his second. Mr. Sager received stem cell transplants from a son, Craig Sager Jr., and returned to work in 2015. But the cancer returned, too. Mr. Sager often flew from Houston, where he was undergoing treatment, to whichever game he was assigned to cover, all while living in Atlanta. Because of network broadcasting contracts, Mr. Sager never covered the NBA Finals for TNT. ESPN agreed to let him work the 2016 finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers. John Ourand, who covers the media for Sports Business Journal, said the \u201cunheard of\u201d decision by ESPN to put Mr. Sager on the air while he was still working for TNT revealed the respect in which he was held in the broadcasting industry and in the NBA. Throughout his career on the sidelines, Mr. Sager often interviewed Gregg Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 gruff head coach, who usually bridled at reporters\u2019 questions. The two were friends off-camera, but Popovich seemed to take particular joy in jousting with Mr. Sager on the air. Once, when Mr. Sager asked Popovich to explain his team\u2019s defensive success, the coach responded that the opponent was probably distracted by Mr. Sager\u2019s hideous black suit with white specks. When Mr. Sager returned to work after his cancer treatment, he interviewed Popovich in December 2015. Popovich dropped his tough-guy act, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got to honestly tell you, this is the first time I\u2019ve enjoyed doing this ridiculous interview that we\u2019re required to do,\u201d before Mr. Sager could ask a question. Popovich hugged Mr. Sager, then said, \u201cNow ask me a couple of inane questions.\u201d ",

Ryan Zinke Discusses America's Role as a Global Leader 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump made official today that he intends to nominate Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a retired Navy SEAL, for the Cabinet position of secretary of the interior. \"He has built one of the strongest track records on championing regulatory relief, forest management, responsible energy development and public land issues,\" Trump said in a statement today. \"As a former Navy SEAL, he has incredible leadership skills and an attitude of doing whatever it takes to win. America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he is going to help keep it that way with smart management of our federal lands.\" Trump added that \"my administration's goal is to repeal bad regulations and use our natural resources to create jobs and wealth for the American people, and Ryan will explore every possibility for how we can safely and responsibly do that.\" Trump's Children Playing Prominent Role in Transition Zinke said in the statement that he was \"honored and humbled\" to be chosen. \"I will work tirelessly to ensure our public lands are managed and preserved in a way that benefits everyone for generations to come,\" he said. \"Most important, our sovereign Indian nations and territories must have the respect and freedom they deserve.\" Zinke, 55, is the sole Montana representative in the U.S. House. First elected in 2014 and re-elected last month, he serves on the House Committee on Natural Resources. He was an original co-sponsor of legislation to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which President Barack Obama vetoed last year. Zinke has been an advocate for the Montana coal industry and has been critical of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce carbon pollution from power plants but, Zinke argues , kills jobs and raises costs for Montanans. Trump and Zinke met at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. ABC News reported Wednesday that Donald Trump Jr. had a hand in the selection of Zinke for interior secretary. Senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News on Tuesday night that Trump offered the position to Zinke that day. \"Today the president-elect offered the spot to Congressman Zinke,\" she said. \"It was a very competitive process and wonderful candidates.\" The Department of the Interior is charged with protecting federal land, including natural resources and national parks and wildlife refuges. If confirmed by the Senate, Zinke will be the first interior secretary from Montana. 0 Shares ",

By Amber Phillips December 15 at 4:33 PM Follow byamberphillips North Carolina's Democratic governor-elect Roy Cooper says Republican lawmakers are trying to hinder his work by moving to strip powers from his office. (Reuters) This post has been updated with the latest news. Democrats won the fight for North Carolina\u2019s governor\u2019s mansion this fall \u2014 but they\u2019re now in a knockdown, drag-out brawl with the Republican-controlled legislature about who actually gets to pull the levers of power. In the waning hours of their hold on North Carolina\u2019s executive branch, Republicans this week unveiled and quickly pushed through bills that would significantly curb Gov.-elect Roy Cooper's (D) power. Republicans held a last-minute special session Thursday and moved bills that\u00a0would, among other things, require the governor\u2019s Cabinet appointments to be approved by the state Senate and effectively give Republicans control of the Board of Elections during election years. Other bills appeared to limit Democrats\u2019 influence in the courts, like making North Carolina just one of several states that holds partisan elections for its state Supreme Court justices. Beleaguered Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is still in charge for a few more weeks and could\u00a0sign the bills into law on his way out the door, though he hasn't said whether he will. Which means all Democrats can do is watch. \u201cAmerican democracy may be more fragile than we realized,\u201d warned longtime U.S. Rep. David Price (D-N.C.) in a statement. Cooper held a press conference Thursday where he described legislature\u2019s efforts as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and urged them to \u201cgo home.\u201d \u201cThis is about thwarting the governor\u2019s ability to move us forward,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cMost people might think that this is a partisan power grab. But this is more ominous.\u201d What Democrats call a concerted power grab, Republicans frame as a constitutional check and balance. House Rules Chairman David Lewis (R) told local reporters the legislature wants to \u201cestablish that we are going to continue to be a relevant party in governing this state.\u201d Yes, he allowed, the fact they'll have a Democratic governor next year is speeding things along. But Republican leaders maintain these reforms were long overdue. Adding to Democrats' dismay is the fact many were caught by surprise. At the request of McCrory, GOP legislative leaders convened a special session this week to approve $200 million of disaster recovery aid for Hurricane Matthew and wildfires. There had been rumors for weeks Republicans would use the time to pack the state Supreme Court with GOP appointees, but that never came to fruition. But as the special session for hurricane relief aid was coming to a close Wednesday, GOP lawmakers suddenly convened another immediately on top of it. They wouldn't say what it was for until the bills that would curtail Cooper\u2019s power dropped. Urged on by Democratic lawmakers, several hundred people packed the capitol in Raleigh on Thursday to express their concern that hurricane relief was being used as a sham to play politics. Things got particularly ugly during a NAACP press conference, when one of the group\u2019s attorneys spotted the director of the state Republican Party in the crowd and welcomed him by saying: \u201cI know this is the first meeting he\u2019s been in in the last two or three days that wasn\u2019t composed of all white people.\u201d Democrats are having some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The last time GOP lawmakers called a high-profile special session, in March, they ended up ramming through one of the state's most controversial laws in recent memory, a bill limiting what public bathrooms transgender people can use and municipalities' ability to pass anti-discrimination laws for LGBT people. A national backlash to that bill helped contribute to McCrory's upset. (He conceded earlier this month, but not before controversially calling the election into question by attempting to claim widespread voter fraud.) The state legislature is indeed acting within its rights, said UNC constitutional law professor Michael Gerhardt. But he said it is potentially concerning that lawmakers are powering through these changes such a blatantly political way: A Republican legislature is convening a special session to pass bills that limit an incoming Democratic governor's power. What's happening now doesn't bode well for relations between the two branches, relations that were already expected to be contentious. Cooper ousted McCrory by some 10,000 votes out of more than 4 million cast, and Republicans in the state legislature have a supermajority capable of vetoing Cooper anytime they want. \u201cThe concern for a lot of people is we have a legislature intent on keeping the score politically,\u201d Gerhardt said. North Carolina\u2019s politics could be taking its cue from Washington. President Obama's legacy has been stymied in the courts, thanks to lawsuits brought by more than two dozen GOP state attorneys general and sometimes even Congress itself. \u201cThey look at what happened at the federal level and think 'Maybe we need to do it at the state level,\u201d Gerhardt said. But, much like Washington, whether you think what\u2019s happening in North Carolina is right or wrong probably depends on your politics. Gerhardt added: \u201cIf you're a 'big D Democrat,' [this] worries you. If you're a 'big R Republican,' maybe it worries you, maybe it doesn't.\u201d politics ",

    "text": "Craig Sager, on the sidelines of the 2016 NBA Finals. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Craig Sager, on the sidelines of the 2016 NBA Finals. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images NBA sideline reporter Craig Sager, a broadcaster nearly as famous for his wardrobe as for his basketball knowledge, has died at the age of 65. Sager had been very public about his diagnosis of leukemia. \"There will never be another Craig Sager,\" David Levy, president of Turner Broadcasting, said in a tweeted statement . \"His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports.\" \u2014 TurnerSportsPR (@TurnerSportsPR) December 15, 2016 The network also posted a video on Facebook commemorating Sager's career. Sager spent two decades covering pro basketball on TNT, work that earned him an induction into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. And during his time on the sidelines, Sager had no problem standing out. Argyle, paisley, floral, seersucker \u2014 name any pattern of fabric, and Sager wore a suit made from it. \"That's always been a badge of honor for Craig,\" says his TNT colleague Ernie Johnson. \"You say, 'You can't possibly wear that.' It's like, 'Hey thanks, you couldn't have said anything nicer to me.' \" Article continues after sponsorship Sager had charisma and unmatched rapport with players. Even when players like future Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett stopped live interviews to insult his brightly colored suits \u2014 \"take this outfit home and burn it,\" Garnett once told him \u2014 Sager was capable of turning those moments into compelling television. In the world of basketball, Sager's name towers nearly as high as LeBron James'. He was among the first to interview Kobe Bryant at the NBA draft in 1996. He joked with Shaquille O'Neal on the sidelines at All-Star games. And LA Clippers point guard Chris Paul always made time for Sager \u2014 even after tough losses. \"When you see Craig, you pep up,\" Paul said once. \"Because you know that he has the same respect for you that you have for him.\" Doris Burke, a sideline reporter with ESPN, shares that admiration. \"There's a saying in basketball: Game recognize game. There's a reason Craig Sager is beloved, and it's the beauty and the magic of what Craig Sager does,\" Burke says. Sager's career started in April 1974, when he was a 22-year-old from Batavia, Ill., who rushed to an Atlanta Braves baseball game. Hall of Famer Hank Aaron was one hit away from breaking Babe Ruth's untouchable home run record, and Sager wanted to cover it for his AM radio station. Sports Reporter Stands Out From The Sidelines He didn't have press credentials, and his boss had threatened to fire him if he showed up late the next day. But Sager went anyway. Somehow, he wound up in the third base photographer's pit on that historic night \u2014 just as Aaron went to bat in front of a roaring crowd. It was one of the biggest moments in baseball history, and Sager did the unthinkable: He got his tape recorder, jumped onto the field and chased after Aaron. It's a dogged determination that never left Sager, even after he switched to basketball and spent decades on NBA sidelines. And those outlandish suits? Well, as Sager told Weekend Edition Sunday host Rachel Martin in 2012, he never minded the ribbing he would get from Garnett and others. He had another audience in mind. \"Some people maybe think it's too outlandish, but I have fun,\" he said. \"I buy it all myself. I pick it all out myself. I once in a while get some help from my 7-year-old daughter. Some people might not like it; my 7-year-old, she likes it.\" ",

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014 In 2009, a life-threatening rash attacked Becki Conway after she took two drugs a doctor prescribed to her. She came down with a potentially deadly condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the eyes and skin. In 2009, a life-threatening rash attacked Becki Conway after she took two drugs a doctor prescribed to her. She came down with a potentially deadly condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the eyes and skin. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014) Karisa King and Sam Roe Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Dangerous doses: First Becki had a sore throat and cough. Then a rash. Soon, her skin peeled off in sheets. The first symptoms mimicked the flu. Becki Conway had a sore throat, a dry cough and irritated sinuses. But the next signs were more puzzling. A sharp pain radiated through her chest. Her eyes turned red and itchy. It seemed like she was fighting off some strange bug, or maybe it was just the normal exhaustion of keeping up with twin toddlers. Then the scalding rash began. Red spots popped up on Conway's face and neck. The next day, painful sores appeared in her mouth and then her throat. Within hours Conway was in a hospital bed, watching with alarm as the rash spread across her torso, arms and face. The red dots turned into blisters that welted so quickly it looked like her skin was burning from the inside out. No treatment could stop it. Within a day or two she wasn't recognizable. Eventually, the rash covered her eyelids with blisters and attacked the lining of her lungs. Her skin peeled off in sheets. Drug interaction Provided by Becki Conway After Becki Conway took\u00a0a risky pairing of prescription medications, her\u00a0skin erupted in blisters. Less than three days after the potentially lethal rash began, the Michigan woman's face was covered in sores and her skin began to peel. After Becki Conway took\u00a0a risky pairing of prescription medications, her\u00a0skin erupted in blisters. Less than three days after the potentially lethal rash began, the Michigan woman's face was covered in sores and her skin began to peel. (Provided by Becki Conway) Only after it was too late to stop the rash did anyone figure out that Conway had taken a potentially dangerous mix of medications that can trigger the immune system to attack the body's own cells. Drug interactions in which one drug alters the effect of another are a hidden epidemic in America, a decadeslong threat to public health that has been barely acknowledged, let alone addressed. Many interactions involve relatively safe drugs that become dangerous only when taken at the same time. Hundreds of risky combinations involve common antibiotics, blood thinners, antidepressants, cholesterol drugs and medicine to treat migraines, heart problems and high blood pressure. The tragedy is that much of the harm is preventable. The particular drug interaction that hospitalized Conway was identified years ago. But experts estimate that thousands of patients still become sick every year from drug interactions because of errors and neglect by front-line providers of medical care. The result in such cases: Victims and their families are left with few answers, and the underlying safety failures go uncorrected. The doctor who prescribed Conway's medications did not heed a black box warning about a fatal rash that could result from the drug pairing, according to medical and legal records and interviews. The pharmacy that dispensed the medicine did not call her attention to the danger. And as her symptoms rapidly worsened, a string of doctors and nurses missed the connection to the drug combination. Most patients rely on their doctors to protect them, but studies show that prescribers often are unaware of harmful drug combinations or trust that pharmacists have more expertise. Pharmacists, in turn, tend to respect the discretion of doctors. For pharmacists, warning patients about the risky mixing of drugs is one of the major responsibilities of the profession, according to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. Yet when injured patients sue, pharmacies often take the legal position that they have no duty to do so. Pharmacies and hospitals use computer programs to screen for unsafe drug pairs. But those systems trigger so many alerts about potential drug interactions \u2014 including many that pose little risk to patients \u2014 that doctors and pharmacists frequently ignore them. Research has found that some pharmacists are more likely to approve dangerous mixes of prescriptions while working busy shifts. When drug interactions hurt patients, the Food and Drug Administration along with most state medical and pharmacy boards do not require doctors and pharmacists to report cases. Pharmacists and doctors rarely face sanctions unless patients take the initiative to complain, according to the national pharmacy group. \"When you look at it from every conceivable aspect, the system is badly broken,\" said Philip Hansten, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Washington who has studied drug interactions for nearly 50 years. \"It's really disheartening to see people are still dying from interactions we've known about for decades.\" Victim of dangerous drug mix tells her story Becki Conway developed a potentially lethal skin rash known as\u00a0Stevens-Johnson syndrome\u00a0while taking two medications, Lamictal and Depakote, that a doctor prescribed to her. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Becki Conway developed a potentially lethal skin rash known as\u00a0Stevens-Johnson syndrome\u00a0while taking two medications, Lamictal and Depakote, that a doctor prescribed to her. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) See more videos Dozens of legal complaints reviewed by the Tribune described how patients became sick or died from a toxic mix of drugs that was mishandled in nearly every health care setting, from family practice offices and corner pharmacies to specialty clinics, hospitals, emergency rooms and nursing homes. One physician prescribed the cholesterol drug simvastatin to a patient in north suburban Niles who was already taking ketoconazole and cyclosporine because of a kidney transplant years earlier. The potentially lethal mix led to a toxic buildup of the heart medication and left the man\u00a0too sick to walk and requiring hospital care, according to a lawsuit that was later settled. In North Carolina, the state pharmacy board found that a CVS pharmacist had ignored computer safety warnings about combining allopurinol for gout and the kidney transplant drug azathioprine. The 49-year-old woman who took the medications together for weeks grew increasingly ill as her bone marrow failed to produce enough blood cells, leaving her hospitalized, according to pharmacy board and medical records. The interactions don't always set off a toxic reaction. In many cases, one drug makes the other drug ineffective, leaving patients vulnerable to the effects of HIV, cancer and other serious ailments. When Becki Conway sought help, trusted health care providers failed her at nearly every turn, leaving her in a fight for her life. A case of anxiety At 37, Conway was a high-energy mother of five children ranging in age from 2-year-old twin boys to a 17-year-old son. The summer of 2009 was one of the most hectic periods in her life. She and her husband were working full time, installing a new roof on their two-story brick home in central Michigan and preparing to open a pizzeria in a month. Their twins were not yet potty-trained. Making matters worse, Conway was battling an ex-boyfriend in a child custody dispute and had been feeling extremely anxious. She found herself lashing out at her husband and shouting at the kids. Conway worked at Sparrow Urgent Care in the town of Mason, registering patients as they arrived at the clinic. She decided to seek help from a doctor she was friendly with, Thomas Bellinger. The two met for 15 minutes in a break room where employees often chatted, drank coffee and ate lunch, according to interviews and documents in a later court case. Conway mostly talked about her family history, childhood abuse and previous medications. She told Bellinger she had taken medicine for depression years earlier but hadn't taken anything since. He told her he empathized with her and promised to bring her a book on bipolar disorder. Bellinger had practiced family and emergency medicine since receiving his medical degree in 1985 from Michigan State University. He worked at several hospitals and urgent care clinics in Michigan before taking a job at the Sparrow clinic. Minutes after their consultation, Bellinger approached Conway at her desk and handed her two prescriptions: one for Lamictal, the other for Depakote, according to medical records and her legal deposition. Both drugs are used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Lamictal carries the FDA's strongest label, a \"black box\" warning, which highlights the potential danger of combining Lamictal and Depakote. (Chicago Tribune staff) Research on the ability of doctors to identify harmful drug pairs shows that although many physicians consider the issue when they write prescriptions, their specific knowledge about drug interactions is generally poor. In one 2008 study, researchers asked 950 prescribers to classify various drug combinations by severity of risk.\u00a0More than a third of the prescribers answered \u201cnot sure\u201d for half of those pairs.\u00a0For three of the four highest-risk combinations, less than 25 percent of the prescribers correctly recognized that the drugs should not be taken together. Training on specific drug interactions in medical schools is lacking because of time constraints and the vast number of hazardous combinations, said Dr. Alfred George, chair of the pharmacology department at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. Doctors also are not required to demonstrate knowledge of drug interactions to state licensing boards or when seeking hospital credentials, he said. \"New drugs are hitting the market every day, and clinicians rarely have time to read all the literature on the drugs they prescribe,\" George said. Adding to the problem, no list of medications automatically follows patients from one medical provider to another. One physician may not know what another doctor has prescribed. The label for Lamictal warns that the drug's concentration level in the body more than doubles when taken with Depakote. To lower the risk of a deadly reaction, the label advises doctors to decrease the normal starting dose of Lamictal by half when it is combined with Depakote. Physicians may read such warnings but make prescribing decisions at their own discretion. Bellinger gave Conway a prescription for the full initial dose of Lamictal.

This is a story about prescription drugs, the beating of our hearts, cells from hamsters and the promise of big data. How the Chicago Tribune and a team of scientists tackled a serious problem in public health. See more videos In depositions, Bellinger said his diagnosis of bipolar disorder was based on multiple conversations with Conway over a period of months and that his prescriptions were in line with successful treatment plans for other patients. He said he was familiar with the black box warning but assessing the combined risk of the two drugs was difficult because Lamictal also can cause a dangerous skin rash when taken alone. Citing language on the drug label, Bellinger said the extent to which Depakote potentially increases the risk is unclear. He believed the possible risk posed by giving Conway the full dose of Lamictal was outweighed by the danger of giving her a dose that was too low to relieve her symptoms. In her deposition, Conway said Bellinger made a prediction as he handed over the prescriptions: She would feel better by the next day. No warnings Conway faxed the prescriptions to her usual pharmacy at Sparrow Hospital in nearby Lansing, part of the same health system as the urgent care clinic. Her husband, Tim Conway, worked there transporting patients and picked up her prescriptions the next day. No one at the pharmacy called his attention to the potentially lethal drug pair, he said in an interview. No one mentioned that the dose of Lamictal exceeded the guidelines for taking it with Depakote. And no one talked to him about a rash. \"There were no special warnings \u2014 nothing,\" he said. Pharmacists serve as the last line of defense against bad drug combinations. Those who see a potentially unsafe pairing can ask questions of the patient, consult with the physician and ultimately withhold the medications. \"If a patient has a significant drug interaction that the pharmacist should've been aware of and didn't catch, then their license could be affected,\" said Carmen Catizone, executive director of the pharmacy group. Yet pharmacists who are busy, distracted or inundated with alerts may fail to intercept potential drug interactions. Sophisticated software systems automatically screen prescriptions for risky drug combinations and alert pharmacists about the danger. But more than a decade of research shows those systems fail to fully protect patients. The safety checks produce a flood of alerts about a range of potential dangers, including drug interactions that cause only minor side effects. Pharmacists must contend with so many alerts that they can become desensitized to even the most serious warnings and dismiss them. One study found that pharmacists overrode more than 90 percent of alerts, including warnings about some risky drug interactions. Heavy workloads for pharmacists also pose a threat. A 2007 study by University of Arizona researchers found that the risk of dispensing two drugs that could interact rose about 3 percent for each additional prescription filled by a pharmacist in an average hour. The pharmacist who filled Conway's prescriptions, Ryan Hamelin, later testified in a deposition that he handled as many as 80 orders on a busy shift. He signed off on her medications at 6:51 a.m., nine minutes before his overnight shift ended. When a technician entered the two prescriptions into a pharmacy computer, a red screen appeared with a warning that required a pharmacist's review, Hamelin said. The alert noted a potential overlap between the medications, which are both used to treat the same illnesses, but it did not call attention to the drug interaction, he said. Hamelin, who had received his doctor of pharmacy degree a year earlier, said he had seen such drugs paired together previously. He also said he was aware of the drug interaction and the black box warning on Lamictal. But it seemed to him that the doctor had used some discretion when writing the prescriptions, as Bellinger had prescribed initial doses that increased over time. Hamelin trusted the prescriber's judgment, he said. Hamelin said he did not see a need to warn Conway personally about the drug pair. Package inserts that advise patients about drug risks typically satisfy a pharmacist's obligation to warn about such dangers, he said. Hamelin approved the scripts and left work. 'This is not right' That day, Conway began taking the two drugs. She felt better almost immediately. But two weeks later, she felt a tickle in her throat and pain inside her ears. She had a cough and bloodshot eyes. Then she woke up with her eyes matted shut with thick gunk. Conway went to work early to get medication for what she assumed was pinkeye. At the urgent care clinic, Conway told the medical staff about taking Lamictal and Depakote, according to her deposition. She described her symptoms, including chest pains she suffered for a day or so before the episodes stopped. No one realized that the seemingly unconnected symptoms foretold an agonizing condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome in which the immune system attacks the patient's skin and mucous membranes. The cells in the lining of Conway's eyes, mouth and lungs were self-destructing. It was as if some switch in her body had been flipped and nothing could shut it off. An anxious mom sought help from a doctor. He prescribed two drugs that may increase\u00a0the risk of a deadly rash when combined. Soon she was fighting for her life. Exactly how the disease develops is not fully understood, but it is most often triggered by medications. Numerous drugs including Lamictal have been linked to the condition when taken on their own. There is no cure; the best treatment is to stop taking the drugs that caused it. Had Conway's condition been diagnosed, she would ideally have been sent to a hospital burn unit, which is best suited to treat the massive loss of skin as the disease progresses, said Jean McCawley, director of the Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation, a patient advocacy group. Instead, Conway's chest pains became the main concern. A doctor at the clinic ordered X-rays and an electrocardiogram to test for possible heart problems. Both showed normal results. To be cautious, Conway was sent by ambulance to nearby Sparrow Hospital for more comprehensive heart tests, medical records show. Legally blind E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014 Becki Conway can use a tablet if she magnifies the text and holds it close to her face. She often chats online with a network of other survivors of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Becki Conway can use a tablet if she magnifies the text and holds it close to her face. She often chats online with a network of other survivors of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014) Conway told the hospital intake nurse that she was taking Lamictal and Depakote. Because Conway's eyes were too inflamed for her to see, the nurse pulled the pill bottles from Conway's purse and noted the medications in a hospital record. The second round of heart tests showed no abnormalities, and Conway was released from the hospital with a suspected strained chest muscle, records show. Her husband came to the emergency room to take her home. After receiving her discharge papers, Conway went to a bathroom to change out of her hospital gown. She glanced at herself in the mirror before getting dressed. On her way out, she caught another glimpse and stopped to stare. Bright red spots had popped up on her face and neck. It looked like someone had thrown red pepper on her. Conway flagged down a nurse and pointed to her face. \"This is not right,\" Conway said, according to her deposition. \"Wow,\" the nurse said. The nurse retrieved a doctor, who examined Conway. But no one connected the outbreak to the two new medications she had reported to nurses and doctors twice that day. The nurse gave Conway a shot of Benadryl and sent her home. Deadly diagnosis Spotting the signs of a dangerous mix of medications can be critical to saving a patient's life. But because the interactions often cause common symptoms, such as low blood pressure or confusion, health care providers can easily miss the clues. \"Drug interactions hurt and kill like nobody has any idea,\" said David Juurlink, head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. Juurlink has treated patients who arrived at the emergency room after taking an antibiotic with certain types of blood pressure medication, which can cause a deadly spike in the level of potassium in the blood. Such a death likely would be attributed to heart disease and old age instead of a drug interaction, he said. After Conway got the Benadryl shot she went home and went to sleep. She woke up at 4 a.m. with painful blisters in her mouth. Her skin rash was turning into red welts. Conway drove herself to the clinic where she worked and was examined by Dr. Kellie Donahue. The doctor asked Conway about her symptoms and any medication she had been taking. When Conway told her about the Lamictal and Depakote, Donahue stopped taking notes and looked up at her. \"I think you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome,\" she said, according to Conway's deposition. Donahue, the first medical professional to notice the dangerous drug mix, explained to Conway that she was suffering from a serious skin rash caused by medications. But even Donahue didn't realize how severe the rash would become. After telling Conway to stop taking the drugs, which Conway had done when the chest pains began, Donahue gave her a steroid shot and sent her home. Conway took a short nap and woke up with blisters spreading into her throat. She called Donahue, who instructed her to go to the hospital immediately. Her first night in the hospital, Conway sat up in bed until dawn researching Stevens-Johnson syndrome on her laptop computer. She'd never heard of the disease. The more she learned, the more alarmed she became. She discovered that, in its most extreme form, many victims die. The biggest risks stem from infections. Drug interactions hurt and kill like nobody has any idea. \u2014 David Juurlink, head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto In the next days, Conway's blisters spread and erupted. Swallowing food was too painful. She couldn't stop coughing and complained that she was struggling to breathe. Her skin began to peel off in sheets, leaving angry patches of exposed flesh that turned black and bloody. Worried about infection, her husband laid down a trail of towels so she didn't have to walk to the bathroom on the hospital floor. He spent the nights at her bedside in a chair. He didn't know what to tell the kids, especially the three youngest. He didn't want them to visit their mother \u2014 her wounds looked too gruesome. He did not disclose his biggest fear, that she might not come home. Conway sporadically roused herself from a stupor of morphine, but mostly she was in too much pain to speak or open her eyes. On Conway's 10th day at the hospital, nurse Kathy Sandoval was assigned to treat her. The nurse had treated one other Stevens-Johnson victim years earlier, but when she walked into the room, she had never seen anything that compared to how Conway looked that day, Sandoval recalled in an interview. From head to toe, only patches of skin could be seen. \"It was red, open, exposed,\" Sandoval said. \"She wasn't gushing blood, but there was blood everywhere.\" Sandoval was afraid to touch Conway. \"She looked like she'd been in a fire,\" Sandoval said. Intensive care Tim Conway Becki Conway was transferred to an intensive care unit for burn victims at the University of Michigan Medical Center after several days of fighting Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Her husband, Tim, took photos to share with family members, who were not allowed to visit her because of the high risk of infection she faced.

Her husband, Tim, took photos to share with family members, who were not allowed to visit her because of the high risk of infection she faced. (Tim Conway) She knew how lethal the condition could be and worried that the sloughing tissue in Conway's lungs and throat might block her airway. Sandoval hovered over Conway's bed watching for signs of distress. That night, at Sandoval's insistence, Conway was transferred in unstable condition from Sparrow to an intensive care burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center, records show. At that point, about 70 percent of Conway's skin had blistered or\u00a0peeled off. She could barely communicate. The next day, an ophthalmologist tried to examine the damage in her eyes, but Conway was in too much pain to cooperate. In the doctor's notes from that day, he wrote that Conway told him she didn't expect to survive. Fighting to live Medical records document the flurry of activity that surrounded Conway at the Ann Arbor hospital. Nurses checked her vital signs at regular intervals. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. The wound care was constant. Every hour, nurses pried open her eyelids to apply drops of medicine. \"They're just trying to keep the patient alive at that point,\" said McCawley of the Stevens-Johnson advocacy group. \"Patients are usually monitored 24/7 with the most intensive care they can give them. ... The reaction has to run its course.\" On Conway's third day at the hospital, her condition improved slightly. She was able to sit up on her own and was taken off contact isolation, which meant that staff no longer had to wear gowns and gloves to enter her room. Over the next few days, the rash stopped spreading and parts of her skin began to grow back. In an attempt to save her eyesight, doctors grafted amniotic membrane onto her eyes to help them heal. She continued to gain strength and looked better. Medication was more effective in easing her extreme pain. The lesions on her face were clearing. Doctors removed her feeding tube and she was able to swallow soft food. Kathy Sandoval Carolyn Van Houten / Chicago Tribune 2015 Nurse Kathy Sandoval, who was assigned to treat Becki Conway at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., said she had never seen anything that compared to the severe skin trauma that Conway suffered. Sandoval insisted that Conway be transferred to an intensive care burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center.

Sandoval insisted that Conway be transferred to an intensive care burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center. (Carolyn Van Houten / Chicago Tribune 2015) After nearly three weeks, Conway returned home with her eyes stitched shut so they could heal from surgery. Wounds were still red and visible on her face and neck. Her twins were too scared of her appearance to sit on her lap, so her husband turned off the lights in the living room and they sat with her on the couch. She held their hands in the dark, tracing the outlines of their small fingers. Unable to see, she learned to distinguish the boys by the shape of their fingernails. Conway spent the next two months unable to open her eyes and later received training on how to walk with the help of a long white cane. In the years since, she has slowly regained her strength, taking long walks and working on home repair projects with her husband. But the trauma left Conway legally blind. In her left eye she can see only shadows and light. By holding a computer tablet close to her right eye and magnifying the text, she can read in limited amounts. She can't drive a car or watch the kids at sports events or read a paperback book. She also suffers stabbing pains in her eyes from nerve damage, leaving her unable to get out of bed on her worst days. She must frequently apply medicated eyedrops because her tear ducts were destroyed. She fights a constant cough caused by her lung injuries. The family now lives in Florida where the high humidity provides some relief for her eyes. Living with the effects E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune Because of the eye trauma she suffered, Becki Conway can\u2019t drive a car or watch her children at sports events or read a paperback book. Her eyes here appear yellow because a doctor just used drops to dilate her pupils.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Conway said her approach to taking medication has changed. \"The general public trusts that what their doctors give them is OK,\" she said. \"They don't question it, but they should question it \u2014 every time.\" In 2012, Conway filed a lawsuit against Bellinger and Sparrow Health System that was settled in 2014 under confidential terms. She and her husband talked about her ordeal in several interviews but declined to disclose the names of the defendants, whom the Tribune identified through court records. Her attorney, Andrea Dalton, said she has handled more than a dozen lawsuits for other patients, many of them children, who suffered from Stevens-Johnson syndrome after taking the same drug combination as Conway. The cases fit a pattern of errors, Dalton said. \"It starts with a hospital or physician error, then there's a pharmacy error and diagnostic errors, and that becomes the perfect storm,\" she said. \"At the end of this is someone who has to live with it for the rest of their life.\" Surviving E.

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2014) Citing a confidentiality agreement, Bellinger's attorney declined to comment on the case. An attorney for Sparrow Health System said Hamelin, the pharmacist, turned down requests for interviews. The health system released a brief statement saying: \"Sparrow cannot discuss specifics of this case due to the nature of the settlement agreement. But the safety and security of patients is always our top priority.\" Bellinger stopped prescribing the two drugs together after Conway became ill, he said in a deposition. It wasn't worth the risk, he decided. The case did not appear to change anything for Hamelin, the pharmacist who handled the prescriptions. He testified he would not have a problem filling the same order again. ",

    "text": "Levy\u2019s statement did not say when or where Sager died. He had a third bone marrow transplant at the end of August in Houston to fight an aggressive form of leukemia. Sager\u2019s son, Craig II, reacted to his father\u2019s death on Twitter: Sager, who worked basketball games for TNT for nearly a quarter-century, revealed in March 2016 that his leukemia was no longer in remission. He said doctors told him the typical prognosis was three to six months to live, but \u201cI am receiving the best treatment in the world and I remain fully confident I will win this battle.\u201d After Sager\u2019s death was announced on Thursday, TNT released a tribute video on social media: \u2014 NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) December 15, 2016 Sager first announced in April 2014 that he had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, and he missed the playoffs and much of the following season as he underwent two bone marrow transplants. His battle with cancer brought out the soft side of Gregg Popovich, the prickly San Antonio Spurs coach with whom he had many memorable exchanges during in-game interviews. Sager sported suits in every color of the rainbow and plenty of shades not found in nature, from teal to fuchsia to magenta. He would match plaid blazers with paisley ties or striped shirts - all in bold hues. Kevin Garnett once told him to burn an entire outfit. In a 2016 interview with HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports,\u201d Sager recalled how Popovich reproached him for trying to stand out. Sager explained to him: \u201cCoach, you don\u2019t understand. If I\u2019m not wearing bright colors and if I don\u2019t feel lively, it\u2019s not me.\u201d Sometimes lost in the glare of his wardrobe was Sager\u2019s relentless nature as a reporter. Every time Popovich would give a terse non-answer, an unfazed Sager would pepper him with another question. During the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Popovich described Sager as \u201can iconic figure in the NBA.\u201d \u201cHe does a great job,\u201d the coach added. \u201cHis sense of humor is obvious. We have a lot of fun going back and forth with that.\u201d Sager\u2019s persistence was on display at the start of his career, when the 22-year-old found himself in the middle of one of the most famous moments in sports history. Making $95 a week in 1974 as the news director at WSPB - a Braves-affiliated AM radio station in Sarasota, Florida - Sager risked getting fired by deciding to hop a flight to Atlanta for a game with Hank Aaron a home run away from breaking Babe Ruth\u2019s career record. With a last-minute credential, Sager was stuck in the third-base photographers\u2019 well. As the historic homer sailed out of the park, Sager, without thinking, sprinted onto the field and wound up chasing Aaron down the third-base line. When Aaron\u2019s teammates mobbed him at home plate, Sager can be seen in his trench coat in the middle of the scrum. The next day, Sager caught a 5 a.m. flight to Sarasota to be back in time for his morning drive responsibilities, and his tapes from the game wound up in Cooperstown. During his career, Sager would work as a reporter on the Olympics, Major League Baseball playoffs, NFL and NCAA Tournament, among other sports. But he was indelibly connected to the NBA. \u201cCraig was as vital to the NBA as the players and coaches,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cA true original and an essential voice on Turner Sports\u2019 NBA coverage for 26 seasons, Craig chronicled some of the most memorable moments in league history and was a ubiquitous presence with his splashy suits and equally colorful personality. Craig earned widespread respect for his insightful reporting and inspired so many most recently with his courage.\u201d His popularity around the sport was evident as he went through his cancer treatments. Earlier this year, Sager was involved in the television coverage of the NCAA Final Four and had a memorable postgame interview with Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Boeheim told Sager on-air after the Orange lost in the national semifinals. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you and what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re a fighter and that\u2019s something we all should really aspire to be. You\u2019re setting an example that we all should be really happy to try to follow.\u201d Sager replied, \u201cWell, thank you very much.\u201d And then the professional broadcaster did what professional broadcasters do - he went to his next question, one about Syracuse\u2019s famed 2-3 zone, without missing a beat. Basketball world rallies around veteran NBA reporter in leukemia fight Sager got to cover his first NBA Finals in 2016 through an unusual arrangement between TNT and ESPN, which invited him to join its coverage. He marked the occasion by wearing a blazer with a royal blue floral print. In an interview with LeBron James after Game 6, the Cavaliers star turned the tables to giddily ask Sager a question: \u201cHow in the hell do you go 30-plus years without getting a Finals game?\u201d Bulls star Dwyane Wade also sold paisley ties during the 2016 playoffs to raise money to combat blood cancers. He reacted to Sager\u2019s death in a video on Instagram: A video posted by dwyanewade (@dwyanewade) on Dec 15, 2016 at 1:50pm PST Last season, Sager called the support he received from Silver, coaches, players and fans \u201chumbling.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been very uplifting, very therapeutic,\u201d he said. And Sager loved everything about his job. \u201cI try to get there three hours before the game, talk with the ushers and the security guards, the coaches and the fans,\u201d Sager said in 2015. A native of Batavia, Illinois, Sager attended Northwestern, where he walked onto the football and basketball teams and served as the school\u2019s \u201cWillie the Wildcat\u201d mascot for three years. He worked at several TV and radio stations in Florida after college before spending two years in Kansas City. Sager joined CNN in 1981 after handling the network\u2019s first live remote report during the 1980 baseball playoffs. Sager was in Dallas for a game in April 2014 when he felt ill and sought treatment from Mavericks team physician Dr. Tarek O. Souryal, who had previously performed Sager\u2019s knee surgery. With a dangerously low hemoglobin count, Sager had six blood transfusions over a 24-hour period before returning to Atlanta. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

I\u2019m Runa, the Director of Information Security for the Newsroom at The New York Times. What questions do you have about information security and how to protect yourself online? Please submit your questions in advance and we\u2019ll answer some of them during tomorrow\u2019s chat. Nicole Perlroth Reporter, The New York Times 9:04 PM ET Hi, I\u2019m Nicole and I cover all things cybersecurity and hacking for The Times. I\u2019m looking forward to your questions and hearing about how you have dealt with your issues around data protection. Runa Sandvik Director of Information Security, The New York Times 1:57 PM ET Hi everyone - we\u2019ll be starting our chat shortly. Nicole is unfortunately running late, but we\u2019re looking forward to answering your questions! M Reader, United Kingdom 2:00 PM ET Should I buy a 2FA token or continue using my mobile phone to secure my account? How would you describe to my tech-illiterate relatives the importance of securing their email accounts? Runa Sandvik Director of Information Security, The New York Times 2:00 PM ET Marc - I usually say that not securing an online account is like not having a lock on your front door. The better the lock, the harder it is to get in. Describing the importance of security to others is all about figuring out what matters most to them; sometimes it\u2019s more about access to content and not so much encryption and security and privacy. A Reader, Netherlands 2:01 PM ET Besides a firewall and anti-virus software, do you recommend encrypting a harddrive as an extra measure against cyber crime? Runa Sandvik Director of Information Security, The New York Times 2:02 PM ET Andrew - that\u2019s a great question! Encrypting your hard drive will protect data stored locally on the drive if the computer is ever lost, stolen or seized. To protect data you have stored in the cloud, I recommend that you consider good passwords and two-factor authentication where possible. CK Reader, Berkeley, CA 2:03 PM ET Without giving away too much, can you tell us what security protections NY Times reporters take in their communications? Especially with sources. Runa Sandvik Director of Information Security, The New York Times 2:03 PM ET Charles - earlier today we launched a tips page with secure communication channels for sources. This page (https://nytimes.com/tips) tells sources how to reach us on Signal, WhatsApp, SecureDrop, via encrypted email and postal mail. In short, we are familiar with and frequently use various secure communication tools to ensure that we protect our communications, data, and sources. R Reader, Philadelphia, PA 2:10 PM ET I am one of the unfortunate yahoo users. To update \u201csecurity\u201d they are asking for my phone number and another email.  Isnt this just foolish to give to the site?  What else can I do?  What happens if you shut down an account (which I have never tried to do) Runa Sandvik Director of Information Security, The New York Times 2:10 PM ET Rosie - I\u2019m sorry to hear you were affected by the Yahoo breach! If you\u2019re not confident that the provider can protect the additional information it is now asking for, you may want to consider other providers. The provider will still have all the contents you\u2019ve given up so far, but at the very least you won\u2019t give up more going forward. J ",

By Steven Mufson and Max Ehrenfreund December 15 at 7:08 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @MaxEhrenfreund Conservative television commentator Larry Kudlow is a leading candidate to become chair President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, which is usually run by one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious economists. Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and an adviser to Trump, told a Lansing, Mich. business group Thursday that Kudlow would be named to the post, though Moore later added the nomination \u201cisn\u2019t a done deal,\u201d according to the Detroit News . A person close to the transition told The Post that Trump is trying to find a space for Kudlow, a Trump friend and loyal adviser during the campaign, in an economic advisory role. If selected, Kudlow would mark another un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox pick for Trump. Under both Republican and Democratic presidents, the council has provided expert economic advice to the president and attracts a staff of top-flight young economists. But Kudlow lacks a graduate or undergraduate degree in economics and has not written scholarly papers on the subject. A fervent supporter of deep tax cuts, Kudlow is a senior contributor at CNBC and former host of the cable channel\u2019s primetime \u201cThe Kudlow Report.\u201d While continuing with his broadcasts, he informally advised Trump during the campaign. Like Moore, Kudlow disagrees with Trump about trade and opposes protectionism, but shares the president-elect\u2019s desire to slash tax rates for businesses. \u201cHe should have hammered much harder on his tax cuts,\u201d Kudlow said of Trump\u2019s performance in one of the debates with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s been the Kudlow theory of debates for a long time that no matter what you are asked you give the answer you want to give on the subject you want. Trump needs to learn more about that.\u201d Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far A graduate of the University of Rochester, where he joined the left wing Students for a Democratic Society and majored in history, Kudlow worked as a junior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, then as chief economist first at Paine Webber and later at Bear Stearns. He became associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan. A star in the conservative fermament, Kudlow later advised Jack Kemp and toyed with the idea of running for the Senate. But his career was derailed two decades ago by alcohol and drug addiction, and he took a long leave of absence starting in late 1992 to attend a twice-daily program to help addicts. In recent years, he has become a popular figure on television, but his record as an economic forecaster is full of potholes. Less than nine months before the economic crisis hit in 2008, Kudlow wrote in the National Review that \u201cThere\u2019s no recession coming. The pessimistas were wrong. It\u2019s not going to happen. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that\u2019s a minimum). Goldilocks is alive and well. The Bush boom is alive and well... Yes, it\u2019s still the greatest story never told.\u201d Earlier, in 2005, he made fun of people worried about inflated housing prices, calling them \u201cbubbleheads.\u201d Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet John Glidden Jr., a friend of Kudlow\u2019s since middle school, said that \u201cLarry, most of his life, was a very high-strung individual, very bright.\u201d He added that Kudlow \u201calways wanted to be involved, always wanted to be in the right circles.\u201d In high school at the Englewood School for Boys in New Jersey, Glidden and Kudlow were friends and rivals. Glidden described Kudlow as a civil but \u201cdogged\u201d partner in speech and debate, who could argue liberal and conservative cases with equal cogency. In their senior year, the two played a match for the top slot on the school\u2019s tennis team. Kudlow won. Both boys\u2019 fathers were prominent Republicans in Englewood, successful men who expected success from their sons as well. \u201cI\u2019m the same way,\u201d said Glidden, now a senior vice president at Gates Capital and the mayor of the borough of Closter, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s something we had in common. I think it\u2019s something that was instilled in us, the way we were both brought up.\u201d In the high-rolling and hard-partying atmosphere of Wall Street, Glidden suggested, Kudlow\u2019s desire to be in the middle of action might have led him into addiction. Yet Glidden said his friend has been sober for about two decades and that his experience in finance would make up for his lack of economic training. \u201cHe licked it. I\u2019m proud of him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do a good job. He\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\u201d Kudlow has linked the economy\u2019s performance to moral values, and he has blamed inequality on poor broken families. \u201cIf we stick with what I call first principles, which is morality and ethics, some spiritual guideline which was present at the creation with the founders . . . then this country is unstoppable,\u201d Kudlow wrote in a 1998 book title \u201cAmerican Abundance: The New Economic and Moral Prosperity. \u201cWe are the city on the hill.\u201d Some economists were shocked by the possibility of Kudlow\u2019s appointment, news of which came the same day Obama\u2019s Council of Economic advisers issued its annual report. Created by the Employment Act of 1946, the council last year marked its 70th anniversary, noting its \u201cdistinctive role\u201d in \u201capplying economic theory and empirical research to the often-novel situations in which policymakers find themselves.\u201d The past chairs have included Harvard professor Martin Feldstein, who served under Reagan; Columbia business school dean Glenn Hubbard, who served under President George W. Bush; University of California, Berkeley professor Christina D. Romer, and later Federal Reserve chiefs Benjamin S. Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan. Kudlow, by comparison, has not done any comparable research, though he is much more famous by dint of his television career. William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economic professor and a member of President Carter\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said \u201csince President-elect Trump apparently doesn\u2019t listen to the professionals at intelligence agencies, why should he listen to professional economists?\u201d business ",

    "text": "Obama administration on defense over fall of Aleppo Published               December 15, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Obama administration is finding itself back on the defensive over its Syria policy as Aleppo falls to Bashar Assad\u2019s government and civilians are evacuated, an operation preceded by desperate pleas from the city\u2019s battered residents and reports of atrocities against them. Ambulances reportedly were carrying out the first groups of wounded and other residents on Thursday, under a cease-fire deal that would seal a rebel pullout from what had been their stronghold in the eastern part of the city. Outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters Thursday he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the cease-fire arrangements as well as the start of convoys moving out of the city. But he also cited a report that a convoy of injured people were fired upon, and reports that Syrian men are being detained or conscripted at checkpoints. He condemned \u201cinexcusable attacks\u201d on civilians and humanitarian personnel, calling for an \u201cimmediate and verifiable, durable cessation of hostilities.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to do our part\u201d to push all parties toward \u201cresolution,\u201d Kerry said. At the same time, Kerry noted that if Aleppo falls completely, it will be harder to bring the parties around and will not end the war. He put the onus on Damascus and its allies in Moscow to pursue peace. Within minutes, State Department spokesman John Kirby took the podium and was peppered with tough questions about how the administration sees any political transition or deal playing out at this stage.\u00a0 Asked whether the U.S. is prepared to take action beyond talks, Kirby said it was determined that military options will not \u201cget us to the end we seek,\u201d while insisting the U.S. is \u201cleading\u201d and acting on behalf of the Syrian people. He conceded diplomacy has fallen short so far.\u00a0 In a feisty exchange at the White House press briefing a day earlier, Press Secretary Josh Earnest also was pressed repeatedly by reporters on the U.S. government\u2019s policy. President Obama famously drew a \u201cred line\u201d with Syria in 2012 over the use of chemical weapons and then opted not to enforce it after evidence surfaced the line was crossed. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive to somehow suggest that the United States government and the world is not doing anything,\u201d Earnest said Wednesday. He defended using diplomatic efforts rather than military force to seek an end to the fighting. \u00a0 \u201cI think the Assad regime has demonstrated that they\u2019ve crossed all the lines in pursuit of their goals,\u201d Earnest said, adding he didn\u2019t know what kind of \u201csick mind\u201d comes up with the strategy Russia and Assad are pursing. \u201cThose goals apparently include depraved tactics like trying to starve innocent civilians into submission, bombing hospitals and playgrounds, targeting them,\u201d he said. Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, blasted Earnest\u2019s comments. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he can stand here and make a statement like that,\u201d Keane said Thursday on Fox News. Keane said Obama had the right to respond militarily after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people but \u201cwas paralyzed by the fear of adverse consequence [that] could happen from that.\u201d But, Keane added, \u201cThere\u2019s consequences from doing nothing.\u201d Kirby also faced tough questions earlier this week from a reporter who pressed him on why the U.S. did not go beyond diplomatic calls to help civilians stranded in the Syrian city. \u201cYou\u2019ve failed repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again, which is a combination of trying to bring together people in some sort of talks with, sort of, imperfect cease-fire and then when things go badly you get really angry \u2026 and then nothing ever changes,\u201d the reporter charged. Kirby said Kerry stressed the need for an immediate end to civilian deaths in Aleppo. He also blamed Shia fighters for violating a truce secured Tuesday but broken hours later. At the annual Saban Forum on Sunday, Kerry admitted the administration\u2019s failure to enforce the red line threat had \u201ccost\u201d the U.S. \u201csignificantly\u201d in the Middle East in terms of a damaged reputation. But Kerry insisted it was Congress that dropped the ball and not Obama, by not formally authorizing military force. \"People have interpreted it as his decision not to when, in fact, he never made a decision not to bomb,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cHe made the decision to bomb. He simply decided he had to go to Congress because David Cameron lost the vote in the parliament on a Thursday, and on Friday, President Obama felt \u2026 he would go [to Congress] and get the decision. Well, the decision wasn\u2019t forthcoming, and in the meantime, I got a deal with Lavrov to get all of the chemical weapons out of the country.\" The deal with Lavrov was cast as reducing the pressure on the West to intervene in Syria. But as Russia subsequently increased its involvement in the war, Assad\u2019s hold on power strengthened. The war became increasingly complicated as the United States turned its attention toward targeting Islamic State forces, following a largely ineffective effort to arm moderate rebels. In some circles, any large-scale intervention in Syria was seen as a losing campaign. By punting to Congress, Obama simply avoided the entanglement. But some lawmakers insisted all along there were middle-ground options that could have reduced the bloodshed in Syria. \u201cIt did not have to be this way,\u201d Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement. \u201cBut this is the inevitable result of hollow words and inaction, red lines crossed without consequences, tarnished moral influence, \u2018leading from behind,\u2019 and a total lack of American leadership.\u201d They said \u201cthe name Aleppo will echo through history, like Srebrenica and Rwanda, as a testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame,\u201d while predicting the Assad regime will use the cease-fire to \u201creset its war machine and prepare to slaughter its way to victory across the rest of the country.\u201d Despite the criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s lack of action, it\u2019s unclear what President-elect Trump plans to do. Aleppo\u2019s fall to Syrian government forces could be his first major test of how he plans to approach Russia, with which he has sought friendlier ties. Trump\u2019s pick of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has extensive businesses dealings with Russia and ties to President Vladimir Putin, has fueled speculation. Currently, the situation in Aleppo is fluid. According to Reuters, the International Committee of the Red Cross said the evacuation of 200 wounded people had begun. Russia, an ally of Assad, claimed 5,000 Syrian rebels and family members had been brought out of eastern Aleppo, though those claims could not be confirmed. The evacuations come after two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian army, aided by Russian air power and Shi\u2019ite militias, in a part of the city held by rebels for four years.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

The president-elect speaks during a meeting Wednesday in New York with technology executives. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Dawn had barely broken Thursday when Donald Trump once\u00a0again broadcast\u00a0via Twitter a provably false claim: that the Obama administration had not raised an alarm about Russian interference in the presidential election until after Hillary Clinton \u2019s defeat. In fact, on Oct. 7, the administration issued an official statement accusing the Russians of being behind the cyberattacks that appear to have harmed Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cOnly Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the administration statement said at the time.\u00a0 Nor was the issue a surprise to Trump.\u00a0He had\u00a0publicly called on\u00a0the Russians in July to find and release Clinton\u2019s emails. He\u00a0talked in September about accusations of Russian hacking and commented on them during the fall\u00a0presidential debates. Still\u00a0he added some equivocation\u00a0to his false tweet\u00a0Thursday: \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u201d In another message Thursday, Trump accused the media of working \u201cso hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex, when actually it isn\u2019t!\u201d Except it was Trump and his team who specifically had cited the complexity of his business operations when they canceled a long-planned Thursday news conference that was supposed\u00a0to explain how he\u2019d separate his government duties from his business affairs\u00a0while in office . Those two tweets \u2014 along with one criticizing Vanity Fair magazine, which appeared to be\u00a0 retribution for a negative review of a\u00a0Trump Tower\u00a0restaurant \u2014 were the latest in a pattern for Trump. His\u00a0communications seem aimed at keeping his supporters on the team, his opponents under fire and the rest of America distracted from larger unanswered questions about the president-elect\u2019s plans . It is a strategy that has helped Trump gather a band of enthusiastic supporters large enough to win the presidency \u2014 but poses the threat of further alienating those who did not side with him and with whom a more conventional president-elect\u00a0might want to ingratiate himself during his preinaugural period. A McClatchy-Marist poll released Thursday demonstrated both the rationale for and the risks of Trump\u2019s tactics.\u00a0Asked about Trump\u2019s tweets, two-thirds\u00a0of American voters cast them as \u201creckless and distracting\u201d compared with 1\u00a0in 5 who found them \u201ceffective and informative.\u201d There was a sharply partisan cast to the findings, but even among Republicans,\u00a0nearly 2 in 5 disapproved of his communications. More than half of those who called themselves \u201cstrong Republicans,\u201d however,\u00a0had a favorable view of Trump\u2019s\u00a0tweets. \u201cHe has been talking mostly to his base and has not been reaching out,\u201d said poll director Lee Miringoff. \u201cAt some point that could become a problem, though we are not at that point yet.\u201d One of the challenges for Trump will be making sure that his regular entreaties on social media don\u2019t work against him as he seeks to build support for his goals. In the case of the Russian hacks, for example,\u00a0his repeated disavowal of the\u00a0unified judgment of U.S. intelligence that Moscow was behind the hacking \u2014 as well as insults leveled at the CIA and his own sympathetic views toward the foreign power \u2014 could complicate his desire to win support for his secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson . The Exxon Mobil chief executive has close ties to President Vladimir Putin from many years of doing business in Russia. More broadly, any president needs to have a trust-based relationship with the country he leads, particularly in times of crisis. \u201cThat only works if the president has credibility,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff , a Democrat from Burbank and member of the House Intelligence Committee, noted at a recent breakfast with reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cSo when you have a president-elect that sends out patently false information \u2026 that impugns the credibility of the [presidency], and at some point the president is going to need to be believed by the country,\u201d Schiff\u00a0said. Trump\u2019s Russia tweet marked the second time in four days that he has falsely asserted that the Obama administration did not say anything in public about the Russian hacking until after the election. He seemed to be trying to frame\u00a0concerns about Russian intervention in the election as an effort to delegitimize his victory. In fact, many of those alarmed about the matter\u00a0\u2014 a group that includes Republicans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have said that there\u2019s no indication the intervention cost Clinton the White House, and that their concern rests with the larger issue of Russian duplicity. Trump spokesman Jason Miller hit the legitimacy\u00a0theme Thursday when asked about Trump\u2019s tweets earlier in the day. ",

News 4:05 p.m. EST December 15, 2016 x Share Dylann Roof has been found guilty in the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, South Carolina. USA TODAY NETWORK A surveillance video shows Dylann Roof leaving Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church holding a Glock handgun, according to officials. Roof, in a confession videotape, said he was surprised police had not arrived, given the number of shots fired. (Photo: Courtesy of U.S. District Court of South Carolina) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 \u00a0The jury in the trial of\u00a0Emanuel AME Church shooter Dylann Roof on Thursday found Roof guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes after two hours of deliberations. The verdict came about an hour after they asked to look at a video of his confession, expressing interest in his statements that he didn't know how many people he had shot. The jury of eight white females, one white male, two black females and one black male was sent out initially a little after 1 pm, then recalled to clarify a legal instruction by the judge. 'There's so many people dead': Charleston church member recounts 911 call The shootings in June 2015 horrified South Carolinians and the nation. \u00a0State\u00a0lawmakers, upon urging from Gov. Nikki Haley, voted to lower\u00a0the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds in response to the crime, which also prompted a dialogue about race relations. \u00a0President Barack Obama spoke at the victims' eulogies, praising their families for their grace in forgiving Roof, an admitted white supremacist. Closing arguments in the guilt phase of the trial ended late Thursday morning. Dylann Roof's chief defense lawyer told the jury that the most important question in the 2015 murders of nine black parishioners is why and he pointed to Roof's internet exploration of racial crimes as an explanation. Testimony indicates Charleston church attack was long-planned \"That is the why as far as the evidence shows,\" David Bruck told the jury. But government prosecutors told the jury there\u00a0was no mystery to Roof's motivation, which they said stemmed from racial hatred so immense that he was willing to shoot innocent people as they prayed in a church and lay wounded on the floor. Roof's lawyers called no witnesses when testimony ended this week and Roof has indicated he will take over his defense in the sentencing phase if he is found guilty. Defense attorneys for Dylann Roof, the accused gunman in the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, S.C., sought a mistrial Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016. The judge denied the motion. Here, Roof, in a June 18, 2015, file photo, provided by the  shows Dylann Roof. \u00a0(Photo: Charleston County (S.C.) Sheriff's Office via AP) Bruck did not\u00a0contest the evidence in his closing arguments and even offered praise for the FBI's probe in the case. \u00a0He focused instead on what motivated Roof, sowing seeds of doubt about his intent, an argument that might be useful if jurors deliberate his sentence. The closing statements ended about 11:30 a.m., leaving legal instructions to the jury as the last step before deliberations on Roof's guilt. Bruck said Roof did not get his feelings on race from family or friends. \"He didn't get this from anybody else he knew,\" he said. Bruck portrayed Roof as a solitary figure who developed an obsession that a war existed between whites and blacks that required him to act and to even sacrifice himself, pointing to his statements to the FBI that he had intended to kill himself. \"There was something in him that made him feel he had to do it, and that's as close as they got to it,\" he said of Roof's motivation. He said there was something wrong with Roof's perceptions, pointing to his being unaware he had killed nine people when questioned by the FBI. Roof, he said, was an odd character, a loner who had hundreds of photos of his cat and wore sweats under his jeans. Contrasting prosecutors' arguments that Roof had spent a lot of time planning the murders, Bruck said Roof did not plan much of what he did. \"He had no escape plan, no money, a car full of dirty stuff,\" he told the jury. In discussing Roof's lack of remorse, he said, \"you don't feel remorseful for what you felt you had to do.\" Bruck concluded by asking jurors to \"look beyond the surface.\" \"Is there something more to the story?\" he asked. Roof sat\u00a0staring ahead during Bruck's closing, much as he had for a federal prosecutor's closing minutes before. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel sustained multiple objections from prosecutors during Bruck's closing, as he did during the opening of the trial when prosecutors felt Bruck was attempting to take jurors to the penalty phase of the trial before Roof's guilt was decided. \u00a0One of the objections came after Bruck attempted to discuss Roof's mental status, a discussion that Gergel said should take place during a penalty phase. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen\u00a0Curran told jurors in the final closing statement for the government that Bruck's request to look beyond the surface \"is nothing more than a distraction.\" \"Nothing undermines that man's guilt,\" he said of Roof. Earlier Thursday morning, a\u00a0federal prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments that Dylann Roof held a \"tremendous, tremendous hatred\" that led him to murder nine parishioners \"at their most vulnerable moment\" during prayer at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The assistant U.S. attorney also described Roof as a coward and a racist who did not see African-Americans as equals. \"He executes them because he doesn't think\u00a0they are more than animals,\" Nathan Williams said. The arguments included photos of the crime scene and of the victims alive, prompting emotional reactions from some family members in the courtroom. \u00a0Mental health counselors were on hand to assist family members. Should that panel return a guilty verdict \u2014 a near certainty in this case \u2014 Roof will dismiss his counselors in favor of representing himself in the sentencing phase, one where those same jurors will decide if he should face a sentence of life imprisonment or execution. \u00a0Bruck told jurors this could be the last time he represented Roof before them. On Thursday, Roof's hatred was described by Williams\u00a0as \"immense, vast and cold and calculated.\" Williams outlined Roof's planning for the crime and showed the jury a video of Roof in his backyard shooting a handgun. \u00a0He said the target practice showed the \"vastness of his hatred.\" How could someone shoot innocent people while they were on the ground, he asked. \"He thinks they are less than human,\" he said. He contrasted what he said were the heroic actions of the victims with the \"executions\" by Roof. \"These nine people exemplify a goodness that was greater than his message of hate,\" the prosecutor said, his voice rising. The case against Roof opened more than a week ago, when Jay Richardson, the lead assistant U.S. attorney, told jurors they would hear overwhelming evidence against the 22-year-old. In the days that followed, Richardson and his team of prosecutors delivered on that promise, one that was bookended by the wrenching testimonies of two adult survivors of that night in June 2015. Between those testimonies delivered by two grandmothers, jurors heard from witnesses who said Roof planned the attacks; they saw his video recorded confession, read his own racist writings and examined solemn crime scene photos depicting the dead. In his own opening statement, the lead attorney representing Roof conceded guilt, said he might not any call witnesses at all. Instead, David Bruck tried to nudge the panel toward considering a life sentence without release over execution. For that, he earned objections from Richardson, frustrated that Bruck was attempting to take jurors to the penalty phase of the trial before guilt had been decided. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel agreed, chastising Bruck for stepping outside the bounds of trial rules. Jurors must consider\u00a0 33 federal counts \u00a0against Roof,\u00a0many of them based on hate crime and obstruction of religion laws. That Roof intends to dismiss a premiere capital defense team, one that includes four lawyers, appears to stem from a conflict over their belief that Roof suffers from a mental defect or related condition, an assertion they have alluded to in court documents and statements. No condition has been specified, but before resting his case on Wednesday, Bruck attempted to offer a psychologist and a psychiatrist as witnesses, a move blocked by the judge. One, Dr. Rachel Loftin, is a clinical psychologist who specializes in autism disorders. Roof, in a handwritten journal that outlines a racist ideology, noted that he has no use for mental health experts. \u201cAlso I want to state that I am morally opposed to psychology,\u201d he wrote in a statement that appears to have been penned in the months before the Mother Emanuel attack. \u201cIt is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don\u2019t.\u201d Though Roof chatted\u00a0freely with his defense team during courtroom breaks, his demeanor changed\u00a0as jurors entered the room. He tended\u00a0to look straight ahead or at the table during proceedings, glancing neither at witnesses nor at a computer monitor to his immediate right, where hundreds of pieces of government evidence \u2013 documents, photographs, video recordings \u2013 have been displayed. Given his wooden demeanor, it\u2019s unknown what, if any kind of case he might present at sentencing. He remained unmoved even when the government called its first witness, survivor Felicia Sanders. She addressed Roof, saying he was sitting with his \u201chead hang down, refusing to even look at me right now.\u201d Sanders testified the shootings began when Roof raised his Glock to the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the 41-year-old leader of the church and a South Carolina state senator, after the group closed its eyes in prayer. With the first cracks of gunfire, she yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d and many in the group numbering 12 scrambled to take cover under folding tables draped with cloths, but the Rev. Daniel Simmons, Sr., described as the backbone of the group, tried to move forward to check on his pastor. Roof shot the 74-year-old man as others hid under folding tables. Later, when emergency personnel arrived, moving among the victims to check for vital signs, only Simmons showed life. He was carried out on a stretcher, but later died. The others died where they tried to take cover from Roof, armed with a .45 caliber pistol. Again and again, the shooter discarded spent magazine cartridges, reloaded new ones, and shot victims even as his view of them was sometimes obscured by draped tablecloths left pocked with bullet holes. More than 70 shots were fired; more than 60 found a human target. The oldest and youngest to die were related by blood. Tywanza Sanders was a poet, a barber and a vibrant 26-year-old graduate of Allen University. In the last moments of his life, he tried to reach his 87-year-old aunt, Susie Jackson. As he moved to the elderly woman, his mother, Felicia Sanders, begged him to stop moving. He asked for water, said he was so thirsty. He died with a hand reaching to Jackson\u2019s short-cropped hair. Roof was captured the next morning as he drove through Shelby, North Carolina, and in a video recorded confession to FBI agents, was unsure how many people he might have shot. Maybe five, he guessed. It was nine. His other victims included the Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Ethel Lee Lance, 74; the Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49 and Myra Thompson, 59. He knew he left two women alive. He did not mention to agents, perhaps did not know, that Sanders lay atop her 11-year-old granddaughter, nearly suffocating the girl to keep her still, mimicking death. The child, who prosecutors did not call as a witness, survived. The 11-year-old was not the only child in the church that evening. In another room, the pastor\u2019s wife, Jennifer Pinckney and their young daughter waited for the Bible study to finish, that they might go home with Rev. Pinckney. Instead, the 6-year-old girl and her mother heard the cracks of gunfire that claimed not only their husband and father, but also members of their church family. 55 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 58 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hSxDRE ",

    "text": "Supreme Court Strikes Down Abortion Restrictions In Texas Abortion-rights groups filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming the regulation unfairly \"burdens women seeking pregnancy-related medical care\" by imposing \"a funeral ritual on women who have a miscarriage management procedure, ectopic pregnancy surgery, or an abortion.\" In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that required clinics that provide abortions to have surgical facilities and their doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Supreme Court ruled both provisions were an undue burden and therefore unconstitutional. The regulations on fetal remains were issued by the state's Health and Human Services Department and were strongly endorsed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, NPR's Wade Goodwyn reported. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reported : \"Supporters ... say its purpose is to provide dignity for 'unborn infants.' \" 'What we're saying is, it needs to be humane, and the mother needs to be given the opportunity to have a say and be informed with what's happening,' says Kristi Hamrick of Americans United for Life. The group has created model legislation intended for other states, similar to the Texas regulation. ... \"The Texas regulation is part of a wave of such laws that followed last year's undercover videos targeting Planned Parenthood . The maker of the videos, an anti-abortion activist, accused the women's health organization of unlawfully selling fetal tissue. The deceptively edited videos sparked congressional hearings and a dozen state investigations. None found any evidence of wrongdoing.\" As Wade has reported , funeral directors in Texas also raised concerns about the new rules: \" 'If the regulations do go into effect, we as an industry, we're real uncertain and real uncomfortable at this point cause we really don't know what to expect,' said Michael Land, a past president of and current spokesman for the 4,000 members of the Texas State Funeral Directors Association. \"Currently funeral homes in Texas are required to cremate the remains from miscarriages after the fifth month of pregnancy. That doesn't happen very often, though, and Land says frequently funeral homes do it pro bono.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "Florida Seeking Full Recount? Here's the Real Story By ALANA ABRAMSON Dec 15, 2016, 6:25 PM ET 0 Shares Star Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images Florida voters mark their ballots at the Leon County Courthouse on Nov. 8, 2016 in Tallahassee, Florida. 0 Shares You may have seen the headline that Florida is looking to have a full recount after the presidential election . The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially false. Here's what we have found. The story was originally posted December 6 on bipartisanreport.com with the headline 'Breaking: Florida Moves for Full Recount of State Over Massive Voter Fraud (Details)' The headline is false. The story has some questionable reporting. The state has not asked -- and does not plan to ask -- for a full recount The Florida secretary of state has not asked for any sort of recount. Under Florida law, a recount is automatically triggered if the differential is 0.5 percentage points or less of the total votes cast. Trump received 4,617,886 votes in Florida, and Clinton received 4,504,975, a difference of 112,911 votes and nearly 2 percentage points, according to the Florida secretary of state. Otherwise, a court or the Florida secretary of state could order a recount if there\u2019s enough proof of fraud or misconduct to have changed the election results. The secretary of state has not mandated a recount. Three people are asking for a recount Three people are calling for a recount, saying the \"totals in the certification are wrong because of several factors,\" including unaccounted votes, illegal votes and lack of integrity of the voting machines, according to a complaint filed December 2. The suit claims Hillary Clinton would have won Florida if the votes were counted properly. There have been no reported election issues in Florida, officials say The original article didn\u2019t go beyond the lawsuit, but there have been no reported election issues in Florida, according to the Florida Department of State spokeswoman. \u201cWe have no indication of an issue,\u201d spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice wrote in an email to ABC News today. On election night, Secretary of State Ken Detzner wrote in a release, \u201cOverall, we\u2019ve had a very smooth and successful General Election Day here in Florida. We only received a few reports of minor issues from the counties. All the Supervisors of Elections were proactive in addressing any concerns and ensuring all voters were able to vote.\u201d The release from Detzner did cite problems, including the evacuation of a polling location and disciplinary action against two poll workers, but they did not include any of the ones mentioned in the complaint. But since he filed the court complaint, attorney Clint Curtis said he has received over 500 complaints about voting issues on Election Day. Before he filed, Curtis said, a couple dozen had come forward. The website bipartisanreport.com did not respond to multiple requests from ABC News for comment.

    "text": "How Verizon landed deal to acquire Yahoo Yahoo ( YHOO ) shares slid almost\u00a0 6 percent on Thursday on worries that Verizon ( VZ ) will walk away or slash its $4.8 billion offer for the company\u2019s digital operations after another massive data breach. Yahoo revealed on Wednesday that information was stolen from more than 1 billion user accounts in 2013. This came after its September disclosure of a separate hack in 2014 of some 500 million accounts.\u00a0 A U.S. official told CBS News that law enforcement agrees with the company in saying the hacks were a state actor , believed to be tied to Russia. In a statement, Yahoo said they believe \u201csome of this activity to the same state-sponsored actor\u201d responsible for the September hack. \u00a0 \u00a0 Verizon had said it would reevaluate the Yahoo deal after the first hack, and said the same Wednesday after the latest revelation. Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni on Thursday declined to comment beyond the company\u2019s Wednesday-night statement. Yahoo said in a statement it was confident in its value and continuing to work on its integration with Verizon. The deal was expected to close by March 2017. If the hacks drive Yahoo\u2019s users away, the company wouldn\u2019t be as valuable to the telecom giant in its quest to build a digital-ad business that could rival industry giants Google, whose parent is Alphabet ( GOOG ), and Facebook ( FB ). Yahoo has said that the September announcement of the 2014 hack didn\u2019t hurt traffic to its services. The second hack \u201cclearly ups the ante\u201d that Verizon may try to abandon the Yahoo purchase or lower its price, said CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler. But if Yahoo doesn\u2019t agree, Verizon might not have the legal grounds to do so under the terms of its deal, he said. There would have to be significant damage to the value of Yahoo\u2019s business, like if it caused many users to deactivate their accounts, and that\u2019s not yet clear, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to buy a house and enter into a contract, and then you find something out that makes you want to reduce your offer, that\u2019s not necessarily as easy to do as it is to say,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants a better deal. Whether or not it\u2019s legally supported or possible I think is still unclear.\u201d If Yahoo and Verizon can\u2019t agree on whether to end the deal or lower its price, there would be a court battle, said Craig Newman, an attorney with New York law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, who specializes in cybersecurity. That has risks for both sides. A case like Verizon\u2019s historically has been difficult to win, he said, but a trial could also mean a lot of pointed, embarrassing questions for Yahoo about \u201cwho was watching the store\u201d on data security.\u00a0 Jacob Helfstein, an analyst with investment firm Oppenheimer, argued on CNBC that Yahoo, despite its flaws, remains an attractive property for Verizon to acquire, given its popular websites like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports, plus its trove of users.\u00a0 Yahoo shares fell $2.41, or 5.9 percent, to $38.51 in Thursday trading. Verizon shares rose 29 cents to $51.92. If Verizon reduced its offer by $1 billion, that would mean a drop of 62 cents a share after taxes, Helfstein said, much less than Yahoo\u2019s stock dropped during the day.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Keith Ellison's Bid To Lead The DNC Faces Increasing Resistance Since then the party has been led by Donna Brazile, the former manager of Al Gore's 2000 campaign and a former CNN commentator, who was shown in emails hacked from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta to have sent questions to the Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall produced by CNN and TV One. Democrats are looking to regroup after a major upset in the 2016 election, not just in the presidential race but farther down the ballot. They failed to take back control of the Senate, which many saw within reach for Democrats, and they picked up a disappointing number of seats in the House. The party is also at its lowest level of power in state capitols across the country in about a century, with just four years to go until redistricting after the 2020 census. Ellison's early entry into the race has given him a head start when it comes to building support and lining up big endorsements. In addition to Sanders, whose unsuccessful presidential bid did succeed at energizing the Democratic Party's progressive wing, there are also Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Rep. John Lewis and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The retiring Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, also supports Ellison. And Ellison has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO, the umbrella organization for most labor unions around the country. Prior to leading the Labor Department, Perez was head of the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. He could pick up backing from some individual labor unions around the country, not to mention outgoing Obama administration officials, including the president. His sudden presence in the contest could also cause some Democratic activists to rethink their positions. Unlike some past fights for the DNC leadership, the leading candidates are both from the progressive branch of the party. Both have said they will focus on organizing from the ground up if elected. There are other candidates. South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party leader Raymond Buckley are running. Others mulling over jumping into the race are South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego. Former DNC Chairman Howard Dean said he was interested last month but has since withdrawn. All of this still has some 10 weeks to play out. The Democratic National Committee will vote on Feb. 24 in Atlanta to pick its next leader; that will be over a month after President Donald Trump moves into the Oval Office. ",

    "text": "OPEN Map In their zeal for pursuing clearly defined constituencies, some Democrats now worry they missed the bigger picture of the electorate: failing to deliver a message that would cut across all constituencies, and ceding too much territory to Republicans in whiter, more conservative areas that Mr. Trump won by wider margins than other recent Republican nominees. Representative Gwen Graham, Democrat of Florida and a likely candidate for governor in 2018, called her party\u2019s message \u201ctoo funneled.\u201d It needed to be more open to pursuing moderate and conservative voters, she said. Ms. Graham, who was elected in a conservative-leaning district in the Florida Panhandle, said she would campaign across every part of the state if she ran for governor. Though Ms. Graham declined to criticize her party\u2019s presidential nominee directly, such campaigning would be starkly different from the approach taken by Mrs. Clinton in 2016, when she focused overwhelmingly on courting the state\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas. \u201cI would run a 67-county strategy,\u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cAnd I would reach out to all different kinds of Democrats and Republicans, along the ideological spectrum.\u201d But while this may make for a good message at the outset of a campaign, it is, in the eyes of a vocal contingent of Democratic strategists, a dated approach that ignores inexorable political and demographic trendlines. To win in a changing country, these Democrats said, the party must tailor a platform and strategy that explicitly appealed to younger and nonwhite voters on issues like policing, climate change and immigration. Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster, said it was folly to continue developing a message for and devoting considerable resources to \u201ca shrinking, increasingly resistant market.\u201d Mr. Belcher recalled focus groups in North Carolina this year in which nonwhite voters who had come out for Mr. Obama\u2019s two elections could not even name the party\u2019s Senate candidate in the state. (It was Deborah Ross, and she lost.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe\u2019re spending all of our resources on broadcast television chasing this mythical unicorn white swing voter,\u201d he said. Mr. Belcher, who has published a new book about race and the Obama presidency, \u201cA Black Man in the White House,\u201d said the party should not ignore white voters. But he said Democrats also should not react to this election by refashioning their appeal as though the country were just as white as it was when Bill Clinton and other centrists began the Democratic Leadership Council 30 years ago. \u201cWhy would we go back to running campaigns as though it\u2019s the 1980s?\u201d Mr. Belcher asked. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not the 1980s.\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer, the former Obama adviser, noted that red states like Arizona and Georgia were closer to turning blue this year even as Mrs. Clinton lost, and argued that new arrivals in Florida and North Carolina would make those states tilt Democratic. Yet even Democrats from solidly blue states, who can in theory win elections without capturing a single conservative vote, said the party\u2019s identity-heavy message was lacking. Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles said Democrats had not explained to many voters how tolerant social values translated into government action. \u201cOf course we are for a tolerant, diverse, inclusive, cooperative future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Mr. Garcetti likened the party\u2019s message to the gestures of conciliation proposed by civic leaders in Los Angeles after the Rodney King riots in the 1990s \u2014 well intentioned but insufficient. \u201cIf the starting point is: \u2018Hey, we are a party and we are a country that stands for blacks and Koreans and people of all stripes liking each other,\u2019 that\u2019s not an agenda,\u201d said Mr. Garcetti, who has not ruled out a run for statewide office. \u201cThese values aren\u2019t just about social inclusion. They\u2019re about getting things done.\u201d ",

(Photo: Zach Gibson, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama allowed an Iran sanctions bill to become law without his signature Thursday, using a rare constitutional maneuver that hasn't been used in 21 years. Obama's decision to allow the Iran Sanctions Extension Act to become law ends the latest chapter of the debate over his pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, in which world powers agreed to relax sanctions on the Iranian regime in exchange for specific commitments to curtail its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Congress passed the bill to give a future president the authority to \"snap-back\" those sanctions if Iran violates the deal. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said it would give President-elect Donald Trump \"the opportunity to evaluate our policy towards Iran independent of additional interference from the outgoing administration.\u201d But the White House has said the president already has that authority under a separate law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and that the new law was unnecessary but ultimately harmless. \"This is part of a message we\u2019re sending to Congress, and it\u2019s simply this: If Congress does blow up the deal that prevents Iran form obtaining a nuclear weapon, they\u2019re going to have to deal with the consequences, and the consequences are grave,\"\u00a0White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. The White House conceded that it was rare for a president to neither sign nor veto a law.\u00a0\"We find ourselves\u00a0in a situation that I'm not sure we\u2019ve encountered in eight years. The bill didn\u2019t meet the standard of something that the president\u00a0would veto, but it's also not something that the administration\u00a0feels is\u00a0necessary,\" Earnest said. The maneuver is made possible by a quirk in what's called the presentment clause of the Constitution. In a way, it's the flip side of a pocket veto: If the president doesn't sign a bill while Congress has adjourned, it's a veto. If he signs it while Congress is in session, it becomes law \"in like manner as if he had signed it.\" Obama's pocket veto on shaky legal ground, experts say Congress recessed for the year last Friday, but remains in \"pro forma\" session\u00a0\u2014 a kind of skeleton session in which Congress remains open for business, usually to block pocket vetoes and recess appointments. The Iran Sanctions Extension Act had just one provision, extending life of The Iran\u00a0Sanctions\u00a0Act\u00a0of 1996 for 10 more years, until Dec. 31, 2026. It passed Congress nearly unanimously. The vote was 419-1 in the House and 99-0 in the Senate. For Obama, fewer bill-signing ceremonies reflect years of gridlock The last time a president allowed a bill to become law without his signature was 1995, when President Bill Clinton did not sign an annual defense spending bill. Clinton expressed a number of policy and constitutional concerns with the law, but concluded that \"the pressing demands of peace and of our military service men and women compel my approval of this measure.\" According to the National Archives, 28 bills have become law without the president's signature since 1951. During the same time, there have been more than 200 pocket vetoes. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The administration did take action in response to the hack prior to the election. In September, President Obama privately confronted Vladimir Putin about the hacks at the G-20 summit in China. He warned the Russian President of unspecified consequences if the hacks continued. Watch Cynthia McFadden on Nightly News with Lester Holt for More On October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued an unprecedented joint statement pointing the finger at Russia, saying hacks of U.S. political groups and individual politicians could only have been done with the authorization of \"Russia's senior most\" Russian officials and that its intent was to undermine the integrity of the election.

Adm. James Stavridis when asked by NBC News about the level of the administration's response. \"In retrospect it certainly seems as though it was a mistake not to call the Russians sooner and respond to them in a very forceful way.\" Click Here to Read the Exclusive NBC News Report on Putin's Involvement in the Hack An administration official, in turn, criticized the news media for focusing more on the leaked documents than on the Russian covert operation that hacked into political entities to steal the documents. Administration officials pointed out that the day the intelligence assessment was made public was the same day a tape was leaked revealing Trump's lewd conversation with Billy Bush. Eleven days later, at an October press conference, Obama was not asked a single question about the Russian hacks. \"We used the same playbook we did with Sony,\" an administration official said, referring to the North Korean cyber attack on the Hollywood studio. The difference, he said, was that the media and the public was focused elsewhere. A Shift in Position? On Thursday morning, President-elect Trump joined in the criticism of the Obama administration, writing, \"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking , why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\" Trump was no longer disputing, as he has for months, that Russia was involved. And his top transition aide, Anthony Scaramucci, went even further Wednesday night in an interview with MSNBC's Brian Williams. \"I don\u00b9t think anybody thinks that you\u00b9re wrong,\" he said of the NBC News report. \"Our position right now is that we\u00b9re waiting for more information. We reject the notion that people would cyber attack our institutions. We are very upset about it.\" Play ",

He can deliver a positive message and it sounds bad. He could say ladies and gentlemen, today we have totally defeated ISIS, and it wouldn't sound good, OK?\" Trump then added, \"Maybe he is getting his orders from somebody else?\" The jabs follow an escalating feud between the Trump transition team and the White House over Russian involvement in the U.S. election. Earnest doubled down on his statements that Trump knowingly benefited and even encouraged Russian hacking in his victory over Hillary Clinton. \"It is just a fact -- you all have it on tape -- that the Republican nominee for president was encouraging Russia to hack his opponent, because he believed that would help his campaign. It is not a controversial statement. I'm not trying to be argumentative. But I am trying to acknowledge a basic fact,\" Earnest told reporters today. Trump's Pennsylvania rally was another stop on his \"thank you\" tour. Trump has used these rallies to air grievances or comment on news relating to the transition. Trump Takes Aim at China in Victory Tour Stop Trump was previously scheduled to hold a news conference today, which would have been his first since Election Day . That news conference, in which he was expected to detail how he'll cut ties to his businesses, has been postponed until next month. Trump triumphed in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, a win that proved vital to his election victory. Green Party candidate Jill Stein 's efforts for a recount of the vote in Pennsylvania was blocked in court Monday. The state later certified the election results.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President Obama ends his presidency with positive ratings for his overall job performance as well as his handling of the economy, according to the latest Fox News Poll. \u00a0 Yet while more people feel positively about the economy today than have in more than a decade, not many say their family\u2019s financial situation has improved since Obama took office.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS. One-third says the economy is in excellent (3 percent) or good shape (30 percent). \u00a0That\u2019s up 10 percentage points from 23 percent in January 2016 (2 percent excellent and 21 percent good). Before Obama took office in 2009, just five percent of voters rated economic conditions positively (1 percent excellent and 4 percent good). \u00a0Some 23 percent say it\u2019s in poor condition today, down drastically from 74 percent (January 13-14, 2009). Related Image Expand / Contract Despite that improvement, only 30 percent feel they are better off financially now than before Obama became president. \u00a0One-in-five says they\u2019re worse off (22 percent), and nearly half feel their family\u2019s financial situation is about the same (47 percent).\u00a0 A 56-percent majority thinks the economy will be in better shape a year from now. \u00a0One-third expects things to get worse (34 percent). \u00a0 There\u2019s a significant partisan gap in views on the economy\u2019s future. \u00a0Republicans (89 percent) are three times more likely than Democrats (28 percent) to say the economy will be better next year. \u00a0Fifty-eight percent of independents see sunnier times ahead.\u00a0 Obama leaves office with a thumbs-up from 53 percent of voters for his overall job performance, while 41 percent disapprove. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract For his handling of the economy, 52 percent of voters approve and 44 percent disapprove. \u00a0That\u2019s notable since Obama\u2019s ratings on the economy were in negative territory for most of his presidency. \u00a0 He received his record high of 55 percent approval in September 2009 -- the most recent time more voters than not rated him positively on the economy. \u00a0His record low was in August 2011 when 34 percent of voters approved. \u00a0 Obama ends his second term with less than half of voters approving of the job he\u2019s doing on foreign policy (47-46 percent), health care (47-51 percent), immigration (47-49 percent), and ISIS (41-51 percent). \u00a0In each of these areas, his ratings are at or near the high point of his second term. \u00a0 Meanwhile, 43 percent feel the country is less safe than when Obama became president. \u00a0That\u2019s more than twice as many as say it\u2019s safer (20 percent). \u00a0One-third feels it hasn\u2019t changed under Obama (35 percent). \u00a0 Views of Obama as a person have been more positive than negative for much of his presidency. \u00a0 The new poll finds 57 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of him, including 40 percent who have a \u201cstrongly\u201d favorable view. \u00a0Forty-two percent have an unfavorable opinion (30 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d unfavorable). Michelle Obama is more beloved: \u00a067 percent favorable vs. 28 percent unfavorable. \u00a0Nearly half of voters, 48 percent, have a \u201cstrongly\u201d positive opinion of the first lady. Pollpourri By a nearly three-to-one margin, voters say Obama should not pardon Hillary Clinton for crimes she might have committed in connection with the Clinton Foundation or her time as secretary of state. \u00a0When Donald Trump mentioned Clinton\u2019s email troubles at rallies, his supporters regularly chanted the phrase, \u201cLock her up!\u201d \u00a0The poll shows 23 percent of voters think Obama should pre-empt any attempt to prosecute Clinton with a pardon. \u00a0Sixty-eight percent disagree.\u00a0 Even voters who backed Clinton in the presidential election are more likely to oppose a pardon: \u00a040 percent say Obama should vs. 48 percent shouldn\u2019t. \u00a0 Among those voting for Trump, it\u2019s 8 vs. 87 percent. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,034 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 11-13, 2016. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

Now, they anxiously await his next move Gaby Pacheco, left, and other immigration advocates meet with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2013. Diego Sanchez A group of \"Dreamers\" including Diego Sanchez, second from left, Gaby Pacheco, center left, and Jose Machado, second from right, met with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2013. A group of \"Dreamers\" including Diego Sanchez, second from left, Gaby Pacheco, center left, and Jose Machado, second from right, met with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in 2013. (Diego Sanchez) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter Gaby Pacheco\u00a0strode into Trump Tower\u2019s\u00a0gilded\u00a0lobby on a mission to\u00a0convince the businessman to back immigration reform\u00a0and\u00a0help young people like her who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Back in that summer of 2013, Donald Trump was just beginning to flirt with a presidential run, and others warned her that he might be using the visit\u00a0for publicity. But she and other Dreamers,\u00a0as the young immigrants are called,\u00a0coveted the star power\u00a0he might bring to the cause. Almost an hour later,\u00a0she and a few colleagues departed\u00a0the surreal encounter with doubts about Trump\u2019s understanding of the issue, an inkling\u00a0of his future political ambitions, and, most oddly, parting\u00a0gifts of chocolates, jewelry and neckties from his famous brands. But they also left with\u00a0a reason for optimism.\u00a0When Trump walked\u00a0his\u00a0young\u00a0visitors to the elevator, he turned and nodded:\u00a0\u201cYou convinced me,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Soon they will know whether they did. Of all of Trump\u2019s\u00a0campaign promises, one of the\u00a0thorniest to navigate\u00a0will be deciding\u00a0what to do with the approximately 700,000 young immigrants who are here illegally, but have been temporarily allowed to work and avoid deportation\u00a0under an executive action by President Obama. Trump made promises to blue-collar voters. Democrats plan to make sure he follows through \u00bb Among the first big tests of his administration will be whether to immediately cancel Obama\u2019s program, allow it to\u00a0gradually expire or\u00a0expend\u00a0some of his political capital to help the\u00a0Dreamers, who have lived in the U.S. most of their lives and\u00a0whom Obama has said are essentially \u201cAmerican kids.\u201d What Trump\u00a0decides may provide one of the clearest signals yet of his commitment to the hard-line\u00a0immigration policy he advocated during the campaign.\u00a0 As a candidate,\u00a0Trump repeatedly vowed to end Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,\u00a0threatening to deport the young immigrants along with the 11 million others\u00a0who are living in the U.S. illegally. As\u00a0president-elect, Trump\u00a0has\u00a0softened\u00a0his tone, saying he wants to \u201cwork something out\u201d for the Dreamers, whose inspiring stories have captured public attention, including his own. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in never-never land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump told Time magazine this month. \"We\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud.\u201d But any leniency by Trump risks blowback from those who\u00a0embraced his tough stance\u00a0against illegal immigration and might view such an accommodation as \u201camnesty.\u201d That includes top advisors and Cabinet picks, not to mention the crowds who still chant \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d at Trump rallies, echoing his repeated campaign promise to erect a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. In Congress, a growing bipartisan group of senators is offering Trump a way out. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) have introduced legislation that would allow Trump to essentially keep his promise to end Obama\u2019s executive action while also creating a new, similar\u00a0program that would allow young immigrants to remain temporarily in the U.S. The so-called Bridge Act\u00a0would give DACA-eligible young people \u201cprovisional protected presence\" for three years, providing work permits and deferring deportations if they continue to be law abiding. \u201cWhat would make America great would be to deal with these kids humanely,\u201d Graham said. Trump and the GOP are charging forward with Obamacare repeal, but few are eager to follow \u00bb Theirs is a carrot-and-stick approach \u2014 nudging Trump toward a compromise while also warning him that\u00a0mass deportations\u00a0of Dreamers would probably be unpopular with lawmakers and most Americans. Obama, too, counseled Trump during their first meeting at the White House not\u00a0to deport Dreamers. For the young people who have gained DACA status \u2014 becoming \u201cDaca-mented,\u201d as they call it \u2014 any disruption in the program would be devastating. DACA provides young immigrants with temporary legal status, which allows them to work, apply for driver\u2019s licenses and travel. Many now have healthcare through their employers.\u00a0All of that would be gone if DACA is terminated. \u201cEverything we worked so hard for,\u201d said Diego Sanchez, 26,\u00a0an immigrant who\u00a0was at the 2013 Trump\u00a0meeting and is now in law school in Miami. DACA permits are currently\u00a0valid for two years, so\u00a0every day some are at risk\u00a0to expire. Many young people are rushing to get them renewed before Trump takes office, but the soonest they can apply is 150 days before their expiration date.\u00a0A backlog has developed, officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of waiting,\u201d said Cesar Vargas, 33, an attorney in New York, who is hoping his own permit, scheduled to expire Feb. 17, is renewed before Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20. \u201cHopefully, it comes before.\u201d For Maria Isabel Vazquez, it\u2019s the ordinary things, like being able to drive, that has made life so much easier since she qualified for DACA four years ago. Most weekdays, after computer science classes at community college in New York, the 20-year-old meets her sister at a bus stop and climbs behind the wheel of the family\u2019s minivan.\u00a0First she picks up their younger sister from school and then she collects her mom from her work cleaning houses. Their dad comes home later from his job as a restaurant cook. On the days she doesn\u2019t have school \u2014 Friday, Saturday and Sunday \u2014 she works 12-hour shifts\u00a0earning $12 an hour as a home health aide, bathing and cooking for an elderly widow she has cared for since 2015. She earned a certificate for the job, and pays taxes.\u00a0 Maria Isabel Vazquez's family depends on the driver's license that DACA allowed her to obtain. Maria Isabel Vazquez Maria Isabel Vazquez's family depends on the driver's license that DACA allowed her to obtain. Maria Isabel Vazquez's family depends on the driver's license that DACA allowed her to obtain. (Maria Isabel Vazquez) But without DACA, all of that could be at risk, costing her the job and the driver\u2019s license that\u00a0much of her  family relies on to work and study. Her DACA permit\u00a0will expire in April, and she is already preparing the renewal \u2014 saving up the $465 application fee. Some immigrants have been afraid to apply for DACA protection, worried about submitting their name, address and biometric fingerprint data as required for the federal government background check. They\u2019re afraid\u00a0the Trump administration could use that information\u00a0to more easily find and deport them. But Pacheco, the Miami Dreamer\u00a0whose 2013 meeting was\u00a0arranged by an advocacy\u00a0organization, hopes the impression the young immigrants made during that visit to his skyscraper will\u00a0convince him to help. She recalled being whisked into his office, where Trump showed\u00a0off his impressive view of the Manhattan skyline. To their surprise, even as they lobbied him, Trump also seemed to be pumping them for information. He peppered them with questions about the upcoming presidential campaigns \u2014 whether Latinos would support Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio for a run. He did not mention his own plans. But as the young people steered the conversation back to\u00a0immigration reform, they noticed many of his questions resembled those they\u2019d heard from ordinary Americans at town hall meetings that summer. Why can\u2019t they just get legal, he asked? If you have enough money, can\u2019t you just hire an attorney and file the paperwork?\u00a0 They emphasized that the U.S. was the only home most of them had ever known. And due to immigration policies\u00a0that give priority to those with family members legally in the U.S. or with special skills, there was virtually no way for Dreamers\u00a0to go back and wait in line because they would never meet the criteria for legal immigration, or could spend many years waiting.\u00a0 Jose Machado, 21, another immigrant who was part of the group and is now a property manager in Miami studying to become a lawyer, said it was like \u201cteaching an Immigration 101 course.\u201d When the meeting ended, Trump rode in the elevator with them to the lobby gift shop. He told them to take what they wanted, helping pick out jewelry, ties and signed copies of his book. Initially they were optimistic that they had won him over. But last summer when Trump announced his candidacy for president, Pacheco watched as he called many Mexican immigrants\u00a0criminals\u00a0and rapists. She felt fooled. \u201cHe\u2019s a salesman,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that then, but now I see it clearly. We went in there and he sold us what we wanted to hear.\u201d Still,\u00a0she and the others remain\u00a0hopeful they made a lasting impression. \u201cTo this day, I continue to hope the conversation we had, the sharing of our stories, it penetrated, it stuck with him,\u201d Machado said. \u201cI still continue to hope that.\u201d Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

    "text": "Federal authorities to investigate O.C. district attorney over jailhouse informants Tony Rackauckas Nick Ut / Associated Press Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas speaks at a news conference in Santa Ana in February. Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas speaks at a news conference in Santa Ana in February. (Nick Ut / Associated Press) Joel Rubin, Adam Elmahrek U.S. Justice Department officials have launched an investigation into whether the\u00a0Orange County district attorney\u2019s office has routinely denied accused criminals fair trials\u00a0by using jailhouse informants to secretly gather\u00a0evidence. The undisclosed role of informants in several high-profile\u00a0cases has\u00a0roiled the county\u2019s criminal justice system and raised questions about the conduct of prosecutors and sheriff\u2019s jailers. Earlier this year, a panel established by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas released a highly critical report saying a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d in his office\u00a0led to the scandal. Justice officials announced the investigation Thursday, saying the\u00a0inquiry would scrutinize\u00a0whether changes are needed to\u00a0the\u00a0long-running practice of\u00a0deploying\u00a0informants\u00a0to surreptitiously extract information from defendants. (Richard Winton, Christine Mai-Duc and Shelby Grad) Investigators will search for patterns of\u00a0widespread violations of the Constitution\u2019s 6th\u00a0Amendment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0namely whether defendants were denied their right to have their attorney present during any questioning.  They will look as well at whether prosecutors have adhered to strict\u00a0rules that require them to disclose evidence that is favorable to defendants.\u00a0 \u201cA systematic failure to protect the right to counsel and to a fair trial makes criminal proceedings fundamentally unfair and diminishes the public\u2019s faith in the integrity of the justice system,\u201d Vanita Gupta, head of the\u00a0Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, said\u00a0in a statement.\u00a0 If problems are found, federal authorities could present Rackauckas with a set of\u00a0reforms\u00a0and offer him\u00a0a stark choice: Make the changes or face a federal lawsuit. In announcing the investigation, Gupta and U.S. Atty. Eileen Decker\u00a0made clear they expected Rackauckas to cooperate, highlighting an offer he made this year for federal officials to look into his office\u2019s\u00a0use of informants. \u201cWe appreciate the district attorney\u2019s invitation to review his office\u2019s policies and practices, along with his assurance of unfettered access to documents and personnel in his office,\u201d Decker said. Rackauckas and Sheriff Sandra Hutchens, whose jailers run the informant program, said they would cooperate with the probe. Rackauckas said he would\u00a0\u201cprovide all needed documents and information.\u201d He added that\u00a0he expects Justice officials will find that his department\u00a0\u201cdid not engage in systematic or intentional violation of civil rights of any inmate and no innocent person was wrongfully convicted.\u201d Some reliance on informants is legal as long as they are not part of an orchestrated plan\u00a0to elicit information from a suspect. When informants are actively drafted by police and prosecutors, they effectively become an arm of law enforcement. In such instances, their involvement can violate a defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the U.S. Constitution. However, police and prosecutors often deny overstepping legal bounds. Daniel Medwed, a professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University and an expert on wrongful convictions,\u00a0said there is a belief among defense attorneys that the use of informants is often based on a \u201cwink and a nod\u201d instead of an explicit arrangement. The other problem prosecutors face when relying on jailhouse informants is disclosure. If the informant is offered a benefit in exchange for information \u2014 such as a shorter jail sentence \u2014 the defense must be informed. Failure to do so could violate a defendant\u2019s\u00a0right to a fair trial. In the past, both\u00a0Rackauckas and Hutchens have rejected claims that the\u00a0use of informants  has led to anything other than isolated problems.\u00a0 The decision by federal officials to delve into the inner workings of the county\u2019s\u00a0top law\u00a0enforcement agency raises\u00a0the stakes dramatically in what has been a rancorous\u00a0battle over the use of jailhouse informants. Last year, a judge kicked Rackauckas\u2019 office off the case of Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2011. The district attorney\u2019s office was pursuing the death penalty, but Superior Court\u00a0Judge Thomas Goethals handed the case over to the state\u2019s attorney general. Goethals made the dramatic move\u00a0after growing increasingly impatient with  sheriff\u2019s jailers and prosecutors, who resisted repeated orders to fully disclose the role of an informant in the case and to hand over records about the informant program. An appeals court recently upheld the decision, saying there was ample evidence of wrongdoing. The discoveries in the Dekraai case have upended several other murder cases. In February, a Superior Court judge ordered a new trial for a convicted killer on the grounds that authorities failed to reveal that a key witness was an informant. In another case, prosecutors neglected to tell defense\u00a0lawyers they had used a paid\u00a0jailhouse informant to help convict a\u00a0man of a 2004 gang\u00a0slaying in Santa Ana. In light of that\u00a0information, the murder conviction was scuttled\u00a0and the man was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter. He could be out of prison in four years. And a defendant\u00a0who faced the possibility of life in prison if convicted of murder in two gang\u00a0killings went free on\u00a0probation after being allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder.\u00a0Prosecutors lost faith in the case after hearings in the Dekraai case revealed that an informant gathered information on the defendant. Medwed\u00a0said the federal investigation into Orange County informants\u00a0\u201chas been a long time coming.\u201d While first\u00a0used to infiltrate complex organizations such as corrupt governments and the mafia, the use of informants has expanded\u00a0over time to include murder and other crimes, Medwed said. Prosecutors, he said,\u00a0have come to over-rely on informants, especially in weaker cases. Informants factor into a high percentage of cases in which defendants are later found to have been wrongfully convicted, he said. \u201cThe problem with informants is they\u2019re so attractive. If it\u2019s a weak case, maybe bringing in an informant is a way to solidify it,\u201d Medwed said. The government\u2019s move Thursday was foreshadowed by the committee Rackauckas appointed as he tried to address the blossoming crisis. The panel,\u00a0which included legal experts, concluded that\u00a0the district attorney\u2019s office was functioning \u201cas a ship without a rudder\u201d\u00a0and faulted some of its prosecutors for adopting a \u201cwin-at-all-costs mentality.\u201d Specifically, it suggested a series of reforms, including the need to create \u201ca clear and consistent policy regarding its use of jailhouse informants\u201d that would establish strict limits on when and how they are used. After the panel presented its findings to\u00a0Rackauckas, the district attorney wrote to U.S. Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch in January to request the federal inquiry. If federal officials find that jailers and prosecutors routinely violated defendants\u2019 rights with the\u00a0use of jailhouse informants, they are likely to impose\u00a0a consent decree on the county\u00a0that would\u00a0require\u00a0changes and appoint a monitor to track progress.

Hours after Uber launched the self-driving service Wednesday, California's Department of Motor Vehicles warned that it was illegal because the cars did not have a special permit. An Uber self-driving car heads out for a test drive in San Francisco. Hours after Uber launched the self-driving service Wednesday, California's Department of Motor Vehicles warned that it was illegal because the cars did not have a special permit. (Eric Risberg / Associated Press) Tracey Lien , Russ Mitchell and Melissa Etehad Contact Reporters Uber became the dominant ride-hailing company in the U.S. by\u00a0operating under the principle\u00a0that it\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.\u00a0 In city after city, the San Francisco company launched without first consulting local regulators, often in violation of rules governing taxi companies. As it grew popular, statewide bans\u00a0were nearly always overturned\u00a0and\u00a0legislation crafted to legalize app-based ride-hailing services,\u00a0helping\u00a0Uber roll out\u00a0in more than 45 states.\u00a0 Now, as Uber ventures\u00a0into self-driving cars \u2014 with the long-term goal of having fleets of vehicles that don\u2019t require a driver behind the wheel \u2014\u00a0it appears to be\u00a0embracing the same aggressive tactics. But what worked in Uber\u2019s war on taxis may not work in its war on drivers, according to technology and transportation analysts, who say regulators may prove less willing to cave now that the company is pushing technology that the public doesn\u2019t yet trust. On Wednesday, the\u00a0California Department of Motor Vehicles went\u00a0after the ride-hailing giant, issuing a strongly worded letter demanding that Uber\u00a0cease its self-driving car program\u00a0in San Francisco or face legal action. The program\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which uses Volvos equipped with self-driving technology but has a\u00a0driver behind the wheel in case of emergency \u2014 launched in the city earlier that day.  To complicate matters, one of the vehicles\u00a0was caught on video running a red light (Uber blamed the incident on the error of its human driver).\u00a0 \u201cHad Uber obtained  [a permit for testing autonomous vehicles]\u00a0prior to today, the company\u2019s launch would have been permissible,\u201d Brian Soublet, the DMV\u2019s deputy director and chief counsel said in a letter addressed to Anthony Levandowski, the head of Uber\u2019s Advanced Technology center. \u201cHowever, it is illegal for the company to operate its self-driving vehicles on public roads until it receives an autonomous testing permit.\u201d Uber had not responded to the DMV\u2019s letter as of Thursday afternoon, a DMV spokesman said, and the company did not immediately respond to The Times\u2019 multiple requests for comment. But on Uber\u2019s website , Levandowski said he didn\u2019t believe that the company needed permits, arguing that it was still \u201cearly days, and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them.\u201d Media reports suggest that the vehicles remained on the road after the DMV sent its letter. This attitude is typical of Uber, according to analysts, who noted that\u00a0the company\u2019s familiar strategy of acting before asking \u2014 common among technology companies such as Facebook that pride themselves on \u201cmoving fast and breaking things\u201d \u2014 may face greater opposition in its push for self-driving cars than its upheaval of the taxi industry. Otto, a self-driving truck company\u00a0that Uber acquired in August for $680 million,\u00a0also landed in hot water with the Nevada DMV this year. The firm, which was founded by Levandowski, released\u00a0a promotional video that appeared to show one of its trucks rolling down a highway without a person behind the wheel.\u00a0 Backchannel reported that the company did so even after the Nevada DMV issued a warning that it would be violating the state\u2019s autonomous vehicle regulations. \u201cUber has a history of playing pretty fast and loose with the rules,\u201d said Steve Beck, co-founder of business strategy firm CG42, which advises companies on ways to comply with regulation. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a strategy that works in this context because the stakes are really high.\u201d Unlike app-based ride-hailing, which consumers quickly warmed to because it met a desperate need in many cities for a more convenient and widely available alternative to taxis and limos, self-driving cars have not yet won in the court of public opinion. When companies are developing new technologies, it\u2019s incumbent on them to win over the public\u2019s trust, Beck said. And when it comes to self-driving cars, that trust simply is not there yet. \u201cAs a corporate citizen, this is a mistake for Uber,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe stakes can literally be as high as life and death, and they\u2019re going to be seen as a company that\u2019s cutting corners. It\u2019s not a sound strategy.\u201d At the heart of the DMV\u2019s cease-and-desist order is state legislation that requires anyone testing autonomous vehicles on the state\u2019s roadways to apply for a permit. The permit costs $150\u00a0and requires holders to send reports to the state on crashes and on \u201cdisengagement\u201d \u2014 the times when the autonomous system turns off and hands control back to the driver. Without a permit, Uber would not have to report such information. Permit holders in California include Tesla, Google, Honda, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and 15 other companies. Uber might have a plausible legal argument, based on the text of the legislation, said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and a specialist in autonomous vehicle law. But the intent of the law,\u00a0he said,\u00a0is \u201cin large part about building trust, and Uber is not building any trust in its systems or practices by doing this.\u201d The federal Department of Transportation this year issued proposed guidelines for autonomous vehicle development, explicitly stating that it believes the technology will lead to safer roads. Individual\u00a0states, however, determine which vehicles can travel on their roads. Politicians and regulators are trying to balance life-saving innovation with protection of the public given the emerging technology\u2019s limited track record. Like all other states that have passed autonomous driving regulations, California defines \u201cautonomous technology\u201d as having the \u201ccapability\u201d to drive a vehicle with no human intervention. Uber claims that its cars are not autonomous and that there is always a driver inside. But it does call the cars \u201cself-driving.\u201d If the company is not being disingenuous, it is \u201cover-claiming\u201d the capabilities, Smith said. \u201cA human is turning the steering wheel.\u201d Or, as Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School, put it, \u201cThey want the cars to be considered self-driving by the investment community and human-driven by the regulatory community.\u201d Uber is working with Volvo\u00a0and Ford\u00a0to create self-driving vehicles, and has been running a similar program in Pittsburgh since September . Asked to comment, a Ford spokeswoman said by email, \u201cWe share the DMV's goal and intend to continue working with them to ensure safe operation of autonomous vehicles on roads.\u201d A Volvo spokesman said it\u2019s providing specially fitted cars to accommodate Uber\u2019s self-driving technology, so meeting legal and permit requirements is on them Uber\u2019s responsibility. But, he added, \u201cAs for Uber\u2019s approach to automated driving, we\u2019re comfortable. But even if Uber wins its battle with the DMV, this particular tiff might hurt its standing with the public more than past regulatory battles, analysts said. Part of it comes back to the inherent distrust the public has of computer-driven cars. But incidents such as the self-driving car running a red light on Wednesday could entrench people\u2019s fears and skepticism about\u00a0the technology,  said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThis was supposed to be the safest of all simulations, having a driver in the car, and yet we had a compromise on safety,\u201d Lindland said. \u201cThey have to play well with others. Uber needs to make the case for why San Francisco is a good place to conduct these tests, and that they\u2019re not compromising on the safety of the community. Some analysts speculated about whether Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick joining president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s business advisory council might help the company with its regulatory hurdles. But this seems unlikely, given that transportation is typically regulated at a local level, and Trump has in the past expressed a desire to leave much decision-making in the hands of states. That leaves Uber to play ball with local authorities. Or not. The company had in recent years shown an interest in softening its image with regulators and the broader community, launching initiatives to sign up more veterans \u00a0as drivers, throwing its support behind California\u2019s Proposition 47 (which reduces certain felonies to misdemeanors) to give\u00a0more people an chance to drive for the service\u00a0and partnering with Mothers Against Drink Driving .\u00a0 But its latest feud with the DMV suggests that the company isn\u2019t ready to grow up yet, Beck said.\u00a0 \u201cMaybe they\u2019re in those awkward teen years where you start to make good decisions, but you still slip up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need parents.\u201d Lien and Mitchell reported from San Francisco and Etehad from Los Angeles.

Then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey was alerted to the attack by an early-morning phone call from the Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Mike Rogers.\u00a0 Now retired, Dempsey told CBS News in an exclusive interview that the attack was proceeding at an alarming speed. Within an hour, hackers had seized control of the unclassified e-mail system used by the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Staff, the organization of some 3,500 military officers and civilians who work for the Chairman. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey tells CBS News the Pentagon was the target of a 2015 cyber attack by Russian hackers.\u00a0 CBS News In that time, the hackers seized the computer credentials of Dempsey and hundreds of other senior officers  -- the passwords and electronic signatures they used to sign on to the network. The only way to stop the attack was to take the network down.\u00a0 The attack, which officials now blame on Russia, began with 30,000 e-mails sent to a West Coast university. Of those 30,000, four were forwarded to members of the Joint Staff and one was opened -- allowing the hackers in.  Since it was an unclassified network, the attack had no real intelligence value. It was not spying, but a full-on assault whose only apparent purpose was to cause damage and force the Pentagon to replace both hardware and software, which took about two weeks to accomplish. U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey speaks during a news conference in Baghdad March 9, 2015. REUTERS The motive for the attack was believed to be Russian anger at economic sanctions orchestrated by the Obama administration in response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine. Cyber attacks have come to be known as weapons of mass disruption, and it is now clear that Russia has used them not just to meddle in U.S. elections -- but to do harm to the American military.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Funerals were held in Chattanooga, Tennessee, this weekend for two of the six children killed last week in a school bus accident. The bus driver ... Johnthony Walker also was using a cellphone in the bus before the crash, Chattanooga traffic Officer Joe Warren said. He estimated that Walker was driving between 48 and 52 mph and never hit the brake. He knew \u201cright off the bat\u201d he was dealing with a speeding bus when he reached the scene, the officer said. A Hamilton County judge found probable cause to send the case to a grand jury. His lawyer, Amanda Dunn, said he\u2019ll plead not guilty if indicted. Five children in Tennessee are still fighting for their lives after a bus crash that killed six of their schoolmates Monday. Manuel Bojorquez rep... Police filed preliminary charges of vehicular homicide, reckless driving and reckless endangerment. A sixth vehicular homicide count will be added for the child who died days after the Nov. 21 crash. The victims were between 6 and 10 years old. Two children remain hospitalized, Officer Adam Cavitt testified. Warren didn\u2019t specify just when Walker was using the phone. Questioned by Dunn, he acknowledged that a camera inside the bus showed Walker using his phone while the bus was stopped, and that the phone then went out of view. Investigators are going through phone records to get a better sense of when he used it. Authorities say 24-year-old Johnthony Walker was going well above the posted speed limit when the school bus he was driving Monday in Chattanooga... Federal authorities say Walker left the designated bus route when he wrecked on a curvy road while carrying 37 children. Authorities say he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. Dunn said evidence yet to be submitted suggests \u201cdifferent versions\u201d of what happened, particularly regarding how fast Walker was driving. She also directed Warren to testify that Walker helped at least two children off the wrecked bus. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot that we don\u2019t know at this time,\u201d said Dunn. The deadly crash in Tennessee has renewed the debate about seatbelts on school buses. At least five children were killed Monday when the bus flip... In a separate investigation, Walker has declined to be interviewed by federal crash investigators on advice of his lawyer, the National Transportation Safety Board has said. The NTSB has filed subpoenas to obtain Walker\u2019s medical and mental health history. Investigators also are seeking his cellphone records and details of his second job with Amazon. The agency\u2019s final report is expected to be presented within 18 months. Students and administrators had raised concerns about Walker\u2019s behavior behind the wheel in the weeks before the crash. The company that provided the school district\u2019s bus services, Durham School Services, has said it will implement millions of dollars in safety upgrades across the country in response to the crash. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Radiologist Brandon Crum and former coal miner Mackie Branham, 39, view an X-ray of Branham's diseased lung at Crum's black lung clinic in Coal Run Village, Ky. Howard Berkes/NPR Across Appalachia, coal miners are suffering from the most serious form of the deadly mining disease black lung in numbers more than 10 times what federal regulators report, an NPR investigation has found. The government, through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, reported 99 cases of \"complicated\" black lung, or progressive massive fibrosis, throughout the country the last five years. But NPR obtained data from 11 black lung clinics in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which reported a total of 962 cases so far this decade. The true number is probably even higher, because some clinics had incomplete records and others declined to provide data. \"The actual extent of PMF in U.S. coal miners remains unclear,\" says the report, which appears in this week's issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"I can't say that I've heard really anything worse than this in my career,\" says Robert Cohen, a pulmonologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago who studies and tracks black lung. Article continues after sponsorship \"I can't think of anything in this particular field ... that's more frightening than this,\" Cohen adds. Edward \"Lee\" Petsonk of West Virginia University has spent three decades addressing the disease and finds NPR's numbers \"very disheartening, very disappointing.\" \"I've spent much of my career trying to find ways to better protect miners' respiratory health,\" Petsonk says. \"It's almost like I've failed.\" NIOSH released a report Thursday , published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which focuses on a small health clinic in Kentucky with 60 cases alone of PMF in 20 months. The report acknowledges cases are being missed by the government's count; it concludes: \"The actual extent of PMF in U.S. coal miners remains unclear.\" \"The more I talk, the more I get out of breath\" Mackie Branham, 39, of Elkhorn Creek, Ky., spent 19 years mining coal until he was diagnosed with complicated black lung. He ran monstrous mining machines and drilled bolts into mine roofs \u2014 occupations NIOSH says can involve excessive mine dust exposure. He worked double shifts and seven-day weeks every chance he had. His gallbladder was removed one day and he says he was back at work the next. He took two days, he says, after knee surgery, before working a 12-hour shift drilling bolts. But severe breathing problems forced him to leave work in March. And he struggles for every breath now. \"My dad has got it. Everybody that has got it, got it when they had like first stage or so. I'll probably be the first born to be this bad in the family,\" Branham says, describing a family legacy of black lung. \"They can't breathe but they can still get up and walk around and do stuff. The more I talk, the more I get out of breath. It's like I ain't got no capacity.\" The Sidney Coal Co.'s Coal Preparation Plant in Sidney, Ky., in 2006. Brian Tietz/AP hide caption toggle caption The Sidney Coal Co.'s Coal Preparation Plant in Sidney, Ky., in 2006. Brian Tietz/AP Branham was diagnosed with PMF at United Medical Group, a clinic in Coal Run Village, Ky., that was the subject of the NIOSH study. Radiologist Brandon Crum was alarmed by the numbers of miners coming in with such severe disease, including some like Branham, who were in their 30s and 40s and worked less than 20 years underground. So he contacted NIOSH researchers. \"I think the percentage of black lung that we're seeing now here in central Appalachia is unprecedented in any recorded data that I can find anywhere,\" Crum says. \"In this clinic we're roughly around 9 to 10 percent complicated rate, which is around three times higher than even the highest reported numbers.\" NIOSH researchers gathered at the clinic and verified the diagnoses. They, too, were alarmed. \"The current numbers are unprecedented by any historical standard,\" says NIOSH epidemiologist Scott Laney, who has focused on black lung as well as the recent Ebola outbreak in Africa. \"We had not seen cases of this magnitude ever before in history in central Appalachia.\" Crum tells NPR he diagnosed 10 more cases of PMF since Laney and his colleagues left the clinic. In three years, 644 cases Life with PMF is bleak. It's incurable and fatal. Fifty-three-year-old Charles Wayne Stanley of Pound, Va., is matter-of-fact about his future. \"Staying on oxygen 24/7, dying of suffocation, that's what I've got to look forward to,\" Stanley says, as he sits in a clinic in St. Charles, Va. \"I've seen it too many times. My wife's grandpa ... [I] watched him take his last breath. I watched my uncle die with black lung. You literally suffocate because you can't get enough air. That's my prospects.\" Stanley says his diagnosis includes black lung and silicosis. In just the last three years, 644 cases of complicated black lung were diagnosed at Stone Mountain Health Services, which operates black lung clinics in St. Charles and two other Virginia communities. That's six times the NIOSH national count in nearly half the time. Ron Carson is the director of the Black Lung Program at Stone Mountain Health Services in St. Charles, Va. \"Something major is going on,\" he says. Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Ron Carson is the director of the Black Lung Program at Stone Mountain Health Services in St. Charles, Va. \"Something major is going on,\" he says. Howard Berkes/NPR \"I'm not an epidemiologist or a scientist or a doctor,\" says Ron Carson, who manages the clinics. \"I just see the results that come through the doors, and something is going on. Something major is going on.\" Laney and his colleagues acknowledge in their paper that they have missed hundreds of cases with their national surveillance program. By law, they can X-ray only working miners and the testing is voluntary. NIOSH data show most miners avoid that testing. Only 17 percent of all working Kentucky miners were tested in the NIOSH program since 2011. Stanley waited until he was out of work, after 30 years mining coal, before he got his first chest X-ray. Miners avoid the NIOSH testing, he says, because they worry it could cost them their jobs. \"If you're working and you go and have that stuff done and the company finds out about it, they'll find a way to get rid of you,\" Stanley says. \"As long as you're working and producing you're an asset. But now when you get something wrong with you, you become a liability. And they'll find a way to get rid of you.\" The last company a miner worked for (for at least a year) is saddled with black lung benefits payments and medical care \u2014 even if the miner spent 20 years working somewhere else in excessive dust. It's the last employer who pays. But it's against the law to punish or fire miners for getting X-rays or being diagnosed with disease. Bruce Watzman of the National Mining Association also says mining companies are not supposed to see the X-rays. \"Those results are not shared with any employer. It's at the miner's discretion the way the program operates today when and if to divulge that information,\" Watzman says. Still, the fear is widespread. So missing from the official NIOSH counts in the last 40 years are the working miners avoiding X-rays, and miners who are retired or laid off. More than 40,000 miners lost their jobs since 2010. Six hundred mines have closed. And those out of work are now flocking to clinics to get screened for the disease and apply for black lung benefits. Last year alone, 3,000 miners showed up at the Stone Mountain clinics. \"I'm seeing miners now feeling that there's no hope. I think that they have really come to the realization that there's other energy out there now that is going to override any coal,\" Carson says. With the increased testing, more cases of complicated black lung are being diagnosed. \"Pure rock dust\" Cohen, Laney and other black lung experts believe thinner coal seams in central Appalachia are likely to blame for spikes in complicated black lung. The thickest seams are mostly gone. The thin seams that remain have coal embedded in rock, and that rock contains quartz. Cutting quartz and coal together results in mine dust that includes silica, which is especially toxic in lung tissue. Stanley worked in so much dust he labeled his mining machine the dust dragon. \"They kept getting less coal and more rock. So you're cutting 19 inches of coal, you're cutting 50-60 inches of rock,\" Stanley recalls. \"And the more rock you cut the more dust you're going to eat.\" A display case at NIOSH shows a normal lung and a diseased black lung from inhaling coal dust and other harmful particles while coal mining. Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR A display case at NIOSH shows a normal lung and a diseased black lung from inhaling coal dust and other harmful particles while coal mining. Howard Berkes/NPR There's also the practice of slope mining, where crews cut solid rock to reach coal seams. Burnham did that in Kentucky for six straight months, working 14 16-hour shifts at one point. It was \"pure rock dust,\" he says. \"I had my respirators on and you'd actually have to remove it to help take a breath every once in a while because the dust packed so much around your filters you couldn't get no air in.\" Protective masks are among the controls that are supposed to prevent inhalation of coal and silica dust. Robust ventilation in mines is supposed to sweep dust away. Water sprays are used to tamp down dust. Kentucky miner Barney Stanton says those things didn't always work, even when most of the companies he worked for provided proper safety gear. \"It's hard to wear a mask and do a physical job,\" he says. \"Just trying to do your job, you breathe so hard the dust will come in around the mask.\" Stanton has been diagnosed with the most serious stage of PMF and is awaiting a lung transplant. \"The mining game is a numbers game,\" Branham says. \"If you don't produce coal, they'll put somebody else in your spot that can. If I've got another man on the other side of the mines, he's cutting more coal than me, it's not going to look good on me. I just thought about my family to be honest with you.\" Mining jobs are often the best-paying jobs in central Appalachia, where there generally are few other options for work. New rules in place, but a decade to see results New and tougher federal limits on mine dust exposure fully took effect in August, and they get even tougher when there's excessive silica. Simple black lung and PMF can take a decade or longer to develop, so the spike in disease is not an indication that new limits are failing, says Watzman of the National Mining Association. \"So I think we're talking about historic exposures and not the exposures we're seeing today.\" Watzman's group sued to keep the new dust rules from taking effect, but he acknowledges positive impact. \"I think that miners that are working today are better protected because the silica levels have come down,\" he says. Silica dust is down, on average, 50 percent since 2009, according to the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, whose director is Joe Main. \"I think if the rules are followed as they are prescribed we would not have these diseases,\" Main says, while also posing this question: \"Is the strength of the rules that are in place adequate enough to protect miners? I think that's the question of the day.\" There are some holes in the new rules when it comes to silica. For example, it can take a week or more to detect silica in dust samples, so excessive exposure isn't quickly addressed. Also, the U.S. Department of Labor has failed to take action on proposed dust rules specifically targeting silica. Every other industry cutting rock has strict limits on silica exposure, except mining. Main, whose tenure will end with the change in administrations, wouldn't commit to a silica limit. \"I think if the evidence points in that direction then that needs to be done,\" he says.

Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption A NIOSH black lung surveillance van at the fire station in Wharton, W.Va., in 2012. Howard Berkes/NPR It'll be a decade or more before the effectiveness of the new rules is known, because it takes that long to detect the disease in lungs. In the meantime, there are the cases NPR has identified. According to year-by-year data reported by NIOSH, our count this decade (962 cases) is more than double the cases NIOSH counted in the last 40 years (441). NPR also did not receive complete numbers from some clinics and did not get data from eight others in the heart of the region experiencing the spike. So there are very likely many more cases that are uncounted. That suggests more and more severely diseased miners will be seeking state or federal black lung benefits, which concerns Evan Smith, an attorney at the Appalachian Citizens Law Center in Whitesburg, Ky., which helps miners file for benefits. \"You're just putting more people into the system that need compensation, so the more people we have moving into the system, the more potential burden it places on the taxpayers,\" Smith says. There are also younger miners now being diagnosed, so benefits payments and health care may be required longer. There may be more demand for expensive lung transplants. \"The treatments run from a half-million to a million dollars,\" notes Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., the ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \"So, if there are cases out there that have not been counted then we have a lot of expenses [coming] that we don't expect.\" That increased demand comes as the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is stressed. The fund is nearly $6 billion in debt. It has taken on 1,000 claims that were covered by self-insured mining companies until they went bankrupt. And the coal excise tax that supports the fund is set for a 50 percent cut in two years. \"I think there are real reasons to be concerned about the viability of the trust fund,\" says Smith. There is also concern involving possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which contains a provision that makes it easier for miners to get black lung benefits. Scott has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the trust fund's ability to continue to pay claims. He also wants more accurate numbers of miners afflicted with progressive massive fibrosis. \"We have to get the numbers straight to make sure they're being properly reported,\" he says.

He is also left gasping for air and grasping for words. He worked hard to feed his family and now, as his life leaves him one breath at a time, he wonders about the cost. Branham has \"never been scared of death,\" he says, as he chokes back tears. \"It don't bother me a bit. It's just not seeing my kids grow up. But if I had it to do over I would do it again, if that's what it took to provide for my family as long as I have.\" Branham hopes for a lung transplant, which may give him five to 10 more years of life.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print FILE -- \u00a0(AP) A beloved Florida middle school was reprimanded for taking a knee during a student-led prayer on the football field. Wakulla Middle School football coach Eddie Metcalf did not lead the prayer. He did not recite the prayer. He simply took a knee and bowed his head. Click here to pre-order a copy of Todd\u2019s new book: \u201cThe Deplorables Guide to Making America Great Again.\u201d But according to the Wakulla County School Board, that act of reverence is against the law. \u201cThat\u2019s not allowable under the law,\u201d Superintendent Robert Pearce told television station WCTV. \u201cThe coach may not participate in the prayer.\u201d I wonder if the school district would\u2019ve made a fuss if the middle school coach had taken a knee to protest the national anthem. I reached out to the superintendent hoping to get an answer to that question \u2013 but so far he hasn\u2019t returned my messages. Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! Not only was Coach Metcalf forbidden from participating in the prayer, he was not even allowed to give any public indication he was praying. \u201cHe may not kneel with the players,\u201d the superintendent told the television station. \u201cHe may not put his hands on the players during the prayer. What we want our coaches to do \u2013 and what most people have survived with in regards to meeting the letter of the law \u2013 is to have separation from the players \u2013 two to three steps.\u201d The controversy started in November when the Freedom From Religion Foundation found a Facebook video of Coach Metcalf taking a knee after a football game. The FFRF is a group of perpetually offended atheists, agnostics and free-thinkers from Wisconsin who apparently troll Facebook preying on small towns and school districts. They are very unpleasant people. \u201cCoach Metcalf\u2019s conduct is unconstitutional because he endorses and promotes his religion when acting in his official capacity as a school district employee,\u201d FFRF attorney Andrew Seidel wrote in a letter to the school district. They alleged that a middle school football coach who takes a knee with his team to pray is a \u201cserious and flagrant violation of the First Amendment.\u201d As a result of the FFRF\u2019s letter, the school district launched an investigation and determined the coach was guilty of bowing his head and taking a knee. WCTV reports the coach was served with a \u201cLetter of Professional Guidance\u201d \u2013 and warned he would be disciplined if it happens again. In other words, it was a slap on the wrist. But the school district\u2019s actions clearly demonstrate that the Wakulla County Schools is hostile to people of faith. Coach Metcalf is not speaking publicly about the incident, but many of his friends are outraged. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating,\u201d Jeremy Smith told me. \u201cEddie was not preaching or teaching or proselytizing or evangelizing. He was reverently nodding his head.\u201d Smith and Metcalf are longtime friends and attend the same church. He said the coach is just a good man who cares about his players. \u201cThis coach has poured his life into this town,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen you hear about men among men \u2013 he is that kind of man.\u201d Smith and many others in the community are organizing a group to defend the coach and send a message to the school district. They want the prayer policy changed. \u201cWe are not asking the school to teach Christianity or Islam or Buddhism,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cBut if a Christian wants to take a knee with students, they should take a knee.\u201d This sounds like a job for a religious liberty law firm like First Liberty Institute or Alliance Defending Freedom! In the meantime, maybe Wakulla County Emergency Management could sound warning sirens so the coaching staff could have advance notice that their players are about to pray? That way, the adults would have time to insert emergency ear plugs and evacuate to a designated \u201cIntercessory Safe Space\u201d out of ear-shot of the prayers?

Philbrick , executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University, who has studied the plan and responded to questions via email. \u2022 How is the work going? Currently, construction is happening in the Central Valley with three construction packages awarded and executed to build the first 119 miles of the system. \u2022 How does the funding picture look? And what\u2019s the burden going to be for California taxpayers? The funding picture consists of federal grants through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, California Proposition 1A funds (which are bonds that were voter approved), and cap-and-trade proceeds. The good news is that there has been a reduction in overall capital costs from $67.6 billion to $64.2 billion and this trend may continue. \u2022 Some critics are calling the project a boondoggle that should be halted. What\u2019s your take? Work should absolutely continue. The state is growing quickly and our aging infrastructure can\u2019t accommodate the concomitant population increase. It is simply not feasible to add more freeway miles or additional runways to airports like San Francisco International Airport. High-speed rail and transit alternatives are the answer to terminal gridlock. \u2022 What does a Donald Trump administration mean for the project? President-elect Trump has proposed a transportation plan that will fund the development of the nation\u2019s infrastructure. But what that means on a state level, and to high-speed rail specifically, remains to be seen. We do know that Mr. Trump has \u201cwondered\u201d why the U.S. does not have such a system, which seems to be a positive sign. \u2022 Besides faster trips, what are other upsides of the rail line? One of high-speed rail\u2019s biggest advantages is that it offers passengers a one-seat ride into the center of major cities and provides ample opportunities for transfers at these locales. Moreover, high-speed rail passengers are typically able to arrive at stations that are only a short walk away from central business districts, without experiencing the stress of negotiating highly congested environments, such as freeways and airports. It\u2019s also electric, which will helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improves air quality. California Online \u2022 Yahoo said more than one billion user accounts were hacked in 2013.

Photo Storm clouds loomed over Ocean Beach in San Francisco on Wednesday. Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press.. You might want to grab your umbrella. A big storm is expected to drench much of the state. Forecasters warned of high winds, surging waterways and the potential for flooding in places throughout the state into Friday. On Thursday, heavy rain was poised to soak the northern half, especially along the coasts and in the Sierra Nevada, where up to five inches of rain could fall, said Brooke Bingaman , a forecaster with the National Weather Service\u2019s Sacramento office. From there, it was expected to spread to Southern California, where officials circulated warnings about the possibility of flash floods and mudflows on slopes stripped bare by wildfires. At the same time, the anticipated rain was seen as more welcome news for the state\u2019s lakes and reservoirs, depleted by five years of drought. Strong rainfall in Northern California over the last few months has helped lift water levels above historical averages at several reservoirs, including Lake Don Pedro, Lake Shasta and Folsom Lake. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe\u2019ve had some nice rain,\u201d said Doug Carlson, information officer for the California Department of Water Resources. \u201cAnd that\u2019s reflected in some of these reservoirs.\u201d But Mr. Carlson added that the greater concern for drought relief was the level of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which plays a vital role in replenishing the reservoirs in the spring and summer. On Wednesday, the statewide snowpack was only 55 percent of the historical average, according to government data . \u201cThat\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d Mr. Carlson said.

Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla, Jim Sergent and Brian Truitt, USA TODAY Unless you\u2019ve been held captive by a Wampa, crash-landed a TIE Fighter on Jakku\u00a0or were eaten by the\u00a0Sarlacc \u2014\u00a0we see you there, Boba Fett, keep hope alive \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s probably not news that there's\u00a0a Star Wars movie\u00a0out this\u00a0week. For everybody\u00a0who hasn't seen the Death Star (or a Death Star-like thing such as, say, Starkiller Base) onscreen enough, Rogue One\u00a0is the flick for you. Nerds and civilians alike are again busting out their\u00a0Star Wars tapes and DVDs, special editions or original recipe, and rewatching the seven previous films to get jacked up for the\u00a0first standalone\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0movie and eighth chapter in this galactic saga. And fourth prequel if we're being technical. We\u2019re no different.\u00a0We binged them again, too, and these are the rankings you\u2019re looking for, y\u2019all \u2014 including Rogue One. 8. Star Wars: Episode I \u2014\u00a0The Phantom Menace (1999) Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Before you see 'Rogue One,' the new standalone 'Star Wars' movie, don't forget about the first seven. USA TODAY's Kelly Lawler takes a look back at the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy, starting with 'Episode I - The Phantom Menace' (1999).\u00a0 Lucasfilm The prequels brought a mix of new characters and younger actors playing favorites to the 'Star Wars' universe, including new Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).\u00a0 Lucasfilm Natalie Portman portrayed the young Queen Padme Amidala, leader of the planet Naboo.\u00a0 Lucasfilm Fans saw Darth Vader as a young slave named Anakin Skywalker living on the planet Tattooine.

Jackson as Mace Windu.\u00a0 Lucasfilm A battle between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Maul is one of the film's most famous scenes, set to John Williams' 'Duel of the Fates.'

Record 6:30 p.m. EST December 15, 2016 x Share Adele Dunlap of Pittstown, NJ resides at the Country Arch Care Center where she celebrated her 114th. Dunlap, who has been a resident of New Jersey her entire life, became the oldest living American approximately six months ago. Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com Adele Dunlap, the oldest American, on her 114th birthday Monday at the Country Arch Care Center in Pittstown. (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/Staff Photographer) 10 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE HUNTERDON COUNTY, N.J. \u2014 Lifelong New Jerseyan Adele Dunlap , who assumed the title of oldest American five months ago, marked\u00a0her 114th birthday Monday with a balloon bouquet and a \"Happy Birthday\" serenade from fellow residents of the Hunterdon County care center where she has lived since age 99. But Dunlap made clear through her facial expressions and her answers to\u00a0questions that she didn't appreciate the fuss. Asked what she was thankful for, Dunlap said, \"Gee, how should I know?\" And asked what her birthday wish was, she responded, \"I've never thought of such a thing. I don't wish for anything.\" She also declared that it was her 105th birthday. It's\u00a0her habit to shave about a decade off her age, according to nursing home staff and her family. Dunlap was born in Newark on Dec. 12, 1902. Her birth date has been validated by the Gerontology Research Group, which tracks\u00a0\"supercentenarians,\" or people older than 110. Among the documents attesting\u00a0to her astonishing age is her diploma from South Side High School in Newark. It is dated June 27, 1921 \u2014\u00a095 1/2\u00a0years ago. Happy birthday to the world's oldest living person -- she's 117! There are believed to be several hundred supercentenarians in the world. In addition to being the oldest American, Dunlap is the world's ninth-oldest person. The oldest, according to the\u00a0 Gerontology Research Group database ,\u00a0is an Italian woman, Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, who marked her 117th birthday on Nov. 29. The next-oldest American is Meta Dishman of Virginia. She turned 113 on June 1. Of the world's 46 oldest people in the Gerontology Research Group's database, 44 are women. Dunlap moved up to oldest American when Goldie Michelson of Worcester, Mass., died on July 8, one month shy of her 114th birthday.\u00a0 She said at the time that being the oldest American didn't make her feel any different. On Monday morning at the Country Arch Care Center in Pittstown,\u00a0Dunlap sat in a wheelchair with a blanket from the Tewksbury Women's Club over her lap and moccasins on her feet. She had her usual oatmeal for breakfast and then attended the \"coffee club\" in the dining room, where staffers and a dozen other residents sang \"Happy Birthday\" to her. That was the extent of the celebration. Country Arch recognizes birthdays en masse, and the 15 residents with December birthdays were feted last Wednesday. Dunlap is one of five centenarians at the Country Arch Care Center. \u00a0(Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/Staff Photographer) The\u00a0center has 111 residents, including five centenarians. The other four are more than a decade younger than Dunlap. \"Ms.\u00a0Adele has requested that the celebrations become fewer because she says we are all important, and that speaks volumes about who she is,\" said Susan Dempster, Country Arch's marketing director. Dempster described Dunlap as a \"passive participant\" in nursing home activities. She says the rosary every week and enjoys musical presentations, including Christmas carols from visiting Girl Scouts, who clamor to have their picture taken with the supercentenarian. \"But we don't make Ms.\u00a0Adele move that much physically,\" Dempster said. \"If she wants to move, she'll move.\" 103-year-olds may have been world's oldest twin brothers The former Adele Henderson taught school briefly in Kearny and raised her three children in Short Hills. Her husband, Earl Dunlap Sr., who worked in insurance, died in 1963. Before moving to Country Arch,\u00a0she lived in Clinton with her son Earl Jr., now 86, and daughter-in-law Barbara. Others apparently didn't get the memo about Dunlap not wanting to make a big deal about her age. Last week, the mayor of Clinton arrived with a proclamation wishing the lifelong \"Jersey girl\" continued good health. And in August, Kean University wrote Dunlap a letter of congratulations on \"capturing a singular title that is reserved for the remarkable person in the United States who has lived the longest and has witnessed more history than anyone \u2013 oldest American.\" Dunlap received a bachelor of arts degree in elementary education from the Newark Normal School, Kean University's predecessor. Soon after basking in birthday wishes Monday, Dunlap was looking ahead. Asked what her favorite part of the day is, the 114-year-old said, \"I guess just going to bed.\" 10 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hTr5Cn ",

His\u00a0task? \u201cCreate a video that persuades people\u00a0to think about\u00a0something differently\u201d\u00a0for a communications course . Smith\u2019s immediate idea was to craft a video showcasing a man he knows as Freddy, a friendly homeless man in Boston\u2019s Kenmore Square. Blake Smith surprised Freddy with money that he raised from GoFundMe. (Photo: Courtesy of Blake Smith) Freddy is known for \u201calways sending good vibes\u201d to people who walk\u00a0by him, said Smith, who passes\u00a0Freddy every day on the way to class. The two developed a quick friendship. \u201cA lot of people just kind of ignore homeless people or think they\u2019re lazy and that\u2019s why they\u2019re in that position,\u201d Smith told USA TODAY College. \u201cBut Freddy sits out in the cold at 30 degrees \u2013 that\u2019s not someone who\u2019s lazy. That\u2019s someone who walks all the way from the Boston hospital, because there\u2019s a shelter there that he\u2019s at, and he walks all the way to Kenmore just to get a couple of dollars every day for food.\u201d Smith\u2019s video tells the story of a young wealthy character\u00a0who walks past Freddy \u2014 who plays himself in the short film \u2014\u00a0every day, throwing out leftovers and then going home to a fridge full of food. Later in the video, the wealthy character has a change of heart and offers his takeout meal to\u00a0Freddy. The video ends with the two men sitting down to share the food together. \u201cI learned from (making) this video\u00a0to be grateful for what you have,\u201d said Smith. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need the new iPhone, but you could help somebody else. Take the time to stop and talk to somebody, see how their position is in life.\u201d But Smith\u2019s efforts did not stop at creating the video. He also started\u00a0a GoFundMe page, with the hope of raising money for\u00a0Freddy, as a holiday gift. In nine days, Smith raised $700 for Freddy \u2014 just $300 short of his final goal. \u201cHe gave me a huge hug and was really happy for everything,\u201d said Smith. \u201cHe was overjoyed, and he told me that he was going to go get a room and get out (of)\u00a0the cold and try to get a place to stay for a little while.\u201d Freddy\u2019s reaction was exactly what Smith was hoping for. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was for, basically,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTo help him out for a while because no one should have to sit outside during the Christmas season.\u201d Related: More than $70k raised for homeless student who biked six hours to college It may have started off as an idea for a project, but Smith said the gesture was about much more than a grade. He hopes to continue impacting lives like Freddy\u2019s with\u00a0his social activism documentary class next semester. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to just make a video to get a good grade \u2014 I was kind of sick of doing projects that way,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI wanted to do something that could help someone outside of class.\u201d Brianne Garrett is a Boston University student and a USA TODAY College correspondent.

    "text": "VA Secretary 'Most Difficult' Position to Fill in Trump Cabinet, Transition Team Official Says By Shushannah Walshe Dec 15, 2016, 6:55 PM ET 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump made veterans\u2019 issues a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. But selecting a leader for the Department of Veterans Affairs will be one of the final decisions to round out his cabinet. Transition sources say Trump is still considering a number of different candidates, from Trump loyalists to retired military officials, ahead of a self-imposed goal of the end of the week to finalize his cabinet. Contenders for the VA job include former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown; Pete Hegseth, the former chief executive of the conservative Concerned Veterans for America; and Adm. Michelle Howard, the first African-American woman to command a U.S. Navy ship. A senior Trump transition official says the president-elect has also interviewed retired Gen. Ann Dunwoody, who served as the Army\u2019s first female four-star general. Hegseth, who is an Army veteran and Fox News contributor, has met with Trump twice, most recently on Thursday at Trump Tower. One senior transition official told ABC News the position of VA secretary is proving to be the \"most difficult\" cabinet position to fill. Trump's pick will be responsible for managing the government\u2019s second-largest department and a national health care system that serves more than 6.6 million veterans and beneficiaries each year. Some veterans\u2019 advocacy groups have expressed frustration that Trump has not met personally with them to discuss the selection, instead meeting with a mix of celebrities and CEOs. \"He's met with Kanye West and Leonardo DiCaprio, but hasn't met with the American Legion or IAVA [Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America],\" said Paul Rieckhoff, CEO and founder of IAVA. Asked about Trump's focus on selecting a VA secretary, transition officials say the president-elect is taking the issue seriously. \"This is an area he cares deeply about, reforming the VA,\" spokesman Sean Spicer said on a call with reporters Thursday. He said that this is \"an area that's near and dear to his heart and one that he really wants to make sure is addressed appropriately, quickly and successfully.\" Some veterans organizations have urged Trump to keep current VA Secretary Bob McDonald in his administration. But a senior transition official says that idea has not been embraced in Trump Tower. \"Transforming an agency as large and diverse as VA will take a continuous commitment from leadership over the course of many years,\" a coalition of 20 veterans groups wrote in a letter to Trump and the transition team. \"As you make your selection for VA Secretary, then, we advocate for an approach that recognizes and builds upon current progress. Given the challenges we face, we cannot afford to start over.\" Trump has proposed making it easier for secretaries to fire VA employees, creating a commission to investigate fraud in the agency and creating a 24/7 White House hotline for veterans' complaints. In interviews, top veterans' advocates say Trump has much in common with McDonald, a registered Republican and former CEO of Proctor & Gamble. \"They\u2019re both businessmen from outside the government that have a different perspective,\" said Garry Augustine, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans. \"If he wasn\u2019t already secretary, president-elect Trump would probably be looking at him.\" Bill Rausch, the executive director of Got Your 6, said keeping McDonald would allow the Trump administration to hit the ground running in January to pass reforms with a GOP-led Congress. \"If we bring in a new VA leader who is going to take a year, two years to get up to speed,\" he said. \"We could miss that window of opportunity.\" It\u2019s not clear if McDonald and Trump have been in contact with each other, but those who have spoken to the current secretary said he would consider serving in a Trump administration. McDonald told the Military Times in a recent interview that he has not been approached about serving in the Trump administration. \u201cI have not been approached, and I\u2019m making plans according to that. But service is important,\" he said. ABC News' request for comment from McDonald\u2019s office was not immediately returned. \"I think he would say yes,\" Rausch said. \"His answer has been that he\u2019s a member of the Veterans Party and he\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for veterans.\" 0 Shares ",

The Metropolitan Police Department said it has issued a permit for the Jan. 21 march to start near the U.S. Capitol. Organizers have said they will march down Independence Avenue, and police said the march is scheduled to disperse at Constitution Avenue near the Washington Monument . Police said that on their application, march organizers estimated 200,000 participants. Organizers initially hoped to rally at the Lincoln Memorial and other spaces, but those plans conflicted with other groups and inauguration events. The Washington Post ( http://wapo.st/2gP3vdW ) reported that Janaye Ingram, the head of logistics for the Women's March on Washington, said last week that the group still has a pending application for a permit for various locations that, like the Lincoln Memorial, are under the purview of the National Park Service . Ingram said the group has not rescinded its application but is no longer interested in rallying in front of the Lincoln Memorial. A National Park Service list of permit requests shows the group was also interested in space at the Washington Monument. About 20 groups have applied for permits to demonstrate on National Park Service land on or around the Jan. 20 inauguration date. National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said the agency is waiting for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which has priority, to make decisions about what space it will use before issuing permits for certain locations. 0 Shares ",

Bogus news sites \u2014 such as these stories from \"USA Daily News 24,\" a site that's registered in Veles, Macedonia \u2014 have been blamed for the spread of misinformation online. Raphael Satter/AP Providing new details about how it's trying to counter the spread of fake news on its services, Facebook says it's working with fact-checking groups to identify bogus stories \u2014 and to warn users if a story they're trying to share has been reported as fake. Facebook also says it will let users report a possible hoax by clicking the upper right hand corner of a post and choosing one of four reasons they want to flag it \u2014 from \"It's spam\" to \"It's a fake news story.\" If a story is deemed false, it will be tagged with an alert message saying it's been \"disputed by 3rd party fact-checkers.\" A mockup provided by Facebook shows the screens it will use to allow users to report a potential hoax or fake news story. Facebook hide caption toggle caption Facebook A mockup provided by Facebook shows the screens it will use to allow users to report a potential hoax or fake news story. Facebook The social media giant was sharply criticized after the Nov. 8 election, as false stories were blamed for adding confusion to a dynamic campaign season. Since then, fake news and conspiracy theories were also identified as a motivating factor in a man's assault on a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C. In the wake of that and other stories, some called for Facebook to hire editors to vet news stories; in today's update from Facebook's vice president in charge of its News Feed feature, Adam Mosseri, the company could be seen to be effectively outsourcing that job to third-party groups that it says have signed on to Poynter's International Fact Checking Code of Principles . Article continues after sponsorship Students Have 'Dismaying' Inability To Tell Fake News From Real, Study Finds The update to Facebook's plan to cope with bogus information comes nearly one month after CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had \"much more work\" to do in how it handles false stories. Today's news touches on four of the seven areas that Zuckerberg listed as part of his company's fight against misinformation. It remains to be seen whether the moves will satisfy Facebook's critics \u2014 both inside and outside the company's ranks \u2014 who've faulted the way it deals with controversial, offensive and/or fake posts. As NPR's Aarti Shahani reported in November , that effort has grown to include thousands of overseas subcontractors. In a news release outlining how Facebook's new reporting and flagging process will work, Mosseri said the company will rely on its users to report a story as potentially bogus, \"along with other signals.\" The story would then be sent to fact-checkers. \"If the fact-checking organizations identify a story as fake,\" Mosseri said, \"it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed.\" Mosseri added, \"It will still be possible to share these stories, but you will see a warning that the story has been disputed as you share.\" The flagged story will also be rejected if anyone tries to turn it into a promoted ad, Facebook says. While fake news created a stir because of its intersection with U.S. politics, many of the people behind the sites say they're mainly in it for the money. Here's how Craig Silverman of BuzzFeed News described what he found in researching the phenomenon, Wednesday's Fresh Air : \"Facebook directly doesn't really earn them a lot of money. But the key thing about Facebook \u2014 and this is true whether you're running a politics site out of Macedonia or whether you run a very large website in the U.S. \u2014 Facebook is the biggest driver of traffic to, you know, news websites in the world now. You know, 1.8 billion people log into Facebook every month.\" Today, Facebook says it has \"found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated\" \u2014 and that it's taking steps to remove some of that incentive. \"On the buying side we've eliminated the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to be real publications,\" Mosseri says. \"On the publisher side, we are analyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary.\" ",
