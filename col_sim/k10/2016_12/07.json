    "text": "Anti-Trumpers trying to sow chaos in Electoral College Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Amid a rowdy recount push in battleground states, anti-Donald Trump forces are escalating efforts to invalidate his election on another front: the Electoral College. The people who technically choose the next president will gather on Dec. 19 to, presumably, make the results of the Nov. 8 presidential election official. Trump won 306 electoral votes in the election, well above the 270 needed to defeat Hillary Clinton and claim the White House. But even as Clinton herself has conceded and joined President Obama in urging a smooth transition of power, a group of electors from Colorado and Washington known as the \u201cHamilton Electors\u201d is trying to persuade other electors to unite behind a Republican alternative to Trump. On Monday, they peeled off one Republican. Chris Suprun, from Texas, said he won't cast one of his state's 38 electoral votes for Trump because \"I am here to elect a president, not a king.\" Suprun previously indicated he would support Trump. But he now says the president-elect's postelection attacks on the First Amendment, as well as the billionaire businessman's continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas, changed his mind. The anti-Trump electors, however, face a very steep climb. In total, they would need to persuade 37 electors to either abstain from voting or switch their vote from Trump to someone else. This would throw the vote for president to the House of Representatives. Texas law doesn't mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state's presidential election, which Trump won by nine percentage points over Clinton. But a majority of states bind their electors to the state\u2019s popular-vote winner, complicating efforts to switch those votes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a binding position,\u201d Cherilyn Eagar, a Utah elector, told The Salt Lake Tribune of the law in her state, dismissing efforts to get fellow electors to defect from Trump. The same newspaper notes that some attorney groups have offered to defend electors who try to defy the will of their states. Politico reported Monday that advocates of the latest stop-Trump plan have been in touch with Clinton allies, though Clinton and her campaign have not commented on the plan. Clinton likewise has not gotten behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s efforts to pursue a recount in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The plan for Electoral College chaos doesn\u2019t necessarily hold promise for Clinton anyway. Anti-Trump electors are pushing for members of the Electoral College to support a Republican alternative in order to bring Trump\u2019s number down \u2013 not elevate Clinton\u2019s. According to Politico , Democratic electors backing the push are leaning toward Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for president, as the likely alternative. Suprun said he \u201cwould have to strongly consider someone like Kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together.\u201d Suprun said he was waiting to see if other electors revolt and rally behind a Trump alternative like Kasich. \"I'm looking for someone we can all unify behind,\" he said. The Kasich camp is pushing back on efforts to put forward his name on Dec. 19. Adviser John Weaver told Politico: \u201cThere\u2019s no question Trump won enough votes in the states to receive over 270 votes when the members of the Electoral College meet.\u201d He voiced confidence the Electoral College \u201cwill affirm this when it gathers later this month.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mr. Dole also assisted in Taiwan\u2019s successful efforts to include language favorable to it in the Republican Party platform, according to the documents. Mr. Dole\u2019s firm received $140,000 from May to October for the work, according to the documents. The documents suggest that President-elect Trump\u2019s decision to take a telephone call from the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, was less a ham-handed diplomatic gaffe and more the result of a well-orchestrated plan by Taiwan, one that sought to use the election of a new president to deepen its relationship with the United States \u2014 with an assist from a seasoned lobbyist well versed in the machinery of Washington.

Chavez first became a survivor on Dec. 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor. \"I can't forget it. I never will,\" he says of the attack. Chavez was stationed at the U.S. naval base when the bombing started. \"I got very emotional that day. There were so many, many innocent people that were lost,\" he said. Chavez has often returned to Hawaii over the years to honor those who died. Three years ago, the Navy veteran decided he wanted to go back this year for the 75th anniversary of the horrific attack. In order to make that trip, Chavez started working out with the help of a trainer \u2014 putting on 20 pounds of muscle. Pearl Harbor survivor Ray Chavez working out with his trainer \"I tell my clients all the time, when they say, 'I'm too old to do this or that,' I say, 'No, look at Ray, that excuse doesn't fly anymore,'\" Chavez's trainer, Sean Thompson, says of his client's dedication.

He'll be there once again to honor so many who lost their lives in service of their country. Ray Chavez receives a hero's welcome upon his arrival in Hawaii When asked if he would be back in five years for the 80th anniversary, all Chavez had to say was, \"If I can walk, I'll go.\" He'll be 109.

Oakland Warehouse in Deadly Fire Held Beauty, Danger by Jon Schuppe and Miguel Almaguer Share Oakland warehouse manager: 'I am incredibly sorry' about fire that killed 36 5:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161207003928if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/825827395707\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> To many who lived, made art and partied at the Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, the building was a temple, a labyrinth of makeshift studios and apartments that fueled round-the-clock creativity in a city where artists felt squeezed by rising rents. But the jury-rig spirit that made the place thrilling \u2014 scavenged music instruments and car parts, exotic lighting, ornate rugs and tapestries \u2014 also made it frightening, according to people who spent time in the building. The warehouse was chockablock with raw wooden fixtures, outfitted with improvised electrical and heating systems and featured a shaky staircase made of shipping pallets, they said. The warren-like layout was difficult to navigate \u2014 and to find an exit from. On Friday, the 10,000-square-foot warehouse went up in a blaze that killed at least three dozen people, many of whom were attending a party and concert on the second floor hosted by a collective called Satya Yuga. Interior of the Ghost Ship in Oakland, California. OaklandGhostShip.com The gathering, and the many others that preceded it, were indicative of what the Ghost Ship had grown into \u2014 a home to artists who \"can't pay your rent because your dream is bigger than your pocketbook,\" Derick Ion Almena, the manager of the warehouse, said Tuesday on TODAY . Almena, 47, defended how the property was used amid concerns that potential safety pitfalls were ignored while he profited as the manager. \"This is profit? The loss of mass life? I'm a father. I lay my three children down there every night,\" a visibly emotional Almena said, calling himself the \"father of this space.\" \"It was a strange place. It was beautiful. There were all these Balinese beds and all kinds of crazy wooden sculptures, and the whole downstairs was a whole maze to get through.\" \"We created something together. This stopped being me. This stopped being about me three years ago,\" he said. Pete Veilleux, a local landscaper, was immediately drawn to the three-year-old collective's welcoming and supportive atmosphere. But when he was invited to move in, he balked. \"I was too afraid,\" Veilleux said Monday. \"I wouldn't even go to big events there.\" He became friends with Satya Yuga's eccentric impressario, Almena, and his wife, Micah Allison. Veilleux said he talked a bit with Almena and Allison about safety concerns there, but \"I didn't get a clear idea if they understood that.\" Veilleux said Almena and Allison lived at the warehouse \"partially\" but were looking for a permanent home nearby for the entire family. Ghost Ship owner Derick Ion Almena Derick Ion Almena said his family stayed at a hotel on the night of the fire \"to get a good night's sleep.\" Almena \u2014 who is on probation for receiving stolen property \u2014 said his heart was broken and offered condolences to the victims. \"I'm only here to say one thing \u2014 that I'm incredibly sorry and that everything that I did was to make this a stronger and more beautiful community and to bring people together,\" Almena said on TODAY. \"People didn't walk through those doors because it was a horrible place,\" he added. \"People didn't seek us out to perform and express themselves because it was a horrible place.\" Play ",

    "text": "Former Bear Rashaan Salaam found dead at age 42 Photos of Rashaan Salaam, who was the Bears' first-round pick in the 1995 draft. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The news of Rashaan Salaam 's death hit those who knew him during his time with the Bears with full force Tuesday afternoon. Ron Turner, Salaam's offensive coordinator for two seasons, couldn't wrap his brain around the reality, recalling the natural ebullience Salaam always seemed to carry himself with. Robert Green, a backfield mate with the Bears in 1995 and 1996, remembered Salaam's smile, his laugh, his drive and couldn't believe it was all suddenly gone at 42. \"Honestly, I was floored,\" Green said. \"I broke down. Forty-two years old. With the rest of his life ahead of him. This is a tough one to handle. It really is.\" Salaam was found dead Monday evening in a park in Boulder, Colo., according to the Boulder County Coroner. An autopsy is being conducted, and according to a statement from the coroner, \"the cause and manner of death are pending further investigation.\" A source familiar with the case indicated a possible suicide was being investigated. Salaam's mother, Khalada, told USA Today that police said they suspect it's a suicide after finding a note. \"It's so saddening, such a tragedy,\" former Bears coach Dave Wannstedt said. \"I don't ever remember seeing him without a smile on his face. He loved football. He worked. He always had a great attitude.\" Salaam was the Bears' first-round draft pick in 1995, selected 21st overall after a brilliant junior season at Colorado . He won the Heisman Trophy that year after becoming just the fourth player in college football history to top 2,000 rushing yards in a season. Salaam rushed for 2,055 yards and 24 touchdowns in his final season with the Buffaloes and enjoyed flashes of success during his first season in Chicago. From 2012: Rashaan Salaam reflects on his disappointing NFL career Open link He rushed for 1,074 yards \u2014 then a franchise rookie record \u2014 and scored 10 touchdowns in 1995, earning NFC Rookie of the Year honors. But that was as good as things would get in the NFL for Salaam, who rushed for only 608 yards and three scores in his final 15 games with the Bears in 1996 and 1997. He was slowed by a knee injury in '96 then suffered a broken leg and underwent ankle surgery the following year, which led to an injury settlement and his abrupt exit from Chicago. Salaam also struggled often with ball security, fumbling 14 times during his 31 games with the Bears, losing 11 of those. Turner, though, remembered Salaam as a pleasant young man who was well-liked throughout the organization. As a player, Turner appreciated Salaam's combination of size and speed and the physical nature with which he ran. \"He kind of put pressure on himself at times,\" Turner said. \"He was a perfectionist. But I say that more in a good way, that he demanded a lot of himself. He was such a great team guy.\" After leaving Chicago, Salaam's NFL career fizzled during 1999 stops with the Packers and Browns , and he was cut by the Raiders in 2000. He later tried to revive his career with the XFL's Memphis Maniax in 2001. Salaam was 20 when he was drafted and later admitted he wasn't mature enough to handle everything that came his way. He was also open about his excessive marijuana use during his early days in the NFL. \"When I got hurt, I knew (marijuana) was a problem because it pretty much consumed all my time,\" Salaam told ESPN in 1999. \"I wasn't going to practice or anything like that, so I pretty much spent a lot of my time sitting around and getting high, and that's when I knew I had to let it go. I wasn't outgoing. I was just to myself. All I wanted to do was go home and do what I wanted to do. I wasn't a social person. I was an outcast.\" Rumors of a possible suicide had Salaam's former teammates shaken. \"You wonder if there was somebody he could have talked to or something he could have gone to to help him with whatever situation he was going through,\" former Bears offensive lineman James \"Big Cat\" Williams said. \"It's weird, man, because you hear about all the things the NFL is doing to help the players that are playing now, but players that played in the past, no one thinks about those guys until something like this happens.\" Wannstedt recalled the bond Salaam forged as a rookie with Walter Payton, eager to soak in any advice he could from the Bears legendary running back. With Salaam's rookie success, Wannstedt said, there was sincere belief he could become \"the next Walter Payton\" for the Bears. When Payton died in 1999, Salaam reflected on his own heartbreak. \"When we lost him it was a sad time in football history,\" Salaam said in 2001. \"My career was going bad, but here's a man at a young age fighting for his life. It put things in perspective.\" Now Salaam, too, is gone at a young age. Green described Salaam as a driven player who was passionate about his job and could be harshly self-critical when he didn't succeed. But it was his personality, his demeanor as \"a big happy kid\" that will always stick with Green. \"There was a light that he had. He was very self-confident and had that spirit. And even though he was a young pup, he was very grounded in who he was. And he loved to laugh. He had that big, infectious smile that just drew you in. I'm going to try to keep that close to my heart in remembering him.\" \"Just the fact that the Heisman Trophy is going out again this weekend and then hearing this, it makes me even sadder,\" Green added. \"You wonder what he was going through mentally.\" Chicago Tribune's Brad Biggs contributed.

Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi leaves a  Catholic hospice in Cesano Boscone on May 9, 2014, after serving his first day of community service for tax fraud.

Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images He was a flamboyant, alpha-male billionaire who said things no career politician ever would \u2014 someone who promised to use his business savvy to reform the system and bring back jobs. Voters believed that his great wealth insulated him from corruption, because he couldn't be bought. But his administration was marked by criminal investigations and crony capitalism. Italian Prime Minister Silivo Berlusconi was \u2014 until Donald Trump came along \u2014 the best known example of a certain type of wealthy businessman who decides to go into politics, promising that, as an outsider, he is uniquely qualified to shake up the system, says Darrell West , vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Trump's Loans From Troubled German Bank Pose Conflict Of Interest \"Most of the time, they win, and for exactly the same reason that Trump did, which is [that] people like business people. They think they know how to create jobs and run the economy. It's a kind of white-knight phenomenon,\" West says. In the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Bidzina \"Boris\" Ivanishvili formed his own political party and was elected prime minister in 2012 after the sitting leader threatened to join NATO, West notes. At the time, Ivanishvili was worth more than $5 billion, about a third of his country's annual economic output. Other immensely wealthy people who have been elected to office include Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , as well as regional and local politicians in Austria, France, Australia and the Philippines. Many of these politicians succeed by assembling unconventional coalitions and displaying a willingness to think outside the box, West says. But in some cases, their immense wealth can become a problem. \"Over time, people notice that they're not separating their personal businesses from the government,\" West says. \"There is corruption. Their friends are getting rich. And by the end, they almost always suffer a big fall in popularity.\" Enlarge this image Thailand's deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra (left) and his wife Pojaman greeted supporters on arrival at a court in Bangkok in July 2008.

He was convicted on conflict of interest charges and lives in self-imposed exile. Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty Images Berlusconi came to office bragging that his wealth made him incorruptible, says Alexander Stille , author of The Sack of Rome: How a Beautiful European Country with a Fabled History and a Storied Culture Was Taken Over by a Man Named Silvio Berlusconi. But the Italian leader had a history of bribery and corruption, and his business interests were a lot more tenuous than anyone knew, Stille says. Article continues after sponsorship Once elected, Berlusconi set about trying to derail investigations into his conduct by rewriting Italy's penal code and giving immunity to business associates. He even made sure members of his defense team were elected to parliament, Stille says. \"It was a situation where the conflict of interest was massive and entered into some of the most important business of the Italian state,\" Stille says. Despite numerous corruption investigations and trials, Berlusconi clung to power for nine years total, resigning in 2011 after his party lost a parliamentary majority. He has since been convicted of tax fraud and abuse of power, though the latter conviction was subsequently overturned. The Berlusconi case illustrates what happens when politicians can pursue policies that benefit them financially, and underscores the need to set up strong firewalls between elected leaders and their business interests, says Meredith McGehee of Issue One , a group that works to get money out of politics. \"Those places where you've had these kinds of businessmen as leaders and they have not taken steps to take care of these conflicts \u2014 their administrations have become bogged down in scandal,\" McGehee says. Trump Sold Stocks In June, Lifting Some But Not All Conflicts Of Interest It also highlights some of the problems that could face President-elect Trump, who has said he will \"separate\" from his business operations, but so far provided no details. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said Tuesday that the president-elect sold all his stock holdings back in June. A federal disclosure form Trump filed in May suggests his shares were worth in the tens of millions of dollars, a fraction of his multi-billion-dollar fortune, which is largely made up of commercial real estate and golf courses. Trump's business holdings are widely expected to become an ethics minefield, presenting the new chief executive with numerous conflicts of interest . McGehee notes that the United States has often held itself up as a paradigm of clean government, lecturing other countries about the need for strong bribery laws and an independent legal system. Even the appearance of conflict of interest by the Trump administration threatens to undermine that, she says. \"The United States has been the shining light on these issues and has been respected around the world for how you deal with these conflicts,\" she says. \"And I would hate to see us lose that leadership.\" ",

    "text": "OPEN Interactive Graphic While insurers say they do not plan to fight the Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal the law, they are in no hurry to see it unwound. And Ms. Tavenner said the industry would support a delay so it could prepare for the changes. \u201cWe would love to see a three-year time frame, as long as possible,\u201d she said. The marketplaces, now three years old, have not become as robust as expected by many of the people behind the Affordable Care Act. Even President Obama, who pushed the law and the marketplaces through Congress, has suggested some improvements. Some of the largest insurers, like UnitedHealth and Aetna, have stopped selling policies on some of the state marketplaces after losing hundreds of millions of dollars, and other insurers say they are still debating whether to stay in the market. Many have raised their premiums sharply. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tavenner acknowledged that the current law \u201cneeded to be improved.\u201d But she emphasized that there was widespread agreement among Republicans about the need for some the law\u2019s provisions, including covering people with expensive medical conditions. President-elect Donald J. Trump has also signaled his support of this popular provision. \u201cThere are common starting platforms,\u201d she said. Ms. Tavenner did not give many details about her group\u2019s positions, but she said its top priority was to stop the immediate threat of eliminating the subsidies for plans sold to low-income people. House Republicans have already sued to block these payments, and the lawsuit is now delayed. If the new administration chose not to defend the lawsuit, the money would disappear, and insurers would probably rush to the exits because fewer potential customers would be available. Another of the industry\u2019s concerns is ensuring that enough young and healthy people sign up to stabilize the market. Republicans have discussed eliminating one of the law\u2019s main tools, the so-called individual mandate, a tax levied on those who do not enroll. In talking with Congress, Ms. Tavenner said, her members are emphasizing the need for some alternative, especially after criticism by insurers that the penalty is not large enough to persuade enough people to enroll. \u201cThere\u2019s not one magic solution,\u201d she said. She pointed to some of the provisions in Medicare that encourage people to sign up before they become sick. And she discussed some options to ease how insurers price their policies to be able to offer plans that are less expensive to younger people. She also argued that the insurers had no desire to return to the time before the law was passed, when people with pre-existing conditions were routinely denied coverage in the individual market. Still, the industry seems willing to embrace some of the ideas being discussed by Republicans, including giving individuals more choices of plans and more accountability for the cost of their health care. Republicans also seem eager to put the states in charge of some of the details of how coverage in both the individual market and Medicaid will look. Ms. Tavenner said the industry had a long history of working with state insurance regulators. Republicans are discussing other ways to stabilize the market, including the creation of high-risk pools, where people with expensive medical conditions might be covered, bringing down the coverage costs for everyone else. \u201cWe would hesitate to rush back to that,\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. In the past, those programs, typically run by the states, have not been adequately funded, she noted. The insurers are also beginning to discuss a potential overhaul of Medicare, pushed by the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who favors so-called premium support, or vouchers, as a way for people to find coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re not big fans of that approach,\u201d said Ms. Tavenner, although she said the industry would be open to discussing it. Ms. Tavenner said the industry wanted to know more about what the Republicans were planning, including information on the fate of the Medicaid expansion under the law. \u201cWe still have more questions than answers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disrupt individuals who are relying on our coverage,\u201d she said.

(Photo: Yoshikazu Tsuno, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Telecommunications giant SoftBank Group\u00a0plans to invest $50 billion into the U.S. economy, and add 50,000 jobs, president-elect Donald Trump announced in New York Tuesday. Trump made the announcement over Twitter after meeting with SoftBank CEO\u00a0Masayoshi Son for 45 minutes at Trump Tower.\u00a0The Japanese company\u00a0has a majority stake in Sprint,\u00a0whose plans to merge with rival T-Mobile were thwarted by the Obama Administration. Son did not say what specific investments\u00a0SoftBank would make, though he told the Wall Street Journal they would be part of a previously announced $100 billion tech investment fund. \u201cWe were talking about it, and then I said I\u2019d like to celebrate his presidential job,\u201d Son said during an impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower, in apparent reference to Trump's vow of\u00a0deregulation. Sprint ( S ) shares rallied\u00a0as much as 7%, to $8.61, hitting a new 52-week high, before ending 1.5% higher. T-Mobile shares rose 1.8%. In his unlikely march to the White House, Trump tirelessly campaigned on bringing more jobs to America, particularly in manufacturing regions hit hard by the recession and globalization. He took swings at companies like Apple for making most of their products outside the U.S. SoftBank is the second high-profile accord he\u2019s landed to underscore his message to voters. Last week, Trump announced a controversial deal to keep furnace manufacturer Carrier from outsourcing about 1,100 jobs to Mexico. Carrier will get $7 million in state tax incentives to keep the jobs in Indiana. Why Carrier's new deal could set a troubling precedent The name of SoftBank isn't a household word in the U.S., but its holdings are vast. Son, who became a billionaire through investments in Japan and China, is in the midst of raising a $100 billion investment fund with Saudi Arabia and others. He's had mixed results in the U.S. since SoftBank bought what is now an 80% stake in Sprint for $21.6 billion, and lost ground to telecom rivals such as T-Mobile. SoftBank also plunked down $32 billion this year to acquire ARM Holdings, a U.K.-based chip designer that makes parts for Apple's best-selling iPhone and other products. Apple asked Asian-based manufacturers\u00a0Foxconn and Pegatron\u00a0in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S., according to a report in\u00a0financial magazine\u00a0 Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Apple wouldn't comment. Son's handpicked successor, former Google executive Nikesh Arora, who joined in 2014 as head of its Silicon Valley Internet and media investment arm, abruptly left the Japanese tech giant in July. Son said at the time he planned to stay on for another five to 10 years. Arora had been criticized by investors for start-up investments as debt from the 2013 Sprint acquisition and slowing profit growth hampered SoftBank. Contributing: Jessica Guynn in San Francisco.

USA TODAY, Collin Brennan Workers sort absentee ballots as part of the Wisconsin recount  Thursday at the Iowa County Courthouse in Dodgeville. Thursday was the first day of recounting ballots from the presidential election. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein raised to pay the $3.5 million for the massive recount. (Photo: Mark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) Five states are now contending with requests for recounts of ballots cast in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is behind recount efforts in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, states where Republican Donald Trump won narrowly over Democrat Hillary Clinton. In Nevada, a partial recount of the race was requested by independent presidential candidate Roque De La Fuente. Clinton won in that state. And a motion was filed Tuesday in central Florida by three voters who say that the election in Florida, which went to Trump, was marred because of hacking, malfunctioning voting machines and other problems. Here's where each state stands Tuesday. WISCONSIN Workers continued Tuesday to recount nearly 3 million presidential ballots in the nation's first statewide presidential recount since 2004, which began Thursday. The recount has resulted in little change so far in the unofficial results as reported Nov. 8. Six counties had completed their work by Monday morning, with the margin between Trump and Clinton unchanged. Both candidates lost 20 votes. A federal lawsuit was filed late last week by a Trump voter and two super PACs seeking to stop the recount. The judge rejected a request to halt the recount while the lawsuit is pending and scheduled a hearing for Friday. Trump won Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes over Clinton. MICHIGAN Elections Director for Wayne County Delphine Oden, left, officially gets the recount started as she assists counters at one table during the Wayne County portion of the recount process for the presidential election Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, at Cobo Hall in Detroit. \u00a0(Photo: Regina H. Boone, Detroit Free Press) More counties joined Oakland and Ingham counties Tuesday after legal wrangling over Stein's request for a hand recount of nearly 4.8 million Michigan ballots cast for president delayed the start. Stein's campaign raised questions about the accuracy of the voting apparatus in Michigan, suggesting it could be susceptible to hacking, error or fraud. Shortly after midnight Monday \u2014 after a rare Sunday hearing in federal court \u2014 U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith ordered the recount to begin, dismissing claims from attorneys for Trump and the Michigan Republican Party that the recount was a waste of time and money with virtually no chance of changing the outcome of the election. Kalamazoo, Kent, Macomb, Ottawa, Washtenaw and Wayne counties began their recounts Tuesday morning, after Oakland and Ingham began Monday. Wayne's recount is, by far, the largest, with 1,680 precincts to be counted. Other counties will begin their recounts over the next week, with the last batch of counties in northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula starting Dec. 12. A spokesman for Republican Secretary of State Ruth Johnson said it's possible not all votes will be recounted in Wayne \u2014 and some other counties \u2014 because of improper seals on ballot boxes and other issues, such as poll book counts not matching the number of actual ballots cast on vote scanner machines. In such cases, the original vote would stand. Clinton won 67% of Wayne County's vote. Trump won the state by about 10,700 votes, or two-tenths of a percentage point, over Clinton. Stein finished a distant fourth with just over 51,000 votes. Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, the Trump campaign and super PACs have filed separate lawsuits asking state courts to prevent the recount, arguing that Stein, as the fourth-place finisher, is not \"aggrieved\" because she has no chance of winning in a recount. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday on those actions. Also Tuesday, a Republican-controlled committee in the state House approved legislation that would require statewide candidates who lose by more than 5 percentage points to pay 100% of the estimated recount cost. Those candidates now pay $125 per precinct, which in Stein's case is nearly $1 million. However, Johnson has said the recount may cost $5 million. The bill would retroactively apply to Stein, though Democrats \u2014 and at least one Republican \u2014 questioned the constitutionality of changing the rules \"in the middle of the game.\" PENNSYLVANIA Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein \u00a0(Photo: Associated Press) Green Party-backed lawyers were in a holding pattern Tuesday after asking a federal judge Monday to order a recount of the state\u2019s Nov. 8 presidential election result. A federal lawsuit filed in Philadelphia called for a recount and a forensic examination of the aging electronic voting machines used in most Pennsylvania counties, saying both are necessary to determine whether the election results were manipulated by hackers. The lawsuit said Pennsylvania\u2019s paperless voting machines make it a prime target for hacking, citing the election-season email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and attempts to breach election systems in other states. \u201cThe Pennsylvania election system is a national disgrace. Voters are forced to use vulnerable, hackable, antiquated technology banned in other states, then rely on the kindness of machines. There is no paper trail. Voting machines are electoral black sites: no one permits voters or candidates to examine them,\u201d the suit said. Pennsylvania elections officials have said there is no evidence that hackers tried to manipulate the vote. \u201cThe current machines worked perfect on November 8th,\u201d Lehigh County elections chief Tim Benyo emailed Monday. \u201cNo issues out of the ordinary.\u201d An updated count Monday by state election officials showed Trump's lead shrinking to 47,750 over Clinton, out of 6 million votes cast, as more counties finished counting overseas ballots and settled provisional ballot challenges. That is still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5% trigger for an automatic statewide recount. Final counts are outstanding in some counties, but there are not enough uncounted votes to change the outcome, officials say.

He paid about $14,000 for the recount to provide what he called a counterbalance to the recounts sought by Stein. Most of the 92 precincts being re-counted are in the Las Vegas area, with eight of the precincts in four other counties. If the sample shows a discrepancy of at least 1% for De La Fuente or Clinton, a full recount will be launched in all 17 Nevada counties. Clinton defeated Trump in Nevada by 27,202 votes, out of 1.1 million votes cast. Nevada secretary of state spokeswoman Gail Anderson said the recount will be finished by the end of this week.

In a lawsuit filed Monday in Leon Circuit Court, they assert that Clinton, not Trump, actually won Florida. The plaintiffs, who live in Osceola and Volusia counties, say the state\u2019s official election results were off because of hacking, malfunctioning voting machines and other problems. They're asking for a hand recount of every paper ballot in Florida, at the expense of defendants including Trump, Gov. Rick Scott and the 29 Republican presidential electors from Florida. Clint Curtis, an Orlando attorney representing the plaintiffs,\u00a0said\u00a0he has received a \u201cdeluge\u201d of reports from voters across the state of problems on Election Day, including people being turned away at the polls and told they\u2019d already voted. Florida Division of Elections officials reported only a few \"minor issues\" on Election Day. Curtis\u00a0said he hopes Trump, who has blasted recount efforts elsewhere, will get behind one in Florida. Officially, Trump got more than 4.6 million votes in Florida, beating Clinton by more than 112,000 votes. \u201cHe\u2019s mentioned he wants to fix the rigged system,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will give the opportunity to do that. If it were a normal politician, I\u2019d say our chances are very slim. But it\u2019s not a normal politician \u2014 it\u2019s Donald Trump.\u201d Contributing: Kathleen Gray and Paul Egan, Detroit Free Press; Jeff Burlew, Tallahassee (Fla.)

Cubans watch Air Force One land in Havana this year when President Obama became the first U.S. commander in chief in nearly nine decades to visit the nation while in office. (Rolando Pujol / European Pressphoto Agency) W.J. Hennigan Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands. The aircraft used by President Obama , built by Chicago-based Boeing Co.,\u00a0have\u00a0been in service since the Reagan administration and are due to reach the end of a\u00a030-year design life in 2017. Boeing, which has built presidential jets since the early 1960s, has been doing early development work on the replacement likely to be outfitted with the latest in gadgetry, including top-secret communications equipment, countermeasures to spoil missile attacks, and aerial refueling capability so it can fly for days without landing. President-elect Donald Trump wants Boeing\u2019s contract for a new Air Force One canceled The aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been in service since the Reagan administration and are due to reach the end of a 30-year design life in 2017. The aircraft used by President Obama, built by Chicago-based Boeing Co., have been in service since the Reagan administration and are due to reach the end of a 30-year design life in 2017. See more videos Trump would not get a chance to fly in a new\u00a0Air Force One unless he is reelected; the replacement isn't slated to begin flying until 2024\u00a0at the earliest. So far, Boeing has been given three contracts amounting to $170 million to develop the aircraft, which is based on the new and larger version of the 747 dubbed the 747-8 Intercontinental. \u201cBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday that he thought the Air Force One program was \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cBoeing is doing a little bit of a number,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want Boeing to make a lot of money \u2014 but not that much money.\u201d As president-elect, Trump has no power to cancel procurements, but the Air Force has yet to issue a\u00a0contract for the next-generation Air Force One, which will include at least\u00a0two planes.\u00a0 Federal budget documents published in February estimated research, test and development costs on the program to be around $2.87 billion through fiscal year 2021.\u00a0The figure doesn\u2019t include the costs of new\u00a0planes, however. When that is factored in, the price tag may be around $4 billion, U.S. officials said. \u201cWe are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,\u201d Boeing said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" It is rare for a president-elect to publicly call out a company by name because of the chilling effect it might have, and it wasn\u2019t clear what prompted Trump\u2019s complaint. Boeing\u2019s shares were down $2 in early trading after Trump\u2019s tweet, but recovered throughout the day, closing\u00a0up 8 cents, or .05%, to $152.24. The latest episode raised questions about Trump\u2019s potential conflicts in light of his undisclosed financial holdings, and whether he held Boeing stock at the time of the tweet. Trump sold all his Boeing stock in June,\u00a0transition spokesman Jason Miller insisted, though no documentation was made public. ",

Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Last year the Air Force struck an agreement with Boeing to deliver two new 747s around 2024, by which time the two planes now in service for presidential travel will be more than 30 years old. The new models will be able to fly about 1,000 miles farther than the current planes. They'll also be slightly larger and faster, but will have a smaller carbon footprint. Article continues after sponsorship Fake Or Real? How To Self-Check The News And Get The Facts \"The presidential aircraft is one of the most visible symbols of the United States of America and the office of the president of the United States,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said at the time. While affordability was listed as a top concern for the Air Force, the presidential planes include special features that drive up the cost, including secure communications equipment, counterterrorism features and capability for in-flight refueling. The Air Force did not respond right away to Trump's complaint about the planes' cost. But Boeing put out the following statement: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" Similar concerns were raised in the early weeks of the Obama administration over costs for a new fleet of presidential helicopters. That $13 billion project was eventually canceled, but not before Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., needled the new president over the high price tag. Biden Hints He's Leaving The Door Open To A 2020 Run Obama agreed the effort to upgrade Marine One was too extravagant. \"The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me,\" Obama said at the time. \"Of course, I've never had a helicopter before, you know? Maybe I've been deprived and didn't know it.\" ",

By Christian Davenport December 6 at 10:22 AM Follow @wapodavenport Shortly after tweeting that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled, Dec. 6, President-elect Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower he wants the company \"to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing\u2019s contract\u00a0to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Boeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn\u2019t much of a competition.\u00a0Boeing\u2019s 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \u201cconsistent with the national public interest,\u201d Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. She insisted that the Pentagon \u201cwill insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\u201d [ Boeing chosen to build the next Air Force One ] Talking to reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: \u201cThe plane is totally out of control. It\u2019s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d And in a call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said that Trump plans to closely examine the Pentagon\u2019s budget and look for areas where he can find savings. \u201cI think this really speaks to the president-elect\u2019s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we\u2019re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.\u201d The entire cost of the program, including development costs, is expected to reach $4 billion, according an analysis by\u00a0Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In a statement, Boeing said that so far it is only under contract for $170 million. And that\u2019s not yet for manufacturing,\u00a0but rather \u201cto help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\u201d An Air Force official, not authorized to speak publicly about the program, said that the current plane will be 30 years old next year, and the new ones aren\u2019t slated to come online until the mid-2020s. By then the technology aboard the current plane will be dated and it will become increasingly hard to maintain it. Any delays to replace it could cause significant problems, the official said. Air Force One. (Carsten Koall/Getty Images) Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump\u2019s tweet was \u201ccompletely nonsensical\u00a0and based on exactly nothing. But it\u2019s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.\u201d Loren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that \u201cAir Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances \u2014 like nuclear war.\u201d The price tag, he said, \u201cis driven by the demands of the mission.\u201d Boeing is under contract\u00a0to build two planes to serve as Air Force One. \u201cI think once [Trump]\u00a0sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,\u201d Harrison said. Air Force One is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad, servicing under the call sign \u201cAir Force One\u201d when the president is on board. But it is also a \u201cflying command post,\u201d as Harrison said. \u201cIn the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.\u201d [ Why we can\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 ignore Donald Trump\u2019s tweets ] President Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was \u201can example of the procurement process gone amok \u201d leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process.\u00a0By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems. But Air Force One is different, Harrison said, because \u201cit\u2019s still very, very early. It hasn\u2019t had a chance to have any cost overruns yet.\u201d\u00a0He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule. But this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events: \u201cTaxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cA total disgrace!\u201d He\u00a0brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. \u201cNow Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d Trump reported owning between $50,001 and $100,000 in Boeing stock in his most recent financial disclosure, which was filed in May 2016 and disclosed his 2015 holdings. He sold the shares in June, according to his spokesman. Boeing\u2019s stock was down\u00a00.64 percent in morning trading. Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. Read more: ",

(Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan remained far apart on a new budget Tuesday, unable to even agree on a way forward for negotiations. The two sides gathered at the Thompson Center following weekend talks, with Madigan emerging from the closed-door huddle to say he proposed restarting so-called working groups of rank-and-file lawmakers to discuss items on Rauner's legislative wish list. Rauner's Republicans said they were not interested in the working group idea, which was attempted earlier this year, and once again accused Democrats of stalling to create a crisis. The governor kept out of the spotlight, instead issuing a statement that again called on Madigan and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton to approve two of his more controversial legislative proposals: term limits and a permanent property tax freeze for local governments. Rauner has named that as his price for another stopgap spending plan. Tuesday's meeting was the continuation of a postelection exercise that began last week when the governor and legislative leaders held meetings at the Capitol as a temporary stopgap spending plan that has kept state services afloat is set to expire at month's end. But the Jan. 1 deadline hasn't caused a sense of urgency among Democrats, the Republicans said. \"No one's jumping out of their chair to get this done,\" House Republican leader Jim Durkin said of the opposition party following the meeting. Democratic leaders on Sunday said they need more information to formulate a comprehensive budget plan, including the potential effects of an incoming Donald Trump administration, but Republicans called the request a stall tactic aimed at creating financial havoc with a short-term state spending... Democratic leaders on Sunday said they need more information to formulate a comprehensive budget plan, including the potential effects of an incoming Donald Trump administration, but Republicans called the request a stall tactic aimed at creating financial havoc with a short-term state spending... (Rick Pearson) Indeed, Madigan downplayed the urgency of the deadline, pointing out that the stopgap spending plan provides a full year of funding for primary and secondary education, as well as capital construction \u2014 meaning that some, but not all, of the spending will expire with the new year. At risk is funding for higher education, human services and some government operations, Madigan said. The speaker, who has been the target of pre- and postelection attacks by the Rauner-led Illinois Republican Party, tried to pin the blame on the governor. \"The truth is, the governor held hostage the budget-making to help his wealthy friends and large corporations,\" said Madigan, reviving a theme that he has employed periodically during his nearly two-year budget standoff with Rauner. The speaker was asked repeatedly to explain the accusation but ignored the questions. Moments later, the Illinois Republican Party blasted out an email that charged, \"Mike Madigan says state government is a democracy, but runs it like a dictatorship.\" The notion that Madigan, who has been speaker for all but two years since 1983, has the levers of state power in his grip and is the cause of Illinois' financial woes is something Rauner has pushed. Bruce Rauner and legislative leaders provided little if any headway on a budget deal to keep state government running into the new year, with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan declaring \"a lack of trust with the Rauner administration.\" Madigan's... A closed-door meeting Saturday between Gov. Bruce Rauner and legislative leaders provided little if any headway on a budget deal to keep state government running into the new year, with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan declaring \"a lack of trust with the Rauner administration.\" Madigan's... (Monique Garcia, Jeff Coen and Rick Pearson) That the campaign-style rhetoric continues less than a month after Election Day is a sign of the political stickiness of the situation. At the center of the budget fight is the reality that Illinois is spending far more than it brings in. Much of that overspending occurred after Democratic lawmakers, at the incoming governor's urging, decided in late 2014 to allow a temporary income tax hike to roll back as scheduled, but failed to adjust spending levels to reflect the loss of revenue. Since then, both sides have acknowledged a tax increase and budget cuts will be necessary to balance the state's books. But Democrats have said they won't use their majorities to approve a politically unpopular increase on their own. And Rauner has said he won't put Republicans on board unless Democrats first grant him some items on his legislative wish list. The list is a shifting collection of ideas, including limits on claims that can be made by injured workers, curbing collective bargaining rights, term limits on elected officials and a property tax freeze on local governments. Madigan and Cullerton, backed by unions and trial lawyers, have long resisted those ideas, saying they would hurt the middle class. Rauner contends the changes are needed to make the state more business-friendly and promote economic growth. In an indication of how fraught the process has become, neither side could agree Tuesday on how things would proceed at their next meeting, currently scheduled for Thursday morning in Chicago. Durkin said Republicans had asked the Democrats to bring with them \"parameters on budgeting\" that would detail \"what is acceptable in their eyes.\" Cullerton said that request would have to go both ways. \"We'd want to know what their parameters are too,\" Cullerton said. \"So that'll be a good discussion. It wouldn't be just our parameters, right?\" kgeiger@chicagotribune.com ",

In a unanimous ruling, the court said Samsung does not have to pay all the profits it earned from the sale of eleven different versions of its smartphones. Instead the court said Samsung must pay only for infringing Apple's patents on some elements of the iPhone's design. Play Historic Samsung-Apple Showdown Arrives at U.S. Supreme Court 1:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161206233049if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/783764547899\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Apple claimed that Samsung copied many of the distinctive features of the iPhone, including the rectangular shape with rounded corners, black translucent front screen, and grid display of colorful icons for applications. Two lower courts ruled in Apple's favor. The lower courts said Samsung must give up all its profits from the smartphone sales, which a jury found to be nearly $400 million. The rulings were based on a federal law that says a company which copies and applies a patented design to \"any article of manufacture\" is liable \"to the extent of his total profit.\" Samsung urged the Supreme Court to rule that it made no sense to apply the law to a complicated product like a smartphone, and the court agreed. Interpreting the law to mean only an entire product \"gives too narrow a meaning to the phrase,\" wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Tuesday's ruling sends the case back to the lower courts to figure out the exact nature of Samsung's patent violations and the amount it owes Apple. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers had urged the justices to rule for Samsung. A victory for Apple, they said in a friend of court brief, would have \"a devastating impact on companies that spend billions of dollars annually on research and development for complex technological products and their components.\" Pete Williams ",

Osorio / Chicago Tribune \u00a0Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio\u00a0could be on his way out at Halas Hall.\u00a0 \u00a0Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio\u00a0could be on his way out at Halas Hall.\u00a0 (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Mike Mulligan There is nothing like losing to stir gossip in NFL circles. It's not unusual to hear one whopper after another. And when dubious stories are repeated often enough, they can be mistaken as truth. With that warning comes a surprisingly widespread belief in NFL circles that Bears coach John Fox will be parting ways with one of his coordinators in the offseason. And it is not the guy you think it is. Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is rumored to be winding down his time with the team as part of a massive overhaul anticipated at the end of the season. It sounds like a tall tale when you consider the Bears' problem has been a lack of continuity because of injury and suspension, along with a number of less-than-stellar game plans on offense. Most observers expect changes at quarterback, and Dowell Loggains has appeared on shaky ground virtually since the day he was promoted to offensive coordinator. The idea that Fox is displeased with Fangio or the coordinator is unhappy in his job sounds absurd but has been the subject of speculation for over a month. \"It has to be some kind of philosophical thing like you saw in Minnesota,'' one league source said. \"It's so out of left field, it might be absolutely correct.'' The Minnesota reference is to the resignation earlier this season of offensive coordinator Norv Turner , who left the team just as the Vikings started to fall apart after a hot start. Turner's decision was a response to philosophical differences with coach Mike Zimmer. Turner is an offensive guy who likes to attack with long passes off play action and was a student of the Don Coryell school of football. Zimmer is a defensive-minded head coach who prefers running the ball and using a short passing game. It's unlikely the Bears would substantiate any conflicts within the coaching staff, so there will be no telling the veracity of the rumors until after the season. Fox and Fangio both come from a defensive background with the Bears running a 3-4 front in large part because it is Fangio's specialty. Fox had always run a 4-3 scheme as a coordinator and head coach although he used a flexible front more often in Denver than in previous stops. The Bears have been building their team and drafting players to fit a 3-4 system, so it is unlikely they would change scheme. The Bears' strength lies in its defensive front seven, where guys like Akiem Hicks , Eddie Goldman, Pernell McPhee and Leonard Floyd are best suited to a 3-4. Philosophical differences may refer to how often they use pressure packages or disagreement on coverage schemes. Fox, insiders say, will return for a third season despite the team's failures this year. He will be reworking his offensive staff and now may also be looking at changes in his defensive staff. It's unknown if respected defensive assistants like Ed Donatell, who came with Fangio from San Francisco or Clint Hurtt, a carryover from the last administration, would want to stay without Fangio. Fox came to the Bears with a reputation as the mayor of NFL coaches with endless lists of guys who wanted to work with him. Jobs in Chicago won't be as attractive if he enters a third year with a losing record and expectations waning. With Fangio, the defensive players have remained believers despite all the losing. Without him, might they become agnostic? There are always two enemies in the NFL \u2014 the one within as seen with doubt and a loss of confidence. And an equally dangerous opponent outside spreading rumors and disharmony to break a team apart. The truth will unfold one way or the other.

The United States, Obama said is \"breaking the backs\" of ISIS and suggested that radically shifting strategies in fighting the rise of terrorism could upend that progress. \"We need the wisdom to see that upholding our values and adhering to the rule of law is not a weakness, in the long run it is our greatest strength,\" he said. \"The whole objective of these terrorists is to scare us into changing the nature of who we are and our democracy,\" he added. The president highlighted the need for tolerance and adherence to rule of law during the address at Florida's MacDill Air Force Base Monday afternoon. \"We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam,\" Obama said adding that ISIS and other extremists do not speak for Muslims around the world or in America. \"If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists' narrative,\" he said. Obama highlighted his administration's efforts in the ongoing fight against ISIS, saying that since he took office the terror group \"has lost more than half its territory\" and recruitment was on the decline. \"We should take great pride in the progress that we've made over the last eight years,\" he said. President Obama during a U.S. counter-terrorism strategy speech at MacDill Air Force Base Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, in Tampa, Fla. Chris O'Meara / AP But the president also acknowledged that \"in some form this violent extremism will be with us for years to come.\" Obama then turned to words of guidance and warnings for the future, saying the nation needs to continue to uphold its values and that \"fencing ourselves from the rest of the world\" would harm the U.S.'s long-term strategy. Obama said his administration was able to gain crucial information without resorting to torture and \"operating outside the law\" \u2014 seemingly drawing a contrast between his style of governance and President-elect Donald Trump, who during his campaign said \"torture works\" and that waterboarding was \"not nearly tough enough.\" A Senate Torture report from 2014 said enhanced interrogation tactics did not help to retrieve information from prisoners. Obama also called for the need to close Guantanamo Bay, another area where he and Trump differ. In addition, Obama stressed the need to make sure the country's efforts a combating terrorism do not unfairly infringe on the rights of its citizens and said his own administration had placed new restrictions on the government's ability to conduct surveillance on individuals. \"By maintaining these civil liberties, we sustain the confidence of the American people,\" he said, adding that it makes citizens more likely to help the government. \"Protecting liberty, that's something we do for all Americans \u2014 and not just some,\" he said, drawing applause from the audience. The president told the audience that the United States was not a country that \"imposed religious freedom tests\" for others or \"where some citizens have to withstand greater scrutiny or carry an ID card.\" \"We're a nation that believes freedom can never be taken for granted,\" he said. The statements again appeared to reference to Trump's comments during the campaign in which he said he would \"certainly implement\" a database system for tracking Muslims in an interview in November 2015. Trump's transition team has since claimed that Trump never advocated for a Muslim registry. The president also urged for the need \"for the universal right to speak your mind\" and the ability to \"protest against authority\" and live in a country where one could \"criticize a president without retribution,\" again drawing applause. The president concluded by asking service members to remember America's past and \"remember what that flag stands for, for we depend on you as the heirs to that legacy.\" \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve of your Commander in Chief, I thank you for all that you've done,\" he said.

Alison Yin/Invision for Nintendo/Facebook Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube say they are creating a database to keep track of terrorist recruitment videos and other terror-related images that have been removed from their services. In a joint statement posted by Facebook on Monday, the company said: \"Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of 'hashes' \u2014 unique digital 'fingerprints' \u2014 for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. \"By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\" The collaboration will allow companies to cross reference videos and pictures that show up on their services with a database of those that have already been removed from other services. For example, if a video glorifying violence in the name of the Islamic State has been removed from Twitter, it will be assigned a unique \"fingerprint\" which will be stored in the database. If the same video shows up on Facebook, Facebook will be able to match the video and, if it chooses, to remove it. Article continues after sponsorship The choice about whether to remove such content falls to the companies, although videos and images related to terrorist or extremist organizations can also be pertinent to law enforcement. As we have reported , identifying what is, or is not, terrorist imagery can be challenging for tech companies. For example, last year Facebook removed (at least temporarily) a parody photo posted by journalist Sultan Al-Qassemi depicting a rainbow pride filter over a picture of the leader of ISIS. Another Facebook user had taken it literally, and flagged it for containing \"graphic violence.\" It was unclear whether the photo was permanently removed by the company. Twitter said earlier this year that it had \"increased the size of the teams that review reports,\" and suspended more than 125,000 accounts since mid-2015 \u2014 that number has since grown to about 360,000 \u2014 for what it called connections to terrorist or extremist groups. But NPR's Aarti Shahani reported that Twitter noted there's no \"magic algorithm\" to identify terrorist content on the Internet, and that it was forced to decide who to ban based on \"very limited information and guidance.\" ",

Lurie Children's Hospital has been named one of the state's top hospitals by the Leapfrog Group. Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital has been named one of the state's top hospitals by the Leapfrog Group. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Lisa Schencker Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Ten Illinois hospitals drew top honors this year for patient safety as part of the Leapfrog Group's annual ratings. Hospitals that completed surveys for The Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit that evaluates hospital performance for consumers and employers, were judged on a number of patient safety measures. Hospitals with intensive care units, for example, had to make sure those units were managed by doctors trained in critical care medicine. Hospitals had to receive a patient safety grade of A from Leapfrog. And hospitals had to comply with Leapfrog's policy for responding to errors that should never occur \u2014 a protocol that includes apologizing to the patient and family, waiving costs, reporting the event to an external agency and analyzing why the event occurred. Hospitals also had to meet a number of other requirements. Larry Boress, president and CEO of the Midwest Business Group on Health, which helps facilitate the Leapfrog survey in Illinois, said the ratings are a useful tool for consumers and employers trying to make decisions about which hospitals they'd like to see their employee plans include. \"When you have a choice of where to go for your delivery or surgery or knee replacement, we know that there is tremendous variation in quality and safety,\" Boress said. \"By identifying the top hospitals \u2026 you can then determine whether you have a better chance of surviving a surgery, as well as readmissions and accidents.\" Not all Illinois hospitals chose to participate in the survey. More than 65 percent of Chicago-area hospitals participated in the survey this year, and about 53 percent of hospitals statewide participated. The Leapfrog Group is one of a number of organizations that releases hospital ratings each year. Ratings can often vary from group to group, as each organization uses a different methodology to evaluate hospitals. Leapfrog named 115 top hospitals across the nation this year, including these 10 in Illinois: \u2022AMITA Health St. Alexius Medical Center, Hoffman Estates \u2022Ann & Robert H.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is the future of manufacturing \u2014 much more so than the 1,000 jobs saved at the Carrier plant in Indiana last week. And Tesla\u2019s challenges are a microcosm of the trade issues that confound so many American manufacturers: To sell its cars in China, Tesla faces tariffs and other disincentives that make its vehicles 40 percent more expensive than locally produced electric cars, according to Mr. Musk. If you flip it around, China faces only a nominal tax to sell electric cars and parts in the United States. The situation is fairly similar in much of Europe. Still, conservative groups and individuals have taken to the internet with a litany of real and fake stories attacking Mr. Musk for the government subsidies Tesla receives, and for his vocal warnings on climate change . Photo Elon Musk talks about the Model X car at Tesla\u2019s headquarters, in Fremont, Calif., in September 2015. Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press Robert E. Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy Corporation, the largest privately owned coal company, called Mr. Musk \u201ca fraud\u201d for accepting $2 billion in government subsidies for Tesla. Mr. Musk, fighting back on Twitter, wrote of Mr. Murray, a Republican who doesn\u2019t believe human activity is affecting the climate: \u201cReal fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for \u2018subsidies\u2019, Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero?\u201d There is some evidence that the president-elect will be flexible on the issues Mr. Musk champions. On Monday, Mr. Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore, whose name is synonymous with the effort to fight global warming, and Mr. Gore told reporters that the session had been \u201clengthy and very productive . \u201d And in an interview at The New York Times on Nov. 22, Mr. Trump said he would keep an open mind on the subject. To Mr. Musk\u2019s critics, he and the subsidies that have been offered to companies like his \u2014 mostly in the form of federal clean-energy tax credits and rebates \u2014 represent the \u201cswamp\u201d that Mr. Trump says he wants to \u201cdrain.\u201d Separately, Jim Chanos, the investor who has bet against the price of Tesla\u2019s shares, called Mr. Musk\u2019s merger of Tesla and SolarCity, both of which he controlled, a \u201cshameful example of corporate governance at its worst.\u201d Some analysts denounced Mr. Musk as a \u201ccorporate governmental mess\u201d and others have called him a huckster. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, while Mr. Musk gets painted as a benefactor of crony capitalism and the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to promote green energy, he is \u2014 perhaps counterintuitively \u2014 a prime example of everything we want our business leaders to be. What other chief executive do you know who takes only $1 a year in salary and has never sold a share of Tesla except to pay taxes? Yes, he pays taxes \u2014 to the tune of some $600 million in just the past year. He has about as much skin in the game as any C.E.O. in the country. (If you\u2019re asking how he pays to live, he has taken out a series of loans from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, using his shares as collateral. For some, that raises its own corporate governance concerns. However, the loans represent only about 5 percent of his net worth, so unless shares of Tesla fall precipitously, he should be able to cover the loan amounts.) And when questions arose about whether Tesla would be able to pay off SolarCity\u2019s debt after the two companies merged, Mr. Musk declared, \u201cI would pay it personally if need be.\u201d That\u2019s putting your money where your mouth is. As for the government subsidies offered to the electric car industry, Mr. Musk has made a compelling case that he would benefit more if the subsidies didn\u2019t exist. ",

Instead, the company envisions customers at the Amazon Go store picking up whatever they want off the shelves \u2014 then simply walking out with it. The items are automatically billed to their Amazon accounts. Details about how the technology actually works are sparse. \"We used computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion much like you'd find in self-driving cars,\" a narrator says in a video from Amazon . \"We call it Just Walk Out Technology.\" YouTube The 1,800-square-foot retail store in Seattle will offer ready-made meals and some grocery basics, according to the website . The company says it is testing the store with its own employees and plans to open to the public in 2017. And while Amazon has not spelled out how it works in full, \"retail tech specialists and computer vision experts agree that Amazon's advertised system is entirely plausible given the state of artificial intelligence, RFID, sensor and machine learning technologies today,\" according to Wired . Article continues after sponsorship Others are more skeptical \u2014 for example, an editorial in Forbes calls the plan \"all hype\" during the high-volume holiday shopping season. It points out that Amazon regularly rolls out high-profile plans at this time of year, like the drone delivery program. This isn't Amazon's first experiment with a brick-and-mortar store \u2014 it launched a bookstore last year in Seattle, as The New York Times reports , and has since added locations in San Diego and Portland. And according to multiple reports, this is one of several experiments that Amazon is launching with the hope of capturing the lucrative market for groceries. The Wall Street Journal says the retail giant is interested in starting a store that \"combines in-store shopping with curbside pickups.\" \"You can bet that there are grocers that are quaking in their boots,\" as Shoptalk retail strategist Sucharita Mulpuru tells Marketplace . She adds that groceries have posed challenges for online retailers: \"It has stubbornly stayed offline more than just about every other e-commerce category.\" Marketplace pointed out that IBM attempted a checkout-free store previously, but the sensor tags ended up being too expensive.

    "text": "White Sox on verge of deal to send Chris Sale to Red Sox Photos of five-time All-Star Chris Sale. Colleen Kane Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The White Sox rebuilding project will begin with a blast to its rotation as the Sox were on the verge of sending ace left-hander Chris Sale to the\u00a0Red Sox on Tuesday afternoon at the winter meetings. A major-league source said the deal was not officially done yet, but infielder Yoan Moncada and right-hander Michael Kopech would headline a four-player return. Moncada was ranked the No. 1 prospect in all of baseball in 2016 by Baseball America and MLB.com. Outfielder Luis Basabe and right-hander Victor Diaz round out the return. A top-five finisher in American League Cy Young voting for each of the last four years, Sale has been the face of the Sox franchise. But a rotation that also includes fellow All-Star Jose Quintana has not been able to lift the Sox out of a streak of eight straight years without the postseason, and that has the Sox embarking on a change of course. With Sale gone, the Sox almost certainly will move on to a list of veteran players, some with several years of team control, that could also be dealt for more prospects. Sox general manager Rick Hahn said Monday the organization was excited about a potential new course but also acknowledged such a project would take patience from the team and the fans. \u201cI know from the fans I hear from, the middle of the night voicemails I get and letters I receive, that people are ready for there to be a change in approach in how we\u2019re doing things,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this for the long term, and if in the short term there\u2019s potentially some hardship along the way, we know that\u2019s the natural price you pay.\u201d Late Monday night, national reports indicated the Sox were progressing in talks to trade the ace left-hander to the Nationals for a package of prospects that would jumpstart the club\u2019s efforts to restock their farm system with an eye on contending down the road. But the Nationals weren\u2019t the only team with interest in the five-time All-Star, and the Red Sox made a late push. In his second season in professional baseball, Moncada, 21, hit .294 with 31 doubles, six triples, 15 home runs, 94 runs scored 45 stolen bases and a .918 OPS at the Class A and Double A levels. He received a major-league call-up and played in eight games, hitting .211 with a double, an RBI and 12 strikeouts. Kopech, 20, is a hard-throwing right-hander who was ranked No. 67 among MLB.com\u2019s top prospects and No. 93 midseason by Baseball America. He was limited to 12 minor-league games this year due to injury, posting a 2.08 ERA, 33 walks and 86 strikeouts over 56 1/3 innings with two Class A teams. But Kopech was named to the Arizona Fall League's All-Prospect team after posting a 3-0 record with 26 strikeouts in 22 innings for Surprise. Six of Kopech's eight walks occurred in one game. He was limited this year after fracturing his hand in a fight with his roommate. He has also served a 50-game suspension last year for violating the minor-league drug policy. On Oct. 2, the White Sox will finish their eighth straight season without making the playoffs, completing a turbulent year in which they gave fans brief glimpses of hope before crushing them with dreadful losses. The Sox played a better brand of baseball, with fewer defensive and baserunning mistakes, than in the last three losing seasons. But an inconsistent offense that didn't give its pitchers enough cushion and a thin bullpen that leads the American League with 28 blown saves in 69 opportunities were the major culprits in the team\u2019s demise, with a fair share of starting pitching flops along the way. While the Sox won some games they shouldn't have, here's a look at 10 of the most deflating losses of the season, ones that made fans bury their faces in their hands or wonder what might have been if they had avoided the monster collapses. (Colleen Kane) Outfielder Luis Alexander Basabe, not to be confused with his \u00a0twin brother, infielder Luis Alejandro Basabe, is a center-field prospect who reached High-A in 2016. Basabe, 20, hit .264 with 24 doubles, eight triples, 12 home runs, 61 runs scored, 119 strikeouts and a .780 OPS. Diaz, 22, is a reliever in his second season in the minors. He owns a 3.00 ERA, 22 saves, 41 walks, 98 strikeouts over 93 professional innings pitched. Basabe was ranked the No. 8 prospect in the Red Sox system, while Diaz was ranked No. 28 among Red Sox prospects. But to be certain, the Sox will miss Sale. The No. 13 overall draft pick in 2010, Sale, 27 finishes his career with the Sox 74-50 with a 3.00 ERA, 14 complete games, two shutouts and 1,244 strikeouts in seven seasons with the club. He is the team single-season record-holder with 274 strikeouts, set in 2015. He went 17-10 with a 3.34 ERA over a career-high 226 2/3 innings this year, at the end of which he acknowledged a trade was a possibility. The Sox had weighed the possibility at the trade deadline in August. \u201cThis is sports -- anything can happen,\u201d Sale said after his final start of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate that happening or necessarily really want that to happen, but it could.\u201d But Sale also talked about hoping for a better 2017 season with the Sox under new manager Rick Renteria. \u00a0\u201cWe leave with an empty feeling inside,\u201d Sale said. \u201cBut next year we have a group of guys in here, and we\u2019ve talked about it in recent weeks to make some changes around here, doing some things better collectively as players to put a better product on the field.\u201d Sale leaves the organization after a tumultuous year in the clubhouse. In spring training, he defiantly spoke out about Sox executive vice president Ken Williams after veteran Adam LaRoche retired because of a disagreement about his son\u2019s clubhouse time. Sale said the team \u201cgot (bald)-faced lied to by someone we are supposed to be able to trust\u201d and added, \u201cSomebody walked out those doors the other day, and it was the wrong guy, plain and simple.\u201d The Sox eventually moved on from LaRoche\u2019s retirement, but Sale wasn\u2019t done creating headlines off the field. In July, he cut up his and his teammates\u2019 throwback jerseys because he was upset about being asked to wear a uniform he found uncomfortable while pitching. He was suspended five days for insubordination and destroying team equipment and later said he was upset with then-manager Robin Ventura for not standing up for his players in the dispute. The Sox, however, acknowledged that such fire was also what made him an outstanding competitor on the mound. Sale now will bring that competitiveness to the Red Sox. ",

    "text": "The United States and Russia begin talks this week on the fighting in Aleppo, Syria. Russia's foreign minister says he expects a deal to withdraw... The extremists gave Marza a scrap of paper signed and stamped by ISIS, allowing him safe passage: \u201cThe infidel Christian Abdo Marza wants to negotiate between us and their church for money. Please facilitate his task from the checkpoints in three days.\u201d The bishop, Mar Afram Athneil, took three days to answer as he consulted with others in the church around the world on what to do. Finally he gave Marza a sealed envelope to take back to ISIS. When Marza returned and handed the envelope to the ISIS leader, he said, he had no idea of the message inside or what it would mean for his fate and his daughter\u2019s. But the extremist broke into a smile. \u201cYour bishop is a very smart man.\u201d With that, little Maryam was freed. Athneil began secret negotiations for the more than 200 others, but it took a while before Assyrians realized what had happened. In California, filmmaker Sargon Saadi packed his gear and headed back to a homeland he had left a decade before, hoping to find out what had happened to the Khabur villages. He found them deserted, but for a handful of ill-equipped Assyrian fighters. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know why they took them, we didn\u2019t know where they took them, what they wanted to do with them,\u201d Saadi said. Were they going to be enslaved, traded, ransomed? The answer filtered down from the bishop: ISIS wanted money. The price was daunting. The militants\u2019 starting demand of $50,000 a person would mean more than $11 million for the entire group. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to give them money. It\u2019s very dangerous, it\u2019s also illegal in many countries,\u201d Saadi said. \u201cAnd the money they were asking for, no one could afford that kind of money.\u201d In Canada, after an emergency meeting, Canadian Assyrians pooled around $100,000 to help the Khabur Christians and sent it off to the church to use wherever it could do the most good, Nissan said. \u201cEvery Assyrian I know knows somebody that was either kidnapped or directly affected by the kidnapping,\u201d he said. In the German rustbelt town of Saarlouis, a chain-smoking Assyrian entrepreneur who owned two restaurants suddenly found a cause more important than his businesses. Charli Kanoun had persuaded the government there to accept the freed Tal Goran hostages. His next task was to raise money for the rest. \u201cEveryone contributed; the church opened an account in Irbil, Iraq, and announced it on the internet so everyone can donate,\u201d Kanoun said. On the outskirts of London, Andy Darmoo ran the Assyrian Church of the East Relief Organization in addition to a crystal chandelier business. He was one of the first people the bishop had alerted about the ransom demand. Darmoo and just a handful of Assyrians were the only ones who knew exactly how many Christians had been taken: 226.\u00a0 Zammo Marza, Sherineh Marza, Charli Kanoun and Abdo Marza, from right, stand at the grave of Marza Marza in Saarlouis, Germany in this Monday, Nov. 7, 2016 photo.\u00a0 Michael Probst, AP In Australia, Nicholas al-Jeloo, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne whose cousins were among the hostages, gave a slide presentation on the history of the Khabur at a local church hall. Much - but not all - of the audience was from the Assyrian community, and more than 500 people donated that night, he said. Al-Jeloo spent his childhood in Australia hearing about the trials inflicted upon the Assyrian people, how they managed to stick together, keeping the same dialects, the same customs, and even the same village names as they moved from Turkey to Iraq and finally to Syria. He himself had visited there to complete his family tree. The calls for donations went out across social media, but primarily on Facebook, where second cousins and friends of friends found themselves in the same networks, anxiously asking for solid news or, failing that, rumors. On May 26, two elderly women were freed. On June 16, one man was released. On Aug. 11, 22 more people were liberated and many in the diaspora hoped the ordeal was nearly over. \u201cFor the Assyrians, the Khabur was one of their last cultural strongholds in a sea of hostility in the Middle East,\u201d al-Jeloo said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t help these people, it was the end.\u201d Then in September 2015 came the video showing three Khabur men, dressed in orange jumpsuits, being shot to death by their captors. It\u2019s not clear what prompted the killings -- whether the ransom demands had changed, ISIS\u2019 cash was running low, or the captors had simply grown impatient. \u201cWhen that happened, everybody went crazy and money started flying in from all over. Churches, and donations, Assyrians, non-Assyrians, just donating to the churches and funneling it to the bishop,\u201d Saadi said. They didn\u2019t see other options. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight them, Assyrians don\u2019t have an army to go rescue them. They don\u2019t have SWAT teams, they don\u2019t have SEAL 6. The only option they have is to pay ransom. And everybody was so fearful that the rest of the hostages were also going to be killed,\u201d he said.\u00a0 ",

(Photo: Robert Voets, Netflix) NEW YORK \u2014 Netflix is continuing its quest to dominate television. With 87 million subscribers in 190 territories, it has 30 series in production or development, and next year plans to double \u2014 \u00a0to 1,000 hours \u2014 the amount\u00a0of original programming, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said at the UBS Global Media conference Monday. Its next frontier: More unscripted programming, with 20 new shows such as Ultimate Beastmaster,\u00a0an obstacle-course competition series (think American Ninja Warrior) featuring contestants and announcers from six countries. Exclusive series are the streaming service's top priority. Netflix is often criticized for its sometimes moldy\u00a0selection of theatrical movies, but Sarandos said they still represent 30% of the service's total viewing, even with this year's addition of Disney titles, which are bypassing the typical pay-cable stop. But how do subscribers actually watch? In new data shared with USA TODAY, Netflix says 59% of its members \u2014 or about 51\u00a0million\u00a0\u2014 take a break, usually lasting two to\u00a0three days, after finishing an original series before they dive\u00a0into a new one. Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) meets bunny officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) in Disney's 'Zootopia.' \u00a0(Photo: Disney) And 61% of those who do pause weave a standalone film or standup special\u00a0between those\u00a0series binges, often choosing like-minded titles. So, for example, fans of the whimsical Gilmore Girls and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u00a0are more apt to follow\u00a0them\u00a0with titles such as The Princess Bride and Sixteen Candles, while Stranger Things viewers opt for Disney's Zootopia. Viewers of Narcos or Breaking Bad go for similarly edgy\u00a0Pulp Fiction, and watchers of Orange Is the New Black and Bloodline tend to watch Spotlight.\u00a0(The research is based on worldwide trends from January to October). Netflix has a more \"dispassionate audience\" of movie fans, said Sarandos, who views Netflix's original films with Kevin James and Adam Sandler as popular if \u00a0unexceptional \"comfort-food comedy.\" But expanding its film slate to more ambitious fare may achieve a loftier goal. He expects\u00a0Bright, an upcoming feature shrouded in mystery that marks a new collaboration between Suicide Squad's star\u00a0Will Smith and director David Ayer, to\u00a0launch a new film franchise. \"Can those films be subscription drivers the way series are?\" he asked.

    "text": "By Danielle Paquette December 6 at 3:27 PM Follow @dpaqreport President-elect Donald Trump reacts after speaking at Carrier Corp Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) The Secret Service agents told the Carrier workers to stay put, so Chuck Jones sat in the factory conference room for nearly three hours, waiting for president-elect Donald Trump. He\u2019d grown used to this suspense. Seven months earlier, at a campaign rally in Indianapolis,\u00a0Trump had pledged to save the plant\u2019s jobs, most of which were slated to move to Mexico. Then the businessman won the election, and the\u00a01,350 workers whose\u00a0paychecks were on the line\u00a0wondered if he\u2019d keep his promise. Jones, president of the United Steelworkers 1999, which represents Carrier employees, felt optimistic when Trump announced last week that he\u2019d reached a deal with the factory\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, to preserve 1,100 of the Indianapolis jobs\u00a0\u2014 until\u00a0the union leader heard from Carrier that only 730 of the production jobs would stay and 550 of his members would lose their livelihoods, after all.\u00a0 At the Dec. 1 meeting, where Trump was supposed to lay out the details,\u00a0Jones hoped he would explain himself. \u201cBut he got up there,\u201d Jones said Tuesday, \u201cand, for whatever reason, lied his a-- off.\u201d In front of a crowd of about 150 supervisors, production workers and reporters, Trump praised Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies. \"Now they\u2019re keeping \u2014 actually the number\u2019s over 1,100 people,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is so great.\u201d Jones wondered why the president-elect appeared to be inflating the victory. Trump and Pence, he said, could take credit for rescuing\u00a0800 of the Carrier jobs, including\u00a0non-union positions. The Post's Fact Checker took a closer look at the claims President-elect Donald Trump made during a speech in Indiana on Dec. 1, about the deal to keep jobs at a Carrier plant there that were due to be shipped to Mexico. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Of the nearly 1,700 workers at the Indianapolis plant, however, 350 in research and development were never scheduled to leave, Jones said. Another 80 jobs, which Trump seemed\u00a0to include in his figure, were non-union clerical and supervisory positions. (A Carrier spokesperson confirmed that 800 factory jobs once earmarked for Mexico are staying.) And now the president-elect was applauding the company and giving\u00a0it millions of dollars in tax breaks, even as hundreds of Indianapolis\u00a0workers prepared to be laid off. \u201cTrump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers,\u201d said Jones, who voted for Hillary Clinton but called her \"the better of two evils.\" \u201cI almost threw up in my mouth.\u201d Spokespeople\u00a0for Trump did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment. In exchange for downsizing its move south of the border, United Technologies would receive\u00a0$7 million in tax credits from Indiana, to be paid in\u00a0$700,000 installments\u00a0each year for a decade. Carrier, meanwhile, agreed to invest $16 million in its Indiana operation. United Technologies still plans to send 700 factory jobs from Huntington, Ind, to Monterrey, Mexico. [ Trump scored perhaps the biggest victory of his new tenure. But it comes with a huge asterisk. ] T.J. Bray, 32, one of the workers who will keep his job,\u00a0sat in the front row during the Dec. 1 meeting as Trump spoke. A corporate employee had guided him specifically to that seat, he said, so he suspected he might be part of Trump\u2019s remarks. \u00a0 On Carrier's makeshift stage, Trump paraphrased the words of an unnamed Carrier employee who talked to an NBC reporter after the election. Bray was the only Carrier employee\u00a0who had appeared on television that day. Apparently, he realized, Trump was saying\u00a0he inspired the deal. Speaking at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Dec. 1, President-elect Donald Trump said he decided to call the company so it would not ship jobs abroad after watching a television news report about the factory. (The Washington Post) \u201cHe\u00a0said something to the effect, \u2018No, we\u2019re not leaving, because Donald Trump promised us that we\u2019re not leaving,\u2019 and I never thought I made that promise,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNot with Carrier. I made it for everybody else. I didn\u2019t make it really for Carrier.\u201d In fact, Trump did make that commitment, and it's on video. \u00a0\"They're going to call me and they are going to say 'Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,'\u201d Trump had said at the April rally. \"One hundred percent -- that's what is going to happen.\" Last week, though, the president-elect told the Carrier crowd he hadn't meant that literally. \u201cI was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in,\" Trump said. \"Because they made the decision a year and a half ago. But he believed that\u00a0was \u2014 and I could understand it. I actually said \u2014 I didn\u2019t make it \u2014 when they played that, I said, 'I did make it, but I didn\u2019t mean it quite that way.'\u201d Trump asked if the employee\u00a0he\u2019d been referencing was in the audience.\u00a0A woman yelled that her son was, and Trump began to compliment that son, though he hadn't spoken\u00a0in the television news segment.\u00a0(Bray said that a\u00a0United Technologies spokesperson later told him Trump meant to single him out.) \u201cI was confused when he was like, \u2018I wasn\u2019t talking about Carrier,\u2019\u201d Bray said. \u201cYou made this whole campaign about Carrier, and we're still losing a lot of jobs.\u201d Bray\u00a0clapped that day, anyway, for the 800 that would remain on American soil.\u00a0 *This story has been updated More on Wonkblog: ",

By Drew Harwell and Rosalind S. Helderman December 6 at 12:36 PM Follow @drewharwell Follow @PostRoz President-elect Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June, his spokesman said Tuesday, a move that could have created a cash windfall as he ramped up to begin a costly general election presidential campaign that at the time he claimed he would personally support with \u201cmajor contributions.\u201d The sell-off could help address conflict-of-interest worries about his stock portfolio, a sizable part of Trump\u2019s financial life that was worth roughly as much as $40 million as of December 2015, a May disclosure filing shows. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio, the May filing shows, included shares in a number of banks, oil giants and other companies with business pending before the U.S. government and whose value could rise due to Trump\u2019s decisions in office. Those stock holdings, ethics advisers said, offered a potentially troublesome facet of Trump\u2019s private finances that could entangle his public decision-making. Beyond comments to The Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since the May filing. Trump spokesman Jason Miller, who told The Post about Trump\u2019s stock sale Tuesday morning, did not immediately answer why Trump had sold the shares, how much he sold them for, or whether he has bought anything since. Trump will not be required by law to file another personal financial disclosure until May 2018. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) [ Trump\u2019s stock holdings may give him a personal stake in rules on banks and oil firms ] Trump\u2019s campaign had given no indication of the sale in the five months since it apparently took place in June. As president, Trump will be subject to the STOCK Act, a law passed in 2012 that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1,000 within 45 days. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio, which is separate from his broader real estate and branding businesses, included stocks and bonds invested in companies such as Apple, AT&T, ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs. The June stock sale would have coincided with a point when Trump was pouring money into his presidential campaign. During the Republican primary, Trump loaned his campaign $47 million of his own money. In June, as the general election began, he formally forgave the loan and began making cash infusions to his campaign, first donating $2 million on June 22. Trump then gave $2 million a month between July and August before donating $10 million in October. Much of Trump\u2019s campaign was ultimately funded by other donors. In all, Trump gave his campaign $66 million, federal filings show \u2013 short of the $100 million that he repeatedly claimed he was spending on his race. Miller, the Trump spokesman, told The Post about Trump\u2019s stock sale Tuesday morning, following Trump\u2019s criticism of aviation giant Boeing. Trump tweeted that Boeing\u2019s federal contract to build new Air Force One jets should be cancelled because costs had gone \u201cout of control.\u201d Trump was once a company shareholder, tweeting in January 2013 that \u201c@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!\u201d Trump reported owning between $50,000 and $100,000 of Boeing stock in the May filing. In the three years between Trump\u2019s original tweet about buying Boeing stock and June 2016, Boeing\u2019s share price climbed about 70 percent. Trump has tweeted that he will separate from his own business, the Trump Organization, but has provided no additional details other than promising to hold a press event on Dec. 15 to outline his plans. [ Citing high cost, Trump says Boeing\u2019s contract to build Air Force One should be canceled ] Trump told Fox Business News in August that he was dumping stocks because he predicted the market was crashing, saying, \u201cI did invest, and I got out, and it was actually very good timing.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s August comments, stock prices have generally been on the rise since June. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told The Post last month that Trump had in June also sold his shares in Energy Transfer Partners, the majority stakeholder in the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline project that has drawn protests from environmentalists and Native Americans. The Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday it would not allow the oil pipeline to be drilled further near a Standing Rock Sioux reservation, but Trump has said he supported completing the pipeline. The company\u2019s chief executive was a major campaign donor to Trump, but its stock had declined in value in the face of protests. Trump said in a financial filing released in May 2015 that he owned between $500,000 and $1 million worth of stock in Energy Transfer Partners. By May 2016, when Trump updated his annual filing, the value of the holding had fallen to less than $50,000. Norm Eisen, who served as ethics counselor to President Obama and has criticized Trump over his conflicts, said it would be \u201cabsolutely a step in the right direction\u201d if Trump had sold his stock holdings in June, divesting himself of ownership in companies whose fates could be tied to his policies. But he added that it is now important to know how Trump spent the money he earned from the sale. \u201cWe need to know, has he put them in conflict free assets ... or has he bought other stocks or assets that would create new conflicts?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more reason that we need a prompt and full financial disclosure. If he did liquidate all his stocks, what did he do with the money? What bank is the money in? What did he buy? It\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d He called this the latest example of the tension between Trump\u2019s promise to drain the swamp and how he has managed his own business conflicts. \u201cThe swamp draining should begin with Trump\u2019s own wetlands,\u201d Eisen said.

    "text": "CBS News Dec 6, 2016 12:53 PM EST A House committee says the price of new U.S. embassies will give you sticker shock. CBS News received the draft of the new report on allegations of wasteful spending at the State Department. The investigation was led by Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who said the Obama administration took a risky approach to building embassies, taking too long and spending too much. Now, the secretary of state will have to decide whether to build fortress-like installations or architectural jewels, reports CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan. According to the report, America\u2019s striking new embassy in London comes with a sizable price tag. The facility -- a steel-framed cube surrounded by glass -- will soon exceed its more than $1 billion projection, according to Chaffetz. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI feel very misled by the State Department because if we aren\u2019t opening those doors in February, the cost to the U.S. taxpayer is about $100,000 a day to stay in a facility that we used to own,\u201d Chaffetz said. That facility \u2013 the existing U.S. embassy -- will be used to house our personnel until the new London embassy is ready. A six-month lease agreement, according to Chaffetz, accounts for a nearly $22 million cost increase. Construction of U.S. Embassy in Mexico draws scrutiny The House Oversight Committee\u2019s two-year investigation found quibbling over a glass wall at the embassy in Indonesia cost \u201ctens of millions of dollars in change order requests,\u201d and nearly $3 million was spent on art at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan. One of the biggest bills came from Mexico , where the U.S. government paid $120 million for a 15-acre lot and $56 million on the design of the diplomatic mission. But nothing has been built there yet.   Chaffetz, who visited the site, said costs will climb above the more-than-$943 million estimate. \u201cSomething has to change because they\u2019re building them slower, they\u2019re coming in over budget, they\u2019re not necessarily as secure and they\u2019re so ostentatious,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cSo for the next secretary of state, is this top of the list?\u201d Brennan asked. \u201cI\u2019m glad we have a Mr. Trump coming in because I think he\u2019ll get it and I think he\u2019ll know how to fix it, and fix it in a hurry,\u201d Chaffetz said. But the strict security standards of building a post for classified diplomatic work isn\u2019t your typical real estate project.\u00a0 \u201cDo you have any kind of timeline as to when these embassies will be both secure and finished?\u201d Brennan asked State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner.\u00a0 \u201cAll I can say is that our diplomatic security bureau, our overseas buildings and operations bureau and our management bureau work hand in hand to ensure that safety is foremost, first and foremost,\u201d Toner said. State Department officials said they\u2019re mindful that what embassies look like impacts perception of the U.S. But they insist that despite the delays, the projects will remain within budget. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Samsung previously had been ordered to pay Apple $399 million in damages. The high court's unanimous decision sends the suit back to a lower court to reconsider what is a reasonable amount. Here's how NPR's Nina Totenberg and An-Li Herring explained the underlying issue a few months ago : \"The two smartphone giants have been battling each other \u2014 not just in the marketplace but also in the courts \u2014 since 2011, a year after Samsung unveiled a new set of smartphones, including the Galaxy. Like iPhones, the Samsung products, for the first time, had rounded corners and square icons on a touchscreen. \"Apple alleged, in part, that its South Korean rival had infringed three design patents for discrete components of the iPhone \u2014 the front face of the device, the rounded edges framing the face, and the device's distinctive matrix of colorful square icons. \"In 2012, a jury ruled in Apple's favor and Samsung was ordered to pay $399 million in damages \u2014 all the profits it had made on 11 infringing phone models. \"Samsung appealed, arguing that it should not have to fork over its total profits; rather, it should only be liable for the specific design elements it infringed. \"The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, rejected that argument, agreeing with Apple that Samsung had to cough up all of its profits on an infringed 'article of manufacture.' \" 'The game then becomes, what's the article of manufacture?' says Daryl Joseffer, who formerly served as principal deputy U.S. solicitor general. 'Is it the cover of the phone which is the design? Or is it the entire phone?' Article continues after sponsorship The Supreme Court unanimously concluded that the \"article of manufacture\" doesn't have to be the entire phone. As we reported in May, Samsung has said the laws that govern copyright infringement like this were outdated and due for re-examination. The South Korean tech giant noted that the logic behind the $399 million decision would apply even if an 18-wheel tractor-trailer included design infringement in a single cup holder. From The Birth Of The iPhone To An Era Of Lawsuits Here's more from our coverage then: \"A smartphone contains thousands of parts, many of which are functional rather than ornamental, Samsung argues. \"The law of the smartphone cannot follow reflexively from the law of the spoon,\" it says in court documents . ... \" In its opposing brief , Apple counters by arguing that the law 'could not be clearer': It explicitly holds an infringer liable for the 'total profit,' and not just a portion of it.\" In the end, the highest court in the land released a very brief decision that turned largely on definitions. The Supreme Court, citing multiple dictionaries, concluded there was no reason why an \"article of manufacture\" couldn't be a component, as easily as an entire product. ",

Police say the teenage suspect showed detectives where he and Viloria-Paulino walked along the Merrimac River while smoking marijuana. The duo were both sophomores at Lawrence High School. The teen suspect told investigators both liked nature and \u201cthe way the boat house across the river is lit up at night,\u201d according to police. Detectives have not said if they know why a nature walk apparently turned deadly. Viloria-Paulino remained missing for nearly two weeks, until a woman walking her dog spotted his headless body partially submerged along the riverbank. His arms were also cut off, the Boston Herald reports , and his body mutilated so badly the autopsy took 11 hours to complete. Viloria-Paulino\u2019s family reported him missing Nov. 18 and has criticized the police department, saying that officers at first thought he was a runaway and didn\u2019t take the case seriously enough. \u201cWe are poor. We are Hispanic. They considered this a normal runaway case. I told them from day one that it wasn\u2019t,\u201d the teen\u2019s grandmother, Ivelisse Cornielle, said after the suspect\u2019s arrest Saturday. The victim\u2019s mother, Katiuska Paulino, said she insisted that her son was not the type to run away. \u201cTo every police officer, detective in our police department, if it was their kid ... would they have waited two weeks to look for him?\u201d she said after Monday\u2019s arraignment. Based on a reported sighting of Viloria-Paulino after his disappearance that turned out to be false, police did at first treat it as a runaway case, Lawrence Chief James Fitzpatrick said after the arraignment. But he said his department made the case a priority from the start. The department posted a picture of Viloria-Paulino on its Facebook page two days after he was reported missing along with the phone number of the detective investigating the disappearance. \u201cWe were relentless on this case,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, adding that he understands that the victim\u2019s family is grieving. Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera has stood by police but has suggested he may seek an independent review of the case.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

By Marc Fisher December 6 at 6:06 PM Follow @mffisher BUCKHANNON, W.Va. \u2014 Bill Nesselrotte owns a coal company that doesn\u2019t mine coal anymore. Still, a few days each week, he straps on a backpack and pushes through the brush to collect jars of water from streams, ponds, wells and springs \u2014 samples to prove to the government that he\u2019s not a polluter. There has been no drilling, no blasting for more than two years on the 150\u00a0acres Nesselrotte leases here \u2014 not since the bottom dropped out of a market that once provided a good livelihood for him and a couple dozen other people in West Virginia\u2019s dramatically narrow valleys. These days, his mine is nothing but a rock-crushing business, selling limestone to anyone who shows up with a dump truck, $150 a load, barely enough to keep one man employed. But to keep crushing rocks, Nesselrotte must keep his coal permits active, and that means collecting water samples, 48 trips a month. A slew of other new rules keeps him at his dining-room table, slaving over paperwork deep into the night. Such burdens are, he says, a major reason 76\u00a0percent of Upshur County voters last month put their trust in the man who promised to slash government regulations and bring back coal \u2014 Donald Trump. Coal country offers a counterweight to the palpable anxiety about Trump in some parts of the country. Here, people said they are \u201ceuphoric\u201d and \u201cthrilled\u201d about the incoming president, even in the valley where Nesselrotte has no customers for his coal. That optimism is pervasive even after Trump last week chose as his commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, the Manhattan billionaire who in 2006 owned the mine just down the hill, where an underground explosion killed 12 miners, the region\u2019s worst coal disaster in decades. \u201cWest Virginians are realists,\u201d said Nesselrotte, a mining engineer by education and a serial entrepreneur by virtue of living in a place that still depends on coal, even though nearly every mine within an hour\u2019s drive has closed in recent years. \u201cThe mines have been shut down, the railroads have been torn up, the preparation plants have closed. A lot of stuff has been done that can\u2019t be undone. A load of black locust logs, used for fence posts, rolls through town in Buckhannon, W.Va. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post) \u201cBut I\u2019m really looking forward to this president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of refreshing to see people come into government who know how business works.\u201d Still, for some, especially for families who felt the mine disaster firsthand, the naming of Ross has dulled the thrill of Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cI don\u2019t like that choice,\u201d Vickie Boni, 74, said. \u201cI always felt the company was responsible.\u201d Boni\u2019s ex-husband, John Boni, was the fire boss, in charge of checking safety at the Sago Mine. Five days before the explosion, he alerted superiors to a leak of dangerous methane gas. A freak lightning strike ignited the methane, investigators later said. Right after the explosion, John Boni retired, after 36\u00a0years in the mines. A few months later, he put a bullet in his head. Still, Vickie Boni remains optimistic that Trump will live up to his promise to restore coal jobs. \u201cThat\u2019s people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d she said. Her father went into the mines at 14 and was killed in a mine at 44. Her son might have ended up mining, too, but there was no work, so he moved to North Carolina, a story that many older parents here tell about their now-distant children. Ross did not respond to a request for comment about the Sago disaster. An inveterate buyer of deeply troubled companies, he had bought the mine only a couple of months before the explosion and was not on-site when the men were killed. In a televised interview in 2006, soon after the tragedy, Ross told ABC that he knew the mine had been cited with 208 violations, that he accepted responsibility for the disaster, that he had not made a personal contribution toward a fund for the miners\u2019 families, and that his company \u201cnever scrimped on safety expenditures.\u201d Several investigations concluded that the mine\u2019s owner, International Coal Group, was responsible for the safety violations, but that the violations did not cause the explosion. Only one miner who was trapped survived. A limestone pond on Bill Nesselrotte\u2019s mine. The mining operation now sells crushed limestone instead of coal. (Jeff Swensen/For The Washington Post) Helen Winans\u2019s son Marshall died at Sago, and although she blames the company for what happened, she does not see Ross as culpable. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d she said, \u201cit was the people here. People went into the mine unprotected because they\u2019d been drinking. The company should have had better safety, and the inspectors should have the sense to shut them down and slap fines on them, but it\u2019s dangerous work.\u201d Dangerous, but essential, she said: Before the price of coal collapsed, before the number of working miners in the state fell to a 100-year low of 15,000, miners could make $60,000, even $75,000 a year, without a high school education. Walmart money doesn\u2019t come close. Winans, 85, lost one son in the mine and another on a gas drilling rig. Her husband died of black lung disease after a life in the mines. Eighteen years later, Winans still hasn\u2019t remarried because marriage would end her black lung benefits. \u201cThe government makes you live in sin,\u201d she said. She\u2019s lived with a man for years, always feeling a bit guilty about it, \u201cbut I\u2019m not giving up that money for a piece of paper that says \u2018I do.\u2019 \u201d Despite the tragedies that have marked her life, Winans prays for the return of coal, and she says Trump will make it happen. \u201cI like the way he talks \u2014 straight,\u201d she said, \u201cnot like that Hillary [Clinton], the way she got up there and shook her finger and said she\u2019d shut every mine down. What would that do to West Virginia?\u201d (In March, the Democratic presidential candidate had said in a CNN town hall that \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right? . . . Now we\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels.\u201d) Trump\u2019s appeal here is stylistic as well as policy-driven, said David McCauley, the mayor of Buckhannon, the county seat, a pretty and bustling town of 5,700. It\u2019s about coal, but also about being ornery and oppositional. \u201cTrump was just what people here have always been \u2014 skeptical of government, almost libertarian,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cHe\u2019s a West Virginia pipe dream: He\u2019s going to undo the damage to the coal industry and bring back the jobs, and all of our kids down there in North Carolina are going to come home.\u201d McCauley, who is also a professor at West Virginia Wesleyan College, one of the town\u2019s biggest employers, was taken aback when Trump named Ross. \u201cThe whole history of West Virginia is exploitation by outside influences,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the guy 80\u00a0percent of us voted for turns around and nominates one of the least favorite names in Upshur County. If he brings in more billionaires and Mitt Romney is secretary of state, people will say, \u2018Well, wait a minute now.\u2019 But if the economy turns around, he\u2019ll get the credit.\u201d McCauley, 58, is a Republican but not a Trumpian. He was a Jeb Bush delegate and ended up voting for Clinton \u201cbecause the last thing we need is two or three more Antonin Scalias\u201d on the Supreme Court. Like many here, he doesn\u2019t fit neatly into Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d He\u2019s pro-abortion rights, pro-gay marriage, he said, \u201ca fervent separation-of-church-and-state guy, a social progressive.\u201d But McCauley is a Republican because government seemed too big and intrusive, and because, as he put it, \u201cyou could not move to Buckhannon and settle into a public position without being a Republican. I can do my job better when people say, \u2018He\u2019s one of us.\u2019 \u201d West Virginia\u2019s Democratic roots are obvious, even though the state hasn\u2019t voted blue in a presidential race since 1996. Upshur County\u2019s delegate to the state legislature, Bill Hamilton, calls himself \u201can oxymoron Republican,\u201d because he\u2019s closely bound to the unions. Like many here, his skepticism of the big businesses that own many mines sits deep in his bones, and the Sago disaster only cemented that doubt. One miner who was killed was Hamilton\u2019s client at his insurance agency, another was his lockermate from junior high school and a third was a family acquaintance. Hamilton never worked in the mines, warned away by his father, who toiled underground until he was drafted to fight in World War II, and who lost two brothers to mining. Still, he finds himself fervently hoping Trump will reopen the coal fields and invest in technology to diminish the environmental damage. Coal, he said, remains the state\u2019s lifeline. But although Hamilton came around to Trump after initially supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich, he wonders if the selection of Ross means Trump might not really be a friend to miners. Hamilton has been pushing Congress to pass a bill to preserve pension benefits that thousands of miners are set to lose next year because so many coal companies have gone belly up. \u201cRoss bought companies and then severed the benefits to make more profit,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cSo do you think that bill\u2019s going to go anywhere now?\u201d Thomas Toler remains \u201ceuphoric\u201d about the Trump win and the prospect of a coal revival. Toler\u2019s uncle was killed in the Sago disaster; the two had worked together in the mines for years. Thomas could never go back underground after the trauma: \u201cIt was survivor\u2019s guilt, and just not being able to be there with him.\u201d But the tragedy made Toler, 55, no less devoted to the industry that defines his family and his community, and he said he misses the mines every day. \u201cIt\u2019s your parents\u2019 and your grandparents\u2019 and your life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just accept the risk, just like driving an automobile or playing football. You have to live. And my uncle, like me, loved it more than anything. If you have a curious mind or any interest in geology, you\u2019re setting foot every day where no man has ever set foot before.\u201d Toler said his hopes now are bound up in Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI guess I really want to believe it\u2019s really going to be different,\u201d he said. The shuttered Sago Mine is now a gentle, grassy hillside marked only by a chain-link fence. Up the hill, Nesselrotte would like to restore a similarly green cover to the barren rock of his idled surface mine, as he has done at nine other locations through the years. \u201cAll my other mines, you can\u2019t even tell it was ever mined,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one, I\u2019m ashamed of.\u201d But Nesselrotte cannot afford to plant trees at the site, an open wound of brown and gray threaded with black veins of once-precious coal. And he would like to finish mining it first. So he waits, selling the occasional load of rocks, hoping to drill again and to bring back the workers he had to lay off. \u201cI\u2019m realistic. I know Trump will have to compromise,\u201d Nesselrotte said. But he was \u201ctickled to death\u201d last week when Trump announced a deal in which Carrier, the air-conditioning and heating company, will keep about a thousand jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not even in authority yet,\u201d Nesselrotte marveled. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we could be back in business.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The figure covers the cost of extra officers assigned to cover Trump Tower, along with the overtime they accrue. \"New York taxpayers must not pick up the tab,\" said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Should Trump's family remain in New York City, Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., and other New York Democrats want Washington to cover the additional costs of securing Trump Tower. The Trump family has said Melania Trump and Barron Trump will remain in New York through the spring, so Barron can finish school in the city. Miller said the security plan \u2014 devised with the Secret Service \u2014 and its costs take into account the difficulties of securing a skyscraper on one of the busiest streets in the city. Asked about those difficulties, Miller said, \"If I could have picked a place to secure, it would have been among the very last.\" Lowey and other New York Democrats want the funding included in a year-end spending bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. Money for the city is \"in the mix\" for the spending bill, according to a representative for House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky. As of Tuesday afternoon, House Republicans floated a counteroffer that included less federal compensation than the New York Democrats requested. \"No decisions have been made,\" the representative said in an email. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio asked Congress to approve the $35 million in a letter sent on Monday, and the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a formal request for the funds to Capitol Hill two weeks ago. 0 Shares ",

Apple to replace faulty batteries on some iPhone 6S models \"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown,\" wrote the iPhone maker in a posting on the company's Chinese support page . Apple notes that some phones shut down \"under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,\" but that it would be releasing a software update next week to garner more information. It is also exploring a possible software fix which would be deployed in a future\u00a0version of iOS. The company stresses that the issue poses no safety risk to users. Apple declined to\u00a0comment on how many phones are impacted or if the issue extended to other devices such as the iPhone 6S Plus. The problem\u00a0stems from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a\u00a0longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs. Those with iPhone 6S phones that they feel have been having issues can go to their local Apple Store or an authorized service provider, the small repair shops with the stickers that say they're authorized by Apple as well as retailers such as Best Buy. If it is determined that your phone is one of the affected units, the company will swap out the battery free of charge. Users can also enter their phone's serial number onto the company's support page to see if their phone is one of the bad ones. Tim Cook praises Watch sales amid wearable concerns Apple is the\u00a0latest major tech company to suffer from battery issues. Samsung notably\u00a0recalled\u00a0and cancelled its Galaxy Note 7 phone this fall after numerous devices saw their batteries catch fire or explode. There have thus far been no reports of similar issues from the iPhone 6S.

By Glenn Kessler December 6 at 3:36 PM Follow @GlennKesslerWP Shortly after tweeting that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled, Dec. 6, President-elect Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower he wants the company \"to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" (The Washington Post) \u201cBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump, in a tweet, Dec. 6, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump targeted Boeing in a tweet, accusing it of letting costs go out of control in the building of a new Air Force One jet. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump is not a stickler for accuracy, but there are number of inaccuracies in his tweet. Let\u2019s break them down one by one. \u201cBoeing is building . . . \u201d Earlier in 2016, Boeing received a $170 million contract to design a replacement for the aging pair of Air Force Ones used by the president. Boeing\u00a0is not actually building the jet, though logically it is the only U.S. manufacturer with the capability to build such an aircraft. \u201c \u2026 a brand new 747 Air Force One \u2026 \u201d At a minimum, there would be two Air Force Ones. You need a spare in case there is a problem with one. The jets generally have a life cycle of 30 years. A plane only receives the call sign \u201cAir Force One\u201d when the president is on board. This is actually a highly modified version of the Boeing 747-8 jet. \u201cCosts are out of control, more than $4 billion\u201d Cost have actually not been set. The Defense Department\u2019s\u00a0 five-year plan indicates a cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years for design and development. It\u2019s logical to assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and procure the aircraft. So an estimate of $4 billion \u2014 for design, testing and manufacture of at least two jets \u2014 is not completely out of line. But the budget is subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the aircraft. Boeing literally needs to re-engineer\u00a0the plane from the ground up, so there are many one-time expenses. Air Force One needs to be designed\u00a0to survive a nuclear war. It requires\u00a0all sorts of undisclosed security upgrades\u00a0and countermeasures. It can refuel in flight . The actual cost of the plane will depend on the equipment that goes into it. There also needs to be extensive testing, probably lasting two years, before the plane is deemed ready for presidential travel. Congress obviously would have a say in the final price tag. The Boeing 757 jet used by the secretary of state was supposed to get long-range engines but at the last moment, they were killed by then-Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). This resulted in some cost savings \u2014 and also that the secretary of state would always have to refuel in Alaska on flights to and from Asia. Boeing says it made no money making the last set of Air Force One jets and does not expect to make money on this order, as it is more a matter of prestige. \u201cCancel the order!\u201d Nothing has been ordered yet. But the program could be eliminated. This may not be a problem for Trump, but certainly would affect his successors. The current aircraft were delivered in 1990, and as we noted, the life cycle is about 30 years. The Pentagon says the current fleet \u201cfaces capability gaps, rising maintenance costs, and parts obsolescence as it reaches the end of its planned 30-year life-cycle.\u201d Todd Harrison , a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said \u201cthe program is very new and hardly had a chance to get started yet.\u201d So, in effect, there are no real cost overruns yet. He added that the estimated $4 billion cost is reasonable given the requirements of the project. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Gay bureaucrat wages war with Christian ministry By Todd Starnes Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print FILE -- March 26, 2005: A cross is silhouetted against the sun in Pinellas Park, Fla.  (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \u00a0(AP) Donald Trump may be the next president of the United States but the war on religious liberty rages on.\u00a0 The other day I received word that Connecticut\u2019s openly gay comptroller is targeting American Family Association , one of the nation\u2019s most prominent and respected Christian ministries. Click here for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for conservatives! If Comptroller Kevin Lembo has his way, AFA could be kicked out of the Connecticut State Employees\u2019 Campaign for Charitable Giving (CSEC) \u2014 even though they are qualified as a charity under the rules. Lembo sent AFA a letter accusing them possibly being in \u201cviolation of the regulations governing the Connecticut State Employee Campaign for Charitable Giving that broadly prohibit discrimination.\u201d He specifically mentioned AFA\u2019s petition to boycott Target over its transgender bathroom policies, and ministry statements regarding traditional marriage. Click here to join the HOTTEST Conservative Facebook Community in America! \u00a0 \u201cThese actions and statements are extremely troubling to me -- not only as an openly gay father and spouse -- but as administrator of CSEC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe AFA\u2019s statements and mission not only appear to discriminate against the LGBTQ communities, as well as Muslims who choose to serve and protect our country by enlisting in the military, but it remains unclear what actual charitable services the AFA provides that qualifies it to participate in the CSEC. I am, therefore, initiating an investigation to determine whether AFA is in compliance with the requirements of the CSEC. (Click here to read the comptroller\u2019s full letter .) If Lembo follows through on his threats, it would mean state employees would not be able to contribute to AFA through the program, AFA president Tim Wildmon says . \u201cThis is a state government official coming directly after your AFA, and the letter is nothing more than an attack on AFA for standing strong for biblical principles,\u201d Wildmon said. \u201cMoreover, it is an unconstitutional attack on the First Amendment rights of all religious organizations. The government is not allowed to dictate to religious charities what they can believe in order to participate in the public square.\u201d AFA general counsel Abraham Hamilton III, minced no words in his interpretation of the state comptroller\u2019s investigation. \"What's being foisted upon the American Family Association is the latest iteration of 'If you don't adhere to the nouveaux orthodoxy of the day \u2013 which is the sexual deviancy agenda \u2013 then you must be castigated and expelled from public life,'\" he tells OneNewsNow. First Liberty Institute attorney Hiram Sasser accused Lembo of abusing the power of his office. \u201cIt is surprising that a government would still be so bold as to engage in clearly unconstitutional religious viewpoint discrimination,\u201d Sasser told me. \u201cHe is abusing his office by inappropriately using it to advance his own personal agenda and it is really disturbing.\u201d And to be perfectly blunt, these types of attacks by far-left bureaucrats are why Donald Trump won the presidency. \"This issue ... really brings into focus why a lot of people supported Donald Trump as opposed to Hillary Clinton,\" Hamilton told OneNewsNow. \u201dPeople feared the federal government \u2013 more specifically the IRS or the Department of Justice \u2013 being used as means of cultural and societal intimidation.\" Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

But because of the pipeline's size \u2014 30 inches in diameter \u2014 its approval went to Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy, an official said. \"Ms. Darcy had the authority to make the decision on behalf of the Department of the Army, and she did so,\" Darcy spokesperson Moira Kelley told NBC News Tuesday evening. Sunday's decision was hailed as a victory by protesters who oppose the pipeline, saying its construction threatens land believed to be sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and could threaten its drinking water. The activists call themselves \"water protectors.\" Related: Cruel Winter Could Be Another Blow to Pipeline Protesters' Hopes Darcy said in the memo that more work needs to be done in looking for an alternate route, with greater participation from the tribe. The memo from Darcy makes clear that her decision \"does not alter the Army's position that the Corps' prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.\" When asked why Assistant Secretary Darcy decided to go against the Corps of Engineers recommendation, Kelley her spokesperson said, \"the Army decided that the totality of circumstances call for additional analysis, a more robust consideration of alternatives, and additional public information.\" Army Secretary Eric Fanning was \"supportive\" of Darcy's decision but ultimately the decision was hers, the spokesperson said.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 6, 2016 7:02 PM EST HARVEY, La. \u2014 The man who fatally shot ex-NFL player Joe McKnight has been arrested and jailed on a charge of manslaughter. Ronald Gasser, 54, was arrested late Monday, after initially being released last week without charges pending further investigation, jail records show.\u00a0 In a press conference Tuesday morning, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand described a \u201croad rage\u201d incident that began minutes before McKnight was shot dead. Normand said Gasser and McKnight had weaved in and out of traffic, pursuing each other on at least two highways and other roads after one first angered the other.\u00a0 Former NFL player Joe McKnight's family urge peace Ultimately, they got to a red light at the intersection of Berman Highway and Holmes Boulevard in Terrytown, La., outside New Orleans. Normand said McKnight pulled alongside Gasser\u2019s car, and each rolled down their windows and began arguing. At some point, Normand said, McKnight got out of his car and continued the argument while leaning down to see eye-to-eye with Gasser, who was in the driver\u2019s seat of an Infiniti sedan.\u00a0 As the argument continued, Gasser pulled a gun from between his seat and the car\u2019s center console, and shot McKnight three times, Normand said. Normand said a gun belonging to McKnight\u2019s stepfather was found inside the car McKnight was driving \u2014 which also belonged to the stepfather \u2014 but there is no evidence McKnight told Gasser about the gun. During his press conference, Normand thanked McKnight\u2019s family for their patience, but had harsh words for those who had pressed the department to charge Gasser sooner. He said waiting to do so allowed investigators to interview Gasser for 10 hours without an attorney, and two hours with one. Normand was defensive about how his office handled the investigation, CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan reports.\u00a0 \u201cFor those who have criticized the men and women of this organization and the strategy decisions that we made relative to that Tough,\u201d Normand said at the press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d Normand also read from some of the social media posts the department has received since the shooting. \u201cI know that Norman is a piece of s**t and you stood behind that white boy with that bulls**t n***** you wont even stand with your people you self-serving son of a b***h,\u201d Normand read.\u00a0 When asked why he felt the need to read out those profane messages, Normand said \u201cwe in this society today are demanding immediate results and we don\u2019t even know what we are talking about and we are castigating people that are trying to do the right thing.\u201d\u00a0 In an interview with Duncan, members of McKnight\u2019s family said that they were not upset by the fact that Gasser was not immediately charged, but by the fact that that their loved one will never come home again. \u00a0 Johanna and Jonathan McKnight want justice for their brother, and said they are willing to wait. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anything to be rushed to judgment. We just want it to be taken care of the right way,\u201d Johanna McKnight said. A report issued by the sheriff\u2019s office said Gasser was involved in a previous incident at the same intersection in February 2006. Gasser got into a \u201cverbal altercation\u201d with another driver, then followed the driver into a service station and \u201cbegan to strike him with a closed fist,\u201d according to the sheriff\u2019s office. A charge of simple battery was later dismissed. \u201cWhat would you say to a community that\u2019s outraged?\u201d Duncan asked Johanna and Jonathan McKnight. Joe McKnight while playing for the USC Trojans in 2009. Close WWL \u201cI  would tell them like I tell people here. You can be outraged but you can do it within yourself,\u201d Johanna McKnight said. \u201cJust do it in a peaceful manner because that\u2019s not what my brother stood for, that\u2019s not what we stand for.\u201d McKnight played three seasons for the New York Jets and one with the Kansas City Chiefs. The Jets held a moment of silence Monday night before their game against the Indianapolis Colts at MetLife Stadium to honor the former running back. McKnight was rated the nation\u2019s No. 1 running back recruit when he came out of Louisiana in 2006 and signed with the University of Southern California. He was a fourth-round draft pick of the Jets in 2010 and played three seasons for New York. He spent a season with Kansas City, and most recently played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. McKnight had a 107-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in 2011, and it remains the longest play in Jets history.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Now State of emergency declared in Oakland after deadly warehouse fire At least 36 people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Veronica Rocha , Soumya Karlamangla , Javier Panzar and Matt Hamilton Contact Reporters Officials in Oakland declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, clearing the way for the city to receive federal and local funding to cover the massive response to a warehouse fire that left 36 people dead. Oakland Fire Department Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said the local state of emergency declaration, which will be taken up for ratification Thursday by the city council, will also allow businesses affected by fire to obtain reimbursement for lost revenue.\u00a0 Addressing reporters on Tuesday evening, Deloach Reed praised fire crews and law enforcement who have worked around the clock since Friday night\u2019s fire was first reported. \u201cThis has been a heavy labor operation as well as a heavy mental operation,\u201d said Deloach\u00a0Reed, as Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf nodded in the background. Of the 36 people whose bodies have been recovered so far from the warehouse,\u00a0all but one person has been identified, according to Alameda County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. J.D. Nelson. The families of 30 victims have been notified. Meanwhile, the cause of the fire remains under investigation. Alexandria Corneiro, a\u00a0spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told The Times that a refrigerator and other electrical items inside the so-called Ghost Ship warehouse were being examined as potential ignition sources. ATF engineers were still inspecting the wreckage from the blaze and trying to determine the source of the flames, Corneiro said. \u201cThere is no determination of origin or cause of this fire,\" Deloach Reed said. Meanwhile, the building manager offered an apology for the blaze but said he could not say whether he should be held accountable. \u201cCan I just say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d a distraught Derick Almena told the \u201cToday\u201d show in front of the fire-gutted building early Tuesday. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here is to put my face and body in front.\u201d\u00a0 Asked if he should be held accountable for the fire that erupted at an electronic music event late Friday night, Almena responded, \u201cWhat am I gonna say to that? Am I gonna be held accountable? I can barely stand here right now.\u201d Did you know one... A fire ripped through a warehouse in Oakland on Friday night, killing more than 30 people who were there for an electronic music concert. Here are the names of people who have been confirmed dead by the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office Coroner\u2019s Bureau or immediate family members. Did you know one... (Los Angeles Times Staff) Alameda County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly told KTVU-TV that some victims, realizing that they were facing\u00a0death,\u00a0had texted family members to tell them they loved them and to say goodbye. Kelly said rescue crews found some of the victims \u201cprotecting each other, holding each other,\u201d the Associated Press reported. Authorities have promised a thorough search. \u201cWe are going to continue\u00a0the investigation,\u201d Oakland police Officer Johnna Watson said.\u00a0\u201cWe are going to continue the process until absolutely every piece of debris is removed from this building, every area has been searched, so families and our community know there is nothing left at this location.\u201d The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was still examining an area within the building, officials said.\u00a0 \u201cThey definitely focused in on a section that\u2019s of interest, but it will remain under investigation for a while until they can be certain,\u201d Call said. Who could be held responsible for the Oakland fire If the fire is\u00a0determined to be an arson, prosecutors could bring murder or aggravated arson charges \u2014\u00a0with one count for each person killed. \u00a0 If the fire is\u00a0determined to be an arson, prosecutors could bring murder or aggravated arson charges \u2014\u00a0with one count for each person killed. \u00a0 See more videos A second\u00a0area in the warehouse had to be stabilized before firefighters could dig through the debris.\u00a0 As the search for bodies progressed, pressure was mounting on city officials to explain how they dealt with numerous complaints concerning conditions in the warehouse. Schaaf, the city\u2019s mayor, release more details on Tuesday about complaints the city had received over the years about the warehouse. She said three complaints had been filed about safety conditions in warehouse itself, two in 2014 and one in 2015. Additionally the city received 18 complaints about a vacant lot adjoining the warehouse between 2008 and 2016. Officials have previously said they had an open safety investigation in process at the time of the fire. Neighbors said they had complained about piles of trash and illegal construction at the warehouse. They said a steady stream of young artists came and went, giving every indication that the building was their home, yet the property\u2019s owner had only a permit for a warehouse, not a residence. Officials had opened an investigation into possible code violations, and an inspector had visited the warehouse but never went inside.\u00a0 \u201cThe administration has to tell us, well, what happened to the code inspector. Why did he just knock on the door and not pursue?\u201d said City Councilman Noel Gallo, whose district includes the Fruitvale neighborhood where the warehouse was located. \u201cThis thing has been going on for 2 1/2 years.\u201d The city of Oakland has yet to release a full accounting of all city building or fire code inspections and investigations of the warehouse, but city records available online show at least five complaints had been investigated since June 2014. The warehouse was a\u00a0 10,000-square-foot\u00a0tinderbox \u00a0with stacks of\u00a0discarded furniture piled high, a rickety staircase made partly of wooden pallets, and a half-dozen RVs. Officials said they have found no evidence of sprinklers or fire alarms inside the structure, known as the Ghost Ship.\u00a0And, according to the man who oversaw the building, it was also outfitted with his homemade electrical repairs, for which he did not obtain permits. Almena\u00a0told NBC News on Monday that he made those\u00a0repairs because the landlord refused.\u00a0 Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories Chor N. Ng, the warehouse owner, could not be reached for comment. Her daughter, Eva Ng, has previously said the family was unaware people were living there.\u00a0 Zac Unger, vice president of the local firefighters union, said\u00a0 the fire marshal\u2019s inspection unit has been understaffed for years.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re way short, especially in an aging city with a huge amount of building going on,\u201d he said. Unger said a more aggressive fire marshal\u2019s office would scour the city looking for buildings that had avoided scrutiny in the past, or had other city code violations and might be hazardous. Such tactics could have possibly prevented the tragedy at the warehouse, he said. \u201cHad a fire inspector walked into that building and seen the conditions in there, they would have shut the place down,\u201d he said. Alameda County Dist. Atty. Nancy O\u2019Malley said her office is investigating the fire, which torched the building during an unpermitted concert. The\u00a0probe could result in criminal charges, including murder or manslaughter, she said. \u201cWe owe it to the community and those who perished to be methodical, to be thorough and take the time to look at every potential piece of evidence,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave no stone unturned. Already people from the community have been reaching out to us about the individuals involved and the scene itself.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , California\u2019s new legislative session began in dramatic fashion , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , and former L.A.

Patton, a Goldendoodle puppy that could be the next White House dog Lois Pope LIFE Foundation Email Last Updated Dec 6, 2016 4:58 PM EST President-elect Donald Trump will move into the White House in January, and when he does, philanthropist and animal welfare advocate Lois Pope hopes a Goldendoodle puppy named Patton will join him. As far as the public knows, the Trump household doesn\u2019t have any pets. But if Mr. Trump wants to follow a centuries-old American tradition, that is going to have to change. And Pope, who has known the billionaire for more than three decades, says Patton is the perfect pup to become the nation\u2019s \u201cFirst Dog.\u201d Weighing in at 20 pounds, Pope predicts the 9-week-old puppy is \u201cgonna be yuge.\u201d The president-elect first saw Patton, named for the general Mr. Trump often praises, over Thanksgiving at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Pope said she showed the president-elect a picture of the dog \u2014 the offspring of American military hero service dogs \u2014 on her cell phone. After examining the fluffy-haired dog, Mr. Trump turned to his wife, Melania, and repeated, \u201chero dog.\u201d \u201cHe is not a \u2018hero dog,\u2019 but he comes from a lineage of hero dogs, dogs who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d Pope explained to CBS News. Then the president-elect asked Pope to show the photo to his son, Barron. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want it,\u201d he told her. Ten-year-old Barron looked up from his computer game at Pope\u2019s phone. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d never seen such a big smile on anyone\u2019s face,\u201d Pope recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s worth all this time and the trouble and effort putting into this for [Barron].\u201d Barron is the real reason Pope is pushing the president-elect to adopt Patton, aside from hoping he\u2019ll follow a tradition that has taken place in the White House for 150 years. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a perfect dog for Barron. He\u2019s the one that I\u2019m really doing this for,\u201d Pope said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be quite a transition for him. He\u2019s only 10 years old and his dad is going to be the the leader of the free world.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s team has yet to respond to CBS News\u2019 request for comment, though Trump\u2019s spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Washington Post that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d about a dog. Goldendoodles come in different sizes, are hypoallergenic, are playful and they\u2019re very smart. The Obamas have two first dogs -- Bo and Sunny -- which are Portuguese Water Dogs. The late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, gave Bo to the first family \u00a0after they entered the White House in 2009. Pope is confident Patton is destined to be the White House top dog. \u201cThat\u2019s up to them, but you know what, I certainly believe it will happen,\u201d the Florida resident said. \u201cPatton stops shows. He\u2019s a show stopper.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Protesters wait Friday outside Chicago Public Schools headquarters, where Black Lives Matter Youth met with city officials and Marist's principal. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The fathers of two girls expelled from Marist High School after being accused of sending racist text messages have filed a lawsuit against the private Southwest Side school that claims another teenager altered the texts. The lawsuit was filed in Cook County on Monday, one month after Indianapolis resident Joshua Beal, 25, was allegedly shot to death by a Chicago police officer in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood, where Marist is located. The shooting led to protests by both Black Lives Matter and pro-police demonstrators. Days later, in a group text message exchange between more than 30 students, a discussion began about the impact of the police shooting and the resulting Black Lives Matter protests would have on classes at Marist. During the exchange, someone allegedly wrote \"I f------ hate n------.\" Screenshots of the exchange were later posted to Twitter. The lawyer handling the lawsuit, which was filed anonymously under the names John Roe and John Doe, claims the images were doctored. \"According to my clients, another student, who particularly doesn't like one of my clients, somehow edited some of these chats to make it look more incriminating than it was. It appeared to be more of an outwardly racially hate-filled statement when the context was removed,\" attorney Steven Glink said in an interview Tuesday. \"It's a personal vendetta.\" Marist expelled the two girls, whose names have not been released. Three other students were also either suspended or expelled, according to the lawsuit. School representatives said they could not comment because of the pending litigation. ",

Flynn, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be national security adviser , Michael G. Flynn, resigned from the Trump transition team Tuesday, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported. He offered his resignation when it became clear that he was becoming a significant distraction and his position helping his father was no longer tenable. Flynn the younger was given the distinct impression that his tweets on fake news had become problematic and the transition did not intend to expend the energy or political capital necessary to defend him. He did scheduling things for his father and other tasks, but senior transition \u200eofficials don\u2019t know the extent of his work for his father. But he had quickly become a problem that was going to be solved immediately: he resigned before he was fired. Possibly seconds before, Garrett reported.\u00a0 The Trump transition team told reporters Tuesday only that Michael G. Flynn is not working with the transition. Michael G. Flynn could be seen attending at least a couple of meetings at Trump Tower with his father -- he\u2019s shown standing behind his father in photos like this one: Retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn talks to media as he arrives at Trump Tower, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, in New York.

His tweet came after a a man named\u00a0 Edgar Welch showed up over the weekend at the pizzeria armed with an assault-style rifle so that he could investigate the story for himself.\u00a0 Michael G. Flynn afterward tweeted that #Pizzagate would remain a story until it\u2019s \u201cproven to be false.\u201d Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story.

    "text": "Obama defends counterterror record in parting security speech, amid new warnings Published               December 06, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Obama, in what was billed as his last major national security speech in office, defended his counterterrorism record and strategy Tuesday while warning \u201cthe threat will endure\u201d well into the future \u2013 and taking a glancing shot at his successor\u2019s approach. \u00a0 Even as a new congressional report declared the U.S. is facing its highest threat from Islamist terrorists since 9/11, Obama claimed progress in the fight against terror in his address at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, home to U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. While calling Al Qaeda a shadow of its former self, the outgoing president said the U.S. and its allies also are \u201cbreaking the back of ISIL.\u201d \u201cThe results are clear. ISIL has lost more than half its territory, ISIL has lost control of major population centers, its morale is plummeting, its recruitment is drying up,\u201d Obama said. He also declared that during his two terms, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned or executed an attack on the homeland. At the same time, Obama acknowledged America has faced numerous attacks from \u201chomegrown and largely isolated individuals who were radicalized online.\u201d \u201cTo say that we\u2019ve made progress is not to say that the job is done,\u201d Obama said, adding \u201cviolent extremism will be with us for years to come.\u201d He also seemed to critique President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric on the subject, without mentioning him by name: \u201cRather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs, or deploying more\u2026 troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world, we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat.\u201d Despite Obama\u2019s claims of progress, a new report published earlier Tuesday afternoon by the House Homeland Security Committee showed a growing threat to the United States and Europe. \u201cMake no mistake: we face a deadlier threat than ever before not only because our enemies have gotten savvier, but because we took the pressure off them,\u201d House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement on the report. \u201cFor eight years, the Obama Administration reluctantly played global whack-a-mole with terrorists rather than leaning into the fight with decisive leadership.\u201d The report said that throughout 2016, ISIS conducted 62 attacks worldwide, injuring 732 people and killing 215 in several countries, including the United States, France, and Belgium. According to the report, ISIS\u2019 shift in messaging from joining the jihad in Syria and Iraq to carrying out attacks in fighters\u2019 home countries is likely to accelerate the trend of at-home radicalization.\u00a0 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also slammed Obama's speech Tuesday as a \"feeble attempt to evade the harsh judgment of history.\" He said in a statement that \"his legacy on counterterrorism is unmistakably clear: a disastrous withdrawal from Iraq, the terrorist rampage of ISIL, an indecisive approach to the war in Afghanistan that has empowered the Taliban, and an indifferent approach to the carnage in Syria on which our terrorist enemies have thrived.\" Before taking the stage Tuesday, Obama met with top military leaders at the base, including Gen. Raymond Thomas, who heads U.S. Special Operations Command. He also told about 250 U.S. service members gathered in a gym that it had been the privilege of his lifetime to serve as their commander in chief. For Obama, who came into office telling a war-weary nation he would wind down two wars and prevent new ones, the inclination toward smaller-scale, limited military involvement was a natural extension of his foreign policy philosophy. But his approach has most notably come up short in Syria, where Obama long ago predicted that U.S.-backed forces would eventually prevail over Syrian President Bashar Assad. Assad's grip on power appears stronger than it has in years while the brutal civil war continues to rage. Trump has said little about how he intends to shift course in Syria and whether he would continue Obama's strategy in other regions destabilized by extremist group. He's argued that ambiguity and unpredictability are assets that deny the enemy a chance to plan ahead. Still, all signs suggest he'll pursue a more muscular, military-driven approach to extremist groups like the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Trump has argued that Obama's decision to withdraw the bulk of troops from Iraq, rather than negotiating harder with Baghdad to leave some there, created a power vacuum that allowed ISIS to form and seize territory. During the presidential campaign, he said he would listen to top military officers about the need for ground troops to fight ISIS, at one point floating a figure of 20,000 to 30,000. Meanwhile, he's suggested that ousting Assad isn't a top priority and that closer alignment between the U.S. and Russia, which backs Assad, would be positive. Obama was promoting Tuesday the benefits of his more limited approach. Under Obama, the number of U.S. troops Iraq and Afghanistan has dropped from roughly 180,000 to 15,000 today, according to deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. Meanwhile, the U.S. has been able to take out key Al Qaeda leaders, most notably Usama bin Laden, and has started edging the Islamic State group out of strongholds like Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. Yet while U.S. troop casualties declined significantly under Obama's approach, as he finishes his term the U.S. is fighting in far more corners of the globe \u2013 as ISIS has nearly tripled the number of countries where it operates. Military action under former President George W. Bush was mostly limited to Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Under Obama, the U.S. is also launching strikes in Syria, Somalia, Libya and Yemen, according to a report to Congress the White House released this week. Additional U.S. troops and assets are also in Jordan, Djibouti, Turkey, Egypt and Cameroon to support counterterrorism missions, while other overseas operations remain classified.

In a surprise appearance in front of reporters at Trump Tower after sending the social media message, Trump expanded on his latest target for negotiation. \"Well, the plane is totally out of control. It's gonna be over 4 billion dollars ... and, I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,\" Trump said. \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 In response to Trump, Boeing issued a statement regarding the Air Force One program, putting the amount of their current contract at just $170 million with more phases to come. \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" the statement read. Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not answer directly how Trump knew the price of the new Air Force One, but according to the latest figures, Trump is likely correct about the eventual $4 billion price tag, which would be paid out over the next decade or more. Research and development is already at $2.7 billion for the first two years, a number that is already budgeted and approved, and the Government Accountability Office warned last year that the cost would be approximately $3.2 billion. By the time the aircraft is delivered, the total cost will likely be over $4 billion, because the government still has to buy the two aircraft once they are built. Play ",

    "text": "AP Dec 6, 2016 6:35 PM EST BERLIN --\u00a0Scientists have developed a mind-controlled robotic hand that allows people with certain types of spinal injuries to perform everyday tasks such as using a fork or drinking from a cup. The low-cost device was tested in Spain on six people with quadriplegia affecting their ability to grasp or manipulate objects. By wearing a cap that measures electric brain activity and eye movement the users were able to send signals to a tablet computer that controlled the glove-like device attached to their hand. Close Science Robotics Participants in the small-scale study were able to perform daily activities better with the robotic hand than without, according to results published Tuesday in the journal Science Robotics. The principle of using brain-controlled robotic aids to assist people with quadriplegia isn\u2019t new. But many existing systems require implants, which can cause health problems, or use wet gel to transmit signals from the scalp to the electrodes. The gel needs to be washed out of the user\u2019s hair afterward, making it impractical in daily life. \u201cThe participants, who had previously expressed difficulty in performing everyday tasks without assistance, rated the system as reliable and practical, and did not indicate any discomfort during or after use,\u201d the researchers said. It took participants just 10 minutes to learn how to use the system before they were able to carry out tasks such as picking up potato chips or signing a document. According to Surjo R. Soekadar, a neuroscientist at the University Hospital Tuebingen in Germany and lead author of the study, participants represented typical people with high spinal cord injuries, meaning they were able to move their shoulders but not their fingers. There were some limitations to the system, though. Users had to have sufficient function in their shoulder and arm to reach out with the robotic hand. And mounting the system required another person\u2019s help. Close Science Robotics Jan Schwab, an expert on spinal cord injury at Berlin\u2019s Charite hospital who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it an interesting pilot study that needs to be followed up with further clinical tests. \u201cBigger studies will be very important to find out which patients respond well, less well or not at all,\u201d Schwab said. Soekadar said the system could be brought to market within two years at a cost of between 5,000 and 10,000 euros ($5,370 to $10,740), depending on functionality. The device could also be used to help re-train the brain of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation, he said. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The footage from October raises new questions about whether authorities in Oakland, California, were aware of possible safety issues at the warehouse or knew that people were living there, even though it was not zoned for residential use. Derick Almena, the embattled manager of the warehouse , said police came to the building while responding to a neighbor's party because they needed access to the roof. The Oakland Police Department declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.

The city of Oakland requires yearly fire inspections for residential and commercial properties, but the head of the firefighters' union said scarce resources may have meant the warehouse didn't get one. \"There are many unsafe buildings in the city,\" union chief Zach Unger told NBC News. The two-story, 10,000-square-foot structure was a maze of makeshift studios and apartments, much of it crammed with wood furniture, and there appeared to be no sprinklers. Residents said the heating and electrical systems were improvised. The warehouse owner, Chor Ng, rented it to Alemena, who lived there with his wife and three children and also rented space to other people.

It's not clear if the agency noted any issues during its site visit, but the children were returned to the couple. The family was staying in a hotel the night of the fire because, Almena said, of a dance music party being thrown on the site. This 2014 photo provided by Ajesh Shah shows the interior of a portion of the 'Ghost Ship' warehouse, taken while he was on a tour as a potential tenant of the Oakland, Calif., building. Ajesh Shah / AP In an interview Tuesday morning , Almena defended his management of the building and said when he signed the lease, he \"got a building that was to city standards supposedly.\" City records show at least 10 complaints had been lodged against the property since Ng bought it in 1997, ranging from trash and debris piling up to an allegation of an illegal structure. In some cases, the city corrected problems and then took out liens against Ng for the money spent on the work. Housing officials say there was an open investigation into the building, but residents say they were never contacted. The Oakland Mayor's Office had no comment. In a statement, the Ng family said: \"We are also trying to figure out what's going on like everybody else. We're sorry to hear about the tragedy. Our condolences go out to family and friends.\" Stephanie Gosk ",

He made the announcement at a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. The Japanese government said it will build six helicopter landing zones and access roads so U.S. forces can continue to train and operate at the base. Residents have grown increasingly frustrated with the U.S. military presence on Okinawa, fueled by a series of incidents involving American service members stationed there. Large crowds gathered on the small island over the summer to protest a U.S. contractor's alleged rape and murder of a local Japanese woman. In March of 2016, an American sailor was arrested on a charge of raping a Japanese woman. And just before that incident, Stars and Stripes reported that a 33-year-old Navy lieutenant was arrested for allegedly groping a 19-year-old Japanese woman on an airplane and punching her multiple times in the head. A senior defense official told ABC News that the agreement will formalize the largest land return by the United States to Japan since 1972. The official called it \"a positive development for the alliance, demonstrating the ongoing commitment of both governments to the realignment of U.S. forces.\" A ceremony for the return will take place on Dec. 21 and 22. 0 Shares ",

By Philip Bump December 6 at 4:30 PM Follow @pbump This post has been updated. Shares of stock in aircraft manufacturer Boeing fell nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday. The reason? A tweet from the president-elect. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Were Boeing to lose a $4 billion contract, that would certainly cause people to be skeptical of future earnings. But this, as seems always to be the case with Donald Trump tweets, is not the full story. As our Christian Davenport reports , the contract with Boeing is currently $170 million. The government's plan to replace Air Force One actually involves two different planes which would serve future presidents for years to come. Boeing won the contract in 2015; the new planes are expected to be operational in about a decade. The $170 million isn't for manufacturing, after all. It's for Boeing's work \"determin[ing] the capabilities\" of the planes they will eventually produce. It was natural to wonder, given the apparently unprompted nature of Trump's tweet, if part of his comment was meant to suggest he would prefer to use his existing aircraft for the job of the presidency. His campaign spent $6.7 million on his personal aircraft after he announced his candidacy, and he has called Air Force One \"a step down\" from his personal aircraft \"in every way.\" (Not size , mind you.) Once Trump received a Secret Service detail, the agency paid $1.6 million for its agents to travel with him -- money that went to TAG Air, a company owned by Trump. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump documented the changes he made to his 757 jet in a 2011 video on his YouTube channel. (Donald Trump/YouTube) Trump's current plane is also a Boeing. The Air Force wouldn't let Trump keep using his plane as president, though, unless it were significantly upgraded. As CNN reported earlier this month, Trump's personal plane would need to be upgraded with critical functionality to serve as his official aircraft. That includes missile detection and avoidance systems, electromagnetic shielding, mid-air refueling mechanisms and confidential communications systems. The cost of those upgrades would be up to Trump. As it turns out, though, the Trump tweet may not have been unprompted. CNN's Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that shortly before the tweet (which was posted at 8:52 a.m. Eastern) the Chicago Tribune posted an article quoting the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenberg.\u00a0(The comments were made at a speech on Friday, not in an interview with the Tribune, as this article originally indicated.) \"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" Muilenberg said at the Illinois Manufacturing Association last week, as noted by Tribune columnist Robert Reed. Fair trade has helped Boeing, which prides itself on being America's largest manufacturing exporter . \"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world,\" Muilenberg continued, noting that a third of the planes were sent to China. \"This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985.\" Those are pointed comments. It was Trump, of course, who robustly criticized free trade during the general election. And it is Trump who, this week, seemed to threaten a trade war with China. Shortly after tweeting that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled, Dec. 6, President-elect Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower he wants the company \"to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" (The Washington Post) That story has a dateline of 7:30 Central time -- 8:30 Eastern. Trump's tweet came out a few minutes later. We don't know that Trump was responding to the Tribune story. We do know that the last time he tweeted an out-of-the-blue opinion, about flag-burning, it was immediately after a Fox News segment showing students burning flags. We also know that Trump's tweet tanked Boeing's stock price, albeit only briefly. In 2013, Trump tweeted about having just bought stock in Boeing (\"great company!\"), but his spokesman said on Tuesday that the president-elect no longer holds stock in Boeing, or anything else, having sold it all in June. The fluctuations in Boeing's stock price that may have stemmed from Trump's annoyance at a news article criticizing his policies in the lightest of terms, then, only affected other people. Update: Some good news for shareholders: Boeing's stock ended the day up slightly. politics ",

(Dec. 5) AP It's not exactly a war of words, but China and Donald Trump are going after each other in public media. Chinese state media denounced the U.S. president-elect as a \"diplomatic rookie\" on Tuesday, hitting him for his phone call with the leader of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, and his subsequent comments about China's government. \"Provoking friction and messing up China-US relations won't help 'make America great again,'\" said a front-page opinion piece in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, reports the AFP wire service . The Global Times'\u00a0Chinese edition hit Trump\u00a0for his \"inability to keep his mouth shut,\" and his \"provocation and falsehoods,\" according to AFP. Trump said Tsai called him to congratulate him on his election; others in the president-elect's orbit described the call as part of an effort to re-calibrate the relationship with China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province. After China protested the Taiwan call, Trump hit back Sunday night in a pair of tweets. \"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!\" Trump said. ",

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama speaks on counterterrorism at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa on Tuesday. (Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama gave an optimistic assessment of the campaign against terror across North Africa and the Middle East on Tuesday, thanking U.S. troops for their help in \"breaking the back\" of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In his last major foreign policy address of his presidency, Obama urged Americans to \"put the terrorist threat in perspective,\" and reject torture, unlimited detention and heightened scrutiny against Muslim Americans\u00a0\u2014 all hallmarks of President-elect Donald Trump's counter-terrorism policies. \"The terrorist threat is real and it is dangerous,\" Obama told a crowd that included special operations troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. But unlike fascism and communism, today's extremists are do not threaten the world order.\u00a0\"They are thugs and they are murderers and they should be treated that way.\" While noting that he will be the first president to serve two full terms in a state of war,\u00a0Obama\u00a0laid out a detailed defense of a his military strategy. It was a doctrine doctrine that avoided large-scale military deployments in favor of more targeted actions to support foreign troops fighting terrorists.\u00a0\"It demonstrates a shift in how we have taken the fight against terrorists everywhere,\" Obama said.\u00a0\"Instead of trying to mount invasions wherever terrorists appear, we've built a network of partners.\" But while Obama touted the withdrawal of 180,000 troops from Iraq and Afghanistan since taking office, a report Obama sent to Congress Monday shows that he has been unable to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Africa and the Middle East. The unclassified version of his semiannual war powers letter outlined\u00a019,996 combat troops he's authorized in hot spots from Afghanistan to Cameroon to Kosovo \u2014 1,579 more than just six months ago. There are 1,352 troops scheduled to depart Afghanistan by Jan. 1, however. White House aides said the speech had been planned since before the election, and Obama did not mention his successor by name. But Obama's\u00a0final foreign policy speech provided a clear contrast with President-elect Donald Trump's more bellicose approach to fighting terrorism. \"Staying true to our traditions as a nation of laws advances our security as well as our values,\" he said. He argued that the United States should continue to ban the use of torture, close the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, and \"deal with suspected terrorists through our justice system.\" Obama has been unable to make good on his eight-year promise to close Guantanamo Bay because of Congressional restrictions on transferring prisoners to U.S. soil. After transferring scores of detainees to third countries \u2014 including one to Cape Verde on Sunday \u2014 the prison now holds 59 suspected terrorists captured during the early days of the war on terror. \"Until Congress changes course, it will continue to be judged harshly by history,\" he said, calling the prison \"a\u00a0blot on our\u00a0national honor.\" Obama also urged a more democratic and transparent use of presidential war powers, calling\u00a0on Congress to update its 2001 authorization to use military force to adapt it to today's threat. \"Democracies should not operate in a state of permanently authorized war,\" he said. The speech comes the day after Obama laid out the legal justifications for how he's prosecuted the war on terror in a 66-page report that revealed how his administration has claimed broad powers to fight the war on terrorism. In a presidential memorandum to national security agencies, he encouraged them to report annually on the legal justifications on their actions into the next administration. 89 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 53 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hb3KLV ",

Check out some of the animals with the longest lifespans recorded in history. USA TODAY NETWORK Clam up! Rings in the quahog clam gave scientists an unprecedented look at the history of Earth's oceans. (Photo: Paul Butler, Cardiff University) 5119 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 47 COMMENTEMAILMORE Clams are more than just a tasty dish in chowder, they're also important in\u00a0understanding Earth's history. The world's oldest animals,\u00a0500-year-old clams\u00a0have given\u00a0scientists an unprecedented\u00a0look at the climate history of the oceans. By studying growth rings in the shells of quahog clams, scientists have pieced together the history of the North Atlantic Ocean over the past 1,000 years. The method is similar to how tree rings can serve as climate proxies\u00a0by revealing clues\u00a0about past weather and climate changes, including droughts. Quahogs, also known as hard clams or chowder clams, are edible mollusks that live in the North Atlantic Ocean along North America and Europe. By studying the clams' shells, scientists from Cardiff University and Bangor University in Wales found that the ocean's relationship with the atmosphere drastically changed over the centuries. That\u00a0is likely due to the influence of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that have been pumped into the atmosphere from humanity's burning of fossil fuels, beginning with\u00a0the Industrial Revolution. Although clams have been used as climate proxies through the field called sclerochronology\u00a0since the 1970s,\u00a0the new\u00a0study is the first time researchers have been able to obtain a 1,000-year record of the ocean with absolute dating precision, according to lead author David Reynolds of Cardiff University. Meet the shark born before George Washington In the pre-industrial era, roughly before 1800, the climate was driven by natural factors such as volcanic eruptions and solar activity, he said.\u00a0At that time, the ocean influenced\u00a0the atmosphere. But since then, it's been the other way around: The\u00a0atmosphere, with its increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,\u00a0has driven major shifts underwater. \"The changes that we are seeing in ocean chemistry are unprecedented relative to the last 1,000 years,\" Reynolds said. Scientists studied\u00a0living and fossil clams from a\u00a0sea bed north of Iceland. By\u00a0comparing the ring widths of live and fossil shells, they were able to date shells that lived during the same time period because they contained the same pattern. \"By using multiple fossil shells we were therefore able to extend the record backwards through time to cover the entire last 1,000 years,\" Reynolds said. The results of the study,\u00a0published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed British\u00a0journal\u00a0Nature Communications ,\u00a0are critical to determine how changes in the Atlantic Ocean could impact the climate and weather across the Northern Hemisphere in the future. \u201cIf we are to continue to develop the most robust near-term predictions of future climate change, we must continue to develop robust reconstructions of past ocean variability,\u201d said\u00a0study co-author Ian Hall\u00a0of Cardiff University. 5119 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 47 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hdf4ar ",

    "text": "Authorities have begun identifying the victims of a deadly warehouse fire that claimed the lives of 36 people Mayor Libby Schaaf deflected questions about whether more aggressive action by authorities could have prevented the tragedy at the building known as the Ghost Ship. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and prosecutors said they are looking into the possibility of criminal charges.\u00a0 The Alameda County Coroner\u2019s Bureau released the names late Tuesday of 9 more victims who have been positively identified.\u00a0 The news release issued by the city of Oakland says the nine were men and women in their 20s and 30s, and most came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Authorities say all but one of the 36 people who died have been identified. Most, but not all of those who have been identified, have been publicly named. The local sheriff, who is also the coroner, told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud he doesn\u2019t believe there are more bodies inside.\u00a0 The building itself is so compromised that work here is dangerous and they\u2019re getting much-needed help from some heavy machinery. Crews brought in a large crane to help comb through the charred rubble where the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d once stood as a criminal investigation begins. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at two things: one is whether or not there is any criminal liability attached to this fire and secondly, if there is criminal liability, against whom,\u201d said Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley. \u00a0 O\u2019Malley said potential charges could range from involuntary manslaughter to murder.\u00a0 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says it is looking at the possibility that a refrigerator or other appliance was the source of the fire.\u00a0 Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge of the ATF\u2019s San Francisco office, said it\u2019s too early to say for sure a refrigerator caused the blaze, but she said it was a potential source of ignition. Snyder said investigators are looking at anything electrical on the first floor of the warehouse near where the fire started. Record searches and interviews by The Associated Press indicate that the couple who leased the warehouse and turned it into living spaces and artists\u2019 studios, Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison, were already under scrutiny by several agencies. Some of those agencies had been told or could have seen for themselves that the family of five and their dozens of artist tenants were living in a warehouse that had no permit to operate as a living space and allegedly had no proper kitchen, electricity, adequate fire exits or solid stairs.\u00a0 Almena, 46, is on probation for receiving stolen property, an Airstream trailer he was accused of stealing and stashing at the warehouse. The terms of his probation allowed authorities to enter his home to search without a warrant, records show. Child welfare workers had taken away the couple\u2019s three children in mid-2015 but returned them by this past summer, despite the illegal conditions at the warehouse and the children being hungry, infested with lice and frequently truant, Micah Allison\u2019s father and other acquaintances said. Almena confirmed in a 2015 document that child welfare workers visited the warehouse at least twice. Child welfare authorities refused to comment on the family, citing privacy laws. In returning the children, the authorities set certain conditions, including that the youngsters be out of the warehouse during the many parties held there, according to those who knew the couple. On the night of the fire, Allison and the three children had checked into an Oakland hotel, according to Almena. All of them survived. Almena said in a TV interview that he had little involvement in the party and had gone to the hotel as well.\u00a0 Almena told the \u201cToday Show\u201d on Tuesday that he was \u201cincredibly sorry.\u201d \u00a0 Almena said he started the community in the warehouse as a dream for the arts and performing arts, but, he said, sometimes \u201cyour dream is bigger than your pocketbook.\u201d He said he signed a lease for the building that \u201cwas to city standards supposedly.\u201d Almena said he lived in the warehouse with his family and other residents, but said he didn\u2019t make a profit. He said, \u201cThis is not profit; this is loss. This is a mass grave.\u201d ",

    "text": "Pipeline Delays Cost Builder Millions, Risking Contract Loss By david pitt, associated press DES MOINES, Iowa \u0097 Dec 6, 2016, 1:00 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this Nov. 25, 2016 satellite image taken by DigitalGlobe, the construction site of the the Dakota Access pipeline is seen near Cannon Ball, N.D. (DigitalGlobe via AP) 0 Shares Email The completion of the Dakota Access oil pipeline has been delayed after the U.S. Army declined to grant an easement for the final few thousand feet under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota pending further study. Pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners originally was expected to finish the pipeline before the end of this year, but the Army's move likely delays it by several months. That will be costly to the Dallas-based company, but industry experts say it's unlikely to kill the project completely. Here's a look at some of the ways the delay could impact the pipeline: WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT? Delays have already cost Energy Transfer Partners more than $450 million, the company said in court documents last month, and continued delays cost $83.3 million per month. The Army Corps of Engineers isn't very sympathetic saying in court filings that the company knowingly began construction prior to receiving all necessary approvals \"at its own risk.\" HOW LONG OF A DELAY IS LIKELY? The Army's decision likely halts progress on the project until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump, who supports the pipeline and holds stock in Energy Transfer Partners, hasn't said whether he will try to overturn the Army's decision. Dakota Access has said tunneling under Lake Oahe is likely to take at least 60 days once digging begins and some industry experts say it could take as long as 90 days. So, if the Trump administration were to immediately reverses course and authorize construction, the pipeline likely wouldn't be completed until April or May. COULD DELAYS DOOM THE PROJECT? Dakota Access attorney William Scherman said in a Nov. 15 document filed in U.S. District Court in Washington that further delay could \"threaten the very survival\" of the $3.8 billion privately funded project, which would carry North Dakota oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. He said the company has long-term transportation contracts with nine shippers indicating the pipeline will be in service by Jan. 1, 2017, and the shippers have the right to terminate those contracts if terms aren't met. Industry experts say the contracts likely have several target dates including project start date, in-service date and differing start dates for the nine shippers. It's difficult to say when they might walk, but shippers are unlikely to cancel the deal easily because most are probably shipping by rail now at a cost of $8 or $9 a barrel, while the pipeline is likely to cost much less, more like $5 or $6 a barrel, said Skip York, a vice president at energy industry consultant Wood Mackenzie. COULDN'T SHIPPERS SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE IF CONTRACTS EXPIRE? Yes. When Dakota Access signed on shippers in 2014, crude oil prices were at $95 a barrel, but they've averaged around $45 to $50 a barrel recently, which could be in incentive for some to use the delay as a reason to want to open up the terms for renegotiation. Shippers say they're not concerned yet. Hess Corp. spokesman John Roper says the company can just continue using current transportation methods. Dennis Nuss, a spokesman for petroleum company Phillips 66, which owns a 25 percent stake in the pipeline, expressed confidence the project will be finished early next year. ARE THERE OTHER OBSTACLES TO THE PIPELINE? Yes. In Iowa, about a dozen landowners forced to allow the pipe on their farmland through a state eminent domain law are pressing forward on their own legal challenge. They contend, among other arguments, that a 2006 Iowa law prohibits an industry from using eminent domain to take agricultural land. They're asking a judge to throw out what they consider to be illegal easements granted by the Iowa Utilities Board.

Peter Dejong/AP hide caption toggle caption Peter Dejong/AP Dominic Ongwen, a senior commander in the Lord's Resistance Army, enters the courtroom of the International Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on Tuesday. Peter Dejong/AP The Lord's Resistance Army committed horrifying crimes against civilians for almost three decades, killing thousands in northern Uganda and beyond its borders. Now, the first-ever trial of an LRA commander has opened at the International Criminal Court. Dominic Ongwen, who was kidnapped when he was a boy and forced to become a child soldier, \"pleaded not guilty to 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2014 including murder and enslavement,\" as NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports. #Ongwen pleads \u201cnot guilty\u201d with respect to all the charges faced at his #ICC trial Watch: https://t.co/hQyzvjKJRO Courtroom 1 pic.twitter.com/6f6DSjwMKS \u2014 Int'l Criminal Court (@IntlCrimCourt) December 6, 2016 In court, he said: \"In the name God, I deny all these charges,\" according to The Associated Press. Here's more from Ofeibea: \"At age 10, Ongwen, nicknamed the White Ant, was captured and became a child fighter and then a commander in the feared LRA, which terrorized northern Uganda for years. Tens of thousands of girls and boys were abducted and forced to fight and become sex slaves and porters.\" Ongwen's status as a former child soldier could be relevant to the legal proceedings; as Ofeibea reports, he told the ICC that \"he's a victim and the Lord's Resistance Army rebel group's leader, Joseph Kony, should be facing war crimes charges.\" Kony remains at large. Article continues after sponsorship Ongwen's mental state is also a factor. \"On the eve of the trial, Ongwen and his lawyers claimed he did not properly understand the charges and called for psychological tests to establish if he was mentally fit to plead,\" according to the AP. \"Judges ordered him to enter a plea anyway.\" Ongwen \"was the subject of a decade-long manhunt until he turned himself in last year, possibly because he feared being killed by his superior, Joseph Kony,\" as The New York Times reports . The charges in this case are tied to atrocities committed in 2003 and 2004 in four displaced persons camps \u2014 \"Pajule, Odek, Abok, and Lukodi \u2014 including murder, torture, enslavement, persecution, and pillage,\" according to Human Rights Watch . The LRA is notorious for kidnapping girls and women and repeatedly raping them. \"Prosecutors said seven women had given statements saying that Mr. Ongwen had raped them as young girls, one when she was 10 years old,\" according to the Times. The trial is being watched closely in Uganda \u2014 the ICC has set up viewing sites and tweeted pictures of large gatherings watching today's court session. Thousands of victims are involved in this case. \u2014 Int'l Criminal Court (@IntlCrimCourt) December 6, 2016 Human Rights Watch called it \"an important new chapter in holding the rebel group accountable for its brutal crimes in northern Uganda.\" The group has lost considerable power in recent years, and the Times reports that Kony's forces are reported to \"have dwindled to 100 or so men.\" The LRA's numbers have waned, as NPR's Gregory Warner has reported , in part because of Uganda's amnesty law: \"Amnesty means that no matter how many murders or mutilations those other rebels have committed, they can walk out of the forest back into civilization and not do a single day in jail. ... But because of Ongwen's ICC indictment, he doesn't qualify for amnesty.\" As The Two-Way has reported , some African leaders have argued that the court disproportionately brings cases against Africans. In fact: \"every person tried by the ICC since the treaty creating it was adopted in 1998 has been African.\" ",

Trump, asked about a tweet he sent on canceling a Boeing contract to build a new Air Force One, said the costs were \"ridiculous\" and that \"Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.\" By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump , who has for years flown in a jet bearing his name, criticized a pending order for a new Air Force One , saying Tuesday morning on Twitter that the upgrade would cost too much. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 6, 2016 The post appeared to come out of the blue: Mr. Trump had not focused during the campaign on the cost of Boeing\u2019s plans for a next-generation plane for the president. And his criticism of the contract to build on a newer Boeing 747-8 airframe raised the possibility that he might prefer to keep flying his own, well-appointed 757. The Secret Service and the Defense Department might object to Mr. Trump keeping his own airplane. Beyond convenience, Air Force One carries an array of top-secret communications gear for conducting everyday business \u2014 and for managing a global crisis, if required, while aloft. It is also equipped with a number of never discussed security features. The current Air Force One, with its white and blue design recognizable around the globe, is aging. There are actually two of the Boeing 747-200B planes, each bearing the famous call sign only when the president is aboard. The Air Force designates them VC-25A . Advertisement Continue reading the main story They were commissioned by President Ronald Reagan and delivered during the term of his successor, President George Bush. The new plane, which the Defense Department had hoped to deliver to the White House by 2023, would have been more powerful, able to travel farther and more technologically advanced. But given Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post, it is unclear when \u2014 or whether \u2014 Air Force One will get an upgrade. In remarks to reporters at Trump Tower shortly after his message, Mr. Trump made clear that he was serious about the issue. He accused Boeing of escalating the costs of building a new plane. \u201cThe plane is totally out of control,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d In a statement just before noon on Tuesday, Boeing made no mention of Mr. Trump or his post on Twitter, but it said it remained committed to proceeding with the upgrade to Air Force One.

Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern said a person who escaped the deadly blaze told authorities there were flames coming from the refrigerator, and evidence found at the scene so far supports the claim. \"On that back wall, there's a significant 45 degree angle burn,\" Ahern told KTVU-TV , which he said could indicate it was the source of the fire. Additional details on a possible cause of the blaze have not yet been released by officials. More on this... Charges possible over deadly Oakland warehouse fire, DA says Ahern also released heartbreaking details of what rescuers found when they searched the warehouse. Two of the victims appeared to be hugging when they died, according to Ahern. The male and female were found on top of one of the seven RVs in the center of the building. It is believed the floor collapsed and the male and female, along with another person, landed on top of the vehicle, he said. \"For our people to see that, it was very emotional for them,\" Ahern said. Work inside the building resumed after it was stopped for several hours Monday.\u00a0 Oakland Fire Deputy Chief Darin White said officials have finished searching 90 percent of the warehouse, and that crews should complete their search of the remaining 10 percent of the building by midnight. Fire officials started knocking down parts of the building that they said were structurally unsound. Officials said the debris will fall on areas that have already been searched for bodies. The death toll remained at 36 on Tuesday with no changes overnight in the number of bodies recovered from the remains. Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy Tya Modeste said 36 bodies have been recovered and 26 of their families have been notified, while another nine bodies have been \"tentatively identified.\" Officials are still lacking any type of identity for one individual. \u201cOur hope is not to find any more (victims),\u201d Lipp said during a press conference. \u201cWe want to completely clear the building.\u201d The building\u2019s structure and safety have reportedly been on city officials\u2019 radar for some time and questions have emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the fire. Oakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints about the warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn't get inside, said Darin Ranelletti of the Oakland Planning Department. Once the building is cleared, the investigation will turn to the cause of the fire. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze. \"We owe it to the community and those who perished in this fire, and those who survived the fire to be methodical, to be thorough, and to take the amount of time it takes to be able to look at every piece of potential evidence,\" Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said. Shelley Mack, who lived at the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d for several months about two years ago, said the building was a \u201cdeath trap.\u201d The building was crammed with rugs, old sofas and a garage-sale-like collection of pianos, paintings, turntables, statues and other items that quickly fed the flames. \"I didn't think it was going to last this long before it went up or somebody shut it down,\u201d she said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Gen. Michael Flynn -- was forced out of the transition efforts amid controversy over a fake news story that he pushed on Twitter. \"The younger Michael Flynn was helping his father with some administration and scheduling duties early on in the transition process,\" Trump team spokesman Jason Miller said, adding that he is \"no longer involved with the transition efforts.\" The decision came from President-elect Donald Trump himself, two Trump transition officials said. Flynn Jr. is accused of pushing the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory in a flood of tweets Sunday and Monday, prompted by gunplay at Ping Pong Comet Pizza in Washington, D.C. The suspect in that case allegedly went to the eatery to investigate what turned out to be a fake news story involving Hillary Clinton and campaign manager John Podesta . ",

Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said Gasser's statement shortly after McKnight was killed was \"replete with statements talking about his fear of McKnight making threatening statements and otherwise, and that's why, on Thursday evening, only faced with and only having Mr. Gasser's statement, that we thought it was best that an arrest not be made for strategic reasons, until we could get other witnesses.\" In Louisiana, Normand said, there are \"very forward-leaning, stand-your-ground, self-defense, justifiable homicide laws\" that, he said, create for \u201cus an obligation to make sure that we get it right.\u201d Gasser was arrested and charged with manslaughter Monday, according to Jefferson Parish records, four days after the Thursday afternoon shooting. Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Office via AP A booking photo of Ronald Gasser, 54, the man arrested on Dec. 5, 2016 for fatally shooting ex-NFL player Joe McKnight in a New Orleans suburb during a road rage dispute. No Indication of Hate Crime in Fatal Road Rage Shooting of Ex-NFL Player Joe McKnight Normand today confirmed Gasser's arrest, saying, at about 5 p.m. local time Monday \"we collectively came together and decided that we were prepared to draft an arrest warrant for the arrest of Mr. Gasser.\" Gasser had an initial court appearance this morning, and bond was listed at $500,000. He was assigned a public defender; the public defender's office declined to comment. Gasser's next court appearance is set for Dec. 21 for disposition of charges. If charges are accepted he will be arraigned. At a news conference, Normand this morning defended his arrest of Gasser on Monday rather than on the day of the shooting, saying if he had made the arrest last week, some witnesses would not have come forward. The case was still developing as of this morning, Normand added. \"Justice has no time period. Justice is not a sprint, it is a marathon. These investigations are marathons,\" he said, adding, \"our arrest is only as good as a prosecution.\" Normand this morning thanked the McKnight family for its patience, restraint and trust. Normand this morning conveyed more information about the shooting Thursday afternoon in Terrytown, Louisiana, located about 5 miles south of New Orleans across the Mississippi River, that killed McKnight, 28. He said Gasser and McKnight's cars were in an altercation, cutting in front of one another, and Gasser got in front of McKnight's car at a red light. He said McKnight pulled \u201caround on the right-hand side, comes to a stop on the side of Mr. Gasser's car.\" Al Pereira/New York Jets/Getty Images Running Back Joe McKnight, #25 of the New York Jets, follows the action against the Miami Dolphins when the Miami Dolphins host the New York Jets at Sun Life Stadium, on Sept. 23, 2012, in Miami Gardens, Florida. There were several other cars around Gasser, Normand said, and \"Mr. Gasser is hemmed in and does not have an avenue for retreat.\" With their windows rolled down, Gasser and McKnight had a verbal altercation while in their own cars, Normand said. Then, McKnight got out of his car and went to Gasser's car, and \"there continues to be a verbal altercation,\" the sheriff said. At some point \"Mr. Gasser pulls his weapon ... and fires three shots at Joe McKnight, killing him,\" the sheriff said. Gasser got out of his car after the shooting \"to see what actually happened to him,\" the sheriff said. Norman today said there was a gun in the car that McKnight was in, clarifying that it was McKnight's stepfather's gun and McKnight's stepfather's car. Normand said both of the men were \"engaged in unacceptable behavior\" and \"did not understand how to deal with conflict resolution.\" Normand called it \"incredibly tragic consequences over bad driving behavior and bad spoken words.\" Gasser, 54, stayed at the scene after the shooting, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Gasser allegedly admitted to fatally shooting McKnight and cooperated with the investigation, the sheriff's office said. Gasser, who relinquished his gun, was taken into custody and questioned by authorities Thursday before he was released later that night without charges, officials said. Rebecca Santana/AP A roadside memorial at the intersection where ex-NFL player Joe McKnight was shot and killed during a road rage incident in Terrytown, La., Dec. 2, 2016. Normand said they started the investigation Thursday afternoon with a witness who he said lied. He said the witness said Gasser got out of his car and aggressively took McKnight out of the other car. He said the witness said that Gasser \"got out of his car, popped caps [shot] through the windshield of Joe McKnight's car, yanked him out of the car and popped him again while he was on the ground, saying he had voted for Donald Trump and he was going to show him relative to that, and we were off and running. And you know why? Because some people wanted that story to be true.\" \"That particular witness told three different stories in a span of an hour,\" he said. \"Shame on that individual.\" Norman said that on Saturday \"we finally located a witness that was key to this case,\" adding, \"several other witnesses since Saturday, up until last night at 7 p.m. that we located yet another witness that was key to making this case.\" Normand said this shooting was not about race, a point he also made Friday. He said this shooting was about \"two people engaged in bad behavior.\" \"Why? I don\u2019t know. But they did.\" Normand said they have conducted over 160 interviews. \"We identified 260 folks that we had an interest in talking to based on license plate recognition camera hits of multiple cameras,\" he said. \"We talked to over 70 business owners in an attempt to retrieve video.\" After Normand thanked local leaders for their support this morning, he appeared emotional at one point during the news conference as he said that local officials were the target of harassment because they supported the sheriff's decision not to immediately arrest Gasser and instead let the investigative process take its course. \"Our elected leaders that stood by me and I want to thank them again. You are true leaders. You are credible leaders. You did not do what was in your best interest. You did what was in the best interest of the community and you're suffering for it,\" he said. \"I'm sure you see the emotion in me because it's not fair.\" The sheriff read some of the harassing language, which included profanity and racial slurs. \"That's the tone of what we're calling our elected leaders for standing up and simply saying let justice prevail and let the process take its course,\" he said. \"The tone of these go on and on and on and all we simply asked for was let them do their job. \"We're constantly talking and asking all of us to reach across the aisle, to embrace one another amongst the races, and when we do so, when we collectively stand together, this is what we call one another,\" Normand said. \"Shame on you. It's completely and totally uncalled for.\" McKnight, who went to high school in Louisiana, headed west for college in 2006 and became a football star at the University of Southern California. After USC, McKnight played for the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs. Jack Dempsey/AP Photo New York Jets running back Joe McKnight (25) runs during an NFL football game against the Denver Broncos in Denver, Nov. 17, 2011. He played in the Canadian Football League this season, according to The Associated Press. A spokesman for the McKnight family said in a statement last week that \"the family is distressed, distraught.\" \"This tragedy is something that changes all of our lives so dramatically,\" the statement said. \"We are in the process of trying to deal with the grief and what we need to go through legally. We want to give Joe his just due.\" McKnight's death marks the second time an NFL player was shot and killed in a motorist incident in the New Orleans area this year. In April, former New Orleans Saints player Will Smith was fatally shot while driving in New Orleans's Lower Garden District. The trial for Smith's accused killer begins today.

Hundreds of East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights high school students walked out of class Nov. 14 to protest the election of Donald Trump as president. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Joy Resmovits The Los Angeles Unified School District has set up a hotline and opened \u201cextended support sites\u201d\u00a0to respond to a high level of student anxiety about the election of Donald Trump as president. Parents and teachers learned about the new resources in a recorded call Monday from district Supt. Michelle King. She said the aim was to answer students\u2019 questions and address their worries \u201cabout potential impact on them and their families\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cto provide you with emotional support, enrollment and attendance information and referrals to outside resources,\u201d according to a transcript of the call provided by the district. The message was distributed in English and Spanish. The\u00a0support centers are in local district offices and in the\u00a0Hollywood\u00a0field office of Board of Education President Steve Zimmer. They\u2019ll be staffed by district workers from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays without any additional hires, LAUSD spokeswoman Barbara Jones said. The\u00a0hotline,\u00a0which will be answered weekdays,\u00a0is (866) 742-2273. At 9th Street School, a downtown elementary school, interim Principal Antonio Camacho said he planned to discuss King\u2019s message with staff Tuesday afternoon. \u201cIf teachers have students who are concerned about their safety, I want to make sure they know where to refer them,\u201d Camacho\u00a0said.\u00a0 Jenny Jerome of Pacific Palisades has three children in three different L.A. Unified schools. She was taken aback by the call, which followed earlier outreach about increased school support.\u00a0\u201cNo other time in history have we had to have school counselors on duty more because of the person who is supposed to be president,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen kids acting really scared and crying.\u201d When she told her children about the call, her son\u00a0said  he already knew about it. The news had come over the public address system in his middle school. L.A. Unified officials took a stand right\u00a0after the election to say\u00a0they would protect students from deportation and hate incidents. The\u00a0week\u00a0after the election, the\u00a0school\u00a0board voted that the city\u2019s\u00a0public schools were\u00a0\u201csafe zones\u201d for students in the U.S.\u00a0illegally, affirming an earlier resolution that employees were\u00a0not to allow federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents onto campuses without district permission. Zimmer\u00a0said in\u00a0a statement the day after the election that\u00a0\u201cwith emotions running high, our schools will continue to be the anchors of our neighborhoods.\u201d State Supt. of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson said: \u201cI want to let all of California\u2019s 6.2 million public school students know that keeping them safe from discrimination and bullying \u2026\u00a0is a top priority.\u2026\u00a0California already has, and will always maintain, strong legal and state Constitutional protections against any and all kinds of discrimination.\u201d Trump campaigned on the\u00a0promise that he would build\u00a0a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico and deport\u00a0those who had come to\u00a0the U.S. illegally. Los Angeles Unified is 74%\u00a0Latino,\u00a0and the threats hit home for many students. Teachers districtwide spent class time reassuring young people \u00a0that they would be safe\u00a0at school. \u201cI\u2019m not here to deport anyone,\u201d history teacher Noemi Morales told\u00a0a class at Van Nuys Middle School. \u201cI\u2019m on your side. I\u2019m your advocate. I\u2019m fighting for you.\u201d This is the full transcript of King\u2019s message:\u00a0 Hello. This is Supt. Michelle King with an important message for the L.A. Unified family. Although it has been nearly a month since the presidential election, many of our students still have questions and concerns about potential impact on them and their families. As part of our commitment to providing a safe and positive learning environment, we are providing additional resources for our families.\u00a0 We have opened Extended Support Sites at each of our Local District offices, as well as at the field office of Board President Steve Zimmer. These sites are open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays, to provide you with emotional support, enrollment and attendance information and referrals to outside resources. We have also set up a hotline at (866) 742-2273, where you can call with questions and concerns. We invite you to visit lausd.net for details about these and other resources.\u00a0 Thank you.

But he now says the president-elect's postelection attacks on the First Amendment and the country's electoral process, as well as the billionaire businessman's continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas, changed his mind. Texas law doesn't mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state's presidential election , which Trump won by nine percentage points over Hillary Clinton . Suprun and the GOP's other electors signed pledges at the state Republican convention in Dallas this summer promising to vote for their party's nominee, but those aren't legally binding. \"I'm expecting backlash, but that has been par for the course this campaign. People are unhappy. They're angry. But I'm angry, too,\" said Suprun, who said that prior to changing his mind he had received hundreds of emails, letters and phone calls urging him not to support Trump. Suprun said the Electoral College system \"is fine as it currently exists.\" His problem is just with its winner. \"I was told if we elected Donald Trump he would transform his personality into being presidential. He isn't,\" Suprun said. \"I wanted him to be presidential, but since the election he hasn't grown into our institution, he's attacked them. I am here to elect a president, not a king.\" Another Texas Republican elector, Art Sisneros, resigned last week rather than vote for Trump. Electors will vote to replace Sisneros when they convene Dec. 19 in Austin and in state capitals across the country to vote for president. Suprun said he was not resigning but also won't be voting for Hillary Clinton. \"I am not sure of who I will vote for, but would have to strongly consider someone like (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together,\" he said. Suprun said he was waiting to see if other electors will revolt and rally behind a Trump alternative like Kasich. \"I'm looking for someone we can all unify behind,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Hagen is a high-ranking Klansman based in California. William Hagen, right, shown at a Ku Klux Klan rally in Anaheim, was arrested and charged with assault with intent to kill in North Carolina. Hagen is a high-ranking Klansman based in California. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) James Queally Contact Reporter The California Ku Klux Klan leader who led a \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d rally\u00a0that erupted in violence in Anaheim\u00a0this year\u00a0was arrested last week\u00a0in connection with a North Carolina stabbing hours before a\u00a0Klan\u00a0parade celebrating\u00a0 Donald Trump \u2019s election, authorities said Tuesday. William Hagen and a\u00a0second person were charged with assault after they stabbed another Klan member\u00a0shortly before the victory\u00a0parade about 20 miles away in Roxboro, N.C., according to Capt. Frank Rose, who oversees criminal investigations for the Caswell County Sheriff\u2019s Office in North Carolina. Hagen and Chris Barker, whom experts described as a national Klan leader, were involved in an argument with Richard Dillon at Barker\u2019s Yanceyville, N.C., home, Rose said. The clash turned violent, and Hagen and Barker are accused of stabbing Dillon several times, the captain\u00a0said.\u00a0Dillon was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and released from a local hospital a short time later, Rose said. Dillon reported the stabbing to sheriff\u2019s deputies about 3 a.m.\u00a0Saturday, Rose said. Barker was arrested at his home a short time later, and Hagen was arrested later the same day during a motor-vehicle stop, he said.\u00a0 William Hagen William Hagen William Hagen (Caswell County Sheriff's Office) Both men are charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflict serious injury, Rose said. They are both being held in the Caswell County detention center in lieu of bail.\u00a0 Attempts to contact attorneys for Hagen and Barker were unsuccessful. A spokeswoman for the Caswell County district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment, and calls to the county clerk\u2019s office attempting to obtain documents related to the charges\u00a0were not returned. Hagen is the \u201cGrand Dragon,\u201d or state leader, of the Loyal White Knights faction of the Klan in California, according to Carla Hill, an investigative researcher with the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, which tracks members of hate groups.\u00a0Barker is the \u201cImperial Wizard,\u201d or national leader, of the Loyal White Knights, a group\u00a0of between 150 and 200 white supremacists across the country, Hill said. Dillon, the person who was stabbed, is also a known Klan member from Indiana, she said. Hill said many Klan members had traveled to North Carolina to participate in the pro-Trump rally. Hagen, who also goes by the name William Quigg, often travels to attend Loyal White Knights rallies\u00a0and was spotted at a white supremacist gathering in Georgia this year, she said.\u00a0 Last weekend\u2019s parade in North Carolina, which gained widespread attention after a reported surge in hate crimes after Trump\u2019s victory, involved about 20 or 30 vehicles driving through Roxboro with people waving flags and praising the president-elect, Hill said. Brian Levin,\u00a0director of Cal State San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism,\u00a0said Hagen also traveled to South Carolina to join protests against\u00a0the removal of the Confederate flag from the statehouse in Columbia, after nine people were shot to death inside a Charleston church in 2015, allegedly by a white supremacist.\u00a0 Hagen, he said, has claimed in the past to have supported Hillary Clinton rather than Trump. But Levin\u00a0said Hagen has openly praised Trump on social media. Trump has received support from a number of white supremacists and ethno-nationalists over the course of his candidacy.\u00a0This year, a white nationalist from Los Angeles was mistakenly listed among Trump\u2019s California delegates. The president-elect has repeatedly denounced the adulation of such fringe groups, but critics contend he has not been forceful enough in distancing himself from their support. ",

And it's not because they didn't try,\" he said, pointing to the intelligence gathered at MacDill. The president used the speech to target President-elect Donald Trump 's experience and desire to use waterboarding as an interrogation technique. Obama said staying \"true to our laws\" strengthens America and prohibiting torture like waterboarding has not decreased intelligence gathering. \"We prohibited torture,\" he said. \"And at no time has anybody who has worked with me told me that doing so has cost us good intelligence.\" He took a veiled shot at Trump and his terrorism policies by hailing diplomatic solutions like the Iran nuclear accord as a strategy that has made America safer. Obama made a point of saying he is the first president to \"serve two full terms during a time of war\" while knocking Congress for pursuing terrorists in a way that he said could breed more terrorism. \"We have to fight terrorists in a way that doesn't create more terrorists,\" he said. \"If a threat is serious enough to require the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, then members of Congress should at least have the courage to make clear where they stand \u2014 not on the sidelines, not on cable TV shows but fulfilling their constitutional duty and authorizing the use of force.\" The president also criticized the notion of a religious test in America and labeling ISIS as representative of all Muslims, which Trump has done on the campaign trail and as president-elect. \"We are fighting terrorists who claim to be fighting on behalf of Islam \u2014 but they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world,\" Obama said. \"And they do not speak for American Muslims, including many who wear the uniform of the U.S. military.\" \"Let my final words to you as commander in chief remind you of what you are fighting for, what it is that we are fighting for,\" he continued. \"The United States of America doesn't impose religious tests as the price for freedom. We are a country that was founded so they could practice their faiths as they choose.\" \"We are a nation that believes freedom can never be taken for granted,\" he added. \"A society that is open and free that can criticize a president without retribution.\" 0 Shares ",

Schaben / Los Angeles Times A view of Martin's Beach, near Half Moon Bay. A view of Martin's Beach, near Half Moon Bay. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Dan Weikel The California State Lands Commission decided Tuesday to explore condemnation proceedings as a way to gain public access to Martin\u2019s Beach, where landowner\u00a0and Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla has\u00a0restricted entry. If the panel decides to proceed, it will be the first time in the commission\u2019s 78-year\u00a0history that it has used condemnation rules. The three-member\u00a0panel, which oversees the use of state tidelands and marine resources, directed its staff to study the use of eminent domain after two years of negotiations with Khosla to obtain an easement on his property collapsed last month. \u201cI hope Mr. Khosla hears that we are not backing off,\u201d said Commissioner\u00a0Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. \u201cThere is a sense this is a new day\u2026. We want to see this damn thing resolved within our lifetimes.\u201d Access to Martin\u2019s Beach near Half Moon Bay became controversial in 2010, when Khosla limited public entry to the scenic shoreline that adjoins\u00a0about 89\u00a0acres of coastal land he bought for $32 million two years earlier. His closure\u00a0of an access road has been viewed as a digression from the practice of the previous owners\u2014the Deeney family \u2014 who allowed the public to reach\u00a0the \u00a0beach, often for a small\u00a0fee, for almost 100 years. How much public access should be granted has been the focus of four lawsuits filed by Khosla, the Surfrider Foundation and Friends of Martin\u2019s Beach. All are pending except for one of Khosla\u2019s two cases, which was dismissed. The commission staff will now research how to exercise eminent domain, including the costs, the resources needed, the time it would\u00a0take and possible effects on the latest lawsuit\u00a0Khosla filed against the commission, individual commissioners and San Mateo County. This is going to be resolved in favor of the people of California. \u2014 Lands Commission chair Betty Yee \u201cThis is going to be resolved in favor of the people of California,\u201d said commission chair\u00a0Betty Yee, the state controller. \u201cI am confident of that.\u201d Both Newsom and Yee said the effort to explore condemnation proceedings does not\u00a0close the door to\u00a0further negotiations, and they urged Khosla to resume talks with the state. Discussions that had been authorized under legislation by state Sen. Jerry Hill , D-San Mateo,\u00a0broke off in November after Khosla demanded either $30 million for an easement\u00a0or an agreement to provide limited access based on a count of beach visitors provided in 2008 by\u00a0Kholsa\u2019s own employees or contractors.\u00a0 Commission negotiators questioned the accuracy of the figures, and Khosla disagreed with the state\u2019s estimated value of $360,000 for the 6.4 acres sought for an easement. Mark Massara, an attorney for the Surfrider Foundation, which has been trying to regain public access to Martin\u2019s Beach, said the commission should already be prepared to move on condemnation proceedings. \u201cThe time for action is now. Eminent domain should not be delayed any longer,\u201d Massara said. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that Vinod is acting in bad faith and will not collaborate. A three-foot wide access way to the beach represents only\u00a0a minimal impact on his 89 acre property.\u201d This controversy was manufactured by the media and became fodder for politicians. \u2014 Jeffrey Essner, attorney for Vinod Khosla During the public hearing, about 20 people, including former Congressman\u00a0Pete McCloskey and members of environmental groups,\u00a0spoke in favor of using eminent domain to gain public access to Martin\u2019s Beach. \u201cThe right of access is meaningless if the wealthy can buy coastal property and close it to the public,\u201d said Ron Romines, a former mayor of Woodside. \u201cThis threatens a precedent that goes well beyond Martin\u2019s Beach.\u201d Two speakers defended Khosla, including his attorney, Jeffrey Essner, who said his client does not want to surrender his property rights and that the public has\u00a0no constitutional right of access to Martin\u2019s Beach. \u201cThis controversy was manufactured by the media and became fodder for politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a false sense that there is a strong demand for Martin\u2019s Beach access.\u201d\u00a0 He added that the state could end up wasting tens of millions of dollars to obtain an easement.

The car was driving fast, but not so fast as to draw attention. That was essential. The lives of the two men in the front seat depended on their ability to keep a low profile and pass through undetected. In the passenger seat, Khaleel Al-Dhaki was focused on the secret mission he was leading to rescue a Yazidi woman and her child, both of whom were taken by ISIS and dragged into Mosul. \"This kind of operation can't be done during daytime,\" he later told NBC News. \"We are basically going in there to kidnap them back from ISIS.\" Khaleel AlDhaki filmed as he coordinated the secret rescue mission of Leila and her three-year-old son. Marc Smith / NBC News Al-Dhaki, a lawyer by training, runs a small team of activists who regularly make dangerous trips into ISIS territory to rescue Yazidi women, members of a non-Muslim minority that live mostly in northern Iraq. \"Saving a soul is the best thing a man can do,\" Al-Dhaki said. \"You get more motivated when you watch them meeting their families. I can't describe the moment of the reunion. We devote our whole lives to rescuing these women.\" Related: Yazidi Women Tell of Rape and Enslavement at Hands of ISIS Al-Dhaki estimates ISIS kidnapped around 7,000 Yazidis and that roughly 3,000 of them managed to escape on their own or were ransomed out of bondage. The fate of 1,000 Yazidi men remains unknown, he adds. That leaves, by his calculation, some 3,000 Yazidi women and children like Leila and Ahmed in ISIS' hands.

Yazidi women, sometimes with their children, were taken as sex slaves. In 2015, ISIS' propaganda magazine, Dabiq, boasted about reviving the ancient practice of slavery. But ISIS is now under intense pressure. Its last stronghold in Iraq, the city of Mosul, is surrounded by Iraqi and Kurdish forces who are elbowing their way in with close support and guidance from U.S. troops. Amid the offensive, Al-Dhaki was sneaking into Mosul to steal the hostages from ISIS. Related: ISIS Mines Pose 'Unprecedented' Threat to Families in Mosul He had arranged to pick up a 23-year-old woman and her 3-year-old son. Although he shared her real name with NBC News, al-Dhaki asked that she be called \"Leila\" \u2014 for her safety and the safety of other Yazidis held by ISIS. Leila had managed to leave her captor's home and go with her son to a safe house that al-Dhaki's team had secured for them. Leila spoke to NBC News of her \"marriage\" to an ISIS fighter, the rape and the abuse she went through while in ISIS captivity. Marc Smith / NBC News Now, outside that safe house, Leila and her son were climbing into the car. She was wearing a headscarf that left her face uncovered. She appeared terrified and sat silently as the car passed other vehicles along the road, each one potentially driven by an ISIS fighter. The boy, whom NBC News is calling \"Ahmed,\" slept in his mother's arms in the backseat. The extraction was a success. Relatives were waiting to receive Leila and Ahmed once they were safely out of ISIS territory. They cried, hugged and kissed one another before driving into Kurdish-held territory near the Turkish border, far away from ISIS. Leila and her son had been gone for two-and-a-half years. Silent and still terrorized by the horrors of ISIS, Leila is now back with her family in northern Iraq. Marc Smith / NBC News \"They took my husband away from me and gave me to an ISIS fighter. They married me to him,\" she told NBC News. Leila is now a refugee living with relatives in a tented camp. Her own village is still occupied by ISIS. Related: Amal Clooney Takes on ISIS for Persecuted Yazidis Leila spoke hesitantly, struggling to finish her sentences. She described how, after the trauma of being separated from her husband and being forced to marry another man, she was \"resold\" twice again to other ISIS radicals. ISIS fighters seemed to trade Yazidi women like baseball cards. Leila's last rapist was a squat, thickly-built Iraqi fighter with an unkempt beard that fell to his chest. His wife was also an ISIS fanatic. \"I hated her even more than him,\" Leila said. \"She would beat my son.\" Children 'Not the Same' As Leila spoke, Ahmed was crying and throwing whatever he picked up from the carpet covering the tent's floor. For most of his life, Ahmed had been surrounded by violent armed men. To prevent Leila from escaping, her ISIS captor would take Ahmed with him when he went to ISIS headquarters, where acts of savage brutality were carried out. Once the the Mosul offensive began, Leila said her captor and his wife wore explosive suicide vests in their home, ready to kill and die if U.S.-backed Iraqi troops came knocking. How had all of this shaped Ahmed during his formative years? Al-Dhaki said many of the Yazidi children he has rescued remain troubled. \"They need help. They are showing signs of violence. They are not the same as before,\" he said. Leila said that Ahmed had seen beheading videos and passed by the body of a crucified man on the street. She doesn't know what he saw during those long hours at ISIS headquarters. The night of her rescue from ISIS Leila reunited with some of her and her husband's relatives who had also been previously rescued from ISIS captivity. Marc Smith / NBC News As Leila spoke about the past from her new home, Ahmed walked back inside the tent after briefly going outside to play with other children. He came back carrying a pair of scissors. Leila went over and tried to pry the scissors from his hands. Ahmed screamed and cried. \"I'll slaughter you,\" he told his mother. Al-Dhaki said another Yadizi boy he'd rescued had tried to slit his sister's throat, apparently mimicking something he had seen ISIS fighters do. Richard Engel ",

(Photo: Adam Nadel, Associated Press) Rashaan Salaam, winner of the 1994 Heisman Trophy and a first-round NFL draft pick in 1995, was found dead shortly before 9 p.m. Monday night at a park in Boulder, Colo., a Boulder police spokeswoman said. His mother, Khalada, told USA TODAY Sports Tuesday that police said they suspect it\u2019s a suicide after finding a note. \u201cThey said they found a note and would share that with us when we get there,\u201d Salaam\u2019s mother said. The police spokeswoman said the cause of death is still under investigation. She said there is no indication of foul play and no threat to the community. A 911 call Monday night reported a body found in Eben G. Fine Park in Boulder, later identified as Salaam, 42, who starred at running back for the University of Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big trip. That\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Salaam\u2019s mother said. \u201cWe just found out this morning, and we\u2019re going to Colorado to take care of him.\u201d She said the family hopes to bury him in Boulder because \u201che liked it there and was successful there, and he liked the people there.\u201d Salaam, who is from San Diego, led Colorado to one of the most charmed football seasons in its history in 1994, when he rushed for 2,055\u00a0yards and helped the team finish No. 3 nationally with an 11-1 record. He was beloved by the CU community and was among many CU alumni who took special pride this year in the football program\u2019s revival as winners of the Pac-12 Conference South Division. \u201cCU starting winning this year, too,\u201d Salaam\u2019s mother said. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d The Chicago Bears selected Salaam in the first round of the NFL draft in 1995. \u00a0He rushed for 1,074\u00a0yards and 10 touchdowns during his rookie season, but he soon was slowed by injuries and his\u00a0production fell off after that. He\u00a0was out of the league a few years later. The last post on his Facebook page dated Nov. 27 includes a video of Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston and Dionne Warwick singing the song \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d In the post, Salaam noted he was \u201cfeeling joyful\u201d and told people to \u201ckeep smiling.\u201d Followers since have posted condolences underneath it. News of his death shook the CU community Tuesday as many remembered Salaam's slicing runs in 1994 on a team that might be one of the greatest not to win a national championship. It included standout quarterback Kordell Stewart and star receiver Michael Westbrook, who combined for a legendary Hail Mary pass that season to beat Michigan as time expired. It also featured a\u00a0stellar offensive line that Salaam often credited for his success. Salaam scored a school-record 24 touchdowns that season and rumbled off a string of nine straight 100-yard games. He rushed for 317 yards in a 34-31 win at Texas a week after the miracle win in Michigan. \"He had a happy heart,\" former Colorado coach Bill McCartney said in a statement on the CU athletics website. \"I loved being around him. He didn't take himself too seriously, and he always credited those around him, especially his offensive line. What I liked about him is that he had a sparkle in his eye. He was upbeat and positive.\" Salaam turned pro after that magic\u00a0'94 season, his junior year. He spent three seasons in Chicago, going a long way in a short time after leaving La Jolla Country Day School in San Diego, where he played eight-man football. After football, he eventually returned to Colorado, where he will always be revered as the great No. 19. \"This is a sad day for the entire university community as we mourn Rashaan's death,\" CU Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano said in a statement on the CU website. \"Rashaan will be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever wear a Buffs uniform, and his 1994 Heisman Trophy brought great prestige and honor to the university. We send our deepest condolences to his family and friends.\" Follow reporter Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer .

    "text": "Chicago removes remaining Donald Trump street signs Honorary Trump street signs taken down Michael Riopell, Chicago Tribune Privacy Policy After much fanfare from Chicago aldermen over the righteousness of tearing down President-elect Donald Trump 's honorary street signs, city workers quietly removed the placards over the weekend. A city sign shop crew pulled down the remaining two street signs on Wabash Avenue near Trump Tower at 8 a.m. Sunday, according to Chicago Department of Transportation spokesman Michael Claffey. A third Trump sign was stolen months ago. The City Council voted a week before the Nov. 8 presidential election to take down the signs, citing the \"caricature\" of Chicago that Trump presented during the campaign through his frequent mentions of the city as a place overrun with violent crime. Aldermen also knocked Trump's pledge to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally in voting to take away the street sign honor. Downtown Ald. Brendan Reilly , 42nd, who sponsored the plan to remove the signs, said city officials had not informed him they were going to take them down, as they had promised to do. Reilly floated the idea before the election of possibly melting down the Trump signs to refashion them into signs \"for somebody who deserves an honor.\" Since Trump won the election, some aldermen have wondered whether it would be smart to antagonize the president-elect by making a big deal out of ripping down the signs. Claffey said he was looking into what had become of the signs, which hung on light poles at Wabash and Hubbard Street and at Wabash and Illinois Street. Still up across the street at Wabash and Hubbard is an honorary street sign for Barbara T. Bowman, an early childhood education expert who is the mother of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.

By Ana Swanson December 6 at 3:32 PM Follow @anaswanson President-elect Donald Trump announced that a Japanese bank, Softbank, \"has agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States, and 50,000 jobs.\" Trump met with Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, at Trump Tower Tuesday. (Video: The Washington Post/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Japanese telecom and internet conglomerate SoftBank would\u00a0invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 new jobs, saying that the decision wouldn't have been made without Trump's election win. Trump appeared in the lobby of the Trump Tower on Tuesday with Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, to announce the news, and later on Twitter claimed credit. Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 It\u00a0was not immediately clear how much of the investment was new, or how much would come directly from SoftBank itself. Son told\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal in an interview that\u00a0the money would come from a $100 billion joint investment fund announced in October by SoftBank and the Saudi Arabian government\u00a0to invest in the global technology sector. SoftBank has said it would provide at least $25 billion for the fund\u00a0in the next five years, while Saudi Arabia's public investment fund pledged to invest up to $45 billion in the same time period. The additional $30 billion would come from outside investors. During a trip to India last week, Son said he was close to securing\u00a0the remaining funds. Although Trump claimed credit for the investment, Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, argued that much of the $50 billion may have already been destined for U.S. technology companies. \"I think it\u2019s making hay out of something that was there already,\" said Entner. \"In all likelihood, this comes out of the $100 billion fund. Considering the extremely large part that the U.S. has in the high-tech economy, [Son] would have probably invested something in the neighborhood anyway.\" Son told reporters at Trump Tower that the funds would be invested into American start-ups. As he spoke, Son brandished\u00a0a piece of paper with the same figures that Trump had announced. The paper appeared to specify that the investment would be made in the next four years. The paper also contained the logo of Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple\u2019s iPhones. It was not immediately clear what role Foxconn would play in the deal, but analysts speculated the company could be responsible for the additional $7 billion in investment and 50,000 new jobs listed on the paper.\u00a0Foxconn could not be reached for comment. \"Seven billion [U.S. dollars] could mean that they\u2019re going to build a factory or multiple factories in the U.S. to assemble phones. We don\u2019t know that, but that would be the speculation,\" says Entner. Son holds a paper with details of SoftBank's $50 billion investment, announced Tuesday, Dec. 6. The Washington Post Trump also tweeted the news Tuesday afternoon. Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. toward businesses and 50,000 new jobs.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Softbank owns roughly 80 percent of telecom company Sprint. Following the announcement, shares of Sprint Corp surged nearly 4 percent as of mid-afternoon. The announcement also raised\u00a0suppositions that Son might be seeking to curry favor for his U.S. business interests. Sprint and SoftBank abandoned an effort to purchase rival telecom carrier T-Mobile in 2014 after U.S. regulators signaled the deal might violate anti-trust laws. But in August, Bloomberg quoted people familiar with his thinking as saying that Son still held out hope for the merger. A Trump administration could consider a potential merger between Sprint and T-Mobile differently, analysts said. Speaking from the lobby of the Trump tower, Son said that he wanted to celebrate Trump\u2019s election \u201cbecause he would do a lot of deregulation.\u201d Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecom industry analyst, said Son could be courting Trump to improve the chances of the merger, but he also described Son as an ambitious entrepreneur who was likely looking for further opportunities. \"Maybe he sees there\u2019s a different possibility for a Sprint and T-Mobile partnership. But that\u2019s only one slice of the pie. I don\u2019t think Masayoshi Son is that small of a thinker,\" said Kagan. \"He sees opportunities, based on what we\u2019ve all seen happen in the last few weeks. And he wants to be a player.\" A self-made billionaire, Son has earned a reputation as somewhat of a maverick. Since founding SoftBank in 1981, he has built the company into a telecom, internet and financial leviathan with purchases including an early investment in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and the acquisition of the Japanese unit of British mobile phone company Vodafone. SoftBank also led a $1 billion investment round in online lender Social Finance Inc last year. In November, a meeting between Trump, his daughter Ivanka and the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe raised controversy over potential conflicts of interest between a Trump presidency and his businesses. Ivanka has been appointed to take charge of Trump\u2019s businesses during his time in office, which include a chain of international hotels. business ",

    "text": "Email Seven special-needs teenagers living near Houston were repeatedly locked away in a closet by their adoptive mother and restricted to a lone room strewn with human waste, state and county officials said Tuesday. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services also said that a 7-year-old boy died in the same home in January 2011. The agency declined to reveal the circumstances of the death. The revelations were part of a startling series of events southwest of Houston that Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls described as \"heart-breaking.\" \"I cannot think of a more deplorable situation than what we have learned in this case,\" he said in a statement. The 7-year-old also had special needs and Family and Protective Services spokeswoman Tiffani Butler said Tuesday that the other seven were not removed from the Richmond home when the child died but that they all lived there at the time. No charges were filed in the child's death. The teens, ages 13 to 16, were removed Nov. 23 but the Fort Bend County sheriff's office didn't publicize the case until Monday. Caitilin Espinosa, a sheriff's spokeswoman, said the investigation was delayed by confusing circumstances and also because the two people arrested in the matter have not cooperated with authorities. Paula Sinclair, 54, and Allen Richardson, 78, each are charged with injury to a child and aggravated kidnapping. They were being held Tuesday at the Fort Bend County jail. Sinclair, who has used aliases in the past, is the adoptive mother of the teens and also of the 7-year-old boy who died. Her husband lives elsewhere, Espinosa said, and it's not clear if Sinclair lived there or came by periodically. Sinclair's relationship to Richardson also isn't clear. The two were arrested Saturday and each is being held on a $100,000 bond. Online jail records did not indicate whether they have attorneys to speak on their behalf. State Child Protective Services was acting on a tip when a case worker went to the home Nov. 22, Butler said. The worker was alarmed enough to receive court approval to remove the teens the next day. Sinclair and Richardson bickered with authorities that they had done nothing wrong, Espinosa said, but detectives found the teens had been locked in a single room. When Sinclair was at the home and needed to leave, all seven children regularly were placed in a 5-by-8-foot closet. They were struck with a wooden paddle if they attempted to leave the closet or room. At times they were in the closet so long that they urinated on themselves. The room was fouled with human waste, with some deposited in bags scattered about. A teen with Down syndrome was found wearing a dirty diaper. It wasn't clear what disabilities the other children have. None attended school. They were taken to a hospital for treatment and remained there Tuesday. Once they're released they'll be in state custody. Sinclair and her husband first served as foster parents to the children and later adopted them, Espinosa said. They've been with the couple as foster children since they were babies and were adopted in 2003 and 2004. \"These people are taking advantage of a lousy situation at the expense of children who cannot fend for themselves,\" Nehls said. \"It is absolutely heart-breaking.\" Parents who adopt a special-needs child can receive up to $540 a month for each child, Butler said. Sinclair and Richardson were charged with kidnapping because the teens were locked in the room and \"kept against their will,\" Espinosa said. They were so isolated that three adults who lived in another part of the home were unaware they lived there, according to Espinosa. \"They really were hidden, even from people in the same home,\" she said. It wasn't clear why the three other adults were living in the home but Butler, the Family and Protective Services spokeswoman, said Texas Adult Protective Services had previously checked on the three and that the home may be licensed by the state. She also said the home was licensed by Family and Protective Services. 0 Shares ",

The suit against Personnel Staffing Group, known as MVP Staffing, accuses the agency and several clients of discrimination and seeks class-action status. Norman Green, a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a temporary staffing agency, is photographed Dec. 6, 2016, at his Chicago home. The suit against Personnel Staffing Group, known as MVP Staffing, accuses the agency and several clients of discrimination and seeks class-action status. (Kristen Norman / Chicago Tribune) Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A group of African-American men filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Chicago federal court alleging systematic discrimination by a temporary staffing agency and several of its clients they say passed over black applicants in favor of Hispanic workers. The lawsuit against Personnel Staffing Group, which does business as MVP Staffing, is seeking class-action status. The clients named as defendants are Blommer Chocolate Co., Segerdahl Graphics, Mercury Plastics, MPS Chicago (which does business as Jet Lithocolor), The Penray Cos., ARI Packaging and Lawrence Foods. The alleged discrimination took place at MVP Staffing's Cicero branch office, which the lawsuit claims was directed by clients not to send African-American workers to their companies for assignments. Those wishes allegedly were communicated using code words, according to testimony from former dispatchers and on-site representatives given in prior cases and attached to the filing as evidence. For example, according to the lawsuit, \"guapos,\" which translates to pretty boys, would be used to refer to African-Americans to suggest they don't want to do dirty work. The terms \"feos\" (translated to mean \"dirty ones\"),\" \"bilingues\" (bilinguals) and \"los que escuchan La Ley\" (referring to people who listen to Spanish-language radio station La Ley) were used to refer to Hispanic laborers, the lawsuit alleges. Christopher Williams of Workers' Law Office, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, said such a model is prevalent in the fast-growing temporary staffing industry, where competition between agencies puts pressure to keep wages low. An immigrant-dominated workforce, with language barriers and legal status concerns, is less likely to complain about failure to pay overtime, workplace injuries, wage theft or overwork, according to Williams. He described dozens of white vans that pick people up in the Little Village neighborhood, populated mostly by Mexican immigrants, and drive them to the suburbs for jobs, while black applicants will show up early at the agency office and wait all day before being told there's no work. \"They get up early, they make their way there, they get there on the promise that there might be work for them,\" Williams said. \"And they watch as it changes from a very mixed room in the morning to mostly African-Americans left in the afternoon.\" Williams, who has filed several federal discrimination lawsuits against individual companies before Tuesday's class action, said the complaints have spurred some staffing agencies to hire more African-Americans, but cultural issues inside the companies create a revolving door. Because of the emphasis on Hispanic recruiting, often the company plant managers and assembly line leaders are Hispanic as well, and \"they didn't want them there,\" Williams said. A person who answered the phone at MVP Staffing said no one was available to comment. None of the other companies named as defendants in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment. In Illinois, the unemployment rate among blacks, at about 14 percent, is nearly three times that of whites (5 percent) and nearly twice that of Hispanics (7.8 percent), according to a May report from the Economic Policy Institute, which at the time said Illinois had the highest black unemployment rate in the country. Williams, who has spent most of his career focused on immigrant workers' rights, said he sees the devastation of joblessness in black communities where there are already barriers to employment, such as criminal records, that leads to \"a level of desperation.\" \"These (temp) jobs are the entry level to the entry-level jobs,\" Williams said. \"They would be perfect for this class of people who make up the extremely large population (of people with criminal records) and they end up being denied these jobs.\" Norman Green, one of the five plaintiffs, said he has felt the discrimination at MVP and other staffing agencies in Chicago. He described arriving at the agency early, around 4 or 5 a.m., with his steel-toe boots on and ready to work, signing his name at the top of a check-in paper. He said he would sit for hours and wait while Hispanics would arrive and be sent out to work sites right away. But the agencies would tell him to come back, he said, so he would borrow from money from friends and family to make the trip and get there early only to sit and wait again. \"A lot of black people just sitting there mad that they can't work,\" said Green, 33, who lives in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. When he has gotten jobs he feels everyone is talking about him in Spanish, and \"it's just uncomfortable.\" Green said the pattern, based on the perception that blacks don't want to work, is \"clear-as-day racist\" and unfairly applied to him even though \"every time I walk into a temp agency I work my butt off.\" Green, who has eight kids, seven of whom live with him, said he lost faith in the temp industry and instead supports his family doing construction and other manual work for family members. In an exhibit attached to the lawsuit, former MVP dispatcher Rosa Ceja testified that she had been yelled at by representatives of client companies when she assigned African-American workers to jobs and was warned by MVP managers and owners not to send blacks because MVP could lose the account if they did. Another MVP employee, Pamela Sanchez, who worked as an on-site manager at a bakery named in a prior lawsuit, said in an exhibit that she was instructed directly by bakery employees not to send black workers and to \"DNR\" (Do Not Return) them on the rare occasions she did. She said she would review lists of laborers to be sent to a shift and if a name didn't sound Hispanic, she would cancel them, even once they had already been assigned, because she knew they would be rejected. She added that she was told to have black applicants complete criminal backgrounds disclosures but not Hispanics. Williams estimated there could be 8,000 to 10,000 potential class members for Tuesday's lawsuit. Andrew Wells, director of workforce development at the Chicago Urban League, said he believes hiring discrimination plays \"a fairly big role\" in persistently high black unemployment, which he links to high crime rates. \"You see so much chaos and violence in the community, that's because you're seeing so many people not working,\" said Wells, who is not connected to the complaint. Wells said spotlighting discriminatory patterns is one step toward starting conversations across sectors \u2014 government, nonprofit and private \u2014 about how to address the problem. His organization also helps people build workplace skills, buy homes, rebuild credit and start their own businesses that employ people from the community. \"People should be employed based on their ability to do the job, their talent,\" Wells said. The lawsuit comes during a heightened debate over immigrant labor as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office with promises of restoring American jobs. Williams said there are plenty of jobs for everyone as the temp industry continues to expand, but hiring needs to be fair and better reflect the population that is applying. Currently about 70 percent of the population around the Cicero office is Hispanic and 30 percent is African-American, but 98 percent of job placements go to Hispanics, he said. \"If we can shift the balance, our hope is that the jobs continue to be available to anyone in the community who wants to work,\" he said.

A federal judge said Tuesday that she would approve San Bernardino's bankruptcy plan, meaning that the city can begin the process of emerging from four years of bankruptcy. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Paloma Esquivel Contact Reporter After four long, painful years, San Bernardino will soon emerge from bankruptcy. A federal judge on Tuesday said she\u00a0 would approve the city\u2019s plan to exit bankruptcy, marking a major step toward the end of the process for San Bernardino. \u201cThis is a very important day for the city,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Jury said. \u201cThe city came in in financial chaos and it\u2019s leaving in a much better place.\u201d Approval of the city\u2019s plan to pay its creditors and restructure its finances was touted by officials as the start of a new era for the battered Inland Empire city, even as it faces a daunting list of challenges to truly right itself. \u201cWe want our residents to know, and we want people who would invest in the city ... to know we\u2019ve cleared this burden and we\u2019re ready to do business,\u201d City Manager Mark Scott said. The plan includes a list of agreements with employees, retirees, municipal bondholders and many others. The confirmation order is tentative until being made official, which Jury said would be done within 30 days. \u201cNobody is walking away from this proceeding without having taken some kind of hit,\u201d Jury said. The plan, the broad outlines of which have been known for some time, preserves pension benefits for employees and retirees, though employees will have to contribute more to their pension plans and benefits were modified for new employees. Retirees will lose some health benefits they were promised. Meanwhile, some bondholders and unsecured creditors will be paid only 1% of what they were owed. The vast majority of the city\u2019s creditors have agreed to the plan. But during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, a number of lawyers for clients with federal civil rights lawsuits against the city that allege police abuse argued forcefully against it. Those clients stand to get 1 cent on the dollar for the first $1 million in judgments if the city is found liable. Insurance would cover the remaining amount. City representatives have argued that any savings from their compromises with creditors would go to rebuilding the city\u2019s depleted infrastructure and improving municipal services. In issuing her ruling, Jury noted that the city must be able to offer adequate services \u2014 particularly those for public safety \u2014 if it is to improve. \u201cAnybody who lives in this area knows that the crime problem in San Bernardino is significant,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to be able to get safe in order for people to want to live there.\u201d City Atty. Gary Saenz said the city\u2019s creditors, employees and others made significant compromises for the plan to move forward. They \u201crealized that the city is in bankruptcy, has no money, and is in an extremely difficult situation,\u201d he said. And they \u201cgave up much to help the city get to a place where we could have a plan that would help the city survive.\u201d San Bernardino has been in bankruptcy since summer 2012. Over the last four years, other municipalities have entered and emerged. Stockton filed bankruptcy in 2012 and exited last year. Detroit filed in 2013 and exited the following year. Years of cuts to public services and struggles to raise revenue in the impoverished city have battered its infrastructure and taken a heavy toll on its ability to meet basic public needs and attract new economic opportunities. The bankruptcy process and cost-cutting efforts in years prior mean the city is now a very different place than it was just a few years ago. Its storied Fire Department has been outsourced to the county and trash collection, recycling and street sweeping services have been contracted out. City staff has been cut by hundreds, while street repair, libraries, parks, community centers and other services have been severely neglected. The Police Department\u2019s staffing has been cut 30%, hampering its ability to deal with a recent surge in homicides. \u201cThe public has had to put up with a lot,\u201d Scott said. \u201cNothing would make us happier than to get back to where we\u2019re serving them at a higher level.\u201d But in a city that is among the poorest in the nation, officials say raising revenue will continue to be a major challenge. The city declared bankruptcy having been devastated by the effects of the Great Recession and housing crisis, which left it grappling with huge unemployment rates, one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation and plummeting property and sales tax revenues. Those tax revenues have improved moderately in recent years but are unlikely to do so significantly in the near future, officials have said. Although city officials have explored raising various sales and other taxes to increase revenue, they concluded that the city\u2019s poor residents could be overly burdened by such increases and voters may not approve them. The city has taken steps to raise fees, which do not require voter approval. To boost the city\u2019s economic foundation, officials hope to attract new development. But challenges including the city\u2019s high violent crime rate, difficulty in providing needed services and the well-publicized bankruptcy itself have made that difficult. On Tuesday, officials expressed hope that the impending exit from bankruptcy would help it begin to address some of those issues. Voters also recently approved a new charter that restructured the city\u2019s complex governmental structure. In issuing her ruling, Jury sounded an optimistic note and congratulated the city\u2019s leadership. The city\u2019s top positions are now filled by different people from when the bankruptcy process started. Four years ago, she said, city officials appeared to be working at odds with each other. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in this community for 40 years,\u201d Jury told the packed room of attorneys and city officials who gathered for the momentous hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018that city needs help.\u2019 And it got it.\u201d ",
