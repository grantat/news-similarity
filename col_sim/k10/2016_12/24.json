    "text": "OPEN Graphic Mr. Putin said Russia was not seeking a new nuclear arms race with the United States that his country could ill afford, and he reacted dismissively to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post about strengthening and expanding the American arsenal, noting that it was similar to what the president-elect had promised on the campaign trail. \u201cSo there is nothing unusual here,\u201d Mr. Putin said. As far back as 1987, Mr. Trump talked about his desire to negotiate nuclear arms control agreements with a declining but aggressive Soviet Union. In recent weeks, he has met with some of the most savvy survivors of the Cold War \u2014 notably Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary \u2014 at a moment when American relations with Russia are clearly at a turning point. Republicans who have spoken to Mr. Trump say he seems to realize that his opening gestures to Moscow will be closely observed at home, in Europe and among other allies. Republicans have split with him on Russia\u2019s meddling in the American election, promising congressional inquiries after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a combination of hacking and information warfare techniques to help elect Mr. Trump as president. At the heart of the question about Mr. Trump\u2019s nuclear plans is what he meant by the phrase \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand America\u2019s nuclear capability.\u201d Had he used the word \u201cmodernize,\u201d he would have been echoing the phrase used by the Obama administration. But the idea, Mr. Obama has said, is to shrink the arsenal, not increase it. The modernization effort began in earnest after the passage of the New Start treaty in 2010, an arms control treaty that Mr. Obama pushed through with Dmitri A. Medvedev, then the Russian president. But in the name of improving safety and reliability, some experts \u2014 and prominent arms strategists \u2014 argued that Mr. Obama was setting the stage for a new president to expand the arsenal. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama acknowledged that danger in the spring, warning of the potential for \u201cramping up new and more deadly and more effective systems that end up leading to a whole new escalation of the arms race.\u201d It was a startling admission for a president who had come to office more than seven years earlier talking about eventually ridding the world of nuclear weapons. China, for its part, has been modernizing a fleet of several hundred nuclear missiles and embarked on an aggressive space-weapons program to blind United States satellites in a conflict. But Mr. Obama\u2019s Pentagon is also leaving a number of projects that Mr. Trump could embrace, including an ultra-high-speed warhead that can travel up to 17,000 miles per hour. The Chinese are working on a similar weapon that is designed to avoid American missile defenses, prompting a warning to a congressional commission last year that an arms race was in its opening moments, long before Mr. Trump was elected. Michael D. Shear reported from West Palm Beach, Fla., and David E. Sanger from Washington. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow.

    "text": "How the Pentagon Plans to Modernize the US Nuclear Arsenal By JUSTIN FISHEL Dec 23, 2016, 2:22 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Putin Responds to Trump's Nuclear Comments 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump's tweets this week about strengthening and expanding America's nuclear weapons capability are raising eyebrows, but they also highlight the Pentagon's existing programs to update and modernize its nuclear arsenal. The components of America's nuclear triad of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM's), strategic bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles are decades old. While the Pentagon has undergone a modernization process to keep these systems intact over that time, the Pentagon has plans to replace each leg of the triad in the coming decades. But the Pentagon's plans to update and modernize the nuclear triad will be a lengthy and costly enterprise. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Congress earlier this year that it will cost $350 billion to $450 billion to update and modernize beginning in 2021. But there are some estimates that a 30-year modernization program could cost as much as $1 trillion. And that process has gotten underway since the lifespan of the existing delivery systems ends in the next 15 to 20 years. Replacement systems are currently in the phase of research, development, testing and evaluation. The U.S. Air Force maintains a fleet of 450 Minuteman III ICBM missiles located in underground silos across the plains states, each carrying multiple nuclear warheads. A key leg of the nuclear triad, the Minuteman III missiles went into service in the 1970's and have been upgraded ever since to keep them mission ready. No new ICBM missiles have gone into service since the MX missile was deployed in the 1980's, but those missiles were retired a decade ago. Donald Trump: I've Asked Boeing to Price a Lockheed F-35 Competitor This summer, the Air Force began the process of soliciting designs for a new ICBM to replace the Minuteman III, with the first new missile scheduled to enter service by 2029. The Air Force has already begun the process of replacing the 76 B-52 strategic bombers that have been flying since the 1960's with the new B-21 \"Raider\" that will begin flying in 2025. Upgrades to the B-52, designed in the 1950's, have allowed the aircraft to continue serving as a nuclear-capable aircraft and also allowed it to conduct airstrikes against ISIS. Eric Draper/AP Photo Senior Airmen Mark Pacis, left, and Christopher Carver mount a refurbished nuclear warhead on to the top of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile inside an underground silo in Scottsbluff, Neb., April 15, 1997. The Navy has also begun the process to find a replacement for its 14 Ohio Class ballistic missile submarine fleet that first went into service in the 1980's. But the first Columbia Class submarine is not slated to enter service until 2031. But it is important to point out that a replacement of these systems, while incredibly expensive, does not equate to an overall growth of the nuclear arsenal. In other words, the U.S. is looking to become more efficient -- it\u2019s not looking for more nuclear weapons. As one defense official put it, with the cost of the new systems, the Pentagon is simply not able to do a one-to-one replacement. As of September 2015, the United States has a total of 4,571 warheads in its nuclear weapons stockpile, according to a State Department official. The United States has retired thousands of nuclear warheads that are removed from their delivery platform that are not included in this total, the official said, noting those warheads are not functional and are in a queue for dismantlement. The 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear weapons agreement limits to 1,550 the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed on ICBMs, submarines or heavy bombers by the U.S. and Russia. Both countries have until February 2018 to meet the New START\u2019s reduction target levels for deployed warheads. The United States currently has 1,361 deployed nuclear weapons while Russia has 1,796. The larger Russian number is seen as a temporary increase as Russia replaces older warheads with new ones. 0 Shares ",

Donald Trump shook up long-standing international security norms Friday by reportedly suggesting a renewed arms race, a day after he tweeted that the United States should \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand\u201d its nuclear weapons capability. Trump\u2019s meaning was sufficiently cryptic, perhaps deliberately... (Tracy Wilkinson and Ralph Vartabedian) The National Academy study, released in 2012, concluded that even a bare-bones space-based system would cost about $200 billion to put in place, and hundreds of billions to operate in subsequent years. Franks, asked whether the country could afford it, replied: \u201cWhat is national security worth? It\u2019s priceless.\u201d Philip E. Coyle III, a former assistant secretary of  Defense who headed the Pentagon office responsible for testing and evaluating weapon systems, described the idea of a space-based nuclear shield as \u201ca sham.\u201d \u201cTo do this would cost just gazillions and gazillions,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cThe technology isn\u2019t at hand \u2014 nor is the money. It\u2019s unfortunate from my point of view that the Congress doesn\u2019t see that.\u201d He added: \u201cBoth Russia and China will use it as an excuse to do something that they want to do.\u201d The word \u201climited\u201d has guided U.S. policy since the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. The qualifier reflects, in part, the reality that intercepting and destroying incoming warheads is supremely difficult, and that it would be impractical to field enough interceptors to counter a large-scale attack. The current homeland anti-missile system \u2014 the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD \u2014 relies on interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Ft. Greely, Alaska. In flight tests, the system, which has cost taxpayers more than $40 billion, has managed to destroy mock enemy warheads only about half the time . The first of Franks\u2019 amendments \u2014 to eliminate \u201climited\u201d\u00a0from U.S. policy \u2014 was approved in April by the House Armed Services Committee with no debate and without a recorded roll-call vote. At a committee hearing May 17, a senior Democrat on the panel, Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee, offered mild protest. \u201cI think it was a mistake to mandate a poorly thought out, unaffordable and unrealistic missile defense policy, including plans for a space-based missile deterrent,\u201d Cooper said. But neither Cooper nor any other House Democrat sought to overturn the provisions, \u00a0and he was among those who voted to pass the overall bill the next day. Franks\u2019 Republican partner on the legislation, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, enjoyed a similarly smooth path. Deliberations of the Senate Armed Services Committee were closed, forestalling public debate. The legislation was approved by a roll call vote of 16-10, with two Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Tim Kaine of Virginia, the party\u2019s eventual vice presidential nominee, joining the Republican majority. In June, Sen. Ed Markey \u00a0(D-Mass.)\u00a0sought to restore \u201climited,\u201d saying that the change in U.S. policy would create \u201cthe impetus for a new arms race\u201d with Russia and China. Markey offered an amendment on the Senate floor but could not muster enough support to bring it to vote. The policy changes were greeted with opposition from another quarter as well.\u00a0 At a congressional hearing in April, Franks pressed Vice Adm. James D. Syring, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, for his stance on expanding American capability into space. Syring replied: \u201cI have serious concerns about the technical feasibility of the interceptors in space, and I have serious concerns about the long-term affordability of a program like that.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption Mothers who lose a second child to violence \"You wash the pain.

Fisher, 60, world-famous for playing Princess Leia in the blockbuster franchise, was rushed to a local hospital after suffering full cardiac arrest on a flight from London to Los Angeles. She was in critical condition, sources told NBC News. Fisher's brother, Todd Fisher, told the Associated Press she was \"out of emergency\" and stabilized at a hospital, but did not give any other details.

HB2 and the Cost of Gerrymandering by Emma Margolin advertisement House Bill 2, North Carolina's controversial law best known for restricting bathroom access for transgender individuals, has cost the state millions of dollars , hundreds of jobs, numerous entertainment and sporting events and, arguably, one Republican governor . Yet, despite those costs \u2014 and the price of attracting national scorn \u2014 the GOP lawmakers who rammed HB2 into law last March can't seem to quit it. This week, a deal to reverse the measure in exchange for the repeal of a local nondiscrimination ordinance in Charlotte fell through , prompting widespread disappointment and outrage once again. Play NC State Rep on HB2 bill: 'The fight is definitely not ending' 3:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161224012017if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/839452227617\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> For months, HB2 backers have been saying that the only way to repeal the law would be to undo the Charlotte anti-discrimination ordinance that prompted its passage in the first place. So why \u2014 after the Charlotte city council held up its end of the bargain \u2014 would North Carolina's GOP-controlled legislature continue to ignore what is clearly in the best economic interests of the state? Simple, say several experts on Tar Heel politics: Because they can. \"Ninety percent of lawmakers who supported HB2 either ran uncontested this fall or won the last election by a comfortable double-digit margin,\" said Bob Phillips, executive director of the nonpartisan group Common Cause North Carolina. \"Essentially, they are unaccountable to the voters.\" Hunter Schafer, of Raleigh, holds a sign in favor of repealing North Carolina HB2 during a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly in Raleigh, N.C., Dec. 21. Ben McKeown / AP With its first GOP-controlled legislature in a century carefully installed back in 2010, North Carolina began its rapid transformation from a reliably moderate, pro-business southern state to a testing ground for far-right, social-conservative policies. Over their years in power, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina have cut education funding, restricted access to abortion, implemented strict barriers to voting, refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, ushered in fracking and, most recently, imposed anti-LGBT regulations on government building bathroom use. The rightward shift has angered many: Hundreds of people have been arrested in weekly \"Moral Monday\" protests at the State Legislative Building in Raleigh. Yet the electoral consequences have been limited. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory only narrowly lost his reelection bid to the state's Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper last month. And Republicans were able to maintain veto-proof super-majorities in both houses of the state legislature, which quickly moved to strip Cooper of some of the powers he would have had going into office.

They don't need to be moderate; they don't need to appeal to crossover voters or Independents,\" he added. \"The way districting works in North Carolina, which is emblematic of the country's worst problems, is that you're beholden to a very parochial conservative district for your reelection.\" Lawmakers confer during a negotiations on the floor of North Carolina's State Senate chamber as they meet to consider repealing the controversial HB 2 law, Dec. 21. JONATHAN DRAKE / Reuters North Carolina was rated one of the most gerrymandered states in a 2014 Washington Post analysis, and several of its districts have since been ruled unconstitutional in federal court. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a challenge to two of North Carolina's congressional districts, which plaintiffs argue are packed with black voters to diminish their strength in other districts. In a separate case, a federal court last month ordered North Carolina lawmakers to redraw 28 state House and Senate districts on the grounds that they were racially gerrymandered. The court also mandated that the state hold special primary and general elections in the fall of 2017. Assuming that that ruling is upheld on appeal, some Republican lawmakers could finally end up paying a political price for their unpopular behavior \u2014 including reneging on the deal to repeal HB2. Even so, the legislature's partisan dynamics likely won't change much. Best case scenario for Democrats, experts say, is that Republicans lose their veto-proof majorities \u2014 and even that's not a guarantee. Play ",

Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP hide caption toggle caption Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Carrie Fisher, seen here at the world premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, has reportedly had a heart attack. Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Updated 7:30 p.m. ET Stars Wars actress Carrie Fisher is reportedly in stable condition after going into cardiac arrest aboard a flight from London Friday. Quoting Fisher's brother Todd, The Associated Press reports the 60-year-old actress had been stabilized at a Los Angeles area hospital. Earlier in the day, The Los Angeles Times and TMZ both reported that Fisher was on a United Airlines flight and suffered the \"cardiac episode\" shortly before landing at Los Angeles International Airport. In a statement, United Airlines confirmed a female passenger was described by crew as \"unresponsive.\" The Los Angeles Fire Department says it transported a passenger from that flight for symptoms similar to those described by media reports. CPR was already being performed when the ambulance arrived, a spokesman for the fire department says. Though neither statement makes mention of Fisher, details of the episode line up with eyewitness accounts referred to by media organizations. The actress had been in London promoting her latest book, The Princess Diarist, a memoir depicting her time filming her iconic turn as Princess Leia in the Star Wars film series. Article continues after sponsorship Fisher had published several books before, the most famous, 1987's Postcards from the Edge, was a semi-autobiographical novel that was turned into a critically-acclaimed movie some three years later. Aside from her role in the Star Wars franchise, Fisher also had supporting roles in When Harry Met Sally... and The Blues Brothers. ",

The U.S. abstention was the stunning culmination of years of icy relations between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And it put Mr. Obama in open conflict with President-elect Trump on a key foreign policy matter at a time when they\u2019ve been promising a smooth transition.

One Italian police officer was wounded in the encounter, although his injuries were not life-threatening, officials said. A video surfaced of a man who appeared to be Amri pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ROME \u2014 The suspect in the Berlin truck rampage was killed in a early-hour shootout after a chance encounter with police on the outskirts of Milan, according to Italian officials. Italy's Interior Interior Minister Marco Minniti described how cops noticed a \"man who walked suspiciously\" at around 3 a.m. in Milan's Sesto San Giovanni neighborhood. \"When he was stopped, the man shot the policemen with a gun. The police shot back,\" Minniti told reporters at a press conference in Rome. One officer was wounded in the firefight. Anis Amri German police via AP The suspect, who police identified as Tunisian national Anis Amri, was \"killed on the spot,\" said Minniti. The man killed was \"without a shadow of doubt\" the Berlin Christmas market attacker, he added. German officials later confirmed that the man shot in Italy was Tunisian-born Amri. The 24-year-old had been at the center of an international manhunt after authorities found his personal documents inside the vehicle that plowed through the Christmas market on Monday. Twelve people were killed and almost 50 others injured in the attack that has since been claimed by ISIS. Minniti praised the young policeman who was wounded in the incident and whose injuries are not life threatening. The man killed in Milan was \"without a shadow of doubt\" the Berlin Christmas market attacker, Italian officials stated Friday. Daniele Bennati / AP \"I thanked him for his bravery and professionalism shown,\" he said. \"I thanked him on behalf of the head of police, of the Interior Ministry, and wished him a swift recovery.\" Minniti added: \"I told him that thanks to him, Italians will be able to have a happier holiday. All of Italy should be proud of him.\" Complicated picture On Friday, ISIS-affiliated news agency Amaq released a video of what it said was Amri's final will and a pledge of allegiance to the extremist group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the self-recorded video, he threatened attacks and called on Muslims to leave for jihad or strike at home. He did not reference Monday's attack in Berlin. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the massacre in Berlin, saying one of its soldiers carried it out as part of the terror group's call to target people internationally. A video has surfaced Friday of a man who appeared to be Anis Amri pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Amaq News Agency A complicated picture has emerged of Amri in the days since the attack. He is thought to have arrived in Europe aged 19 and was jailed in Italy between 2012 and 2015 after reportedly setting fire to a school. Italian prison officials told NBC News Friday that Amri had a \"violent and unruly attitude\" and was frequently moved between jails, but showed few signs of religious fundamentalism. Italian authorities reportedly tried to repatriate Amri shortly after he was released from prison but Tunisia resisted these attempts. He arrived in Germany in 2015, according to officials there, and was monitored as a potential risk by various authorities. Related: Truck Suspect Trod Familiar Path to Terror Yet surveillance by German officials produced \"no leads\" that suggested Amri was a threat to state security. The snooping operation against him was ended in September this year. Amri maintained contact with his family back in Tunisia throughout this time, even sending presents in the days before the Berlin attack. \"He was going to return back to [Tunisia's capital] Tunis in January of 2017,\" Amri's younger sister Hamida told NBC News Thursday. \"It is impossible that he killed those innocents. But if he was the one, he should be punished.\" Play ",

    "text": "What Russian President Vladimir Putin Said in His Marathon News Conference By PATRICK REEVELL Dec 23, 2016, 4:13 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Putin Responds to Trump's Nuclear Comments 0 Shares Email Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual end-of-year news conference -- the marathon event during which he fields questions from hundreds of journalists for hours on end -- to laugh off accusations from the U.S. government that Moscow had hacked America\u2019s presidential elections and to attack the outgoing Obama administration as \u201closing on all fronts.\" Putin was speaking at the event Friday in Moscow, where around 1,500 journalists gathered in an auditorium to try to pose a question to the often inaccessible Russian leader. The event usually lasts for hours, with Putin\u2019s record standing at 4 hours and 40 minutes, and touches on virtually all of the major topics on which Russia finds itself in the news. Close to the Russian New Year holidays, the event often has an oddly festive atmosphere, with giggling journalists holding huge -- often absurd -- placards meant to get Putin\u2019s attention. One placard today read: \u201cAre there dive bars around the Kremlin?\u201d Another showed Putin as Superman. With relatively few chances to put questions to Putin, those present will often ask for him to intervene in a local problem. Today, a journalist from an independent media outlet asked Putin to look into the case of one of their colleagues currently jailed and whose case Putin had promised last year to examine, the journalist said. Putin said he wasn\u2019t sure what had happened. \u201cI\u2019ll look again,\u201d he said. This year was a relatively long session for Putin, coming in at around 4 hours. It ended with the Russian leader saying he would enthusiastically accept an invitation from Donald Trump to visit the U.S. should the president-elect invite him. Below are some of the key points Putin covered: On Donald Trump At last year's press conference, Putin made his first comments on Donald Trump, telling an ABC News reporter then that Trump was \u201cvery colorful\u201d and the \u201cabsolute leader\u201d in the Republican primaries. Now, Trump is president-elect and Putin appeared very satisfied with the prospect of a Trump administration, making some of the most friendly comments he has made about an American president in years. He expressed confidence that Russia and the U.S. will see an improvement in relations under Trump. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Trump in the course of the election campaign spoke about how he considers it correct to normalize Russian-American connections, and said it definitely won\u2019t be worse, because it can\u2019t get any worse. I agree with him. And so, together we\u2019ll think how to make it so it\u2019s better,\u201d Putin said. Asked if he would accept an invitation to visit the U.S. if Trump were to invite him, Putin replied enthusiastically, \u201cIf he invites me, I will go.\u201d A Russian journalist asked if Putin about the idea that Ronald Reagan -- famous as a Cold War warrior -- would be \u201cspinning in his grave\u201d if he knew Trump had won. Putin said he didn\u2019t think Reagan would be upset, saying he would instead be pleased that a candidate who \u201cso finely felt the mood of the American people\u201d had won. \u201cNo one believed it,\u201d Putin said of Trump's election, then joked: \u201cExcept for me and you.\" On Nuclear Arms Race Putin responded calmly to Donald Trump\u2019s Tweet on Thursday that the U.S. needs to greatly strengthen its nuclear capabilities, calling it \u201cnothing unusual.\" However, the Russian leader acknowledged that Russia was strengthening its own nuclear arsenal in order to ensure that no country could pose a threat to it. Trump wrote his Tweet on Thursday seemingly in response to a comment by Putin to military officers that Russia had to modernize its nuclear weapons to \u201creliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems.\" Today, Putin said he wanted to emphasize that meant only to be able to defeat \u201can aggressor.\" Putin though blamed the U.S. for pushing Russia into developing the system by withdrawing from an arms control treaty in 2002 and developing a missile defense shield in eastern Europe. Both the U.S. and Russia are already engaged in the large-scale modernization of their nuclear arsenals and arms control experts have recently sounded the alarm that the world could see a new build-up of apocalyptic weapons as nuclear powers seek to modernize their aging arsenals. Those alarms are now likely to get louder. Even as Putin was speaking, Trump told MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" that he was ready for an arms race. \u201cLet it be an arms race,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll outmatch them at every turn and we\u2019ll outlast them all.\u201d Before Trump\u2019s comments, Putin said that Russia would keep modernizing its deterrent but argued Russia has no pretensions to challenging U.S. nuclear power. \u201cWe aren\u2019t arguing with that. We\u2019re just saying we are stronger than any aggressor. If someone wants to launch an arms race, it\u2019s not us,\u201d Putin told the audience, before heavily criticizing the U.S. arms policy. On Accusations Russia Hacked the US Elections Putin laughed off the accusations from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the U.S. elections by hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to have Donald Trump elected. \u201cThe losing side always tries to put the blame outside,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAnd they are losing on all fronts,\u201d he said referring to the Democratic Party and the Obama administration. \u201cIf we look, then the Democratic Party lost not just only the presidential elections, but it also lost in those for the Senate, in those for Congress -- what, is that also ours? Is that also my work?\u201d Putin said to laughter from the audience. Putin echoed Trump\u2019s denials of the claims of hacking, which have been made by the U.S. Intelligence Community and which the Obama administration says it has raised directly with Moscow. Trump has said he does not believe the allegations that the hackers were controlled by the Russian state. \"As the president-elect said perfectly correctly, who knows what was with the hackers?\u201d Putin said. \u201cMaybe they were based in a different country, and not in Russia. Maybe it was someone laying on a sofa, in bed, who did it.\u201d Putin said instead of accusing Russia, the Democrats should be concerned with what was in the documents released by the hacks, noting that Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had resigned after leaked emails showed DNC workers trying to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primaries. \u201cThat means the hackers showed the truth,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey needed to apologize\u201d to people, he said. \u201cInstead they started shouting about these hacker attacks.\u201d On Syria and Aleppo Putin hailed Russia\u2019s involvement in the retaking of the Syrian city of Aleppo, which fell last week to the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as U.N. officials and Western leaders condemned the appalling violence used to capture it from rebels fighters. Putin called the evacuation of civilians and rebel fighters from the devastated city \u201cthe greatest international humanitarian operation in modern history.\" Tens of thousands have fled Aleppo, which Russia helped put under siege by relentlessly bombing the city for months, indiscriminately targeting hospitals, according to international observers. Last week, rebels in the city finally surrendered and were bused out by Russian troops, leaving government troops to declare victory. \u201cThis may sound immodest, but this would have been impossible without Russia\u2019s participation,\u201d Putin said. Putin said the next steps for Syria was a \u201ccomplete ceasefire\u201d across the entire country, to be followed \u201cstraightaway\u201d by the start of negotiations to find a political solution to the war. Putin said the talks should be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. Russia and Turkey, which has been backing rebels, have proposed Astana as a new location for the discussions, removing them from Geneva, where they were previously held and thus potentially pushing the U.S. further from the table. Today, Putin said Assad had also already agreed to the move. It remained unclear if talks were possible -- previous efforts have repeatedly failed, with Assad showing little interest in negotiating and rebels demanding he step aside before any deal could be made. On Doping in Sports Despite the publication this month of another damning independent report providing yet more evidence that Russia had run a huge cover-up scheme that allowed its athletes to dope, Putin unequivocally denied the accusations. \u201cThis is just impossible, and we will make it so that this never will be, and there never has been any kind of state system,\u201d Putin said. As Putin spoke though, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced it was bringing disciplinary proceedings against 28 Russian athletes who had tested positive after their drugs tests from 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were re-analyzed. Russia\u2019s entire track and field team was barred from the summer Olympics in Rio over the doping scheme and the country has now been stripped of a number of international competitions. Officials from the World Anti-Doping Agency has suggested Russian athletes should potentially miss the 2018 Winter Olympics if Russia does not acknowledge the cover-up. However, Putin today again dismissed the findings against Russia, denigrating one of the whistle-blowers who provided key evidence that revealed the cover-up, Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia\u2019s anti-doping program. \u201cDo you know where he worked before that? In Canada,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAnd then what did he do? He came to Russia and ... kept bringing in all sorts of filth.\" 0 Shares ",

Ken Ham, the president of Answers in Genesis, wrote on the ministry's website that\u00a0Christians need to take the rainbow back. Ham said the rainbow should not symbolize \"freedom, love, pride or the LGBTQ movement,\" but rather God's covenant with Noah. \"Sadly, people ignore what God intended the rainbow to represent and proudly wave rainbow-colored flags in defiance of God's command and design for marriage,\"\u00a0 Ham wrote . The Ark Encounter biblical theme park in Williamstown, Kentucky opened in July.\u00a0The 500-foot-long ark cost $100 million and drew\u00a0 more than 400,000 visitors \u00a0in its first few months of operation. Ham, in his holiday missive, warned people of God's impending judgment, this time not with water, but with fire. He then closed by urging people to visit Ark Encounter and to take \"advantage of the special pricing this month\" after 5 p.m. Amid clouds and drizzle, thousands gather to board Noah's Ark LGBTQ organizations reacted with a mix of frustration and humor to the ark's holiday light display. Josh Wagoner, co-chairman of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network of Greater Cincinnati, said he rolls his eyes when he hears that type of message from evangelicals, but worried what impact Ham's message can have on younger people. He wants young people to realize that no matter their sexual orientations, there are people and communities for them. \"I think the rainbow is big enough for all of us,\" Wagoner said. The rainbow is a symbol of love, acceptance, unity and inclusion, said Chris Hartman, director of the Kentucky Fairness Campaign. \"None of which Mr. Ham or his operation embrace or embody,\" Hartman said. Hartman admired the look of the lights, though. \"It makes the ark look incredibly gay,\" Hartman said. ",

    "text": "US abstains in key Israel vote, clearing way for condemnation of settlements Published               December 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A \"shameful\" abstention by the U.S. in a United Nations vote Friday allowed passage of a resolution condemning Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. The UN Security Council resolution was put forward by four nations a day after Egypt withdrew it Thursday under pressure from Israel and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Failure by the U.S. to veto the measure was seen as a double-cross of America's key Middle Eastern ally, and attributed directly to outgoing President Barack Obama, who has had chilly relations with Israel throughout his eight-year tenure. Reaction from U.S. Republicans and Jewish leaders around the world was swift and sharp. \"It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,\" said Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon. \"I have no doubt that the new U.S. administration and the incoming UN Secretary General will usher in a new era in terms of the UN's relationship with Israel.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the Obama administration for undermining America's historic Middle East ally. \"This is absolutely shameful,\" Ryan said. \"Today's vote is a blow to peace that sets a dangerous precedent for further diplomatic efforts to isolate and demonize Israel.\" Minutes after the vote, Trump took to Twitter to express his opposition. As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" Trump tweeted. Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, said the contention that settlements, and not Palestinian terrorism, is the obstacle to peace is false. \"This UN resolution represents the Big Lie of modern anti-Semitism,\" Bayefsky said. \"Palestinians' backers on the Council, New Zealand and Malaysia, made today's slander clear, claiming Jews living peaceful, productive lives on Arab-claimed land was the 'single biggest threat to peace\" and \"primary threat to a two-state solution.' \"Seven decades of violent Palestinian rejection of a Jewish state prove otherwise,\" she added. The measure was adopted with 14 votes in favor, to a round of applause, after U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power abstained. It is the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years. THE WEEK IN PICTURES \"The resolution is too narrowly focused on settlements when we all know, or all should know\" there are other factors that contribute to the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, Power said in an explanation for why the U.S. chose to sit on the fence, which ensured passage of the resolution. The Obama White House, under heavy pressure from the Israeli government and its supporters to veto the resolution, kept everyone guessing until the vote whether it would stop shielding Israel from council resolutions and permit it to pass by abstaining. After the vote, White House officials acknowledged on a conference that Obama made the decision himself after several rounds of discussions with top administration officials. As for Trump, deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes pointedly said there\u2019s only one president at a time \u2013 and that the Obama administration was concerned the Israelis\u2019 pace of settlement activity could put the viability of a two-state solution at risk. Israel believes it has the right to expand settlements in the disputed territories as populations within them expand. Palestinians do not believe the settlements should exist at all, and world condemnation of expansion is seen as a possible first in that direction. \u00a0 The resolution, warning that Israeli settlement expansion is \u201csteadily eroding the two-state solution and entrenching a one-state reality,\u201d calls on Israel to \u201cimmediately and completely cease all settlement activity in occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.\u201d It repeated the longstanding UN position that all settlements on land Israel conquered in 1967 are illegal under international law. A senior Israeli official accused the U.S. of a \"shameful move\" after learning that it did not intend to veto the text, the BBC reported. The U.S., which has veto power as one the council five permanent members of the council, has traditionally sheltered Israel from condemnatory resolutions. But the Obama administration has long made clear its opposition to Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory and there had been speculation that in its final month it might allow a resolution against settlements to pass at the U.N. A senior Israeli official told The Associated Press: \"President Obama and Secretary [of State John] Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the U.N. \"The U.S. administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel's back which would be a tail-wind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall [the Jewish holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem] occupied Palestinian territory.\u201d Most of those critical of the move by the U.S. painted it as a stab in Israel's back delivered by Obama. \u201cThis last minute political maneuvering is shameful,\" said Ric Grenell, former spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the UN and a Fox News contributor. \"It is inconsistent with the long standing U.S. policy that no country or organization should be dictating solutions on the two parties. \"Today\u2019s abstention by the Obama Administration will make it harder to find a peaceful solution because it imposes outside positions on Israel without letting them negotiate directly,\u201d he added. Wael Abu Youssef, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Reuters that Netanyahu's government \"must not be rewarded\" by the initial withdrawal of the draft resolution. The resolution, although it reiterates long-held U.N. policy, could be more than symbolic. While it does not call for imposing sanctions on Israel, its language could hinder Israel's negotiating position in future peace talks. Given the widespread international opposition to the settlements, it would\u00a0 be nearly impossible for the Trump administration to reverse it.

    "text": "By christina capatides CBS News December 23, 2016, 4:07 PM Have you been traumatized by 2016? You're not alone Email If you\u2019re feeling a bit down as 2016 draws to a close, you\u2019re not alone and, as it turns out, there\u2019s a reason for that. It\u2019s called \u201ccultural trauma,\u201d and according to Jeffrey Alexander, a sociology professor at Yale University, it occurs \u201cwhen a collectivity experiences an injury to its idealization of who it is.\u201d Basically, every year has a narrative. Some years simply have more memorable and, shall we say, darker narratives than others. So, when 2016 kicked off in January with the death of David Bowie \u2014 a music icon countless fans viewed as untouchable \u2014 a narrative about unthinkable and unpredictable tragic events occurring was set into motion. The death of David Bowie may have set 2016\u2019s cultural narrative in motion. Ralph Gatti/AFP/Getty Images \u201cWith Prince and David Bowie, I think the real surprise was that they weren\u2019t immortal,\u201d dramaturg Anika Chapin tells CBS News. \u201cThere was something about them that was so special and so odd and unusual, that it was like, the fact that they were even capable of dying like human beings was in itself disappointing.\u201d When Bowie\u2019s passing was followed in close succession by more terrible news \u2014 the terrorist attack in Brussels, the spread of the Zika virus, the water crisis that turned Flint, Michigan into a disaster area \u2014 2016 evolved into a year many people wished they could simply rewind. From the presidential election to the death of Harambe and the Ryan Lochte robbery scandal, 2016 has been a roller coaster of a year... one a lot... \u201cThere were a lot of bad things that happened over the course of this year,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cEvents like Zika, the Flint water crisis, terrorist incidents, continuous police-on-African-American violence and then, beginning to be the reverse. So, there\u2019s been a series of frightening events, but it\u2019s kind of the way these events are strung together. The narrative that encompasses them kind of determines how these things are experienced.\u201d\u00a0 The fact that 2016\u2019s story line was already in place by the time Prince died in April magnified the impact of his passing, according to Alexander. Unlike past years, when their larger narratives were developed and applied in reflection after the fact, people began experiencing the tragic narrative of 2016 in real time. Now Alan Thicke... Can we get a do-over on 2016? Too many good people lost and way too many bad people getting lucky... RIP Dr. Seaver \uf64f\uf3fe \u2014 Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) December 14, 2016 maybe if we put 2016 in rice? \u2014 JamieDMJ (@JamieDMJ) November 9, 2016 \u201cOnce you have a broader narrative of tragedy \u2014 that this is a year of unusual fear and disappointment that we feel could be a fulcrum of history, which is pushing us and the values we have off to the side \u2014 then everything becomes much more significant. So, Prince\u2019s death, for example, was I thought given a lot more affect than maybe it might have in another year. There\u2019s a sense of precariousness now, like our sense of order is more fragile than it once was,\u201d Alexander explained. ",

    "text": "Putin reaches out to Trump, while thumping Dems Published               December 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin followed up a warm letter to Donald Trump with a more terse message for U.S. Democrats Friday: Don't blame me for your November drubbing. President-elect Trump on Friday released the Dec. 15 note from Putin, who Democrats blame for tilting the election Trump won against Hillary Clinton, and called it a \"very nice letter.\" In it, Putin wished Trump \"warmest Christmas\" greetings and expressed hope that Trump would \"bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level.\" In addition to praising the tone of the letter from Putin, Trump said, \"His thoughts are so correct. I hope both sides are able\u00a0to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path.\" But Putin, in a year-ending address from Moscow Friday, had a different message for Democrats as he offered his analysis of the American political scene. \u201cDemocrats are losing on every front and looking for people to blame everywhere,\" he said. \"They need to learn to lose with dignity. \u201cThe Democratic Party lost not only the presidential elections, but elections in the Senate and Congress. .\u2026Is that also my work?\u201d he said. He went on to ridicule Democrats for never-say-die efforts to overturn the Nov. 8 presidential election, first by calling for recounts, then trying to get electors to flip. \"The fact that the current ruling party called Democratic has blatantly forgotten the original definition of its name is evident if one takes into consideration unscrupulous use of administrative resource and appeals to electors not to concede to voters\u2019 choice,\" Putin said, according to the Russian news agency Tass. THE WEEK IN PICTURES The former KGB officer even invoked President Ronald Reagan, the staunch anti-communist who worked with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to end the Cold War in the 1980s. \"I think Reagan would have been glad to see representatives of his party winning everywhere,\" the president said. \"And he would have been happy for the newly elected president [Donald Trump], who was sensitive enough to feel the moods of the society and worked exactly within that paradigm, going to the end, though nobody but you and I believed that he would win.\" \"Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. [Franklin D.] Roosevelt certainly would be.\" Supporters of defeated Democratic standard-bearer Hillary Clinton have cited alleged Russian \u201chacking\u201d of the election for her surprising loss on Nov. 8. Putin moved back his news conference a day to attend the funeral of his ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, who was assassinated at an Ankara art gallery in a brazen public shooting by a Turkish policeman shouting slogans about the war in Syria.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who had scrambled in recent days to stop the measure from coming to a vote, issued a blistering denunciation afterward. \u201cIsrael rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. and will not abide by its terms,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cAt a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall \u2018occupied territory.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Netanyahu immediately retaliated against two of the countries that sponsored the resolution. He ordered Israel\u2019s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal to return home for consultations, canceled a planned visit to Israel next month by Senegal\u2019s foreign minister and cut off all aid programs to Senegal. The vote came a day after Mr. Trump personally intervened to keep the measure, which had been originally proposed by Egypt, from coming up for a vote on Thursday, as scheduled. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said he had spoken to Mr. Netanyahu. Both men also spoke to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Egypt postponed the vote under what that country\u2019s United Nations ambassador called intense pressure. But in a show of mounting exasperation, four other countries on the Security Council \u2014 Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela \u2014 all of them relatively powerless temporary members with rotating two-year seats, snatched the resolution away from Egypt and put it up for a vote Friday. Document: U.N. Security Council Draft Resolution on the Middle East Peace Process The Obama administration has been highly critical of Israel\u2019s settlement building, describing it as an impediment to a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has long been the official United States position, regardless of the party in power. Mr. Trump, who had urged the administration to veto the resolution, has made clear that he will take a far more sympathetic approach to Israel when his administration assumes office on Jan. 20. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the resolution amounted to his most direct intervention on United States foreign policy during his transition to power. Minutes after the Security Council vote was announced, Mr. Trump made his anger known in a Twitter posting , saying: \u201cAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\u201d As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 23, 2016 A range of senators and congressmen from both parties also denounced the resolution, a reflection of the deep loyalty to Israel shared by Democrats and Republicans.

Credit Tomas Munita for The New York Times Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who oversees a subcommittee that oversees United Nations funding by the United States, threatened to take steps that could \u201csuspend or significantly reduce\u201d that financing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Reaction to the resolution also illustrated fissures among American Jews regarding Israeli policy. Some, like the World Jewish Congress and American Jewish Committee , called the resolution a one-sided measure that would not help the peace process. Ronald S. Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement : \u201cIt is also disconcerting and unfortunate that the United States, Israel\u2019s greatest ally, chose to abstain rather than veto this counterproductive text.\u201d Other groups that have grown increasingly critical of the Israeli government\u2019s approach to the peace process applauded the resolution and the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to block it. J Street, a Washington-based organization that advocates a two-state solution, said the resolution \u201cconveys the overwhelming support of the international community, including Israel\u2019s closest friends and allies, for the two-state solution, and their deep concern over the deteriorating status quo between Israelis and Palestinians and the lack of meaningful progress toward peace.\u201d Ms. Power, the United States ambassador, portrayed the abstention as consistent with the American disapproval of settlement-building, but she also criticized countries at the United Nations for treating Israel unfairly. She said the United States remained committed to its \u201csteadfast support\u201d for Israel and reminded the council that Israel received an enormous amount of American military aid. Ms. Power said the United States chose not to veto the resolution, as it had done to a similar measure under Mr. Obama in 2011 , because settlement building had accelerated so much that it had put the two-state solution in jeopardy, and because the peace process had gone nowhere. \u201cToday the Security Council reaffirmed its established consensus that settlements have no legal validity,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States has been sending a message that settlements must stop privately and publicly for nearly five decades.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story She also rebuked Palestinian leaders for \u201ctoo often\u201d failing to condemn violence against Israeli civilians. But she directed a portion of her remarks to Mr. Netanyahu, whose relations with the Obama administration have never been warm. \u201cOne cannot simultaneously champion expanding Israeli settlements and champion a viable two-state solution that would end the conflict,\u201d she said, arguing that the settlements have undermined Israel\u2019s security. Israel\u2019s ambassador, Mr. Danon, who had exhorted the American delegation to block the measure, expressed his anger in a statement that looked forward to a change in policy under Mr. Trump. \u201cIt was to be expected that Israel\u2019s greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,\u201d he said. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, welcomed the resolution\u2019s adoption but tempered his approval with a warning. \u201cIn reality, today\u2019s action may be too little too late,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter years of allowing the law to be trampled and the situation to spiral downward, today\u2019s resolution may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the two-state solution and revive the path for peace.\u201d The resolution condemned Israeli housing construction in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank as a \u201cflagrant violation under international law\u201d that was \u201cdangerously imperiling the viability\u201d of a future peace settlement establishing a Palestinian state. The resolution also included a nod to Israel and its backers by condemning \u201call acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction.\u201d That language is diplomatic scolding aimed at Palestinian leaders, whom Israel accuses of encouraging attacks on Israeli civilians. Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip and is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, expressed appreciation to the Security Council. \u201cWe praise the countries that voted for the resolution,\u201d said Hazem Kassem, a spokesman for the group. \u201cWe emphasize the need to turn such a resolution into action, not only to halt settlements but to eradicate Israel\u2019s occupation in all its forms.\u201d Peter Baker contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Mark Landler from Washington.

By Ruth Eglash December 23 at 5:47 PM Follow @reglash JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out forcefully against a U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday that condemns Israeli settlements, calling it \u201cshameful\u201d and saying that Israel would not abide by its terms. The resolution criticizes Israel\u2019s settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that the Palestinians hope will be a future state, and says the settlements \u201caltered the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\u201d The resolution passed with 14 votes to 0. The United States, in a break with tradition, decided to abstain from the vote. \u201cThe Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the U.N., it colluded with it behind the scenes,\u201d Netanyahu wrote in a strongly worded statement, which was unusually released on the Jewish Sabbath eve. Netanyahu and President Obama have had a strained relationship, especially over the issue of Israeli settlements. Hours before the U.N. Security Council met to discuss the resolution, Israeli media reported that an anonymous Israeli official had accused Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry of scheming behind Israel\u2019s back to push the resolution through. (Reuters) The resolution, initially brought by the Egyptians, had been scheduled for a vote Thursday. Israeli pressure and a push from President-elect Donald Trump caused the Egyptians to table it. It was revived Friday by other members of the Security Council. [ Israel rejects latest U.S. criticism of settlement policy ] Immediately after the vote, Netanyahu ordered a series of diplomatic steps against countries that co-sponsored the resolution and with whom Israel has diplomatic relations. He instructed Israel\u2019s ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal to return to Israel immediately and canceled the Senegalese foreign minister\u2019s planned visit to Israel. He also canceled Israeli aid programs in Senegal. In his statement, Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Trump. Since the election, Netanyahu and his ministers have refrained from making public statements about Trump, but subtle words and gestures have suggested that the Israeli leadership is buoyed by the new administration. So far, Trump has indicated he might approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a different manner than Obama. Last week, he nominated his close adviser, New York lawyer David Friedman, an outspoken supporter of Israel\u2019s settlements, as the ambassador to Israel. (Reuters) [ Israel says there\u2019s never been a more right-wing U.S. ambassador than Trump\u2019s pick ] About 400,000 Jewish settlers live on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. At the same time, right-wing voices in Netanyahu\u2019s government are pushing for legislation that would legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Israeli TV that the resolution was not only anti-settlements but also against Israel and Jews in general. \u201cThe heart aches after eight years of friendship and cooperation with Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.N. Security Council can\u2019t make a decision on Syria, but on this issue, the U.S., Obama and John Kerry allow it to pass.\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, expressed disappointment that the United States had not used its veto power in the Security Council to stop the resolution. \u201cIt was to be expected that Israel\u2019s greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no doubt that the new U.S. administration and the incoming U.N. secretary general will usher in a new era in terms of the U.N.\u2019s relationship with Israel.\u201d The Palestinians called the U.N. approval of the resolution \u201ca victory.\u201d Saeb Erekat, a former peace negotiator and the No. 2 in the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the vote was a \u201cclear and unanimous message\u201d to Netanyahu that \u201cyour policies will not achieve peace and security for Israel or the region.\u201d \u201cThe only way to peace is through the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and this is what the international community agreed upon today at the Security Council,\u201d he said.

Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon (Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports) NORMAN, Okla, (AP) \u2014 Joe Mixon made a tearful public apology in a news conference Friday in Norman, Okla., taking full responsibility for punching a woman in the face nearly 2\u00bd years ago. As Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops looked on, Mixon spoke at a news conference Friday afternoon, more than two years after he assaulted Amelia Molitor and broke her jaw and cheekbone. Mixon said he wanted to address the issue earlier, but his legal team advised him not to. \u201cI\u2019m here to apologize to Miss Molitor,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize to Coach Stoops, I apologize to President (David) Boren, the AD (athletic director Joe Castiglione), my teammates. And most of all, my family. I let a lot of people down.\u201d Mixon was suspended for a year after the incident. Though Molitor shoved and slapped him first, Mixon said hitting a woman is unacceptable, even if provoked. \u201cHonestly, it really don\u2019t matter what she did,\u201d he said during the 26-minute session. \u201cIt\u2019s all on me the reason why we\u2019re in this position right now. I take full responsibility of what happened that night. It\u2019s never OK to hit a woman. Never. I will preach to anybody. It\u2019s never OK. Hopefully to people around the world will learn from my mistake. I\u2019m willing to teach.\u201d The All-Big 12 performer said if it happened now, he would respond differently. Mixon: \"If I could go back, I would do whatever I could to change the outcome of that situation. Definitely would have walked or ran away.\" \u2014 Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) December 23, 2016 \u201cIf I could go back, I would do whatever I could to change the outcome of that situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely would have walked or ran away and went about the situation differently. I wouldn\u2019t have been in that situation.\u201d Mixon said he was disappointed he let down his team, the university and his family. He struggled to speak when he began talking about the impact on his mother, a single parent who watched the video with him along with Norman Police a few days after the incident. \u201cMy mother, she worked hard, and I disappointed her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my queen, and I apologize to you, mom.\u201d Mixon\u2019s legal advisers released video of the punch last week, and Mixon said he wishes it had come out sooner. Since the video came out, there has been a backlash against Mixon, Stoops and the university. Mixon said he hasn\u2019t paid attention to his fellow students much on campus, but his teammates have been supportive. \u201cI can\u2019t do nothing but thank my teammates for lifting up my spirits,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wanting me to come out and go hard for them every day, and I feel like honestly that\u2019s how I give back to them. I can only lead by example on and off the field by words, by my actions. Honestly, I\u2019m willing to do anything for my teammates.\u201d Mixon said he has matured and learned since July 2014. \u201cWell, at the time, as you guys know, I was 17, 18 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI was young. Right now I\u2019m 20 years old. I\u2019ve grown up a lot over the 2 1/2-3 years I\u2019ve been at OU. Like I said, I can\u2019t do nothing but thank coach Stoops for giving me a second chance and having me prove to everyone that I deserve it.\u201d Mixon said he\u2019s willing to speak against violence against women so others can learn from his mistake. \u201cI think when I have the opportunity to do that I\u2019ll seize the moment and do whatever I can to be the person \u2014 the bigger person \u2014 and the man I should be,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be that influence for young kids that are lost out there or in certain situations I was in. Hopefully, I can teach them for the next time and how to react a certain way.\u201d Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Speaking at the defense ministry\u2019s headquarters in Moscow, Putin said Russia should be swift in \u201cadjusting plans to neutralize potential threats to our country.\u201d Putin spoke after Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu presented an annual report that lauded Russian military achievements in Syria and ongoing efforts to modernize the army. Shoigu said Russia has fully covered the Russian border with early warning anti-missile systems for the first time. He complained about increased NATO drone flights in border areas and announced plans to send more troops to Russia\u2019s west, southwest and the Arctic. Analysts say Russia\u2019s military forces remain materially weaker than NATO armies but are gaining technological ground, aided by Putin\u2019s aggressive command. Igor Sutyagin, a senior research fellow at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, said the Russian military was not the world\u2019s strongest. But he said Russian military performance was improving in part because Putin wields more control over his military compared to NATO nations. \u201cThe lack of restrictions makes them better equipped for combat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are stronger because if Putin wants to use them, he doesn\u2019t ask advice. He doesn\u2019t come to Parliament or to Capitol Hill.\u201d In its annual report on the global military balance, Britain\u2019s International Institute for Strategic Studies noted that Russia\u2019s use of new cruise missile designs in Syria and other recent military displays showed that it was catching up with the West on advanced weapons systems. \u201cThe efficiency and high quality of Russian weapons have been clearly shown in Syria,\u201d Putin said earlier this year. Putin thanked the defense ministry for its work but cautioned that \u201cthe situation might change very quickly (if) ... we let ourselves relax even for a moment.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "advertisement New uniforms issued by American Airlines have thousands of flight attendants itching to get the old ones back, according to a grievance filed with the carrier. The uniforms, introduced in September, are causing a variety of issues, including \"eye swelling, rashes, skin blistering,\" plus wheezing, headaches, and vertigo, claims a letter from the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, a union that represents more than 25,000 flight attendants at American. \"Personal health is so integral and critical to our Flight Attendant workforce, who must be able to work in a healthy manner and environment. To do so, our members need proper and safe uniforms,\" wrote the union's president, Bob Ross, in a letter on Wednesday to American's general counsel. Nearly 2,200 flight attendants have reported reactions to the uniforms, Ross said. His letter called on American to stop issuing the uniforms; honor flight attendants' request for sick leave and reimburse them for medical expenses; and establish a $2 million fund to nail down what the issue is with the new outfits. It also claimed the airline wasn't taking \"necessary steps\" to address the problem swiftly. American Airlines aircraft sit on the tarmac at LaGuardia airport in New York. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri The uniforms were rolled out to 70,000 employees, American Airlines told NBC News. The blazers and pants are a blend of wool, polyester, and spandex, while the shirts are 100 percent cotton, American said, adding that a cotton version of the uniform pieces is offered to those who are sensitive to wool. American added that it has done three rounds of testing on the old uniforms, the new ones, and the packaging they came in. They have also opened a call center for flight attendants to report problems and are working with the flight attendant union to do a fourth round of testing. Related: Next Year is Shaping up to Be Another Good One for Airlines \u2014 and Travelers \"Our primary objective throughout the whole process has been to ensure that the uniform is safe for our team,\" Ron Defeo, a spokesman for the company, told NBC News. \"We are confident our uniforms are safe, and we continue to encourage any of our team members who suspect a reaction to the uniform to contact their manager.\" The uniforms are made by Twin Hill, a subsidiary of Tailored Brands, Inc., a retailer that includes brands such as Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank. In announcing the new apparel in September, Tailored Brands said in a press release, \"Elegant and modern yet reminiscent of a bygone era of luxury travel, the attire offers great style and design, high-quality performance and functionality that can take on the rigors of the job.\" This isn't the first wrinkle for Twin Hill. The company was the subject of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of Alaska Airlines flight attendants several years ago who said they experienced numerous health problems as a result of their uniforms. Despite the fact that a judge ruled in Twin Hill's favor, the airline replaced the uniforms. Twin Hill insisted there were no problems with the American Airlines uniforms. \"The safety and comfort of our uniforms has, and will always be, our highest priority. Extensive testing conducted by independent labs on the American Airlines uniforms has raised no safety concerns,\" a representative for Twin Hill told NBC News. Elizabeth Chuck ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 23, 2016 9:21 AM EST The Tunisian man sought as the primary suspect in connection with the truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market this week was killed early Friday morning by Italian police near Milan, Italy. Anis Amri , whose bid for asylum in Germany was rejected in July, became the subject of a massive manhunt on Thursday morning after authorities discovered his personal documents in the cab of the truck used in the Berlin attack, and his fingerprints on the door. Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said at a news conference that the incident began early Friday morning near the Sesto San Giovanni train station in Milan\u2019s outskirts. Two police officers stopped the man presumed to be Amri, who was on foot, and asked to see his identification.\u00a0 A photo published by Italian daily Il Tempo shows Anis Amri, the suspect in the Berlin terror truck attack, dead on the ground after a shootout with police in Milan, Italy, Dec. 23, 2016. Il Tempo Amri then removed a handgun from a backpack and shot one of the officers in the shoulder before being fatally shot by the other officer, Minniti said. He added that Amri had been identified \u201cwithout a shadow of a doubt.\u201d Minniti lauded the two officers who stopped Amri and said the one shot in the shoulder, Christian Movio, was not seriously injured. According to the interior minister, Luca Scata, the officer who fatally shot Amri in the chest, was just 29 years old, and a rookie on the national police force. Police officials said later that Amri died 10 minutes after he was shot. They said he tried to hide behind a car after shooting Movio, but was pursued and fatally shot by the rookie officer. Amri was carrying no ID, no phone and had only a knife and the loaded 22-caliber handgun he used to shoot Movio and, likely, the Polish driver of the truck he used in the Berlin attack. \u201cHe was a ghost,\u201d Milan police chief Antoio de Iesu said, according to the Associated Press. Iesu said Amri was stopped thanks to good old fashioned police work, \u201cand a little luck.\u201d Anis Amri, the Tunisian man suspected of driving a truck into a crowded Berlin Christmas market on Dec. 19, 2016, is seen in a video posted online by ISIS on Dec. 23, 2016, the same day Amri was killed by Italian police in Milan. ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Berlin and claimed Amri as one of its own, tried to paint the fatal encounter in Milan as another \u201cattack\u201d by the Tunisian on Italian police. There was nothing to back up that portrayal of events, however. The terror group also released a new video Friday, in which Amri is seen pledging his allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and then explaining his actions as vengance against \u201cthose who bomb Muslims everyday.\u201d A photo provided by Italy\u2019s national police force shows Christian Movio, the officer wounded during the encounter with Berlin terror suspect Anis Amri in Milan early on the morning of Dec. 23, 2016. Amri was killed in the shooting after wounding Movio. Italian police handout Speaking later in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel thanked the Italian police for bringing the European manhunt for Amri to an end, but vowed the investigation into the market attack would continue until anyone who helped him was aprehended. Facing myriad questions over how Amri managed to evade German police, make it to France and then on to Italy, and how the Tunisian who had already been on law enforcement radars managed to carry out his attack in the first place, Merkel vows that security measures would be reviewed. Before coming to Italy in 2015, Amri spent at last three years in an Italian jail after being arrested as a juvenile in connection with a fire started at a center for migrants, according to his brother. In his native Tunisia, Amri\u2019s brother Walid said earlier this week that he and his family were \u201cshocked\u201d by his brother\u2019s alleged involvement in the attack. \u201cIf he can see me now, I would tell him \u2018you should not have done this,\u2019\u201d Walid Amri told the Associated Press. In a separate interview, Walid told Sky News Arabia that he believed his brother became radicalized while serving his prison sentence in Italy. ",

By Kimberly Kindy and Dan Keating December 23 at 7:17 PM Follow @kimberlykindy Follow @dtkeating (Lee Powell/The Washington Post) UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series , The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. The ads started popping up about a decade ago on social media. Instead of selling alcohol with sex and romance, these ads had an edgier theme: Harried mothers chugging wine to cope with everyday stress. Women embracing quart-sized bottles of whiskey, and bellying up to bars to knock back vodka shots with men. In this new strain of advertising, women\u2019s liberation equaled heavy drinking, and alcohol researchers say it both heralded and promoted a profound cultural shift: Women in America are drinking far more, and far more frequently, than their mothers or grandmothers did, and alcohol consumption is killing them in record numbers. White women are particularly likely to drink dangerously, with more than a quarter drinking multiple times a week and the share of binge drinking up 40\u00a0percent since 1997, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal health data. In 2013, more than a million women of all races wound up in emergency rooms as a result of heavy drinking, with women in middle age most likely to suffer severe intoxication. This behavior has contributed to a startling increase in early mortality. The rate of alcohol-related\u00ad deaths for white women ages 35 to 54 has more than doubled since 1999, according to The Post analysis, accounting for 8\u00a0percent of deaths in this age group in 2015. \u201cIt is a looming health crisis,\u201d said Katherine M. Keyes, an alcohol researcher at Columbia University. Although federal health officials and independent researchers are increasingly convinced that even moderate drinking poses health risks, American women are still receiving mixed messages. Parts of the federal government continue to advance the idea that moderate drinking may be good for you. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is overseeing a new $100\u00a0million study, largely funded by the alcohol industry, that seeks to test the possible health benefits of moderate drinking. Meanwhile, many ads for alcohol \u2014 particularly on social media \u2014 appear to promote excessive drinking, which is universally recognized as potentially deadly. These ads also appear to violate the industry\u2019s code of ethics, according to a Post analysis of alcohol marketing. For example, when girl-power heroine Amy Schumer guzzled Bandit boxed wine in the movie \u201c Trainwreck ,\u201d Bandit\u2019s producer, Trinchero Family Estates, promoted the scene on social media. Young women responded with photos of themselves chugging Bandit. Within months, Trinchero said, sales of boxed wines \u2014 sometimes called \u201cbinge in a box\u201d \u2014 jumped 22\u00a0percent. \u201cWe saw it first with tobacco, marketing it to women as their right to smoke. Then we saw lung cancer deaths surpass deaths from breast cancer,\u201d said Rear Adm. Susan Blumenthal, a former U.S. assistant surgeon general and an expert on women\u2019s health issues. \u201cNow it\u2019s happening with alcohol, and it\u2019s become an equal rights tragedy.\u201d Alcohol marketing is regulated primarily by industry trade groups, but dozens of studies have found lapses in their record of enforcing the rules. As a result, an international group of public health experts convened by the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office in Washington, D.C., plans to call in January for governments worldwide to consider legislation similar to laws adopted a decade ago to sharply curtail tobacco advertising. \u201cThe industry\u2019s system of self-regulation is broken,\u201d said Thomas F. Babor, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine who is aiding the effort. \u201cThe alternatives are clear: Either you have to take their system and put it into independent hands, or you have to go with a partial or full legal ban on alcohol marketing.\u201d [ Nine charts that show how white women are drinking themselves to death ] Officials with the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), one of the largest U.S. trade groups, defend their record of oversight, saying it has received high marks from federal regulators. \u201cThe Council\u2019s Code of Responsible Practices sets more stringent standards than those mandated by law or regulation, or that might be imposed by government due to First Amendment constraints,\u201d council Senior Vice President Frank Coleman said. DISCUS tells members that ads should not \u201cin any way suggest that intoxication is socially acceptable conduct.\u201d The Beer Institute tells members that their \u201cmarketing materials should not depict situations where beer is being consumed rapidly, excessively.\u201d And the Wine Institute prohibits ads that make \u201cany suggestion that excessive drinking or loss of control is amusing or a proper subject for amusement\u201d or that directly associate use of wine with \u201csocial, physical or personal problem solving.\u201d But these rules appear regularly to be flouted, particularly on alcohol companies\u2019 websites and \u00adsocial-media feeds, which are soaking up a growing share of the more than $2\u00a0billion the industry is expected to spend on advertising this year. And the trade groups acknowledge that they do not investigate or act on possible violations unless they receive a formal complaint. A woman samples a bottle of wine at a festival in Raleigh, N.C. Companies are gearing promotions to target women, with much of the edgiest marketing appearing on social media. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Normalizing drinking Some of the edgiest ads appear on social media \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram \u2014 where they can be narrowly targeted toward the inboxes of the most eager consumers. \u201cThey can be very specific,\u201d Facebook spokeswoman Annie Demarest said. \u201cThe ads could go to married women ages 21 to 60 who read about wine and leisure. They can also target the ads based on location, interests, demographics, behaviors and connections.\u201d Jokes about becoming inebriated are common. One Twitter ad features a woman with a bottle the size of a refrigerator tilted toward her lips. Its contents: Fireball Cinnamon Whisky. Women also are frequently shown drinking to cope with daily stress. In one image that appeared on a company website, two white women wearing prim, narrow-brimmed hats, button earrings and wash-and-set hair confer side by side. \u201cHow much do you spend on a bottle of wine?\u201d one asks. The other answers, \u201cI would guess about half an hour . . . \u201d At the bottom is the name of the wine: Mommy\u2019s Time Out. Another ad on a company website features a white woman wearing pearls and an apron. \u201cThe most expensive part of having kids is all the wine you have to drink,\u201d it says above the name of the wine: Mad Housewife. This spring, Mad Housewife offered a Mother\u2019s Day promotion: a six-pack of wine called Mommy\u2019s Little Helper. Mommy\u2019s Time Out and Mad Housewife are two wines that are marketed toward women. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) The trend extends to \u00adwine-related housewares. A flask promoted on the Mad Housewife site features two women from the \u201cMad Men\u201d era asking, \u201cWho is this \u2018Moderation\u2019 we\u2019re supposed to be drinking with?\u201d An ad on the Etsy marketplace website promotes a stemmed glass big enough to hold an entire bottle of wine with the line: \u201cShe will be telling the truth when she says \u2018I only had 1 glass.\u2019\u00a0\u201d And Urban Outfitters \u2014 a retailer that markets to 18- to 28-year-olds \u2014 stocks whole-bottle wine glasses that say: \u201cDrink until your dreams come true\u201d and \u201cThis is how you adult.\u201d Urban Outfitters did not respond to calls and emailed messages. Alcohol marketing experts see a feedback loop between alcohol advertising and popular culture. They cite Trinchero\u2019s repurposing of Schumer\u2019s scene in \u201cTrainwreck\u201d as a prominent example. \u201cThe rise in hazardous drinking among women is not all due to the ads. But the ads have played a role in creating a cultural climate that says it\u2019s funny when women drink heavily,\u201d said Jean Kilbourne, who has produced several films and books about alcohol marketing to women. \u201cMost importantly, they\u2019ve played a role in normalizing it.\u201d Multiple experts on alcohol marketing said Trinchero\u2019s use of the scene to promote its wine violated industry standards. Wendy Nyberg, Trinchero\u2019s marketing vice president, defended the company\u2019s behavior, saying Trinchero officials had no role in the production of \u201cTrainwreck\u201d and no control over how their wine was portrayed. It\u2019s \u201ceasier when you control the messaging,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe have to promote moderation in everything that we do. We stick to the code of ethics.\u201d The owner of Mommy\u2019s Time Out did not respond to requests for comment, and marketing promotions sent to the company for a response have been removed from the company\u2019s public Facebook page. Damian Davis, the owner of the Seattle-based Rainier Wine, which produces Mad Housewife, said he does not think his ads crossed a line. \u201cWe treat wine like a lifestyle product. I grew up in a big Catholic family, and having it with dinner was a way of life,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t encourage binge drinking. It certainly is a drug, and it can be dangerous.\u201d Even responsible drinking campaigns can send conflicting messages. A Facebook ad for Smirnoff Ice \u2014 ranked among the five most popular beverages by young female drinkers \u2014 shows a stack of caps from four pint-size bottles. The tagline: \u201cKnow Your Limit.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s binge drinking,\u201d said David Jernigan, who runs the Center for Alcohol Marketing and Youth at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Jernigan, who advocates limits on alcohol marketing and has come under frequent attack from the alcohol industry, uses the Smirnoff ad in a presentation he calls \u201cVirginia Slims in a Bottle.\u201d \u201cNot only is that not responsible drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hazardous drinking.\u201d In a statement, Diageo, the maker of Smirnoff Ice, defended the ad, saying that by \u201csaving the bottle caps, you keep track of how much you have had. Each individual has their own individual limits and for each individual these limits can vary based on time period of consumption, food intake and many other factors.\u201d Officials with Fireball Whisky declined to comment. \u2018No gender equity\u2019 As it happens, drinking can be especially hazardous for women. Women tend to have smaller bodies than men, and differences in physiology that make blood-alcohol\u00ad levels climb faster and stay elevated longer. Some studies have found that women have lower levels of the stomach enzymes needed to process the toxins in alcoholic beverages. As a result, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, women are more prone to suffer brain atrophy, heart disease and liver damage. Even if a woman stops drinking, liver disease continues to progress in ways it does not in men, said Gyongyi Szabo, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. And research definitively shows that women who drink have an increased risk of breast cancer. \u201cThere is no gender equity when it comes to the effects of alcohol on men versus women,\u201d Szabo said. \u201cFemales are more susceptible to the unwanted biological effects of alcohol when they consume the same amount of alcohol and at the same frequency \u2014 even when you adjust for weight.\u201d Many women don\u2019t know this \u2014 nor do they understand what constitutes excessive drinking, said Robert D. Brewer, leader of the CDC\u2019s alcohol program. For women in the United States, anything more than one drink a day is considered excessive. That\u2019s one\u00a0ounce of distilled spirits, 12\u00a0ounces of beer or five\u00a0ounces of wine. Four drinks consumed within two hours is considered binge drinking. That\u2019s about two-thirds of a bottle of wine. \u201cMost people do not understand what binge drinking looks like, and they don\u2019t yet recognize how dangerous it is,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cSmoking, eating unhealthy foods, not exercising \u2014 people get what that can do to your health. But we are in a way different stage with binge drinking.\u201d Women sample and drink wine at a festival in Raleigh, N.C. Women consume the majority of wine in the United States. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) The alcohol industry and some government agencies continue to promote the idea that moderate drinking provides some health benefits. But new research is beginning to call even that long-standing claim into question. This year, Jennie Connor, a professor at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine in New Zealand, published a paper that found \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that drinking as little as two servings of alcohol a day can cause cancer at seven sites in the body \u2014 mostly in areas where human cells come in direct contact with alcohol. Connor\u2019s research included a survey of dozens of studies of the issue by prominent organizations, including the World Cancer Research Fund, the American Institute for Cancer Research and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In an earlier paper examining alcohol and cancer in the New Zealand population, Connor found that about a third of alcohol-related cancer deaths among women were associated with less than two standard drinks per day. About the time this work was appearing, DISCUS chief scientist Samir Zakhari produced research casting doubt on its validity. Zakhari also wrote an opinion piece directly attacking Connor\u2019s study, using earlier research to dispute her findings. Connor fired back at Zakhari in an op-ed published in a New Zealand newspaper, noting that Zakhari relied on \u2014 and misrepresented \u2014 her own earlier research. \u201cThe author cites Health Promotion Agency research showing how wrong I am,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf he had opened the report, he would have discovered that I wrote it.\u201d Zakhari scheduled and then canceled an interview with The Post to discuss his criticism of Connor and other alcohol researchers. \u201cI occasionally write op-eds or letters to the editor, most often in response to news coverage that contains flawed science,\u201d he ultimately said in a statement. The CDC\u2019s Brewer, however, said that Connor\u2019s research \u2014 and other recent work highlighting the health risks of drinking \u2014 is persuasive. \u201cThe current and emerging science does not support the purported benefits of moderate drinking,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cThe risk of death from cancer appears to go up with any level of alcohol consumption. \u201cThe guidelines talk about low-risk consumption, but there is no such thing.\u201d Julie Tate contributed to this report.

After more than three decades and thousands of programs, she's stepping away from the broadcast microphone. Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images Diane Rehm poses for a portrait at her home in January. After more than three decades and thousands of programs, she's stepping away from the broadcast microphone. Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images Diane Rehm is wrapping up a public radio career spanning more than four decades and thousands of episodes. Her talk show has originated at Washington, D.C.'s WAMU and is heard by nearly 3 million people across the country weekly on NPR stations. Yet The Diane Rehm Show almost didn't get off the ground. In 1979, Rehm started as a host with a program aimed at homemakers. Several years later, she informed her boss that she had other plans. \"I'm bored. I'm really bored,\" Rehm remembers telling him. \"Unless I can change this show and do politics, do science, do medicine, do everything that's happening in the world, I'm outta here. ... He listened, and he said 'you're right.' \" Diane Rehm To Retire From Long-Running Radio Show Reformatted and rebranded as The Diane Rehm Show in 1984, it became a place for policies to get dissected and politicians to get tested. Last year, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley experienced Rehm's steely civility as he called in from a cellphone en route to the studio. \"Gov. O'Malley, I must say I'm somewhat surprised that you could not make it here in time as you had promised to,\" she told him on air. \"Ah, well, Diane, you can't believe every promise every politician makes,\" he replied with a twinkle in his voice. O'Malley, in the early stages of his Democratic presidential campaign, then apologized profusely. Rehm did not relent. \"I do expect guests to live up to their promises,\" she told O'Malley. A low point for Rehm occurred last year during election season. Relying on fabricated Internet reports, she asked Bernie Sanders about his supposed dual American and Israeli citizenship \u2014 only he doesn't have dual citizenship. Diane Rehm Finds New Life In The Profound Challenge Of Being Alone She calls that a chief regret over decades of broadcasting. Rehm's presence on the air was always distinctive. Her inflection and pitch was greatly affected by a neurological voice disorder, called spasmodic dysphonia, that threatened her livelihood. \"It sends an incorrect message to the vocal cords, and I become strangled,\" she explains. Treatment requires a Botox injection into her vocal cords several times a year. The first time Rehm received the injection, she says, she thought her career was over. Article continues after sponsorship \"People were so kind and so welcoming,\" she says. \"Now, I'm not saying everybody was, because I had the feeling there were a ton of people who said, 'What in God's name is this woman doing on radio?' \" Among her most frequent nonpolitical guests were the actor and singer Julie Andrews, the author Isabel Allende, and the poet Maya Angelou, who stopped a conversation about her book with this: \"I like you so much, Diane Rehm, and ... so does your audience. And I have a feeling all the time that you and I are best friends.\" As Diane Rehm Retires, WAMU Launching Midday Show Called '1A' The interview took place in 2013 and was their final conversation. \"You are the kind of best friend everybody would like to have,\" Angelou added. \"You're honest, you're direct, and you're not brutal.\" The Diane Rehm Show signs off the air Friday, to be succeeded by Joshua Johnson , whose show, 1A, will be heard on many member stations. Yet Rehm's voice won't disappear. She says she has only listened to a single podcast \u2014 once \u2014 but she intends to start a podcast of her own, also for WAMU. ",

Questions about President-elect Trump\u2019s stance on nuclear arms had been raised throughout the campaign and arose again Thursday when Trump tweeted that the U.S. \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump's meaning in the tweet was unclear, and his spokesman and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer addressed the issue in interviews. On MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Spicer defended Trump\u2019s speaking out on issues before becoming president, saying that he shouldn\u2019t necessarily follow the examples of some other recent presidents-elect who waited until inauguration to weigh in on foreign and domestic policy. Carlo Allegri/Reuters Sean Spicer arrives in the lobby of Republican president-elect Donald Trump's Trump Tower in New York, Nov. 14, 2016. But more confusion arose when MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski reportedly spoke to Trump by phone -- a conversation that was not broadcast -- after Spicer's interview on the show. Brzezinski and her co-host Joe Scarborough recounted her conversation with Trump on the air afterward. \u201cMika asked the president-elect while we had the opportunity what his position was on trying to clarify the tweet yesterday regarding the nuclear arsenal, and the president-elect told you what?\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough said. \u201cLet it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cAnd outlast them all,\u201d Scarborough said. Spicer gave more interviews this morning after that and when asked about the comment Trump allegedly made to Brzezinski, Spicer told CNN, \"That was a private conversation. I was not privy to that.\" \"But the bottom line is this, the president [elect] is going to put our nation's security and safety first. And he's not going to worry about how it's -- he's going to do it. That's what every American should understand, that he's not going to be a passive president. He's going to be active and make sure that our safety is number one,\u201d Spicer said. \"If another country expands theirs, the United States will act in kind,\u201d he said of nuclear arsenals. On NBC's \"The Today Show,\" Spicer said, \"There's not going to be [an arms race] ... because he is going to ensure other countries get the message that he is not going to sit back and allow that. And what's going to happen is they will come to their senses, and we will all be just fine.\" \"There [have] been several countries -- Russia among them -- that have talked about expanding their nuclear capability.\" ABC News' Alana Abramson contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Ethnic violence and clashes have killed tens of thousands in the South Sudan and forced millions to flee from their homes. Ben Curtis/AP hide caption toggle caption Ben Curtis/AP The arms embargo and sanctions fell short of the nine votes needed for adoption Friday. Ethnic violence and clashes have killed tens of thousands in the South Sudan and forced millions to flee from their homes. Ben Curtis/AP An arms embargo against South Sudan failed to gain traction with the U.N. Security council Friday, delivering a blow to efforts to halt fighting in the young nation. The resolution, which also included targeted sanctions, fell two votes short of the mandatory nine needed for the body to adopt such measures. While, no permanent member of the council vetoed the proposed arms embargo, NPR's Michele Kelemen tells our newscast unit, prominent voices on the council, including Russia and Japan abstained from the vote. \"History is going to be a very harsh judge of their decision. The atrocities in South Sudan, the displacement to other countries is increasing every day,\" U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the council following the vote. Power, who introduced the resolution, said that while it was far from a \"panacea,\" its passage would have brought consequences to what she called \"the architects of mass atrocities and those who defy the demands of the Security Council day in, day out.\" Following news of the vote, several human rights organizations decried the resolution's defeat. \"South Sudanese civilians had a reasonable expectation that the Security Council would make good on its long-standing threat to impose an arms embargo and extend sanctions to some of the senior leaders who have been responsible for grave human rights abuses\" said John Prendergast, founding director at the Enough Project, said in a statement circulated by Humans Rights Watch . Article continues after sponsorship The embargo's defeat follows worsening violence within the nation, which split from Sudan by popular vote in 2011. Shortly thereafter, fighting began between forces loyal to the President Salva Kiir and supporters of Riek Machar, the country's former vice president. As we reported earlier this month , the political conflict quickly cut across ethnic lines: \"Since December 2013, South Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war that began as a primarily political conflict, but has since taken shape between the country's two largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and the Nuer. At that time, South Sudan President Salva Kiir fell out with his former vice president, Riek Machar, over allegations of a coup attempt. Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer, gathered supporters from their respective tribes.\" A 2015 peace deal did little to stop the fighting which has killed tens of thousands and forced 3.1 million to flee, the Associated Press adds. Earlier this year, the Security Council adopted a resolution authorizing 4,000 troops from African nations to join 12,000 U.N. peacekeeping forces there offering an arms embargo as an ultimatum if the government remained resistant to U.N. efforts, the newsservice goes on to say. Japan, Russia, China, Angola, Malaysia, Venezuela, Egypt and Senegal all abstained with ambassadors from those countries questioning the efficacy of the proposal. ",

In the hours after President-elect Trump tweeted about his desire to expand American nuclear weapons capability \u2014 seeming to upend decades of consensus that fewer nukes is better \u2014 experts puzzled about what he meant, his own aides seemed to walk his comment back, and Trump himself weighed in to suggest that the most extreme reading of his tweet was the right one. Trump stunned nuclear experts Thursday by proclaiming in a tweet that \"the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" And on Friday, Trump himself weighed in again, saying in a statement to \"Morning Joe\" host Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC: \" Let it be an arms race . We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.\" While President Barack Obama has proposed a multibillion-dollar plan to modernize the aging U.S. nuclear triad, no mainstream voices are arguing to increase the numbers of nuclear weapons beyond the 4,500 active warheads the U.S. currently possesses, several experts told NBC News. \"The thrust of U.S. nuclear policy for decades now has been to trim the fat off the U.S. nuclear arsenal,\" said James Acton, co\u00ad-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"At a certain point,\" he said, quoting Winston Churchill, \"you are just making the rubble bounce higher.\" \"Can a tweet start an arms race?

Was he simply arguing for modernizing the nuclear force, or was he actually calling for more weapons? Trump spokesman Jason Miller appeared to try to walk back the more extreme reading, saying in a statement to NBC News that \"President-\u00adelect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes. He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\" Miller did not respond to a follow-\u00adup question, however, asking whether that meant Trump was not, in fact, calling for more nuclear weapons. Trump's new press secretary, Sean Spicer, appeared to try to clarify Trump's \"arms race\" remarks on NBC's TODAY show Friday, saying the president-elect's statements are meant as a \"warning\" to other nations. \"There's not going to be [an arms race] because he's going to ensure that other countries get the message that he's not going to sit back and allow that,\" Spicer said. \"And what's going to happen is they will come to their senses and we will all be just fine.\" Play Trump's newly named press secretary on president-elect's nuclear plan 4:47 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161224012016if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/840242755980\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Later, on CNN, Spicer said Trump's words should be taken literally. But when asked about Trump's statement to Brzezinski, Spicer called it a private conversation with which he was unfamiliar. That followed remarks by newly appointed counselor to the president-elect Kellyanne Conway, who told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Thursday that Trump's tweet was effectively about posturing. \"In the case of the nuclear comment, I discussed it with him directly and he is making the point this is about nuclear proliferation in the face of rogue nations and regimes that are stockpiling weapons,\" Conway said. Trump's Nuclear Options The U.S. has not increased its nuclear stockpile since 1967. But Trump does have options that could mean more U.S. nuclear weapons, said Matthew Kroenig, an expert at Georgetown University. Under the most current treaty with Russia, the U.S. could increase the number of deployed weapons to 1,550 from the current 1,300, Kroenig said. It could also add new types of weapons with greater capabilities. The U.S. can deliver nukes by bomber, intercontinental missile and submarine \u2014 the three legs of the so-called nuclear triad. Under Obama, the Pentagon has been moving forward with a program to modernize many aspects of the aging weapons and delivery systems, a program that some say could cost $1 trillion over three decades. Some experts question whether the U.S. still needs all legs of the triad. One who has raised that issue is James Mattis, the retired Marine general who is Trump's choice for defense chief. \"You should ask, 'Is it time to reduce the triad to a diad, removing the land\u00ad-based missiles?'\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in January 2015, as the Associated Press reported earlier this month. Keith Payne, a former Defense Department official and longtime nuclear expert, argues that modernization is badly overdue. But even Payne doesn't argue for expanding the number of nuclear weapons or launchers, he told NBC News in an interview. He declined to say whether he is advising the Trump team. Acton called Trump's tweet unprecedented, not only for its content, but for the notion that a president-\u00adelect would make a pronouncement about something so sensitive as nuclear weapons policy over a medium as casual as Twitter.

Allies are consulted, presidential statements pored over, words checked and double checked, crafted and recrafted.\" But Trump doesn't appear to do business that way. \"I have no doubt in my mind that Trump's Twitter feed is monitored extremely closely by foreign governments and that this will cause significant heartache,\" Acton said. It's unclear what prompted the statement. Earlier Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his desire to strengthen Russia's nuclear forces, but experts say Putin says such things on a near\u00ad weekly basis. \"We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,\" Putin said. On Friday, Trump released and praised a letter Putin sent him calling for cooperation between the two countries. Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said that the Russians \"see U.S. modernization plus missile defense plus conventional precision weapons as a serious threat to their nuclear deterrent ... they have been doing nuclear saber-rattling that has been unprecedented.\" However, Bunn said, that doesn't mean the U.S. needs more nukes. \"I just think we need a broader conversation about exactly what we need for deterrence,\" he said. Trump Confused About Nukes? Trump's comments during the campaign raised questions about the depth of his understanding of U.S. nuclear capabilities \u2014 and of nuclear weapons in general. In a debate, Trump agreed with moderator Lester Holt of NBC News that nuclear weapons are of paramount importance to the U.S. \u2014 but then called for more nations to join the nuclear club. He ruled out a \"first strike,\" but he also revealed a willingness to use nukes and a misunderstanding of the high\u00ad-stakes balancing act the nuclear superpowers have pursued for decades. \"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over,\" Trump said, referring to the use of nuclear weapons. \"At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.\" During the Republican primaries in December 2015, Trump appeared not to know what the nuclear triad was, dodging a question about it from conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt. Trump also provoked unease during the campaign when he suggested that non\u00ad-nuclear powers such as Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia could be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, contradicting decades of bipartisan U.S. policy consensus.

The United States abstained from the vote. USA TODAY NETWORK The United Nations Security Council votes to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction at United Nations headquarters in New York on Dec. 23, 2016. (Photo: Justin Lane, epa) In an unprecedented diplomatic rebuke of Israel, the United States\u00a0abstained Friday on a United Nations\u00a0Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements, allowing the highly charged measure to pass. The resolution was approved\u00a014-0 with the one abstention.\u00a0The vote was greeted with loud applause in the packed Security Council chamber. The measure\u00a0demands Israel \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\" It declares the establishment of settlements by Israel has \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\" In abstaining, the U.S. brushed aside calls for a veto by\u00a0president-elect Donald Trump who, in an unprecedented move, managed to delay the\u00a0vote a\u00a0day\u00a0by weighing in with Egypt, the initial sponsor of the\u00a0resolution. In a tweet after the vote, Trump offered his reaction to the outcome: \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, in remarks to the council after the vote,\u00a0said the U.S. position\u00a0on the\u00a0settlements has remained unchanged for five decades, and quoted a 1982 statement by then-President Ronald Reagan, which declared Washington \u201cwill not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements.\u201d \"The U.S. has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately\u00a0and publicly, for five decades,\" Power said. Settlement activity, she added, \u201charms the viability of a negotiated two-state outcome and erodes prospects for peace and stability in the region.\u201d At the same time, she said,\u00a0\"Our vote does not in any way diminish our steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.\"\u00a0Israel, she noted,\u00a0\"faces very serious threats in a\u00a0very tough neighborhood.\" In a statement issued\u00a0by his office, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said,\u00a0\"Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. and will not abide by its terms.\" \"At a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall 'occupied territory.'\" Netanyahu, whose relations with President Obama have been decidedly strained over the past eight years, said the U.S. administration \"not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the U.N., it colluded with it behind the scenes.\" \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution,\" the statement said. The American Jewish Congress also expressed dismay with the move. \"In the strongest terms possible,\u00a0the American Jewish Congress is deeply disappointed with the Obama administration\u00a0for\u00a0shamefully abstaining\u00a0on\u00a0today's\u00a0anti-Israel UN Security Council resolution,\" the group said in a statement. \"By the U.S. abstaining, President Obama abandoned\u00a0long standing American foreign policy of vetoing one-sided resolutions against Israel at the United Nations, and in doing so, he\u00a0steps away from his presidency, turning his back on the unbreakable bond with our great ally Israel.\" At the U.N., Israeli ambassador\u00a0Danny Danon\u00a0criticized the U.S. abstention, saying he has \"no doubt\" the Trump administration will usher in a new era.\u00a0In remarks to the council,\u00a0he said\u00a0Jews have conquered\u00a0many obstacles in the past, and \"we will overcome this evil decree, too.\" Pro-Israel lobby AIPAC\u00a0said it was \"deeply disturbed\" the Obama Administration declined to veto what it called a \"destructive, one-sided, anti-Israel resolution.\" \"By adopting this resolution, the United Nations has once again served as an open forum to isolate and delegitimize Israel \u2014 America\u2019s lone stable, democratic ally in the Middle East,\" AIPAC said in a statement. Read an equally bristling statement from the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the rabbinic arm of the United States reform movement, \"The CCAR has frequently criticized the current Israeli settlement policy as an obstacle to peace.\u00a0 At the same time, the United Nations is not the arena in which to address these complex issues. Peace negotiations belong between the two parties involved.\u00a0 Further, the UN's obsessive and relentless criticism of Israel, while ignoring the unspeakable repression committed by illegitimate regimes and terrorist organizations worldwide, falsely and maliciously labels Israel uniquely as a pariah state.\" Palestinian authority ambassador to the U.N. Riyad Mansour thanked the council\u00a0for the vote and said he believes it could contribute to prospects\u00a0for peace talks.\u00a0The resolution, he said, \"may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the two-state solution and revive the path for peace, to keep the hope alive.\" Although Egypt withdrew the measure Thursday, co-sponsors New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal requested the vote take place Friday. To pass, it needed nine \"aye\" votes and no veto from a permanent council member \u2014 the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China.

White House officials said\u00a0the administration's decision not to veto is consistent with its long-standing opposition to Israeli settlements, calling them an incitement to violence and an impediment\u00a0to peace. The United Nations resolution\u00a0\"makes clear that both Israel and the Palestinians have to take steps to preserve the two-state solution,\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. Rhodes said the U.S. had nothing to do with the U.N. resolution, and that the Obama administration has been warning Israel for years that settlements were increasing its international \"isolation.\" As for Trump's tweet, Rhodes said Obama remains in charge until Jan. 20. \"There is one president at a time,\" he said. While the resolution does not call for sanctions on Israel, it amounts to a high-profile rebuke of the Israeli government and could hamper Israel's negotiating position in future peace talks. Palestinians argue that the expansion of settlements on the disputed land makes a peace deal even less likely. Under international law, Israeli settlements \u2014 built on Palestinian land occupied by Israel \u2014 are considered to be illegal. Some 600,000 Israelis live in east Jerusalem and on the West Bank, which the Palestinians seek as part of a future independent state. Israel captured both areas in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel argues the final status of the territories should be determined in any future talks on Palestinian statehood. Trump slams UN resolution on Israeli settlements Trump, who does not take office until Jan. 20, had issued a statement Thursday calling for a U.S. veto only hours before the initially scheduled vote. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the Republican president-elect spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about the proposed Security Council action Thursday. On Friday, Sisi's spokesman said the two leaders agreed to allow Trump's incoming administration a chance to take up the issue. \"During the call, they discussed regional affairs and developments in the Middle East, and in that context the draft resolution in front of the Security Council on Israeli settlement,\" said spokesman Alaa Yousef. \"The presidents agreed on the importance of affording the new U.S. administration the full chance to deal with all dimensions of the Palestinian case with a view of achieving a full and final settlement. A senior Palestinian official, speaking anonymously according to protocol, said Egypt didn\u2019t consult with the Palestinians about delaying the vote and it was a \u201ccomplete shock\u201d for them, AP reports. Egypt represents Arab states on the security council. Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, with whom it shares close security ties in a joint struggle against Islamic militants.

    "text": "Italian Police Didn't Realize Man Was Berlin Terror Suspect Before Shootout By J.J. GALLAGHER Dec 23, 2016, 4:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Berlin Terror Attack Suspect Shot Dead in Milan 0 Shares Email The two Italian police officers who shot and killed a gunman outside a closed train station early Friday did not realize initially that he was the suspect in the Berlin truck attack, which killed 12 and injured dozens, Milan police said. Anis Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, was near a train station in the Sesto San Giovanni area about 3 a.m. when he was approached by two officers, police said. \"He was a man from northern Africa, like there are many in the Milan area, and ours was a routine check that was carried out by two young and good police officers,\u201d Antonio de Iesu, the head of Milan police, said in a press conference today. When a police officer spoke to Amri, who was standing alone, he answered in Italian that he came from Reggio Calabria, located at the tip of Italy's southwest coast. The officer noted Amri's foreign accent when he spoke, an official at the Milan police headquarters told ABC News. The policeman asked Amri to empty his backpack and pockets, which is standard procedure, said Roberto Guida, Head of Sesto San Giovanni police. Amri was calm as he started emptying his pockets and backpack, but he suddenly pulled out a weapon that had already been loaded and fired once at the chief patrol officer, who was closest to him, Guida said. After he fired the initial shot, Amri tried to hide behind a car and shoot the officers again, Guida said. Another officer then walked around the car and shot and killed Amri. When he was confronted by the officer, Amri allegedly said \"policemen are bastards,\" according to Guida. The wounded police officer was taken to a local hospital where he is recovering, according to the interior minister. Amri had a train ticket on him when he was shot from Chambray, France to Turin, Italy. He did not have a cellphone or keys or any other personal effects, but he did have cash and a gun, the official said. Italian authorities confirmed the man killed was Amri using fingerprints provided by German authorities, German Federal Prosecutor Peter Frank said. In a video posted on social media that appears to have been recorded prior to the attack in Berlin, Amri pledges allegiance to ISIS and says he is avenging the bombing of Muslims, urging others around the world to take up the jihad. \u201cMy message to the crusaders who bombard Muslims every day: With God\u2019s will, I swear we\u2019re coming to slaughter you, you pigs,\u201d Amri says. \u201cI encourage all my Muslim brothers in every place to conduct jihad in the name of the religion.\u201d Iesu said that it was \"absurd that a terrorist of this sort was found casually during a routine check but this is the reality.\" \"The policemen had no indication he was a killer,\" he added, according to the Italian news agency Ansa. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the \"the general threat of terrorism continues,\" and said if there are \"other guilty persons or helpers\" in the Berlin attack, \"we will bring them to justice.\" Merkel said she also spoke to the president of Tunisia and told him that Germany will greatly speed up its deportations of Tunisian nationals \"who have no right of abode in Germany.\" Investigators meanwhile are working to determine how Amri became radicalized and were trying to determine his travels since Monday's attack, police said. Amri passed through France before arriving by train at Milan's central railway station at around 1 a.m. Friday morning, a Milan police spokesman said. German are trying to determine whether he had had help from a network of supporters in planning the attack and fleeing to Italy, Milan Police Italian police officer Cristian Movio recovered in the hospital after being injured in a shootout with Anis Amri, a suspect in the terrorist attack at a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 and injured 48. Amri had become the center of a Europe-wide manhunt following Monday's deadly attack on the Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz, a public square in the heart of Germany's capital. Milan Police A bullet hole in the uniform of the Italian police officer wounded in a shootout in Milan with Berlin attack suspect Anis Amri, Dec. 23, 2016. Officials identified Amri as the likely assailant in the attack, citing evidence discovered at the crime scene including fingerprints in the cab of the truck. The truck's driver was found dead with gunshot wounds in the back of the Polish-owned tractor-trailer used in the attack. The man is being counted among the 12 fatalities. Sergio Pontoriero/IPA/REX/Shutterstock Suspected Berlin truck attacker Anis Amri was shot dead in Milan, Dec. 23, 2016. ISIS claimed responsibility for Monday's assault, calling Amri \"a soldier of the Islamic State,\" in a statement released by the terrorist group. Ralf Jaeger, the interior minister of the German state of North Rhine\u2013Westphalia, told reporters on Wednesday that Amri had known ties to the local radical Islamic scene and he had been deemed a threat by several security agencies. Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany German officials have released this poster, saying that Anis Amri, 24, of Tunisia, is wanted in connection with the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, on Dec. 19, 2016. In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Amri's mother said her son showed no signs of radicalization and she questioned whether he was really the man who launched the attack in Berlin. She said poverty drove her son to steal and travel illegally to Europe. \"I want the truth to be revealed about my son,\" Nour El Houda Hassani told The AP on Thursday in the central Tunisian town of Oueslatia. \"If he is the perpetrator of the attack, let him assume his responsibilities and I'll renounce him before God. If he didn't do anything, I want my son's rights to be restored.\" ABC News' Molly Hunter, Rym Momtaz, Phoebe Natanson, Bruno Nota, Kirit Radia, Ben Gittleson contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Putin also launched a scathing attack on Democrats, saying they forgot the meaning of their own name and were sore losers. USA TODAY Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during his annual press conference in Moscow on Dec. 23 2016. (Photo: Natalia Kolesnikova, AFP/Getty Images) In a\u00a0marathon, year-end news conference,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin praised President-elect Donald Trump on Friday for tapping into the mood of American voters, but took a swipe at Democrats,\u00a0saying they are\u00a0losing on many fronts and are off base in trying to blame Trump's victory on external factors. \"Trump understood the mood of the people and kept going until the end, when nobody believed in him,\" Putin said, smiling.\u00a0\"Except for you and me.\" The Russian leader\u00a0also said he\u00a0hopes to develop \u201cbusiness-like and constructive relations that would benefit both Russia and the United States.\u201d As for the elections,\u00a0in which the U.S. accused Russia of interference, Putin said Democrats have only\u00a0themselves to blame for their losses. \"They (the Democrats) are losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame,\" he\u00a0told reporters in a news conference that lasted nearly four hours. \"In my view this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You need to learn how to lose gracefully.\" Accusing the Democrats of forgetting the \"meaning of their own name,\" Putin said \"outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. Roosevelt certainly would be.\" Putin said he hopes to have a meeting soon with Trump to discuss how to improve ties, adding Russia\u2019s relations with the United States and its allies have fallen to their lowest level since the Cold War era. He said he agrees with Trump\u2019s assessment of the current low level of U.S.-Russian relations, adding they \u201ccan\u2019t be worse.\u201d Later on Friday, the Trump organization later released a copy of letter from Putin to Trump in which the Russian leader expressed his \"warmest Christmas and New Year greetings\" to the president-elect. Putin writes that Trump becomes president, he hopes the two leaders \"acting in a \"contructive and pragmatic manner\" \u00a0can\u00a0take \"real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas.\" and bring\u00a0collaboration on the international scene \"to a qualitatively new level.\" Trump, issued a statement, in which he said he had\u00a0received a \"very nice \u00a0letter\" from\u00a0Russian leader. \"His thoughts\u00a0are correct,\" Trump said. \"I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate\u00a0path.\" In the\u00a0wide-ranging, televised\u00a0news conference, the Russian president said he sees \u201cnothing unusual\u201d in the U.S. president-elect's pledge to strengthen\u00a0U.S. nuclear forces, calling Trump's statement in line with his campaign promises. Putin conceded the U.S. has a bigger military, but said Russia's military is stronger than any potential foe. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during his annual news conference in Moscow, Dec. 23, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Alexei Druzhinin, AP) \u201cIndeed, they (the U.S.) have more missiles, more submarines and more aircraft carriers, we aren\u2019t arguing with that, but we are simply stronger than any aggressor.\u201d Putin said military modernization helped strengthen the Russia's nuclear forces. Regarding U.S. accusations that Russian tried to influence the U.S. election by hacking into the computers of the Democratic party, Putin said the hackers could have been located anywhere. He shrugged off Washington\u2019s claims of their Russian affiliation. He added, however, that U.S. Democrats should have apologized to American voters over the information revealed by hackers who posted politically embarrassing emails from Democratic National Committee staffers. Asked how he responded when\u00a0President Obama raised the Russian hacking accusation in a private conversation, telling the Russian leader to \"cut it out,\" Putin said\u00a0he never makes confidential conversations public. The news conference touched on a wide variety of topics, from the assassination of a Russian envoy in Turkey to charges of doping by Russian athletes to events in Ukraine. Among the highlights, Putin: \u2014\u00a0Called for a ceasefire across Syria followed by peace talks, now that Syrian government forces have taken full control of Aleppo.\u00a0\u201cThe next stage should be a ceasefire on the entire territory of Syria and the launch of talks on a political settlement.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Said\u00a0Russia is working to uproot doping among Olympic athletes, but calls some of the charges against Russia about widespread doping unfair. \u2014 \u00a0Called the fatal shooting of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov on Monday in Ankara \u201can attack on Russia-Turkey relations,\u201d but said it would not hurt cooperation between the two countries. Putin noted the killer was a police officer and said\u00a0the attack reflected a high level of \u201cpenetration of destructive forces\u201d into the Turkish military and security forces. \u2014\u00a0Declared that peace talks, sponsored by France and Germany should remain the basis for efforts to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine. A shaky peace deal brokered by Berlin and Paris in early 2015\u00a0has helped lower the scale of fighting in eastern Ukraine.\u00a0More\u00a0than 9,600 people have died in battles between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists that erupted there in April 2014. However, clashes have continued and political settlement has stalled. 6735 CONNECT TWEET 24 LINKEDIN 328 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hfS4dS NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Actress Carrie Fisher speaks onstage during Wizard World Comic Con Chicago 2016 - Day 4 at Donald E. Stephens Convention Center on August 21, 2016 in Rosemont, Illinois.\u00a0 Getty Images for Wizard World / Daniel Boczarski Todd Fisher said Friday night that his sister is receiving excellent care, but that he could not classify her condition. He had earlier told The Associated Press that she had been stabilized and was out of the emergency room. In a subsequent interview he said many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency are unknown. Fisher, 60, experienced medical trouble during a flight from London and was treated by paramedics immediately after the plane landed in Los Angeles, according to reports citing unnamed sources. Several people who were on the flight tweeted that they saw the veteran \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress receive CPR from passengers who may have been nurses. The plane was then met by paramedics at LAX who provided advanced life support and aggressively treated the patient. United Airlines said that medical personnel met United flight 935 from London to Los Angeles upon arrival Friday and after the crew reported that a passenger was unresponsive. Sources have told CBS News that Fisher was that patient. TMZ \u00a0first reported that Fisher had gone into cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles Times\u00a0 reported \u00a0that Fisher was in critical condition. Actress Anna Akana, who also calls herself a fan of Fisher\u2019s, said she was on the flight and tweeted, \u201cDon\u2019t know how else to process this but Carrie Fisher stopped breathing on the flight home. Hope she\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d She also added that the flight crew and doctor and nurse passengers jumped into action during the episode. Her boyfriend, comedian Brad Gage, tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m in complete shock. @AnnaAkana and I sat in front of Carrie Fisher on our flight from London and she was just taken off the plane by EMTs.\u201d Don't know how else to process this but Carrie Fisher stopped breathing on the flight home.

In 2013, she was hospitalized due to an\u00a0 incident relating to her bipolar disorder. \u00a0 In the actress\u2019 latest book is \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d but perhaps her most well-known book was 1987\u2019s \u201cPostcards from the Edge,\u201d a semi-autobiographical novel that was adapted into a film of the same name.

The suspect \u2014 identified as 33-year-old Gary Holmes \u2014 surrendered to police Thursday night after he was wanted on a warrant since Saturday's shooting, authorities said. Gary Holmes, 33, of Little Rock, Arkansas, is accused of killing a 3-year-old boy. Provided by the Pulaski County Sheriff PIO via KARK Holmes' girlfriend told police that he got upset when another vehicle was following him too closely and he had pulled over to let it pass, according to an affidavit obtained by NBC affiliate KARK . Then, at a stop sign, the other car waited for a \"few minutes,\" and Holmes honked at it, the girlfriend said. Holmes got out and fired one shot from his gun into the other car, she added. When he returned to his vehicle, the girlfriend said, he had a message: \"That's what you get for following me around.\" She said they did not realize anyone was shot until the next day. The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office confirmed the capital murder charge against Holmes as well as two counts of terroristic acts stemming from the shooting. Another court date was set for Feb. 22.

The gunman was angry that King-Macon \"wasn't moving fast enough at a stop sign,\" Little Rock police Lt. Steve McClanahan said at the time. The shooting prompted the city of Little Rock and the FBI to offer $40,000 in reward money for information leading to the shooter. Play ",

Security Council has condemned Israel's construction of settlements, with Ambassador Samantha Power saying the project hurts Israel's security. In this photo from March, soldiers guard the Gush Etzion junction near a cluster of settlements in the West Bank. Mahmoud Illean/AP The U.N. Security Council has approved a resolution condemning construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, after the U.S. abstained from the vote rather than vetoing the resolution outright. In explaining the U.S. abstention, Ambassador Samantha Power said the move doesn't signal diminished U.S. support for Israel; she later added that the continued construction of settlements \"seriously undermines Israel's security.\" Power said, \"The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades.\" NPR's Michele Kelemen reports for our Newscast unit: \"A day after Egypt withdrew the resolution under pressure from Israel and President-elect Donald Trump, several other Security Council members brought the draft to a vote. Fourteen supported it; Power was the only one to abstain.\" Less than an hour after the vote, Trump tweeted , \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" At the start of Power's remarks explaining the U.S. position on the resolution, the ambassador read aloud a quote she said was from President Ronald Reagan, in 1982: \"The United States will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements during the transitional period. Indeed, the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel, more than any other action, could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks. Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel, and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated.\" Article continues after sponsorship Power said that in addition to condemning settlements, the resolution \"reflects the facts on the ground,\" condemns violence and terrorism and addresses \"counter-productive actions by the Palestinians\" while also calling on both sides to engage in peace talks. The U.S. abstention comes one day after President-elect Trump issued a statement calling on the U.S. to veto the resolution. \"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" Trump said. He added that the resolution \"puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\" The subject of fairness came up in Power's remarks, as well \u2014 as she said Israel has long been the victim of bias in the U.N. Power said: \"In reality, this vote, for us, was not straightforward, because of where it's taking place: at the United Nations. For the simple truth is that for as long as Israel has been a member of this institution, Israel has been treated differently from other nations at the United Nations. \"And not only in decades past, such as the infamous resolution that the General Assembly adopted in 1975 with the support of the majority of member states, officially determining that Zionism is a form of racism. But also in 2016, this year. One need only look at the 18 resolutions against Israel adopted during the General Assembly in September, or the 12 Israel-specific resolutions adopted this year in the [U.N.] human rights council \u2014 more than those focused on Syria; North Korea; Iran and South Sudan put together.\" Power stated that \"such unequal treatment not only hurts Israel; it undermines the legitimacy of the United Nations itself.\" ",

Dold was the newspaper's editorial page editor before being named editor in February of 2016. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy The 2,700 pages of emails Rahm Emanuel turned over from his personal accounts last week showed the mayor communicating with a wide range of Chicago power brokers, business leaders and media figures, including  Tribune Editor and Publisher Bruce Dold. The emails included a handful of messages exchanged between Emanuel and Dold, when Dold  was the newspaper's editorial page editor before being named editor in February. Some of the messages centered on the two setting up a time to have a phone conversation or to meet for lunch. Others, such as an exchange in June 2015, focused on Emanuel trying to air particular issues on the Tribune's editorial pages. On June 11, 2015, Emanuel wrote Dold to tell him his office would be sending along an op-ed he wrote on neighborhood public art. Dold responded, criticizing the  article that discussed the unveiling of a Yoko Ono sculpture and landscape garden in Jackson Park. \"This has the same problem that the last piece had. It reads more like a press release than an essay that will draw and keep readers,\" Dold wrote, before offering Emanuel suggested improvements. \"It is self-congratulatory. ... It is thematically unfocused. There could be a nice, focused piece here in which you announce some news and reflect on one of the great strengths of Chicago, its public art. \"It should start with Yoko Ono's first permanent public piece, pointing to the 606 and Riverwalk and other recent improvements,\" Dold continued. \"Elaborate why this is of such value to Chicago.\" ",

Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption A view of Deutsche Bank's corporate headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images In the last days of the Obama administration, the federal government has reached multibillion-dollar settlements with Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over their sale of toxic mortgage securities. President-elect Donald Trump owes Deutsche Bank hundreds of millions of dollars in loans . So that deal removes a potential conflict of interest \u2014 where a Trump Justice Department would have been negotiating the settlement. Deutsche Bank settled for $7.2 billion, while Credit Suisse agreed to pay $5.3 billion. The deals resolve U.S. investigations into the sale of toxic securities tied to mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis. Regulators have already struck similar deals with major U.S. banks. A third European bank, Barclays, resisted a settlement offer and is now being sued by the Justice Department. Goldman Sachs Will Pay $5 Billion For Misleading Investors On Mortgage Assets Most of these cases involved the banks' so-called securitization of home loans. That is \u2014 the banks would pool thousands of individual home loans and bundle them into a security, of which the bank could then sell shares to investors. The problem was that in many cases, the banks were telling investors and ratings agencies that these loans were much more likely to be repaid than they actually were. The time frame dates to the crazy days of the housing bubble, when lenders were making loans to homebuyers with no proof of income and the terms and interest rates on many of the mortgages made them impossible for homeowners to repay over time. It was this packaging of largely garbage loans \u2014 and telling investors they were safe and solid investments \u2014 that was at the heart of the financial crisis. Many investors suffered massive losses. Entire financial institutions collapsed or required government bailouts to survive. So in effect, these settlements are an effort to make the major banks involved pay a penalty for helping to crash the global financial system and for sending they U.S. economy into recession. Article continues after sponsorship Morgan Stanley Will Pay $3.2 Billion For Contributing To Mortgage Crisis The multibillion-dollar bank settlements at least sound like pretty stiff penalties. \"They're very substantial,\" says Harvard Law School professor Hal Scott. But he adds, \"In the case of Deutsche [Bank], at least we know it's roughly half of what the Justice Department was seeking initially.\" Scott says it's puzzling to him how these sums get arrived at. He's an expert on international financial systems. He says the Justice Department's methodology for the penalties in these mega-bank-settlements isn't public: \"We don't know exactly how they do that.\" \"If I were doing this I would start by trying to determine you know how much did people lose as a result of these activities,\" Scott says. \"That would be a starting point.\" So he says greater transparency into questions and calculations like that would give these settlements greater credibility.

    "text": "Secrets to Lasting Relationships From High School Sweethearts By JACLYN PEISER SEPT. 22, 2016 Growing up, and growing older, with their partners. Couples reveal how their love matured. Accidentally stepping on the back of his shoe, interrupting her during a class presentation, being set up in a parking lot at a youth group event. Adolescence is steeped in awkwardness and hormones. But there are couples who meet during that time of change and confusion who find \u2014 and stay in \u2014 love. The perception that a high school romance is likely to end when college or adulthood begins is not lost on these couples. We asked a few of them how they met the challenges of growing up while being in a relationship. They revealed their secrets and explained how their partnerships thrive today. Photo Mary Isenstein, 80, and Len Isenstein, 82, of Dallas How they met: \u201cWe met at a party and I was 12 and he was 14,\u201d Ms. Isenstein said. \u201cI got a call from a fellow that I know and he asked if I will go on a blind date with Lenny. So we went and that\u2019s it.\u201d When they married: July 1, 1957, at 20 and 23. Do you still show affection to each other? \u201cVery much so, even more so now than ever,\u201d Ms. Isenstein said. \u201cWhen the kids left, we just got closer.\u201d Mr. Isenstein added, \u201cAs the years go on, I loved her even more.\u201d Have your priorities in your relationship changed since you started dating? \u201cAs you progress, your priorities change because you become responsible for different things as the years go by,\u201d Ms. Isenstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about floating through life. You just got to understand each other and accept weaknesses even if they drive you crazy.\u201d Advice: \u201cShe does the talking, I do the listening,\u201d Mr. Isenstein said. His wife added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a similar interest. Marriage is a two-way street. You have to be in it together. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Photo Gina Desiderio Edmison, 36, and Joshua Edmison, 35, of Ellicott City, Md. How they met: Through mutual friends when Ms. Edmison was 17 and Mr. Edmison was 16. When they married: Aug. 6, 2005, at 25 and 24. Was it always easy? \u201cGoing through infertility was incredibly intense,\u201d Mr. Edmison said. His wife said: \u201cIt had long lasting effects. Feeling the struggle together \u2014 bringing us together and also feeling isolated from each other. We did go through a recovery period even after our first son was born. We had to talk through it; we argued, but had to get down to it.\u201d Advice: \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s hard,\u201d Mr. Edmison said of being married. \u201cPeople want or expect it to be easy. By hard, I mean really hard. There are dark times. There were weeks where we didn\u2019t talk or we were not connecting. But since we\u2019re both stubborn and goal-oriented people, we don\u2019t quit. It would be easy to quit. You need to work through the adversity.\u201d Photo Andi Farmer, 51, and Mark Farmer, 52, of Gainesville, Ga. When they met: In sixth grade but started dating in 10th grade. When they married: Aug. 30, 1986, at 21 and 22. Do you still show affection for each other? \u201cProbably too much,\u201d Ms. Farmer said. Referring to their two daughters, Mr. Farmer said, \u201cWe embarrass the girls.\u201d Advice: \u201cCommunication,\u201d Ms. Farmer said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say what\u2019s bothering you, it won\u2019t get better. You also can\u2019t just say what\u2019s bothering you and what\u2019s bad. You have to say what\u2019s good, too. You also have to make sure to pay attention to your relationship and not take the other person for granted.\u201d Photo Lindsey Grays and Alexander Grays, both 29, of Seattle How they met: \u201cWe met in 10th grade in world history class,\u201d Ms. Grays said. \u201cI was presenting and somehow Alex introduced himself to me during my presenting. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if we know each other but my name is Alex.\u2019 \u201d When they married: May 14, 2016, both at 28. Did you ever break up? \u201cWe did long distance in college but broke up,\u201d Ms. Grays said. \u201cWe were just both really young. I don\u2019t think either one of us were equipped in making those sacrifices and the kind of commitment it takes to keep those relationships. We didn\u2019t have the mental wherewithal to have separate activity and have a unity. That drew us apart.\u201d Mr. Grays said, referring to when they both had graduated: \u201cShe may have come home from college a week or two after I did and we just kind of took things slow. It didn\u2019t take long for us to get back together. Our friendship had grown and we were evolving as adults.\u201d How has growing up together helped your relationship? \u201cWe really had a special opportunity to see each other grow up and we grew together,\u201d Ms. Grays said. Her husband added: \u201cWe evolve every day and that improvement can make you be a better person. If you\u2019re the same person at 15 and 28, you\u2019re wasting your life.\u201d Advice: \u201cSay \u2018sorry\u2019 and mean it,\u201d Ms. Grays said. \u201cDo something nice.\u201d Photo Anna Popp and Daniel Popp, both 50, of Plano, Tex. How they met: \u201cWe met in a parking lot getting ready to go on a United Synagogue Youth event,\u201d Ms. Popp said. Mr. Popp said: \u201cA head of the youth group told me he met a young girl who went to the same high school that I did and she\u2019s new and I should talk to her. It was the best introduction I ever had.\u201d When they married: July 3, 1989, both at 22. How has growing up together helped your relationship? \u201cWe helped mold each other into more and more of what we wanted in a partner,\u201d Mr. Popp said. \u201cThat set the foundation for us to stick together the whole way. I was supportive of her and she supportive of me.\u201d Advice: \u201cIt\u2019s a partnership,\u201d Ms. Popp said. Mr. Popp added: \u201cWhen you really feel like you are in this together, it doesn\u2019t matter what obstacle comes your way. We always try to solve them together.\u201d Photo Shanti Yetish, 24, and Joshua Hunt, 25, of Manhattan How they met: On the wrestling team in junior year. (Yes, she wrestled, and was the only girl on the team for most of high school.) When they married: They were engaged in September 2015 and plan to wed in September 2017. Has it always been easy? \u201cI think the hardest times were when I started college,\u201d said Ms. Yetish, who attended Rutgers University while Mr. Hunt stayed home in Teaneck, N.J., to work and attend community college. \u201cThere were a lot of confusing things going on. On the one hand, Josh was being amazing and taking care of my mom, who was sick, and proving to be an important part of my life. On the other hand, I was surrounded by so many long-distance couples in college who were breaking up and Josh was also getting jealous sometimes. It was confusing. But I quickly realized that my relationship was different than other people\u2019s, and I really learned to appreciate ours. Josh is so genuine. There\u2019s something so real about him that I know I couldn\u2019t find in anybody else.\u201d How has growing up together helped your relationship? \u201cThe last seven years we grew together,\u201d Ms. Yetish said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the person I am without Josh. We had a large influence on each other\u2019s lives.\u201d Advice: \u201cPatience, and understanding where the other person is coming from,\u201d Ms. Yetish said. Mr. Hunt added, \u201cBe honest with each other.\u201d Photo Sara Hasson and Laurence Hasson, both 36, of the Bronx How they met: They were in the senior class play, \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Ms. Hasson was Wendy and Mr. Hasson was Tinker Bell. When they married: Aug. 14, 2003, both at 23 and on the night of a blackout in the Northeast. How has growing up together helped your relationship? \u201cI think as much as we\u2019ve changed since high school, fundamentally we are probably the same,\u201d Mr. Hasson said. \u201cWe still have the same professional and religious goals and family goals. I think we\u2019ve actually stayed fairly consistent with who we are.\u201d Do you still show affection for each other? \u201cSara craves more affection, and I think she takes it personally if that affection is not given as often as she would like,\u201d Mr. Hasson said. \u201cThe reality is it\u2019s not in my mind. I\u2019ve been dealing with a high stress job, three kids, dealing with the stress of a parent who is ill.\u201d Ms. Hasson responded: \u201cI think for me, it\u2019s just like the little things, remembering to say \u2018I love you,\u2019 a quick hug or kiss to make sure you don\u2019t fall into this pattern of then just becoming roommates. Having come from divorced parents, I\u2019m attuned to these things.\u201d Advice: \u201cSomeone gave me advice: Never go to bed angry,\u201d Mr. Hasson said. \u201cI think we really make an effort to try and hash things out when we\u2019re angry.\u201d Photo Paula Mantell, 66, and Michael Mantell, 67, of San Diego How they met: \u201cWe were at West Orange Mountain High School on our way to English class,\u201d Ms. Mantell said. \u201cI stepped on the back of his shoe, and he turned around. His angry face melted and he smiled. He turned around to his friends and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to marry that girl some day.\u2019\u201d When they married: Dec. 17, 1971, at 21 and 22. How have you maintained a long, sustaining partnership? \u201cWe solve problems together,\u201d Mr. Mantell said. \u201cIt\u2019s also having enormous trust and having an emotional connectional and passion. We still have a gratifying sex life. We don\u2019t have contempt and we never stonewall. We also don\u2019t get offensive with each other.\u201d Advice: \u201cAlways turn toward each other, and never ignore each other\u2019s emotional needs,\u201d Mr. Mantell said. More on NYTimes.com ",

The resolution was put forward at the 15-member council for a vote by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal a day after Egypt withdrew it under pressure from Israel and President-elect Donald Trump. The President-elect and the Israelis had called on the US to veto the measure. It was adopted with 14 votes in favor, to a round of applause. It is the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years. The lack of U.S. involvement in the vote represents a sharp break with tradition of protecting Israel from UN action. It was seen as a last-ditch attempt by the council to put the brakes on settlement building and get the Israelis and Palestinians talking again before Trump's inauguration. The President-elect has indicated he will not pressure Israel to participate in talks with the Palestinians. \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" Trump tweeted following the resolution's passage. As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ripped the resolution and said his country \"will not abide by its terms.\" \"At a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East,\" he said. Netanyahu, whose relationship with President Obama has long been strained, accused the White House of colluding with the UN \"behind the scenes.\" \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution,\" he said. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. \"acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution.\" \"That future is now in jeopardy, with terrorism, violence and incitement continuing and unprecedented steps to expand settlements being advanced by avowed opponents of the two state solution,\" he said. \"That is why we cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\" Kerry also reminded critics of the Obama Administration's \"unparalleled record of support for Israel's security, including the largest military assistance package in history.\" GOP lawmakers vehemently disagreed. Republican Sen. John McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the resolution \"ill-conceived.\" \"The abstention of the United States has made us complicit in this outrageous attack, and marks a troubling departure from our nation's long, bipartisan history of defending our ally Israel in the United Nations,\" he said in a statement. \"This resolution will serve as yet another roadblock to peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and embolden the enemies of Israel.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan called the move \"absolutely shameful.\" \"Today's vote is a blow to peace that sets a dangerous precedent for further diplomatic efforts to isolate and demonize Israel. Our unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel,\" he said. The bipartisan American Israel Public Affairs Committee said it too was \"deeply disturbed\" that the Obama Administration didn't veto the resolution. \"By adopting this resolution, the United Nations has once again served as an open forum to isolate and delegitimize Israel\u2014America's lone stable, democratic ally in the Middle East,\" the organization said. The Obama administration has been critical of Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. But U.S. officials said earlier this month that Obama wasn't expected to make any major overtures toward Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts before leaving office. Elizabeth Chuck ",

Daily News 5:17 p.m. EST December 23, 2016 x Share Actor alan Thicke's death certificate was released Wednesday, stating he died of a ruptured aorta. The cause of death was determined by a doctor, as no autopsy was performed on the actor, songwriter and talk show host. USA TODAY 'Growing Pains' star Alan Thicke died of a ruptured aorta, his death certificate stated Wednesday. (Photo: Richard Shotwell, Invision/AP) The medical condition that took the life of actor Alan Thicke is not common and accurate diagnosis often comes too late, medical experts say. The 69-year-old actor famed for his fatherly role in the popular 1980s sitcom \u201cGrowing Pains\u201d died from a ruptured aorta, the major artery that carries blood out of the heart to the brain and other organs, according to the death certificate obtained by the Associated Press earlier this week. The aortic rupture occurred about three hours after the actor developed a tear or dissection in the inner layer of the artery, according to the death certificate. The tear causes blood to flow between the layers of the artery which lead to a rupture, according to medical experts. Alan Thicke died from ruptured aorta An aorta tear requires immediate surgery and survival odds are good, yet delayed diagnosis often proves too late, said Dr. Edward Savage, cardiothoracic surgeon and director of the Heart & Vascular Center at Cleveland Clinic Florida near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cMost people assume it is a heart attack so sometimes the diagnosis is delayed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you have to have a high suspicion.\u201d Patients believe they are suffering a heart attack with pain in their chest, he said. But what\u2019s distinctive with a tear is that as blood leaks into the space between the layers of the ascending aorta, the pain will often move upward and can work its way along the spine, Savage said. Friends and fans react to Alan Thicke's unexpected death An aortic dissection can happen in anyone but causes can be an enlarged aorta, a pre-existing aneurysm or when someone suffers from an inherited connective tissue disorder known as Marfan syndrome. \u201cIt is possible (Thicke) had an aneurysm,\u201d said Dr. Brian Taschner, a cardiologist with Lee Health in Fort Myers, Florida and incoming board chairman of the American Heart Association in Southwest Florida.

Patients who suffer an aortic dissection may be exerting themselves in some way although it can occur at rest sitting on the couch, Savage, the Cleveland Clinic cardiothoracic surgeon, said. Other actors have suffered aortic dissections, notably John Ritter, who died in 2003 at the age of 54 and starred in the sitcom \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d Ritter was being treated for a heart attack in the hospital when he suffered an aortic rupture, Taschner said. Alan Thicke's wife speaks of 'wrenching sadness' The John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health was founded in October 2003 weeks after Ritter\u2019s death to improve awareness and help with medical research. American diplomat Richard Holbrooke, 69, died in 2010 after suffering an aortic dissection and undergoing 20 hours of emergency surgery. Aortic dissection occurs in about 2 of every 10,000 patients and can affect anyone, but it is most often seen in men between the ages of 40 to 70, according to the National Institutes of Health. Emergency surgery for aortic dissection is essential, where the treatment is the same as for someone with an aneurysm, a weakened or bulging area of the aorta wall, Savage said. \u201cYou are not replacing the whole tear, you are replacing the part prone to rupture,\u201d he said, adding that he sees four or five dissections a year. 5 life lessons from Alan Thicke If someone gets to the emergency room, a proper diagnosis of dissection and no other complications, like shock, most patients will survive with surgery. It\u2019s not possible to test for a dissection but a CAT scan can detect an enlarged aorta. Yet many people can suffer a dissection and they don\u2019t have an enlarged aorta. \u201cThe majority of people have a normal size aorta and not an enlarged aorta,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only indication to do a CAT scan is a history of aneurysms in the family.\u201d The John Ritter Foundation can be found at the\u00a0 johnritterfoundation.org . 6 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ioQTXp NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

    "text": "By John Wagner and Abby Phillip December 23 at 5:36 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @abbydphillip Donald Trump\u2019s sudden embrace this week of a nuclear arms race \u2014 and his staff\u2019s scramble to minimize the fallout \u2014 underscored an emerging modus operandi for the president-elect: governance by chaos. Since winning the election, Trump has seemed to revel in tossing firecrackers in all directions, often using Twitter to offer brief but provocative pronouncements on foreign and domestic policies alike \u2014 and leaving it to others to flesh out his true intentions. In the past week alone, Trump has publicly pitted two military contractors against each other, sowed confusion about the scope of his proposed ban on foreign Muslims, and needled China after its seizure of a U.S. underwater drone. But nothing has created more consternation for many foreign policy experts than Trump\u2019s assertion Thursday on Twitter that the country should \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand\u201d its nuclear capability. On Friday, after his staff had tried to temper his comments, Trump doubled down \u2014 telling a television talk-show host that in an arms race against any competitor, the United States would \u201coutmatch them at every pass.\u201d (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Trump has pledged to shake up both Washington and the world order, and boosters argue that a degree of unpredictability can be useful, particularly when it comes to foreign policy. But the mixed messages and erratic nature of his pronouncements have alarmed even some Republicans, who say it\u2019s important to know how seriously to take the leader of the free world. \u201cWe\u2019re just operating in this world where you cannot believe the things he says,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a foreign policy expert and former George W. Bush administration official at the State Department. \u201cIt will have large consequences for our allies and our adversaries, and it\u2019s going to greatly magnify the danger of miscalculation by all kinds of people.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s latest remarks stoke talk of a nuclear arms race ] Trump\u2019s team has struggled with the new resonance that becoming president-elect has given Trump\u2019s Twitter habit. They have repeatedly said that his statements on social media do not necessarily reflect his official policy and have at times sought to play down the import of his actions. But Trump supporters say the rest of Washington is going to have to get used to his more freewheeling style. \u201cPeople who expect the past are going to be shocked that there\u2019s a new way of doing things,\u201d said Barry Bennett, a Republican strategist who served as an adviser to Trump during the general-election campaign. \u201cThis is a glimpse of where he\u2019s headed, and in a way, it\u2019s highly transparent, but just not the way Washington has done business for the past 40 or 50 years.\u201d But others warn that Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill could have a hard time reading Trump and discerning his true priorities if he continues to operate as he has during the transition. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff \u2014 what comes out that he really wants and what\u2019s just said at the spur of the moment,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). \u201cIn the past, a president-elect doing something like this would have been unfathomable.\u201d The imbroglio over nuclear arms began Thursday with a tweet from Trump in which he said the United States \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d Trump made no mention of what spurred his thoughts, but the tweet followed an address by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin in which he said his country\u2019s nuclear stockpile needs fortifying. Trump\u2019s tweet seemed to signal a break with four decades of policy charted by presidents of both parties \u2014 and it sent his staff scrambling to explain his thinking. [ Trump continues to sow confusion over his plan for Muslims entering the country ] In a television interview Thursday night, Kellyanne Conway \u2014 named counselor to the president earlier in the day \u2014 played down its sweep. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying to change a policy through Twitter,\u201d Conway told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow. \u201cWhat he\u2019s merely saying is that he wants us to be ready to defend ourselves.\u201d Conway said Trump\u2019s tweet was not necessarily aimed at Russia but directed at \u201ca regime that would do us harm or a rogue nation.\u201d Trump was not backing down Friday morning, however. On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski relayed a conversation she had with Trump in which he reportedly said, \u201cLet it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.\u201d As they discussed Trump\u2019s nuclear vow, Brzezinski and host Joe Scarborough, a former congressman from Florida, were both dressed in pajamas as they sat in front of a fireplace on their final show before Christmas. Shortly after the segment aired, Sean Spicer, who was named Trump\u2019s White House press secretary on Thursday, suggested that Trump was describing a hypothetical situation and speaking about what would happen if other countries don\u2019t \u201ccome to their senses.\u201d \u201cIf another country wants to expand their nuclear capability, the U.S. is not going to sit back and idly by,\u201d Spicer said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cBut just to be clear: The president isn\u2019t saying we\u2019re going to do this. He said unless they come to their senses. It\u2019s a warning to them that this president\u2019s going to take action.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, chided Trump for being cavalier about a topic as sensitive as nuclear weapons. Taking to Twitter himself, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote Friday afternoon that \u201cCongress must not allow the Tweeter in Chief to unleash a dangerous and costly nuclear arms race.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) tweeted: \u201cDear Donald Trump. You\u2019re new to this so here\u2019s a list of things to tweet about instead of nuclear weapons. 1.) Literally anything.\u201d In an interview, Schiff said that in his view, \u201cthis just isn\u2019t a way to conduct business, certainly not as president or president-elect. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d [ Donald Trump is holding a government casting call: He\u2019s seeking \u2018the look\u2019 ] Doug Wilson, a former assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the Obama administration, said it remained unclear to him and many others in the national security establishment what Trump was trying to convey. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s talking about expanding the nuclear arsenal or he\u2019s mistaken that for modernizing the nuclear force,\u201d Wilson said. Wilson said that there can be foreign policy advantages to being unpredictable but that \u201cthere is a difference in being strategically unpredictable and foolishly unpredictable.\u201d He said it\u2019s too early to know in which camp to place Trump. On a range of other issues during the campaign and in recent weeks, Trump has made statements that his aides have immediately walked back or softened. In a brief appearance before reporters this week, Trump seemed to suggest that two of his most controversial campaign proposals \u2014 to ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States and to register those who are here \u2014 had been vindicated by recent terrorist attacks in Europe. Later, Conway insisted that a ban on Muslims was no longer Trump\u2019s plan. After meeting this week with the chief executives of two of the largest defense contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Trump announced on Twitter that he had asked Boeing to price out the cost of an F-18 fighter jet \u2014 which could replace the F-35 jet developed by Lockheed Martin due to cost overruns. The tweet sent Boeing\u2019s stock up and Lockheed Martin\u2019s stock plummeting \u2014 shaving about $1.2\u00a0billion off the company\u2019s value. Some conservatives praised Trump for using his platform to pursue cost savings for taxpayers. But on foreign affairs in particular, experts warned that Twitter is not the best venue to pursue new policy \u2014 even if the aim is disruption. Thomas Nichols, a U.S. Naval War College professor who is currently writing a book on U.S. nuclear policy, noted that Trump and his staff have now offered multiple explanations for what he meant in his nuclear weapons tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than not having one explanation,\u201d said Nichols, who said he was speaking in his personal capacity. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to change policy, then that requires a kind of steely consistency and a lot of disciplined messaging.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all spending a lot of time,\u201d he added, \u201ctrying to devise the future of America\u2019s nuclear policy out of 140 characters.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "After a Bloody Week Overseas, Feds Urge US Law Enforcement to Remain Vigilant By Mike Levine Dec 23, 2016, 3:38 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Friday Rewind: Attack in Berlin 0 Shares Email Federal authorities are urging authorities around the country \u201cto remain vigilant for indications of nefarious operational planning this holiday season\" after ISIS-affiliated groups have called for attacks on churches across America and elsewhere. In a joint intelligence bulletin issued today to federal, state and local law enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and National Counterterrorism Center say they want to \u201cremind security planners and first responders\u201d to be on guard. Italian Police Didn't Realize Man Was Berlin Terror Attack Suspect Before Shootout Just two days ago, members of a pro-ISIS group posted a link online to a list of U.S. churches, including their names and addresses. The group \u201caspirationally called on its supporters to attack them during the holiday season,\u201d noted today\u2019s bulletin, obtained by ABC News. \u201cWe assess this list may have been published to encourage attacks by homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) or as a means to intimidate or incite fear, but is likely not indicative of a specific, credible threat,\u201d the bulletin said. The bulletin emphasized, however, that while ISIS and its supporters have repeatedly released lists of potential targets online, including names of U.S. military members and government workers, \u201cthe release of these lists have rarely inspired HVEs to conduct plotting \u2014 none of which resulted in a successful attack.\u201d Nevertheless, the bulletin said authorities believe \u201cHVEs pose the most likely near-term threat to the homeland, probably by conducting small-scale and opportunistic attacks against civilian targets using small arms or weapons of opportunity, such as knives or vehicles.\u201d The bulletin comes just two days after a Tunisian man plowed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring dozens more. The incident launched a global manhunt for 24-year-old Anis Amri, who was killed earlier today in Italy after a shootout with police. In a video released over social media and apparently recorded before Monday\u2019s attack, Amri pledged his allegiance to ISIS, saying he was avenging the bombing of Muslims. He urged others to launch their own attacks. Early last week, a man launched a suicide attack on a Coptic Orthodox Church in Cairo, Egypt, and just yesterday Australian authorities announced they had foiled a \u201cmulti-tactic plot in Melbourne, Australia, planned for Christmas Day against St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and other prominent locations,\u201d according to today\u2019s bulletin from U.S. authorities. Such incidents \u201cunderscore the need for heightened vigilance through the holiday season,\u201d the bulletin added. In addition to targeting churches, the ISIS-affiliated group\u2019s posting earlier this week called for \u201caspirational attacks\u201d on hotels, coffee shops, streets, markets, and other public places in the United States, Canada, France, and the Netherlands, according to the bulletin, which was first reported by CNN. 0 Shares ",

It\u2019s a great part.\u201d That said, he isn\u2019t shy about where he stands. \u201cI don\u2019t hate him. I want him to enjoy his life. I just want him to not be the president of the United States \u2014 as quickly as possible.\u201d As a satirical version of Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin now deals with an unexpected dilemma, for him, anyway: Is his portrayal making the new president more human, and thus, more sympathetic? Ms. Nir asked him about that, too. That\u2019s the fake Mr. Trump. The real Mr. Trump had a busy and consequential week, grappling with fast-moving global affairs in Germany , Turkey, Russia and Syria that are challenging a presidency focused on domestic economic revival. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What did we learn about his interest and influence over international events? I put that question to the White House reporters Maggie Haberman and Mark Landler. President-elects almost always remain silent on foreign policy until their inauguration, to avoid confusing the world about who, exactly, is commander in chief. On this, Mr. Landler and Ms. Haberman agree: Mr. Trump, and his very active Twitter account, have no interest in abiding by that practice. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t subscribe to the old idea that the country has one president at a time,\u201d Mr. Landler says. Ms. Haberman questions how much we can deduce about his policy once in office from his current behavior. \u201cWhen it is not Trump triangulating against Obama and Trump actually having to be the only president, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see in terms of foreign policy. It\u2019s a little easier for him to do this right now.\u201d How do I listen? Two ways From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.

Paladino, an elected city school board member, took part in a survey by the Artvoice weekly newspaper in which Buffalo residents were asked what they wished for in 2017. In answering what he'd like to happen most next year, the former New York GOP gubernatorial candidate replied: Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to [senior White House advisor] Valerie [Jarrett], who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her. And when asked what he would most like to see go in 2017, he responded: Michelle Obama. I'd like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. Buffalo School Board President Barbara Seals Nevergold said Paladino is known for his controversial rhetoric. \"What was surprising though were the direct attacks on the president and the first lady in such demeaning ways, in such tone that many have described as racist and as sexist,\" Nevergold told reporters, \"and so those are the comments I am most concerned about because of the messages they send to our children.\" Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said in a statement that Paladino must resign. Carl Paladino, former New York gubernatorial candidate, speaks to reporters in the lobby at Trump Tower on Dec. 5, 2016 in New York City. Drew Angerer / Getty Images \"While the First Amendment of our Constitution protects the right of free speech, no matter how deplorable it may be, there can be no room in our civil discourse for such hate and anger,\" said Poloncarz, a Democrat. \"These comments harken back to the darkest days of racism in our nation's history. Anyone who has these beliefs is unfit to hold public office and especially unfit to oversee the education of children.\" But in a lengthy response sent to the media on Friday, Paladino said his comments have \"nothing to do with race.\" Related: Nonprofit Head Who Wrote Racist Michelle Obama Post to Return to Job \"It's about 2 progressive elitist ingrates who have hated their country so badly and destroyed its fabric in so many respects in 8 years,\" he wrote. He added that the president was \"demeaning and weakening\" the U.S. military and sniped at him for being a \"yellow-bellied coward who left thousands to die in Syria and especially Aleppo.\" He also said Michelle Obama \"hated America before her husband won.\" Play ",

    "text": "Open records experts see loopholes in Emanuel's email lawsuit settlement Rahm Emanuel Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune Two Freedom of Information Act experts noted that because Mayor Rahm Emanuel settled the case with the Better Government Association, there was no legal determination that he violated state open records law. Two Freedom of Information Act experts noted that because Mayor Rahm Emanuel settled the case with the Better Government Association, there was no legal determination that he violated state open records law. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy A day after striking a deal to release 2,700 pages of emails involving public business he conducted on his personal accounts, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he \"wasn't perfect\" when it came to transparency but had resolved a lawsuit with a \"landmark\" agreement. A review of the mayor's settlement of a suit brought by a government watchdog group, however, shows that it contains loopholes that open records experts said could allow Emanuel to avoid turning over all the public records that the law requires. A double layer of Emanuel's lawyers \u2014 not a judge \u2014 decided which emails the public got to see and which ones remain secret. In doing so, the mayor's attorneys set up the rules to determine which emails were related to public business and would be released. In turn, the lawyers applied those definitions to a universe of emails that was substantially smaller than what the Better Government Association sought in its lawsuit, in large part because many of the emails no longer existed. Left unsaid by Emanuel's legal team when it turned over the documents was that emails sent to the mayor's personal accounts were deleted after 90 days. That meant the only emails released were either preserved after the lawsuit was filed last year or could be tracked down via email accounts of City Hall staffers. Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... In April 2014, investment banker Byron Trott sent an email to Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... (Rick Pearson, David Heinzmann and Jeff Coen) Beyond that, Emanuel and his attorneys maintained in the settlement that government-related emails on his personal accounts were not public records, despite Illinois law holding that government business conducted via email by a public official is subject to open records requirements. The mayor's position could allow him to continue to use his private email to conduct government business, experts who reviewed the settlement told the Chicago Tribune. \"The settlement says they disagree, that they don't think they're subject to the public records law,\" said David Cuillier, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Arizona who focuses on freedom of information issues. \"Really, that's sad and unconscionable. They are basically going to put in writing that they don't agree with the law or the principles of accountability to the public. ... They think it's OK to sneak around the public's eyes.\" Uncharted water? While Emanuel has put the BGA suit behind him, the mayor still faces a Tribune lawsuit alleging that Emanuel violated the state's open records laws by refusing to release communications about city business conducted through emails and text messages on personal devices. That ongoing suit is based on an open records request that sought electronic communications related to subjects that include the city's scandal-plagued red light camera program, as well as email and text correspondence between Emanuel and Michael Sacks, the mayor's close confidant and top campaign contributor. The Tribune sued a month before the watchdog group brought its case against Emanuel in October 2015 over a blanket open records request that sought all official emails the mayor sent from a nongovernment account. The mayor's Wednesday settlement with the BGA was announced 12 days after the Tribune won a round in its lawsuit. On Dec. 9, Cook County Judge Kathleen Pantle ordered Emanuel to produce an index of certain emails and text messages the mayor sent and received on personal devices, giving him until Jan. 27 to comply. The Tribune continues to seek those records in court. Read the story On Thursday, Emanuel discussed the settlement and repeated four times that he had been navigating \"uncharted waters\" when it came to determining whether he was allowed to conduct government business on personal email accounts. \"I think we finally, while there was a disconnect, synced up technology and transparency and have an agreement that kind of sheds a light going forward and sets a principle that not only applies to me, but all the city employees and gives people that information they need,\" the mayor said. Emanuel was asked what was so unprecedented about the notion of not sending government messages on private accounts, given that email has been commonplace for two decades and that he has spent nearly his entire career working in government, including as a congressman and as a White House senior aide in the administrations of two presidents. \"An overwhelming amount of the emails are people coming to me. I would be taking a stab, but 3 out of 4 are people just coming to me,\" Emanuel replied. \"They emailed me, and I forward it. Second, where I initiated it, I wasn't perfect. Now, you have a policy going forward, and that's it.\" The mayor also said \"sunshine was a good thing,\" but he worried about public officials becoming \"insular.\" \"It is good to have that public policy,\" he said. \"Know, though, it doesn't come, potentially, cost-free. It may actually deal with limiting people who want to talk to people in public life.\" Asked why some aldermen knew to email him on his private accounts rather than his official government email, the mayor responded, \"I'm not speaking for them.\" Emanuel also was asked how some of the city's top power brokers knew to reach him at the rahmemail.com address. \"People communicated,\" Emanuel replied without elaborating. Rahm Emanuel turned over from his personal accounts last week showed the mayor communicating with a wide range of Chicago power brokers, business leaders and media figures, including Tribune Editor and Publisher Bruce Dold. The emails included a handful of messages exchanged... The 2,700 pages of emails Rahm Emanuel turned over from his personal accounts last week showed the mayor communicating with a wide range of Chicago power brokers, business leaders and media figures, including Tribune Editor and Publisher Bruce Dold. The emails included a handful of messages exchanged... (Bill Ruthhart) Cuillier said he didn't buy the uncharted waters defense. \"He should have known better,\" Cuillier added. \"I don't think he's a dummy. I assume he and his staff are aware of the right thing to do and the law, so it surprises me they would do something so flagrantly wrong.\" A pair of Freedom of Information Act experts noted that because the BGA case was settled, there was no legal determination that Emanuel violated state open records law. Both experts contended that Emanuel's violation of the law was clear based on other rulings in similar cases around the nation. \"It would have been ideal to have a strong court ruling that clearly said he was in the wrong,\" said Cuillier, who added that it would have been better if a judge had reviewed all of Emanuel's emails and determined which ones were required to be made public. \"That didn't happen in this case, so for all we know there were important communications that the public will never see that they should see.\" Maryam Judar, executive director of the Elmhurst-based Citizen Advocacy Center that has long focused on government transparency issues, said similar lawsuits litigated across the country show that the BGA lawsuit was \"a losing case for Rahm Emanuel.\" Getting a court order would have made that clear, she said. \"They are not saying from now on that all emails pertaining to business, even if on a personal email account, should be produced pursuant to a FOIA request,\" Judar said, referring to the settlement. \"It's not a total victory.\" \"Basically, in the future, if someone wants to FOIA Rahm Emanuel's email, he could deny them all over again,\" she added, \"and they could go through this whole process all over again, because it isn't a court order.\" Deleted emails But Don Craven, a Springfield-based media attorney who has brought similar cases downstate, said there's no guarantee that a judge reviewing the emails would have come to a different determination as to which ones were public. \"In this case, the good news is even by means of the settlement, there is some indication, there is some recognition that the mayor's emails even on private accounts, private devices, are subject to FOIA, and that's a big step,\" Craven said. \"As a practical matter, this will serve to help establish that point.\" The mayor's use of the personal accounts first publicly surfaced among thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta posted by WikiLeaks this fall. A subsequent search for the mayor's email domain in 30,000 emails released by the State Department showed Emanuel used the same account to communicate with Clinton, including a 2012 email inviting her to appear at a public event with him in Chicago.

    "text": "Trump's comments on nuclear weapons rattle U.S. officials and foreign leaders Donald Trump Donald Trump speaks in October in Washington. Donald Trump speaks in October in Washington. (Tribune News Service) Tracy Wilkinson and Ralph Vartabedian Contact Reporters Donald Trump shook up long-standing international security norms Friday by reportedly suggesting a renewed arms race, a day after he tweeted that the United States should \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand\u201d its nuclear weapons capability. Trump\u2019s meaning was sufficiently cryptic, perhaps deliberately so, that\u00a0disarmament experts, foreign leaders and U.S. officials were left off balance \u2014 and unsure if he plans to upend U.S. policy on nuclear arms after he enters the White House in 28 days. Since his election, Trump has rocked the foreign policy establishment by praising Russian President Vladimir Putin , and by speaking to the president of Taiwan and questioning the \u201cOne China\u201d policy that only recognizes Beijing. He also has challenged long-standing policy toward Israel, saying he will move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, a disputed city, and naming an ambassador who supports Israeli settlements likely to block any resumption of the peace process. But speaking recklessly about nuclear proliferation poses high risks in an unstable world, especially if it signals a possible end to decades of efforts and accords aimed at reducing the size and number of nuclear weapons. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to shrug off Trump\u2019s tweet as \u201cnothing new,\u201d telling a news conference in Moscow that he would welcome a Trump invitation to visit the U.S. David G. Savage Donald Trump is moving\u00a0into a White House that has seen presidential powers\u00a0markedly expanded by its previous two occupants. George W. Bush used his power as commander-in-chief to wage a global war on terror, including by imprisoning foreign combatants at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\u00a0 Barack Obama ,... Donald Trump is moving\u00a0into a White House that has seen presidential powers\u00a0markedly expanded by its previous two occupants. George W. Bush used his power as commander-in-chief to wage a global war on terror, including by imprisoning foreign combatants at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\u00a0 Barack Obama ,... (David G. Savage) China appeared more concerned. A foreign ministry spokesman said Beijing was \u201cclosely watching\u201d the incoming administration\u2019s nuclear policies, adding that the \u201ccountry with the largest nuclear arsenal should assume a special and prior responsibility on nuclear disarmament.\u201d The numbers fluctuate, but Russia currently has about 400 more warheads, while the United States has 170 more delivery systems, according to the State Department Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. Under the New START Treaty , both countries will deploy no more than 1,550 strategic weapons by February 2018. Whatever his intention, Trump\u2019s comments mark a severe shift in the tone and substance that Republican and Democratic presidents have used in the past when discussing nuclear weapons. \u201cIt is a significant departure from what we have heard in the past,\u201d said Hans Kristensen, \u00a0a nuclear weapons expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a nonpartisan group that seeks to reduce the spread and power of nuclear weapons. \u201cNone of them came out in this brazen way,\u201d he added. \u201cThat means countries around the world are trying to figure out what is going on. Is it a madman or a new policy that they have to deal with? It creates uncertainty and suspicion both among allies and adversaries.\u201d The flap began Thursday after Putin was reported telling a defense ministry meeting in Moscow that Russia needs \u201cto strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces.\u201d Apparently in response, Trump tweeted that \u201cthe U.S. must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d The back-and-forth raised concerns that the two countries, which control 95% of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons, might be resuming the destabilizing arms race that defined much of the Cold War. On Friday, Trump acknowledged those fears in an off-camera\u00a0 conversation with the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d talk show, which he reportedly watches regularly. Mika Brzezinski, dressed in festive pajamas before a roaring fire, quoted Trump as saying: \u201cLet it be an arms race because we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.\u201d She didn\u2019t say if Trump meant it as a joke or a threat. But as has become increasingly common, Trump\u2019s aides rushed out statements trying to clarify what he meant, or at least may have meant.\u00a0 In this case, they argued that Trump wasn\u2019t calling for a new arms race, saying he wants to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a policy that President Obama has pursued. Those claims didn\u2019t mollify disarmament experts in Washington. ",

Hillary Clinton Jewel Samad / AFP/Getty Images Hillary Clinton conceded to Donald Trump on Nov. 9 in New York City. Hillary Clinton conceded to Donald Trump on Nov. 9 in New York City. (Jewel Samad / AFP/Getty Images) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter The first woman president was supposed to make history by accumulating such deep experience that few could deny her ability to serve as commander in chief. Hillary Clinton did that, and lost. Now women politicians and those working to elect them \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 are sifting through her defeat to understand what her loss means for future women candidates and to\u00a0find a future path. Their effort is complicated by the very things that made Clinton\u2019s nomination both inevitable and troubled:\u00a0her singular standing and unique negatives. While the number of women elected to office has grown markedly over the decades, polling shows that in a race for the White House they\u00a0still must demonstrate they are capable of commanding the government and in particular the U.S. military, a masculine institution\u00a0despite its own gender strides. That inevitably conflicts\u00a0with another voter demand: for a fresh face \u2014 like that, say, of President Obama, who defeated Clinton in the Democratic primaries in 2008 in part because he appealed to voters\u2019 desire for change. \u201cYou can\u2019t get those qualifications, get that r\u00e9sum\u00e9, while also being able to present yourself as a change candidate,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden and a scholar at Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women and Politics. \u201cMen aren\u2019t held to the same standard of proving their credentials.\u201d Hillary Clinton \u2019s eyes peer over the deep-discount orange sticker declaring 50% off. Her face revolves on a two-sided key chain. On a row of shot glasses, she smiles from inside the circle of a presidential seal. While the real Hillary was\u00a0surprising unsuspecting hikers in the woods of New York,... Hillary Clinton \u2019s eyes peer over the deep-discount orange sticker declaring 50% off. Her face revolves on a two-sided key chain. On a row of shot glasses, she smiles from inside the circle of a presidential seal. While the real Hillary was\u00a0surprising unsuspecting hikers in the woods of New York,... (Nigel Duara) Clinton\u2019s experience won her plaudits from voters who throughout the campaign saw her as best prepared to assume the presidency. That may have helped her win the popular vote, but she lost the electoral college to a man who had never before run for elective office or served in government. Most damaging, she was unable to fully benefit from the advantages that usually flow to a woman candidate \u2014 being seen by voters as more\u00a0honest, trustworthy and both a unifier and the one who most cares about constituents\u2019 concerns. That has left a puzzle: How much of the loss reflected Clinton\u2019s particular vulnerabilities, how much involved opposition that any future woman candidate may face? Unquestionably, Clinton faced unique problems: Her decision as secretary of State\u00a0to use a private email server, which led to extended controversies; media coverage of separate\u00a0Democratic emails now believed to have been hacked by Russian operatives; and a relentless line of assault casting her as corrupt, first by primary challenger Bernie Sanders and later by Trump. She also faced a unique opponent, Donald Trump, whose image of swashbuckling masculinity shaped the campaign more than any of Clinton\u2019s milder efforts to use gender to her advantage. Clinton\u2019s supporters have been left counting smaller victories, like the fact that she won more votes than any candidate ever, apart from President Obama. They are also casting Clinton\u2019s reach for history as part of a decades-long\u00a0effort that, by definition, includes stumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle, it\u2019s always been a struggle \u2014 that\u2019s the nature of the fight for equality,\u201d said Sen.\u00a0Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat\u00a0who was elected in 1992, a year when the number of women senators tripled. \u201cThe fact that we got to have first woman nominee of a major party is an enormous breakthrough, and we\u2019ll build on that,\u201d she said. But others suggest that this year\u2019s campaign portends trouble for whichever women come next. At a recent panel discussion at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, which\u00a0included representatives from both campaigns, Trump\u2019s manager, Kellyanne Conway, argued that the country was ready to elect a woman president \u2014 just not this particular woman in a year in which voters demanded change. \u201cOn gender, it wasn\u2019t a hypothetical,\u201d she said of voters\u2019 options. \u201cIt was Hillary. So it\u2019s not just a woman; it\u2019s one that people had lived with for quite a while.\u201d That drew a pained response from Clinton\u2019s media strategist, Mandy Grunwald, who suggested that Clinton had rare standing to be seen as a potential commander in chief, given her tenure as secretary of State, U.S. senator from New York and as a first lady deeply involved in policy matters. \u201cYou may think\u00a0the country is ready for a woman, any old woman, just a different one. There are very few people who will ever meet that test,\u201d Grunwald said, adding:\u00a0\u201cI hope I am wrong.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign was a real-world test that shined a\u00a0bright light at some of the downsides of women\u2019s candidacies. The degree of\u00a0punishment she took from voters concerned about perceived ethical lapses was one of those. Throughout the campaign, prompted by broadsides from Sanders and Trump, voters were sharply critical of Clinton when it came to honesty and truthfulness. The virulence of their\u00a0sentiments suggested that women, usually held in high regard on those fronts, suffer more than male candidates when seen as not meeting that standard. For women candidates, \u201cthat fall from the pedestal may be longer and harder,\u201d said Dittmar. Clinton\u2019s perceived ethical difficulties, she noted, took more of a toll than Trump\u2019s arguably larger constellation of problems, which included repetitive falsehoods, wrongdoing by his foundation, tax issues and the fraud case leveled against Trump University. \u201cOne reason could be that we expected it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect that men have those issues.\u201d And while Clinton benefited to some extent from the prospect of being an historic first, Trump successfully made gender arguments\u00a0of his own. He made gender-based gibes at Clinton throughout his campaign, much as he had sought to diminish his primary opponents by mocking their height or lack of combativeness or, in the case of Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, her looks. He talked tough, invoking the specter of violence, repeatedly and on a range of issues. His official health report listed his testosterone level, an atypical disclosure that stood out given the lack of detail he released on other health questions. His campaign did nothing to push back against vulgar references to women on T-shirts and campaign buttons at his events. Whatever the motive for that style, it appealed to concerns that many voters still have\u00a0about a woman commander in chief and women\u2019s role in society. An April poll by PRRI/The Atlantic asked whether Americans felt society \u201chas become too soft and feminine.\u201d Two in five voters said that it had; among Trump supporters, 68% said so. For more on politics \u00bb In response to another question, two in five voters said that society was better off when men and women hewed to traditional gender roles. In October \u2014 the height of the controversy over Trump\u2019s treatment of women \u2014\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b another PRRI/The Atlantic poll showed 56% of Americans believed society \u201cseems to punish men just for acting like men.\u201d Sentiments like that serve as a negative starting point for the next high-level candidacies by women. Women currently hold 1/5th of the seats in the Senate and the House, as well as six governorships, positions that serve as one form of entree to a White House bid. Women hold prominent positions in business, which Trump demonstrated can be a launching pad. Ironically, Trump himself may go a long way in clarifying\u00a0the future path for women candidates. A successful Trump presidency could enhance the odds for a woman candidate with a business or military background. A failed Trump presidency could reinforce the desire\u00a0for someone with more political or governmental experience, more empathy or the reams of policy proposals that gained Clinton little traction. Key for the next round of women presidential candidates will be finding the balance that eluded Clinton, between experience and freshness, between empathy and toughness. They will have one benefit: They will not have been a symbol of cultural tumult, as Clinton and her generation of\u00a0women candidates have been, perhaps giving them more latitude to navigate\u00a0the nation\u2019s views. \u201cAs a baby boomer, she was a generationally challenging figure, certainly as the first first lady that had a career,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director, said at the Harvard panel. \u201cShe didn\u2019t stay home and bake cookies. She broke a lot of rules. \u201cShe\u2019s been an uncomfortable presence for a long time.\u201d The next generation may also benefit from the shock value of Clinton\u2019s loss. Women\u2019s groups report increased interest by younger women in political activism, a direct outgrowth of the November defeat. Boxer, who will leave her Senate post in January, called such reports \u201cheartening.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic looking forward,\u201d she said.

Credit Nancie Battaglia for The New York Times Near the Candy Cane Express train, Carrie McDonald, 41, who lives in Harveys Lake, Pa., and her sister, Erin Richburg, 37, who lives in Philadelphia, watched their children flap arms and legs into snow angels. \u201cWe came up in 1984 with our grandparents and have really vivid memories,\u201d Ms. McDonald said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it a tradition to come back. Right now we\u2019re choosing this over Disney.\u201d Ms. Richburg added, \u201cIt\u2019s old-fashioned and simple. It\u2019s all about Santa.\u201d Standing by the park\u2019s outdoor amphitheater, where Mary and Joseph trudge to the manger, Corinne Curtis, her husband, Dave, and their children, Jack, Deacon, Kainen and Londyn, who range in age from 8 years old to 16 months, were back for a second year, visiting from their home in Binghamton, N.Y. \u201cThe old-school feeling is what appeals to us,\u201d Ms. Curtis said. And Santa, of course. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweet Santa,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cHe takes the time with them. It\u2019s not like other commercial places.\u201d But in the 21st century, a nice St. Nick might not be enough to sustain a theme park in a remote part of the state. Santa\u2019s Workshop\u2019s inaccessibility \u2014 far from metropolitan areas, including five hours from New York City along twisty mountain roads \u2014 is \u201cpart of the mystique of the place,\u201d Mr. Waterbury said. But it has also contributed to its decline. In 1967, the final stretch of Interstate 87 \u2014 through the eastern Adirondacks \u2014 was completed, punching a direct route from New York City to Montreal. It bypassed communities with mom-and-pop motels and cabin colonies as well as diners and attractions that had flourished in the years after World War II . In the 1940s, when three businessmen, Julian Reiss, Harold Fortune and Arto Monaco, came up with idea of a destination where it was always Christmas, they hadn\u2019t anticipated 90-mile-per-hour roller coasters or parks built around Walt Disney\u2019s characters. (In fact, before Disneyland opened in Anaheim, Calif., in 1955, Walt Disney visited Santa\u2019s Workshop for inspiration and to consult with Mr. Monaco, according to Mr. Waterbury.) Photo Visiting with Santa. Attendance at the park has dropped steadily since the 1970s, and the owner says it is a \u201cchallenge to keep the door open.\u201d Credit Nancie Battaglia for The New York Times The recession of 2008 pummeled the Adirondack travel industry. The unpredictability of the weather has also presented challenges, including Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, which damaged the park. Attendance has dropped steadily since the 1970s, and now the park attracts no more than about 1,000 people on most days \u2014 a far cry from the over 14,000 customers who would show up in the 1950s.

In the 1950s \u201ca 13-year-old might still believe in Santa Claus,\u201d Mr. Waterbury said. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual today that a kid over 7 or 8 still believes. There\u2019s an urgency to get families to bring their kids here before they grow away.\u201d In the lobby of the Jack Jingle puppet theater, where juice glasses, coasters and other memorabilia are displayed, Danielle and Paul Raimondi, from Center Moriches, N.Y., showed their daughters, Isabel, 13, and Sophia, 10, sacks spilling over with 60 years\u2019 worth of letters addressed to Santa Claus. After the girls wandered away, Ms. Raimondi whispered, \u201cA lot of people in our 10-year-old\u2019s school were talking about not believing, and we wanted to show her that he still does exist.\u201d Mr. Waterbury, whose company, Empire Attractions, buys troubled assets, joined Bob Reiss, a son of Julian Reiss, as a co-owner in 2004. A decade later he bought out Mr. Reiss after earning his trust that he was committed to keeping the park\u2019s spirit alive. Mr. Waterbury said he felt an obligation to loyal Santa fans, the community and the park\u2019s history. Mr. Waterbury recently hired a new general manager, John Collins, who has many years of experience in the theme park industry. They\u2019re trying to figure out ways to bolster summertime attendance, the workshop\u2019s most dismal season. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let it go,\u201d said Mr. Waterbury. \u201cThere are enough bad things. This place is about what\u2019s good in life.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 24, 2016, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: A Struggling Theme Park Asks: Do You Still Believe in Santa?.

    "text": "Those with an overactive bladder usually must urinate eight or more times a day, often awakening two or more times a night to use the bathroom. Advertisement Continue reading the main story (Still others are plagued with stress incontinence ; they leak urine involuntarily when they cough, sneeze, laugh or exert themselves physically.) Of course, women are not the only ones with life-disrupting urinary concerns. Men are susceptible to many of the same conditions that increase a woman\u2019s risk of bladder problems, and older men who develop an enlarged prostate (60 percent of men in their 60s, rising to 90 percent by age 80) are especially at risk of urinary urgency and incontinence. The National Overactive Bladder Evaluation , a study that assessed the prevalence of this problem in the United States among 5,204 representative adults, found in 2003 that it caused incontinence in 16 percent of men and 16.9 percent of women. As disturbing as the symptoms of overactive bladder and urinary incontinence can be, Dr. Ekene Enemchukwu, a urologist at Stanford University Medical Center, told me that, on average, men wait four years and women wait six and a half years before consulting a doctor about difficulties in getting to the bathroom in time. Although the problem is more common among older adults, experts like Dr. Enemchukwu say it is not a normal part of aging. Rather, conditions that tend to develop later in life, including arthritis , dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and medications taken for disorders like high blood pressure , can make it more difficult to control the urge to urinate. Under normal circumstances, as the bladder fills, nerve signals sent to the brain gradually alert you to the need to urinate and typically give you enough time to find an appropriate facility before bladder muscles contract to release stored urine. How do you become a more successful sleeper? Grab a pillow, curl up and keep reading to find out. Sometimes, however, a person\u2019s bladder muscles start to contract involuntarily and create an urgent need to urinate. This can happen even when the bladder is not full, for example, when the bladder is irritated by excessive consumption of caffeine or alcohol or compressed by stored stool when a person is constipated. In men, the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder, passes through the doughnut-shaped prostate gland and can be squeezed when the gland enlarges. This can cause the wall of the bladder to thicken, making it overactive, or decrease the efficiency of contractions, keeping it from emptying completely and causing more frequent urges to urinate, Dr. Enemchukwu said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In women, pelvic organ prolapse may prevent complete bladder emptying when muscles that hold the bladder in place are weakened by childbirth or surgery. Even when an underlying disorder is not present, the risk of developing an overactive bladder increases with age for reasons medical science has yet to determine, the doctor said. However, she added, just because you\u2019re getting older or your mother had the same problem doesn\u2019t mean you have to put up with it. There is a host of remedies that diminish the risk and often eliminate it entirely. The American Urological Association says effective treatment should start with a thorough evaluation to help pinpoint the exact nature of the problem and factors that contribute to it. Before consulting a doctor, the Mayo Clinic recommends keeping a bladder diary for a few days, \u201crecording when, how much and what kinds of fluids you consume, when you urinate, whether you feel an urge to urinate, and whether you experience incontinence.\u201d Also, make a list of the medications and supplements you take and be prepared to relate any and all underlying medical conditions, like diabetes , and prior pelvic surgeries. Possible tests include measuring the amount and speed of voiding and pressure in and around the bladder as it fills. If the doctor suspects incomplete emptying of the bladder, an ultrasound scan may be done to measure residual urine after you void. Whatever the cause, it is best to start with behavioral remedies, experts say. Strengthening pelvic floor muscles by regularly doing Kegel exercises, which may benefit both women and men , can reduce involuntary contraction of bladder muscles, though it can take up to two months to notice the benefit. If you are obese and have stress incontinence, losing weight may eliminate this problem. When, what and how much you drink is of major importance. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and artificial sweeteners, which can be bladder irritants. Consume most fluids earlier in the day, drinking little in the evening to reduce nighttime voiding needs. If incomplete bladder emptying may be a cause, try voiding twice: Wait a few minutes after urinating, then try again to empty your bladder. Many find it helpful to void on a schedule rather than wait for an irrepressible urge. For example, you might urinate every two to four hours at the same times each day. You might also try to gradually extend the time between voidings to increase your bladder\u2019s capacity and ability to control an urge. There are also more than half a dozen medications that help to reduce urge incontinence. As with all drugs, they can have side effects, most commonly dry eyes and mouth and constipation .

He introduces himself simply as Padre Jos\u00e9 to the children at a local Catholic school. He showers and shaves at the Community Healthplex gym like any other member, and calls his workout buddies his Band of Brothers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In short, he is just the kind of leader Pope Francis is elevating to realign the church in the United States with his priorities. As the pope has made clear over the past three years, fancy lifestyles, formality and regal titles like Prince of the Church are out of style for cardinals. So is an emphasis on the divisive issues of abortion and same-sex marriage , even though the church\u2019s underlying position on those issues has not changed. Instead, in the pope\u2019s view, the church should emphasize humility and service to the poor. It should be multicultural, welcoming different styles of worship. It should reach out to other faiths and stand up for immigrants, refugees and nuns. Photo Cardinal Tobin\u2019s post as archbishop of Indianapolis came with a driver, but he drives himself. Credit A J Mast for The New York Times And that, church experts and members of his flock say, is a close description of the priorities of Cardinal Tobin, who will be heading east just after Christmas to lead the approximately 1.5 million Catholics in the Archdiocese of Newark. He is replacing Archbishop John J. Myers, 75, who preferred to be addressed by the formal title Your Grace, and who achieved notoriety when the church spent some $500,000 to outfit the house he will retire to with an indoor exercise pool and an elevator. Cardinal Tobin\u2019s appointment in October as one of the nation\u2019s 18 cardinals came as a surprise to many, including the man himself. But perhaps it should not have. For what his unassuming bearing does not reveal is that he is no stranger to the corridors of power in the church. He is a friend of Pope Francis. And under Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, he had helped lead the Vatican office that oversees the roughly one million men and women in religious orders around the world. That position did not end so well. It was an open secret that Cardinal Tobin was sent to Indiana as a kind of exile most likely because he questioned an inquiry by his office into supposed doctrinal lapses among the roughly 50,000 nuns in the United States. As he got to know the faithful in the chancery of Indianapolis, he would joke with them about it. \u201cI was kicked out and I\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d the chancellor of the archdiocese, Annette Lentz, recalled his saying about how he turned up on her doorstep. And she would tell him, \u201cTheir loss is our gain.\u201d How Cardinal Tobin, 64, an amiable 6-foot-3 Irish-American who likes Bob Seger, plays piano and speaks five languages, went from being the oldest of 13 children living in Detroit to the pinnacle of the global church is a story that bears telling. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He grew up in a working-class neighborhood where the big houses were perfect for the large families of Irish, Polish and other Eastern European backgrounds that filled them. The local parish, Holy Redeemer , was run by an order of priests called the Redemptorists, and was unusually large, with 14 Masses each Sunday for up to 20,000 worshipers, he recalled in a Dec. 5 interview. His mother was a public-school teacher who quit her job to raise her brood; nine of her cousins and three of her aunts were nuns. Growing up in a deeply Catholic environment, Cardinal Tobin had two role models: the parish priests and his father, a cost analyst at General Motors who attended 6 a.m. Mass daily. Joe Tobin was a rough-and-tumble child, who once crashed through the back-porch window when he was being chased. But he also learned the deeper lessons taught by the nuns at the parish school. \u201cJoe came home in second grade and said to me, \u2018Mom, I need a pair of socks,\u2019\u201d his mother, Marie Tobin, 93, recalled before Cardinal Tobin\u2019s emotional farewell Mass in Indianapolis on Dec. 3. \u201cAnd I looked at his feet and saw his socks were fine. \u2018Mother,\u2019 he said, \u2018there\u2019s a boy in my class who has rags around his feet and a safety pin.\u2019\u201d Photo A photograph of Cardinal Tobin\u2019s family from the 1970s. Credit a J Mast for The New York Times In 1977, when the cardinal was in seminary in Esopus, N.Y., his father died of a heart attack. By that time, the family had moved across the border to Canada, and his father had been commuting to Michigan. \u201cI idolized my dad,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said. \u201cHe was everything I think a man should be. He was strong, he played in the Orange Bowl as a freshman in Boston College. He lost his leg in World War II , so he never played football again. He had a quiet, unpretentious faith. He was chivalrous with women. \u201cAnd I remember when he died,\u201d he added, \u201cand I was waiting at the seminary for someone to drive me to La Guardia, and one of my teachers came and said, \u2018If you can be a man like your father, when they call you Father you will be all right.\u2019 And I suppose I am still trying to do that.\u201d He remains close with his siblings. And in the Redemptorists, an order that requires a vow of poverty and emphasizes missionary outreach, he found a second family. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He dreamed of being sent to far-flung locales once he was ordained in 1978. Instead, because he spoke Spanish, he was sent right back to Holy Redeemer, which had a growing Hispanic population. There, he learned about serving the poor. An older priest modeled what was to become a signature of Cardinal Tobin\u2019s ministry: an intense focus on each person. \u201cWhen he is there and you are talking to him, it\u2019s as if you have known him all your life,\u201d said Bernice Guynn, 89, a parishioner at St. Rita in Indianapolis. From Detroit, he was moved during the AIDS epidemic to Chicago, where he ministered at the bedsides of the dying. The church\u2019s stance against homosexuality was not a barrier to him. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be there for people,\u201d he said. By 1991, the higher-ups of his order had taken notice and he was moved to Rome. For 12 years, he led the Redemptorist order, finally traveling the world to missions in more than 70 nations. Photo Cardinal Tobin with the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary after his farewell Mass in Indianapolis on Dec. 3 Credit A J Mast for The New York Times In that capacity, he made an impression on Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then the Vatican official responsible for enforcing Catholic doctrine. In 2010, five years after Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope Benedict, he offered Father Tobin the title of archbishop and the position of secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the Vatican. Cardinal Tobin recalled that he was painting his mother\u2019s porch in Ontario when he got the call from the Vatican secretary of state. \u201cI turned white and started stuttering,\u201d he said. He did not want the job, he said, but how does one refuse the pope? The office he had been tapped to administer was investigating American nuns for supposedly adopting a \u201csecular mentality\u201d and straying from Catholic orthodoxy. In other words, the nuns were accused of being too liberal, and Cardinal Tobin was to oversee the inquiry. But he had an \u201cextremely positive\u201d view of the nuns, he told T he National Catholic Reporter at the time, and he wanted to explain their good works. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cMy first job, I thought, was to ask, \u2018What were people trying to accomplish with this?\u2019\u201d he said this month. But the problem, he came to believe, was structural: the investigation of 55,000 religious women by a tiny staff for the alleged errors of a few. \u201cIt made as much sense as an ophthalmologist trying to do cataract surgery standing in center field in Yankee Stadium and pointing his laser gun up at the bleachers,\u201d he said. Two years into his five-year term, his priest secretary surprised him with the news. \u201cWe are so sorry you are going,\u201d Cardinal Tobin recalled him saying. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Really, where am I going?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Indianapolis.\u2019\u201d The official news did not come for four months. \u201cIt was like death by 1,000 cuts,\u201d he said. When he arrived in Indiana in December 2012, most American Catholics had never heard of him. But to the nuns he was something of a hero. \u201cWe thought that he was a tremendous individual,\u201d said Mother Anne Brackmann, the prioress of the Carmelite Monastery in Terre Haute, Ind. \u201cAnd he was welcomed very, very warmly.\u201d Someone else took note of his dismissal: Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, who would become Pope Francis. Photo Cardinal Tobin greeting students at St. Philip Neri School in Indianapolis this month. Credit A J Mast for The New York Times The two men met in 2005 during a synod of bishops in Rome, and they bonded over a shared view of the church. There were conservative bishops in their group who wanted, for example, to ban girls from being altar servers. \u201cI have eight sisters, and at the time, I had nieces who were serving at the altar, and I didn\u2019t see the justification for it,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said. \u201cBergoglio was on the same page. There are more important things to talk about.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story They had also laughed together: Cardinal Tobin recalled telling Cardinal Bergoglio that he had been his mother\u2019s choice for pope that year, because she had read how he picked up after himself and cooked his own food. Still, Cardinal Tobin was surprised to get a note from Cardinal Bergoglio in 2010 wishing him luck in his Vatican position. \u201cHe said: \u2018I remember our time together, I remember our conversations, and I remember your mother\u2019s good taste. I\u2019m praying for you.\u2019\u201d By the time Cardinal Tobin came to the Vatican in 2013 to receive his pallium \u2014 the cowl that would mark his status as the archbishop of Indianapolis \u2014 Pope Francis had been elected. He was not sure the new pope would remember him. But Francis again surprised him. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying intensely for you since I heard what happened,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said the pope had told him. What happened next was a kind of rehabilitation. Francis appointed him to the oversight committee of the same Vatican office he had been removed from. Then, in October, came the announcement: The pope was naming him a cardinal. He would be the youngest one in the United States. Cardinal Tobin was shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you are sleeping in class and all of a sudden the spotlight is on you,\u201d he said. At a news conference last month in Newark, he put it this way: \u201cSometimes I think Pope Francis sees a lot more in me than I see in myself.\u201d Photo Cardinal Tobin with Pope Francis at the Vatican last month. Credit Stefano Rellandini/Reuters Cardinal Tobin said he loved his time in Indianapolis, where he visited parishes in 39 counties, ministered to prisoners on death row and baptized about 1,000 new Catholics each Easter. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He was up by 4 many mornings to pray before arriving at the gym by 5:30. With the help of a trainer, Shane Moat, he learned how to deadlift 425 pounds. \u201cBig breath, explode, keep it close,\u201d Mr. Moat coached him earlier this month. Cardinal Tobin strained and hoisted the weight to his waist. \u201cYou the man!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said after dropping the weight with a bang. That morning, Mr. Yeary, the salesman, presented him with a goodbye gift: a framed photo of the cardinal with his seven workout buddies, whose ages range from 27 to over 70. \u201cOh, man, that\u2019s wonderful, thank you,\u201d the cardinal said. Then he reverted to his lighthearted tone: \u201cNone of those Sopranos are going to mess with me. This is my crew.\u201d Cardinal Tobin has had a hard time saying goodbye. He choked up at his farewell Mass and had only one request of the congregation that had packed the cathedral: Pray for him. But his admirers here and elsewhere are hoping that Cardinal Tobin will become a more public voice for Pope Francis and his priorities. He has already done that once, in a showdown with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican who is now the vice president-elect, over welcoming Syrian refugees. In November 2015, Mr. Pence announced that he would suspend Syrian refugee resettlement programs, citing security fears. Cardinal Tobin felt that was not only illegal, but also immoral. He met with Mr. Pence, discussed his objections and told him he would continue the Catholic Charities resettlement program. A federal court has since overturned the governor\u2019s directive. In an email, Mr. Pence said, \u201cCardinal Tobin is a personal friend, and I deeply respect his commitment to his faith and his ministry.\u201d While Cardinal Tobin did not tell anyone whom to vote for in the presidential election, he said he was disturbed by appeals to fear during the campaign of Donald J. Trump, particularly his views of refugees and immigrants. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cwas appealing to the dark side of the divisive forces, to the unredeemed part of us.\u201d And while the cardinal believes American democracy will ultimately resist such appeals, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too Pollyannish about things.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Cardinal Tobin at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark last month, when he was introduced as the new Roman Catholic archbishop of the city. Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times In Newark, he said, his first job after his installation on Jan. 6 will be to listen. Encompassing Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Union Counties in northern New Jersey, the archdiocese has pockets of great wealth and poverty, and an array of immigrants so diverse that Mass each Sunday is celebrated in 20 languages. About 30 percent of the parishioners are Hispanic. Advertisement It is also a community in need of healing . In July, citing the failure of the archdiocese to effectively remove priests accused of sexual abuse from contact with children , the editorial board of The Star-Ledger of Newark called the departure of Archbishop Myers a \u201ctrue blessing.\u201d \u201cDuring his 15-year tenure as New Jersey\u2019s highest-ranking Catholic, he protected pedophile priests,\u201d the board said. \u201cHe urged his flock to vote based on two issues \u2014 abortion and gay marriage \u2014 at the threat of being denied Holy Communion.\u201d Jim Goodness, the spokesman for the archdiocese, denied those allegations, saying that Archbishop Myers had permanently removed from ministry some 20 abusive priests and that he had \u201cnever threatened to deny Communion to anyone.\u201d Cardinal Tobin will bring a different message. One of his priorities, he said, would be to ensure that the archdiocese is fully compliant with church and criminal protocols on handling sexual abuse allegations. At the Vatican in the late 1990s, the cardinal recalled, it was difficult to convince people that the abuse issue was serious. \u201cI think they just believed it was an American problem,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it like I was a great crusader over there, but I did take it seriously.\u201d He later led an effort to establish protocols for abuse claims in his order. Yet the most outspoken American victims group, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests , said that Cardinal Tobin, like the church as a whole, must do more, such as posting the names of all credibly accused priests online. \u201cCertainly there are worse bishops, but that fact should comfort no one,\u201d David Clohessy, the organization\u2019s national director, said. Cardinal Tobin assumes his role in an uneasy time. He said that he hoped to lead with joy and transparency, and that he intended to encourage dialogue to bridge divisions. But he would go further if he believed that policies ran counter to the moral values that Jesus taught. On the threats by President-elect Trump to carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants, for example, Cardinal Tobin was clear. He recalled how Pope John XXIII, before he became pope, issued false baptismal certificates to help Jews escape the Nazis in World War II.

    "text": "Carrie Fisher in stable condition after medical emergency Published               December 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 LOS ANGELES \u2013 \u00a0Carrie Fisher, the actress who is known for her role as Princess Leia in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, is in stable condition after suffering a medical emergency aboard a flight from London to Los Angeles Friday. Her brother, Todd Fisher, told The Associated Press that she was \"out of emergency\" and stabilized at a Los Angeles hospital Friday afternoon. He said he could not discuss any other details about what happened. The 60-year-old star experienced medical trouble during the flight and was treated by paramedics immediately upon landing in Los Angeles around noon Friday, according to reports citing unnamed sources. Celebrity website TMZ, which first reported the incident, said anonymous sources told them the actress suffered a heart attack. Fisher's publicists and representatives for her mother, Debbie Reynolds, and her daughter, Billie Lourd, did not immediately return calls from the AP. Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott said paramedics administered advanced life-saving care to a patient at Los Angeles International Airport Friday and transported the person to a nearby hospital. He did not identify the patient as Fisher. The actress and author is considered a member of Hollywood royalty \u2014 her parents are Debbie Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher. Catapulted to stardom as Princess Leia in 1977's \"Star Wars,\" Carrie Fisher reprised the role as the tough-as-nails leader of a galactic rebellion in three sequels, including last year's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" Fisher is best known for her portrayal of Leia, but she is also an accomplished writer known for no-holds-barred accounts of her struggles with addiction and mental illness. Her thinly veiled autobiography \"Postcards from the Edge\" was adapted into a 1987 film version starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep. She transformed her one-woman show \"Wishful Drinking,\" which played on Broadway and was filmed for HBO, was also turned into a book. She has recently been promoting her latest book, \"The Princess Diarist,\" in which she reveals that she and co-star Harrison Ford had an affair on the set of \"Star Wars.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Twitter has teamed up with the NFL to livestream football games, and it seems to have scored a touchdown with Thursday night's Jets vs. Bills gam... Wall Street analysts are concerned about even more executives departing at a time when Twitter is developing new products such as its live streaming of National Football League games and other events as it tries to reignite its decelerating growth.\u00a0 Revenue in the third quarter rose 8 percent on a year-over-year basis, down from a 58 percent rate a year earlier. Monthly active users have barely increased over the past three quarters, at a rate of 3 percent, and rival sites such as Facebook ( FB ), YouTube and Snapchat continue to gain ad revenue and users at Twitter\u2019s expense, according to Doshi. Twitter ended efforts to sell itself earlier this year after potential suitors such as Walt Disney ( DIS ), Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Salesforce.com ( CRM ) decided to pass. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s decision to retain his position as CEO of payments processor Square ( SQ ) is another sore spot with Wall Street analysts who\u2019ve long argued that Twitter is too complicated to use. According to Pachter, Twitter has made improvements that many users may not know about because the company has communicated information about them poorly.\u00a0 Pressure also is mounting on Twitter to crack down on abusive users.\u00a0 \u201cTwitter is not a safe place. There\u2019s harassment. There\u2019s sexism. There\u2019s actual porn on there,\u201d Pachter said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great place for a wholesome, family-friendly company like Disney.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Zambito, The (Westchester County, N.Y.) Journal News 4:46 p.m. EST December 23, 2016 Metro-North engineer William Rockefeller (Photo: File photo: The Journal News) The train engineer who fell asleep at the controls of a speeding New York train three years ago, causing a derailment that killed four and injured dozens of passengers, will receive a $3,200-a-month disability pension from the railroad for the rest of his life. William Rockefeller found out recently that\u00a0the Metropolitan Transit Authority's Pension Disability Medical Review Board had taken his side in his\u00a0appeal of a separate pension board's September decision turning\u00a0back his request. \u201cThe Pension Disability Medical Review Board reviewed the appeal and determined that Mr. Rockefeller is disabled from performing his function as an engineer and he is eligible now to receive his pension,\u201d the MTA said. The board is made up of medical professionals. LAWSUIT: Derailment engineer $10M suit blames Metro-North The total monthly payout will be approximately $3,200, the MTA added. It\u00a0will be in addition to a federal railroad retirement pension Rockefeller was awarded earlier this year. That amount was unknown. Officials cited medical privacy issues in refusing to discuss Rockefeller\u2019s disability. In September, Rockefeller\u2019s union said he was seeking the disability for a post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by the accident on Dec. 1, 2013. Rockefeller\u2019s Manhattan-bound train was going 82 mph along a curve marked for 30 mph when it derailed, coming to rest along the banks of the Hudson River near Spuyten-Duyvil. Several passengers were thrown through the train\u2019s windows and Metro-North air conditioning mechanic Samuel Rivera was paralyzed. Several lawsuits filed by passengers as well as the families of those who were killed are still pending. In October, The Journal News/lohud.com reported that nearly $32 million in settlements and legal costs have been paid out to resolve the claims of passengers injured in the derailment. The award comes just three weeks after Rockefeller filed a $10 million federal lawsuit against Metro-North, claiming the commuter rail was to blame for the accident. Rockefeller's lawyer mum Rockefeller\u2019s attorney, Ira Maurer, blamed Metro-North for the crash, saying the commuter rail had the available mechanisms to prevent the accident from taking place but failed to employ them. The mechanism he referred to could apply the train\u2019s brakes automatically if the engineer is speeding through a curve. Maurer declined to comment on the pension award. \u201cWho told you that?,\u201d Maurer asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him in the last week. I\u2019m not going to feed the news frenzy.\u201d Maurer said there were no plans to dismiss the lawsuit filed and said the evidence will show that Metro-North was largely to blame for the crash. Samuel Rivera was left a quadriplegic after being injured when a Metro-North train derailed in 2013.  Seth Harrison/The Journal News) \u00a0(Photo: Seth Harrison/The Journal News) Rockefeller learned in March that he would receive a U.S. Railroad Retirement Board pension for an unspecified disability.

    "text": "Email President-elect Donald Trump appears to be weighing the costs and benefits of killing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Jet, pitting top aircraft manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Boeing against each other in a bid for defense contracts. Mr. Trump said in a tweet late Thursday night that there were \u201ctremendous cost and cost overruns\u201d of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35, but that he had asked Boeing to \u201cprice-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet\u201d: Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Boeing, in response, sent a tweet less than an hour later saying it was \u201cready to work with\u201d the administration to \u201caffordably meet U.S. requirements.\u201d Ready to work with @realDonaldTrump 's administration to affordably meet U.S. military requirements. \u2014 The Boeing Company (@Boeing) December 22, 2016 The president-elect met separately with the executives of the two major defense contractors earlier this week at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida. He spoke with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg Wednesday in what the executive later said was a \u201cvery productive\u201d discussion. Following the president-elect\u2019s meeting with Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin\u2019s CEO, the executive released a statement saying she \u201cappreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 program and the progress we\u2019ve made in bringing costs down.\u201d \u201cThe F-35 is a critical program to our national security, and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our U.S. military and our allies,\u201d Hewson said. The Pentagon is attempting to purchase over 2,400 F-35 planes, some of the most advanced computerized aircrafts, to become the standard fighters for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. They would then replace several older planes, including Boeing\u2019s F/A-18. As some have pointed out on Twitter, however, the possibly cheaper Super Hornets Mr. Trump is advocating for present no comparison to an F-35, which currently costs more than $100 million to produce. According to Marcus Weisgerber at Defense One, the F-35 has stealth capabilities, whereas the F/A-18 does not: There's no such thing as a comparable F/A-18 Super Hornet. F-35 is stealthy, Super Hornet is not. But F/A-18 is a lot cheaper https://t.co/rErFiCQEFZ \u2014 Marcus Weisgerber (@MarcusReports) December 22, 2016 But the F-35 program has been beset by delays, cost overruns, and malfunctions since Lockheed Martin began producing them nearly 10 years ago. Both Republican and Democratic legislators have been critical of the aircraft due to numerous safety concerns, and worries that it would be undependable in some combat scenarios.\u00a0 On the Wednesday that Mr. Trump spoke with Boeing and Lockheed Martin executives, the president-elect also met with Air Force generals and Navy admirals to discuss the aircraft, telling reporters that the meeting was focused on \u201ctrying to get costs down cost primarily the F-35 trying to get the costs down cause it\u2019s a program that\u2019s very very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe are going to get the costs down and get it done beautifully,\u201d he promised. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Bowles has been hospitalized with what the team says is an \"undisclosed illness,\" and he did not travel for the game at New England on Saturday. In a statement posted Friday, Dec. 23, on the team's website, the Jets say Bowles is in stable condition, but it is uncertain if he will eventually join the team in time for the game. (AP Photo/David Richard, File) 0 Shares Email New York Jets coach Todd Bowles was hospitalized Friday with what the team called an \"undisclosed illness,\" and he did not travel for the game at New England on Saturday. In a statement posted on the team's website , the Jets said Bowles was in stable condition, but it was uncertain if he would eventually join the team in time for the game. The 53-year-old Bowles fell ill early Friday afternoon and was taken to the hospital, where general manager Mike Maccagnan visited him. Maccagnan has remained in constant contact with Bowles, who wants to coach the game but will need to be cleared by doctors. If Bowles is unavailable to coach, assistant head coach Mike Caldwell will fill in against the Patriots. Caldwell, who played linebacker for 11 seasons in the NFL , also serves as New York's inside linebackers coach. Caldwell ran the Jets' walkthrough practice while Bowles was hospitalized. He was informed during the team's flight to the Boston area that he would be the head coach if Bowles can't make it to the game. Bowles is in his second season as coach of the Jets. He got his tenure off to a promising start with a 10-6 season that finished a win shy of a playoff appearance. But New York has struggled to a 4-10 mark this season, prompting questions about Bowles' future as coach as the Jets failed to make the postseason for the sixth straight year. Bowles has maintained a low-key, even-keeled approach in public despite some fans and media calling for his job in recent weeks. \"When I signed the contract, I knew what my job status was and I'm not worried about that,\" he said earlier this month. \"I'm going to do the same thing and keep grinding like I always do.\" This is the second health-related situation Bowles has dealt with since coming to the Jets. In February, he had a benign golf ball-sized mass removed from his throat that was initially discovered during the season and didn't require any additional surgery. \u2014\u2014\u2014 For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL 0 Shares ",

By Mike DeBonis December 23 at 6:27 PM Follow @mikedebonis President-elect Donald Trump is signaling a cease-fire in his battle with the Republican leadership in Congress, which he repeatedly skewered during his election-season attacks on the Washington establishment. Trump has, by all accounts, patched up his once-turbulent relationship with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). To fill top jobs in his administration, Trump has chosen five sitting lawmakers, as well as the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). And he has passed up opportunities to meddle in congressional business in ways that might have pleased his populist base but frustrated Republican leaders. The detente in Trump\u2019s war on GOP leaders reflects the unifying power of victory, the moderating influence of Vice President-elect Mike Pence and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, and, most of all, a shared desire to make good on years of Republican campaign promises. \u201cHe has made it clear he does not want to be an executive-order president, like Obama,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who was one of the first lawmakers to openly back Trump and now serves on the transition\u2019s executive committee. \u201cHe wants to be a legislative president, who gets legislation on his desk to sign into law.\u201d [ How to pay for Trump\u2019s agenda? Congressional Republicans aren\u2019t saying. ] Top leaders and their staffs have developed a relationship with Trump\u2019s more establishment-minded aides \u2014 Priebus and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who will serve as a White House counselor. Ryan has a particularly strong bond with Pence, forged during their 12 years together in the House. But other Trump aides are nurturing different channels of communication that could exacerbate GOP tensions. Hard-line House conservatives appear to have a direct line to Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior political aide David Bossie \u2014 both of whom spent years in the conservative media railing against the GOP establishment. Other Republicans \u2014 including a group of early Trump backers from New York and Pennsylvania \u2014 are closer to Trump family members, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is playing a central transition role and could join the White House officially. Trump is in near-daily contact with Ryan and McConnell, mainly to solicit input on potential appointees, while high-level transition staffers hash out a legislative blueprint for 2017 with senior congressional aides \u2014 one that would repeal Obamacare, rewrite the federal tax code and rebuild domestic infrastructure. But the pre-inauguration choreography can only extend so far. Big questions remain about Trump\u2019s personal approach to Congress: Will he be a bipartisan schmoozer and dealmaker? Or will he sit back as Republicans power through a long-deferred wish list? Trump has yet to commit to attending the yearly House Republican policy retreat scheduled for late January in Philadelphia \u2014 a traditional early stop for a new president. A Trump spokesman declined to comment for this article. But it is clear that the members of Trump\u2019s inner circle often are not on the same page, which could spell trouble for his legislative agenda. For instance, members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus claimed to have Trump\u2019s backing when they defied Ryan and launched an early-December bid to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen. Priebus intervened in an attempt to halt a floor vote, as reported by Politico, but conservatives forced one anyway. The Freedom Caucus was emboldened \u2014 and encouraged behind the scenes \u2014 by Bannon, whose former website, Breitbart, wrote favorably about it, and by Bossie, who supported the impeachment push as president of Citizens United. Impeachment was effectively buried in the end, handing GOP leaders the win. Even as Trump has moved closer to the Republican leadership, not all key decisions are going its way. A top GOP leader got an up-close lesson on the competing whims of Trump insiders. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the House Republican Conference chairwoman, was personally wooed for a Cabinet position by Pence, and on Dec. 9, a Friday, several media organizations reported that Trump had chosen her as interior secretary. But McMorris Rodgers was never offered the job ahead of a planned visit to Trump Tower the following Monday. On her way up to Trump\u2019s 26th-floor office, according to a person familiar with the visit, her elevator stopped and she was joined by Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr. \u2014 the latter holding a folder of documents. The sons then entered their father\u2019s office ahead of McMorris Rodgers before she was ushered in. After small talk about that weekend\u2019s Army-Navy football game, the person said, Trump opened the folder and questioned McMorris Rodgers on statements she had made criticizing Trump during the campaign. The meeting ended within minutes. They next day, Trump announced he had selected Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), a former Navy SEAL who got to know Donald Trump Jr. through hunting and fishing circles. Trump\u2019s eschewing of McMorris Rodgers and choice of Zinke was a blow to GOP leaders, especially McConnell, who saw Zinke as Republicans\u2019 best chance to unseat Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in 2018. Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), the veteran House Republican, said the competing factions inside Trump\u2019s inner circle could help him manage a fractious Congress. Different wings of the party, he said, could interact with the White House through different advisers and feel comfortable their views were being heard by Trump. \u201cThere can be creative chaos sometimes in administrations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is probably not unlike the way he runs a lot of businesses. . . . He probably seems to like that, likes a little tension in the Cabinet or disagreements with his advisers, because it clarifies the issues in front of him and then he makes the decision.\u201d Stylistically, Trump seems to be charting a different course toward lawmakers than President Obama, who was criticized for his seemingly aloof personal relations with them. Trump is embracing a more hands-on approach \u2014 one that has played out in rapid-fire phone calls, text messages and highly publicized visits to Trump Tower. \u201cI probably talked to him as much since he\u2019s become president-elect as I did [to Obama] in the entire eight years,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin III, a moderate West Virginia Democrat who was in contention for energy secretary. Manchin said he left a Trump Tower visit earlier this month with Trump\u2019s direct phone number and budding relationships with Priebus and Bannon, both of whom Manchin praised. \u201cI liked him,\u201d Manchin said of Bannon, a bete noire to most Democrats. \u201cHe\u2019s no bull---, straightforward, direct. . . . You might not agree, but at least you know where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d Priebus, he said, \u201cwants to do some things to move things forward.\u201d Those relationships are being built, several lawmakers pointed out, even before Trump takes office and has use of some of the most powerful tools of persuasion. \u201cSay what you want about the trappings of the White House and Air Force One and those kinds of things, but some presidents have used that stuff very effectively,\u201d said Rep. Kevin Cramer (D-N.D.), another early Trump backer, now advising the transition on energy issues. \u201cDonald Trump, with his background in hospitality, as a host, owning facilities, being in the business, he\u2019s the kind of guy who can maximize the tools of relationship probably as well as anybody could.\u201d Cole said Trump\u2019s decision-making style suggests Congress will not be kept at arm\u2019s length. \u201cA lot of it seems to be in interactive situations with individuals, which of course is what congressmen want to do: They want to talk about what they know and what they do,\u201d Cole said. \u201cMy guess is the Trump White House is going to be an interesting White House to visit. You\u2019re going to be invited down a lot more.\u201d Senior Capitol Hill staffers say they are waiting for Trump to weigh in on key questions before committing to strategies on health care, infrastructure and taxes. But even among Trump\u2019s strongest congressional supporters, there are differing views on how involved Trump ultimately will get in dictating legislation. \u201cI think we know he\u2019s not going to get himself wrapped around the axles,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re delivering the product that gets to his goals, I think that he would defer the details to us.\u201d Collins, on the other hand, said Ryan and McConnell understand that the GOP is Trump\u2019s party now and that he will ultimately call the shots. \u201cThere\u2019s been no kickback whatsoever that would suggest, \u2018We\u2019re Congress. You\u2019re the president. We\u2019re going to do what we\u2019re going to do,\u2019 \u201d Collins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite. It\u2019s, \u2018Yes, Mr. President. What do you want us to do first? How would you like us to proceed? Thank you very much.\u2019 \u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "2012 2016 Source: Upshot estimates. \u201cNorthern states\u201d exclude the former Confederate states, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia. His gains among younger working-class whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest. Young white working-class voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country. Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among them \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s weakness \u2014 was evident from the beginning of the 2008 primaries. It Wasn\u2019t Turnout Mr. Trump\u2019s gains among white working-class voters weren\u2019t simply caused by Democrats staying home on Election Day. The Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start, according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats. Its models, based on survey data, indicated that they were underperforming Mr. Obama in less-educated white areas by a wide margin \u2014 perhaps 10 points or more \u2014 as early as the summer. The campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012, and found a large number of white working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump. The same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters. Those polls aren\u2019t affected by changes in turnout. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The best data on the effect of turnout will ultimately come from voter file data, which will include an individual-level account of who voted and who didn\u2019t. Most of this data is only beginning to become available. But the limited data that\u2019s already available is consistent with the story evident in the pre-election polling: Turnout wasn\u2019t the major factor driving shifts among white voters. The voter-file data in North Carolina, where nearly all of the state\u2019s jurisdictions have reported their vote, shows that the turnout among white Democrats and Republicans increased by almost the exact amount \u2014 about 2.5 percent. The same appears to be true in Florida. Nationally, there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout. Mr. Trump made gains in white working-class areas, whether turnout surged or dropped. The exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters. Perhaps most strikingly, Mr. Trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, including 8 percent of those who \u201cstrongly\u201d approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance and 10 percent of white working-class voters who wanted to continue Mr. Obama\u2019s policies. Mr. Trump won 20 percent of self-identified liberal white working-class voters, according to the exit polls, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than Mr. Obama\u2019s. It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white, working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier. The Obama-Trump Vote The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum. Mr. Trump, if anything, was Mr. Obama\u2019s opposite. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the two had the same winning pitch to white working-class voters. Mr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs. The implication was that he would leave middle-class jobs prey to globalization and corporations. The proof of Mr. Obama\u2019s commitment to the working class and Mr. Romney\u2019s callousness, according to the Obama campaign, was the auto bailout: Mr. Obama protected the auto industry; Mr. Romney wrote \u201cLet Detroit Go Bankrupt\u201d in The New York Times. There was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it: coal country. There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed climate-change policies that would reduce the production and use of coal. In retrospect, the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of working-class interests. Mr. Trump owned Mr. Obama\u2019s winning message to autoworkers and Mr. Romney\u2019s message to coal country. He didn\u2019t merely run to protect the remnants of the industrial economy; he promised to restore it and \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Just as Mr. Obama\u2019s team caricatured Mr. Romney, Mr. Trump caricatured Mrs. Clinton as a tool of Wall Street, bought by special interests. She, too, would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business, he said. According to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the proof of his commitment to the working class wasn\u2019t the auto bailout but the issue of trade: Mr. Trump said free trade was responsible for deindustrialization, and asserted that he would get tough on China, renegotiate Nafta and pull out of the trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 two trade agreements that Mrs. Clinton supported or helped negotiate (she later rejected the trans-Pacific deal). Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment \u2014 and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn\u2019t out to help ordinary Americans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Taken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration, trade, China, crime, guns and Islam all had considerable appeal to white working-class Democratic voters, according to Pew Research data. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion, same-sex marriage and the social safety net. Appealing to White Working-Class Democrats Donald J. Trump\u2019s economic views hold some appeal for blue-collar white Democrats.\u00a0 Percentage of white Democrats without a college degree who say \u2026 Gun rights are more important than control The U.S. should get tougher with China on economic issues Free trade does more harm than good That they have a favorable view of N.R.A.

Emanuel responded to questions about his use of a private email account. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, center, speaks to the media at the Jane Addams Family Resource Center on South Loomis Street in Chicago on Thursday. Emanuel responded to questions about his use of a private email account. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy In April 2014, investment banker Byron Trott sent an email to Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both Erskine and I are looking forward to hosting a fundraiser for you in June \u2014 our teams are working together on finding a date and a place for this as I write,\" Trott wrote, apparently referring to former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, whom Emanuel served with as a top Bill Clinton presidential adviser. Bowles is an adviser to Trott's namesake investment bank, BDT Capital Partners. \"Given your broad support base, the only challenge will be to find some who haven't already maxed out!\" wrote Trott, whose bank is housed in the Wrigley Building, which BDT also owns. A little more than an hour later, mayoral aide Jasmine Magana forwarded the email to both the mayor's campaign fundraising coordinator, Anne Olaimey, and administration aides David Spielfogel and Abby Masters with the message: \"The Mayor wanted me to pass on to you all.\" Read the story Trott's email and the reaction of the mayor's office underscore the intermixing of politics and government, issues at the core of legal efforts to obtain Emanuel's work product involving city business that took place on personal email accounts. Amid the thousands of emails released by Emanuel's attorneys this week to settle a lawsuit with the Better Government Association are myriad requests sent to the mayor's personal accounts from corporate heavyweights, campaign supporters and the politically connected aimed not only at helping their businesses but also their lifestyles. There's a request seeking Emanuel's help to get a business a state tax break. There's a plea for the city to hold off on a major announcement for fear of alienating a business's investors. There's an ask for assistance to block a zoning change in a tiny downtown neighborhood. And there's a lifelong friend who wanted to keep a local business from being evicted, noting the mayor's wife had been a patron. As for Trott's email, after proposing the political fundraiser as Emanuel geared up for a re-election bid, the investment banker asked the mayor to appear at an annual summit his BDT bank organizes for the ultrawealthy and influential business leaders. \"As we discussed, hopefully, you can play a role in our second 'Global Summit for the Closely Held,'\" wrote Trott, a former Goldman Sachs executive who ran the Wall Street firm's Chicago office before starting his own company in 2009. Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, Mayor Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... (Bill Ruthhart, Hal Dardick and Jeff Coen) Trott's email then moved on to asking Emanuel to provide top-level access to his administration for a new executive, Elizabeth Baker Keffer. \"As I mentioned, BDT has just hired our first Chief Network Officer \u2026 can you please connect her with your chief of staff or someone else who is seated as a similarly senior level with good access to you?\" Trott wrote. BDT declined to comment. Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins said the mayor did not attend the global summit. Collins defended the instance of mayoral staff contacting campaign staff regarding a request for the mayor's time, calling it \"completely acceptable and within bounds.\" It was unclear if Trott held the Emanuel fundraiser. Since 2010, Trott and his wife have given at least $97,100 to Emanuel's campaign fund. The nearly 2,700 pages of emails revealed other instances where top corporate executives and their businesses had Emanuel's ear. United Airlines request In an email exchange from Nov. 7, 2012, then-Emanuel staffer Tom Alexander let the mayor know that United Airlines had a request. United Continental Holdings, the airline's parent, was giving back $5.6 million in city tax incentives used when United moved its corporate headquarters to Wacker Drive along the river in 2007. By 2012, the airline was moving again, to the Willis Tower, and thought returning the TIF funds for the prior redevelopment was appropriate. Emanuel's private emails released These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 See more videos \"United has asked that we hold the story about their TIF return for a day or two,\" Alexander wrote. \"They are doing a monthly earnings report that will show significant loss due to Hurricane Sandy , and they are concerned that reporting they are giving back this money on the same day will cause problems for their investor relations department and will cause regulatory issues.\" The news of the refunding could be replaced with an announcement about a city job fair, Alexander wrote. \"Got it. Jobs fair is fine,\" Emanuel replied a few minutes later. News of the giveback was released by the city a few days later. Executives from the airline, one of the city's largest private employers, have contributed at least $137,000 to Emanuel's campaign fund. CME tax break Emanuel hadn't even been in office a month when he exchanged emails in June 2011 with Terrence Duffy , executive chairman of the CME Group , which runs the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. At the time, CME was threatening to move at least some jobs to another state because of the tax burden they faced in Illinois due to federal and state tax changes. \"Thanks for the talk this morning,\" Emanuel wrote to Duffy. \"Thank you,\" Duffy responded. \"I look forward with you and your staff as we try and build a better Chicago.\" ",

    "text": "More States Consider Working Around the Electoral College By susan haigh, associated press HARTFORD, Conn. \u0097 Dec 23, 2016, 11:35 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Presidential Electors to Cast Their Votes 0 Shares Email Frustrated after seeing another candidate secure the presidency without winning the national popular vote, mostly Democratic lawmakers in several capitols want their states to join a 10-year-old movement to work around the Electoral College. In states including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Mexico, legislators have said they plan to introduce legislation that would require their state's Electoral College voters cast ballots for the presidential candidate who earns the most votes nationwide, regardless of the statewide results. \"Every vote in this country should have equal weight. The Electoral College is a relic of a bygone era, and we need to change this system,\" said Connecticut state Sen. Mae Flexer, who filed a bill with several fellow Democrats requiring Connecticut to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Since 2006, 11 states have signed onto the compact, which require their Electoral College voters to cast ballots for the national popular vote winner. In theory it would take effect once it involves states representing at least 270 electoral votes, the threshold to win the presidency. When people vote for president, they are really choosing the electors from the political parties. The college is made up of 538 electors, which corresponds to the number of a state's seats in the U.S. Senate and House, plus the three votes allotted to Washington, D.C. The states that have already passed legislation to join the group represent 165 electoral votes. Typically reliably Democratic states, the list includes California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey , New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and D.C. \u2014 all where Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump. Advocates note the measures have cleared several Republican-controlled legislative chambers, including the Arizona House this year. That bill did not come up for a vote in the GOP-controlled state Senate. The compact wouldn't benefit any one party, said Patrick Rosenstiel, a consultant to National Popular Vote, the group that has been pushing for the compact since 2006. Rather, the Republican said, it will encourage candidates to campaign in every state, regardless of its politics, and make every voter relevant. \"Right now we've got a system where the battleground states have all the political influence,\" he said. Clinton is the fifth presidential candidate to win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College. She received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, according to an Associated Press analysis Tuesday after vote totals were certified, giving her the largest popular vote margin of any losing presidential candidate and bringing renewed calls to abolish the Electoral College. She benefited from solid wins in populous California and New York, while Trump narrowly won some battleground states. U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said she will introduce legislation in January to do away with the Electoral College through a constitutional amendment, but it's a longshot. An amendment would have to pass Congress and then be ratified by three-fourths of the states within seven years. Supporters of the compact are aiming to get enough states on board before the 2020 presidential election . Some critics question, among other issues, whether Republicans will have the political desire between now and 2020 to push for national popular vote compacts in their states. The GOP now holds majorities in 33 legislatures. Recent polling shows support for the Electoral College among Republicans is high following Trump's victory, said Robert Alexander, a political science professor at Ohio Northern University and author of a book on the Electoral College. \"Certainly among Democrats, yes,\" Alexander said of the will to join the compact. \"But a lot of the state legislatures are controlled by Republicans, and there is way too much uncertainty for them to take that issue on for their own political futures.\" If there had been a recent instance of a Republican candidate losing the Electoral College but winning the national popular vote, there likely would be more support from GOP lawmakers for the legislation, Alexander said. According to National Popular vote, in 2016 there were 154 Republicans who sponsored the measures and 162 Democrats. Battleground states like Ohio have little motivation to give up the attention they receive from presidential candidates, Alexander said. And he wondered what would happen if a state with a law binding its electors to vote for the winner of the state's popular vote \u2014 as is the case in more than half the states \u2014 joins the compact. \"Which would take precedence?\" he said. \"The state's binding law or the interstate compact?\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Pence Hands out Pay Raises, Awards Before Leaving Office By brian slodysko INDIANAPOLIS \u0097 Dec 23, 2016, 4:02 PM ET 0 Shares Email On his way out of office, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence approved pay raises for state employees while giving one of the state's highest awards to more than a dozen of his political allies and staff. Pence, now the vice president-elect, said Indiana \"would not be a state that works\" without dedicated government workers, to whom he is giving raises that range between 2 and 4 percent. The raises will cost $31 million over the next year, though they amount to a smaller pay bump than what Pence gave out in 2015, The Indianapolis Star reported. Meanwhile, Pence has awarded a bevy of Sagamore of the Wabash awards in recent days to Republican legislators, state office holders and staffers, as well as Indiana's outgoing Republican Party Chairman Jeff Cardwell, who is a former Pence staffer. The award was at one time the highest public service honor in Indiana. State offices were closed for the Christmas holiday on Friday and Pence spokesman Matt Lloyd said a list of everyone Pence gave the award to in recent weeks was not readily available. In one recent photo obtained by The Associated Press, Pence is posing in the governor's office with eight members of his staff who are clutching their awards. The staffers include longtime aides Lani Czarniecki and Chris Crabtree, as well as his personal assistant and \"body man\" Zach Bauer. Pence's mass issuance of the awards was mocked by some Indiana Republicans on social media as excessive, but former Pence spokesman Robert Vane said it was appropriate to give the award to his staff. \"It is completely within Gov. Pence's character to recognize the staffers who put in 70 hours a week in their service to Hoosiers and his office,\" said Vane. \"The easiest thing in the world is to give Sagamores to businessmen and large donors, but it's typical of the vice president-elect to award them to the people who work hard for him every day.\" Indiana governors are free to develop their own criteria for handing out the award, which was created during the term of Gov. Ralph Gates in the 1940s. While some have generously handed them out, Pence's predecessor, Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels , sharply curtailed the number issued during his eight-year tenure. Pence issued looser rules for giving the award when he took office in 2013, allowing each of the state's 150 lawmakers to nominate two people for the Sagamore award every year. The award used to be the highest public service honor in the state until Daniels revived Indiana's Sachem award, which is issued to one person a year. Republican Secretary of State Connie Lawson was one of the office holders given the Sagamore award this week. During the election won by President-elect Donald Trump and Pence, Lawson was a driving force behind an investigation into voter registration irregularities and repeatedly raised fears that widespread voter fraud could be occurring. After Trump and Pence were elected, Lawson said the election process \"worked.\" Pence, who leaves office on Jan. 9, said the pay raises were a just reward for hardworking state employees. Gov.-elect Eric Holcomb's transition team declined to comment on the raises, although Holcomb last week said less revenue than previously projected \"may require difficult decisions.\" Lawmakers have also signaled that they expect a tight budget year, but don't expect any spending cuts. \"Indiana would not be a state that works without the dedication and commitment of our state employees,\" Pence said in a statement. \"I am privileged to work alongside the Hoosiers who are the force behind the outstanding services and support the people have come to expect from their state government.\" 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump frequently pledged during the campaign that he would slash the size of the federal government and rein in spending, once proclaiming \u201cwe will cut so much, your head will spin.\u201d But the bombastic business titan is about to come face-to-face with Washington, that \u201cswamp\u201d he wants to drain. And both nonpartisan specialists and others who have tried before suggest the odds are not in his favor. Most every president in modern times has mounted an effort to streamline the federal bureaucracy and all have largely failed. President Obama in 2012 proposed merging parts of six agencies and cutting more than 1,000 federal jobs. Congress wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIt worse than died, it was assassinated on the Hill,\u201d said Donald Kettl, University of Maryland professor and author of Escaping Jurassic Government: Restoring America\u2019s Lost Commitment to Competence. Likewise, President George W. Bush put forth a \u201cManagement Agenda\u201d to overhaul the bureaucracy and Bill Clinton pushed a\u00a0\u201cReinventing Government\u201d plan. \u201cIn each case, executive branch efforts to reform management were viewed with skepticism (by Congress),\u201d John Kamensky, deputy director of Clinton\u2019s initiative, and Jonathan Breul, a budget management adviser during both administrations, wrote in a paper about lessons learned. \u201cAs a consequence, few pieces of significant legislation were enacted.\u201d The Grace Commission President Ronald Reagan convened a commission of private-sector executives and experts who came up with more than 2,000 recommendations to reduce waste, improve management and restructure the government in 1984. The so-called Grace Commission said the changes would save taxpayers $424 billion over three years. \u201cAbsolutely nothing came of it. Absolutely nothing,\u201d said Paul Light, New York University professor and author of 25 books, including Thickening Government: Federal Hierarchy and the Diffusion of Accountability. Light said that while every president has promised to make government work better, the last successful major overhaul of the federal government was in the 1950s. He said there are a mix of forces fighting to keep the status quo, not the least of which is Congress, whom he blamed for many inefficiencies in the federal government that waste taxpayer dollars. \u201cAll duplication and overlap flows downhill from Congress,\u201d Light said. \u201cCommittees create these different programs and they don\u2019t want to do anything about it.\u201d Kenneth Baer, who was associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget when Obama made his push, said there\u2019s no incentive for members of Congress to cut anything. \u201cFor all their talk about getting rid of this or that, the truth is that they don\u2019t want to get rid of any of it,\u201d he said. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has been issuing annual reports since 2011 on wasteful spending and has identified hundreds of fixes that could save taxpayers billions of dollars. The GAO said its report this year that the IRS could be collecting $385 billion more in taxes annually, and millions could be saved by reducing overlapping programs. Food safety, for instance is overseen by 12 different agencies. Eight agencies administer more than 100 programs supporting individuals suffering from mental illness. Orice Williams Brown , a GAO managing director who helped coordinate this year\u2019s report, said that because eliminating programs is so difficult, Congress often just layers new ones on top. For example, she said, the law passed after the financial crisis added to an existing patchwork of financial regulatory programs. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t an appetite to step back and say, \u2018Let\u2019s put aside what we currently have, and let\u2019s think about what we would do if we were starting over today,\u2019\u201d Williams Brown said. \u201cAnd that becomes really the heavy lift that is difficult to do. It\u2019s difficult politically.\u201d Of 544 fixes recommended by GAO in the past five years, only 244 have been completed. Some are optimistic about Trump\u2019s chances of getting more done than his predecessors to improve the bureaucracy, particularly given his Cabinet picks so far, which include chief executives from the private sector and members of Congress. His pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., is a deficit hawk. \u201cIn my view, they are better positioned than the members of prior administrations, high-ranking members of prior administrations, to come in and start getting to work right away,\u201d said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a\u00a0group founded by the leaders of Reagan\u2019s commission. \u201cI think people look at Donald Trump and said he\u2019s going to be a strong leader, he\u2019s going to get things done, and you have the secretaries of the various agencies pushing for some of those same things,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cI think it\u00a0puts pressure on Congress to do some of those things, to reduce on this duplication and overlap, the mismanagement.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "Dec 22 2016, 7:36 pm ET With Obama's Signature, U.S. Religious Freedom Law Protects Atheists by Alex Johnson advertisement When President Barack Obama signed an update to U.S. law protecting religious freedom late last week, one provision drew special attention: U.S. law now recognizes non-believers as, in essence, a religious group. Obama's signing of amendments to the International Religious Freedom Act on Friday wasn't widely noticed \u2014 except among the community of atheists, agnostics and others who categorize themselves as \"humanists.\" For the first time, the law \u2014 which was originally passed in 1998 \u2014 specifies that \"the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess or practice any religion.\" Among other things, the main amendments to the law promoting religious liberty around the world: Allow the United States to target \"entities of particular concern\" (that is, groups that aren't sovereign countries, like ISIS and Boko Haram). Set up a way to track religious prisoners overseas. Require that all foreign service officers undergo training in religious liberty. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters, Malia and Sasha, walk back to the White House after attending St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington in October 2009. AP The addition of protections for non-theistic or even non-existent beliefs wasn't even mentioned in many news reports. But for Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the nonprofit American Humanist Association, the change is a historic cause for celebration. \"That non-theists are now recognized as a protected class is a significant step toward full acceptance and inclusion for non-religious individuals, who are still far too often stigmatized and persecuted around the world,\" Speckhardt said. \"Legislators are finally recognizing the human dignity of humanists and granting the non-theistic community the same protections and respect that have been given to religious communities,\" he said. In its 2016 annual report (PDF) , the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal panel that was created under the original 1998 law, highlights numerous instances of persecution of atheists and other non-believers. The report plays no favorites, singling out important U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia, where the poet Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death last year for \"apostasy\" \u2014 specifically, for spreading atheism. The sentence was reduced in February 2016 to eight years in prison and 800 lashes. Regulations enacted in 2014 by the Saudi Interior Ministry, in fact, classify \"calling for atheist thought in any form\" as terrorism. The report also harshly criticizes Egypt, which convicted Mustafa Abdel-Nabi, an online activist, to prison in absentia in February for \"blasphemy\" after he published posts about atheism on his Facebook page. A year earlier, another Facebook user, Sherif Gaber, was sentenced to prison for discussing his atheist views online. \"Religious freedom for all people, theists and non-theists, is an American value we must protect,\" said Matthew Bulger, legislative director of the American Humanist Association. Post by NBC News . But it's not just humanist groups that are applauding the revision. \"Protecting non-theistic beliefs and requiring increased religious freedom training for our foreign service officers emphasizes our shared value of religious liberty for all people across the globe,\" said J.

    "text": "WATCH World Leaders Congratulate President-Elect Donald Trump 0 Shares Email An Israeli official on Friday accused President Barack Obama of colluding with the Palestinians in a \"shameful move against Israel at the U.N.\" after learning the White House did not intend to veto a Security Council resolution condemning settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem the day before. \"President Obama and Secretary Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the U.N.,\" the official said. \"The U.S administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel's back which would be a tail wind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory,\" he said calling it \"an abandonment of Israel which breaks decades of US policy of protecting Israel at the UN.\" Earlier he said Israel's prime minister turned to President-elect Donald Trump to help head off the critical U.N. resolution. Although the U.S. opposes the settlements, it has traditionally used its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council to block resolutions condemning Israel, saying that disputes between Israel and the Palestinians must be resolved through negotiations. But after eight years of failed peace efforts during the Obama Administration, Israel has expressed concern the outgoing president would take an audacious step to leave his mark on the region. In recent weeks, the White House had been especially secretive about its deliberations. The Israeli official's admission marked a final chapter in the icy relations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama over the last eight years, and signaled an era of close ties between Israel and the incoming Trump administration. Israel knew even before the Egyptian draft resolution that the White House was planning an \"ambush\" and coordinating it with the Palestinians, said another Israeli official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal diplomatic conversations. Israeli diplomats believe they were misled by the U.S. during a meeting last week between high-ranking Israeli and Obama administration officials in which the U.S. side offered reassurances about its efforts to support Israel but declined to explicitly state that the U.S. would veto such a resolution if it came up. The Israelis told their counterparts that \"friends don't take friends to the Security Council,\" the official said. The Egyptian-sponsored resolution had demanded that Israel halt settlement activities in occupied territories claimed by the Palestinians and declared that existing settlements \"have no legal validity.\" But under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt called off a planned vote in the Security Council hours before it was to take place. In the diplomatic activity ahead of the postponement, both Netanyahu and Trump issued nearly identical statements urging the U.S. to veto the measure. \"After becoming aware that the administration would not veto the anti-Israel resolution, Israeli officials reached out to Trump's transition team to ask for the president-elect's help to avert the resolution,\" the Israeli official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity. On Friday, Egypt said its president had received a call from Trump in which they both agreed to give the incoming U.S. administration a chance to try and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The call came hours after Egypt indefinitely postponed the U.N. vote. A statement from the Egyptian presidency said the two men spoke by phone early Friday and agreed on \"the importance of giving a chance for the new American administration to deal in a comprehensive way with the different aspects of the Palestinian issue with the aim of achieving a comprehensive and a final resolution.\" A senior Palestinian official, speaking anonymously according to protocol, said Egypt didn't consult with the Palestinians about delaying the vote and it was a \"complete shock\" for them. Egypt represents Arab states on the security council. Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, and the two countries have close security ties in a shared struggle against Islamic militants. The Palestinian mission to the United Nations said the Security Council will vote later in the day on the resolution condemning Israel's settlement construction, now sponsored by New Zealand , Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela. The U.S., along with the Palestinians and nearly all of the international community, opposes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as obstacles to peace. Some 600,000 Israelis live in the two territories, which the Palestinians seek as part of a future independent state. Israel captured both areas in the 1967 Mideast war. Trump has signaled he will be far more sympathetic to Israel. His campaign platform made no mention of the establishment of a Palestinian state, a core policy objective of Democratic and Republican presidents over the past two decades. He also has vowed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that would put the U.S. at odds with the Palestinians and almost the entire remainder of the international community, and his pick for ambassador to Israel, Jewish-American lawyer David Friedman, is a donor and vocal supporter of the settlements. The proposed resolution would have been more than symbolic. While it did not call for imposing sanctions on Israel, its language could have hindered Israel's negotiating position in future peace talks. Given the widespread international opposition to the settlements, it would have been nearly impossible for the Trump administration to reverse it. It remained unclear Friday whether the measure would come up for a vote in the council before Obama leaves office. In a Christmas greeting on Friday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said: \"Despite the Israeli occupation, our presence in our homeland and the preservation of our cultural and national heritage are the most important form of resistance in the face of the darkness of a foreign colonialist occupying power.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) 1408 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 326 COMMENTEMAILMORE ALBANY, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0Former New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino is facing backlash on social media for a racist remark\u00a0about first lady Michelle Obama\u00a0published Thursday in\u00a0a Buffalo alt-weekly publication. Paladino, who was honorary co-chair of President-elect Donald Trump's New York campaign, was one of a few dozen prominent Buffalo figures\u00a0 surveyed by\u00a0Artvoice \u00a0for an\u00a0end-of-the-year feature on their hopes for 2017. In response to a question about who should \"go away,\" Paladino suggested the first lady should\u00a0\"return to being a male\" and move to an African cave. \"I\u2019d like (Michelle Obama) to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla,\" Paladino responded, according to\u00a0Artvoice. A Buffalo developer and member of the city's school board, Paladino won a 2010 Republican primary for governor, defeating ex-U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio by running a campaign that lambasted political correctness. Paladino's remarks drew near-immediate backlash from officials and many social-media users in western New York, some of whom called on him to give up his school board seat. Instead, Paladino doubled down, claiming the remarks were meant to be humorous and had \"nothing to do with race\" despite the references to the African country and Michelle Obama, an African-American. His lengthy, 527-word statement referred to President Barack Obama as a \"lazy ass president\" while criticizing him for everything from his handling of the Syrian conflict to his treatment of the military to his opposition to Trump's presidential campaign. \"And yes, it\u2019s about a little deprecating humor which America lost for a long time,\" Paladino said of his\u00a0Artvoice\u00a0response.\u00a0\"Merry Christmas and\u00a0tough luck if you don\u2019t like my answer.\" Paladino's\u00a0Artvoice\u00a0remarks also targeted President Obama, with Paladino saying he hopes the president contracts mad cow disease by having a relationship with cattle. \"He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to (Obama adviser) Valerie Jarret (sic), who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihadi cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her,\" Paladino said in response, according to the alt-weekly. (2 of 2) The statements are so incredulous. If they were made by him there can be no room in our civil discourse for such hate and anger. \u2014 Mark Poloncarz (@markpoloncarz) December 23, 2016 The Buffalo Parent Teacher Organization held a news conference Friday calling on Paladino to step down from the Buffalo school board, while Democratic officials and organizations ranging from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to the Monroe County (New York) Democratic Committee condemned his remarks. Cuomo, who defeated Paladino in the 2010 general election, called Paladino's remarks \"racist, ugly and reprehensible.\" \"His remarks do not reflect the sentiments or opinions of any real New Yorker and he has embarrassed the good people of the state with his latest hate-filled rage,\" Cuomo said in a statement. Paladino was one of three honorary co-chairs for Trump's New York campaign, introducing the candidate at campaign rallies across the state ahead of New York's April primary. He has remained\u00a0in contact with Trump's transition team, becoming part of the parade of potential job-seekers who traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with the president-elect earlier this month. In a statement, Trump's transition team criticized Paladino's remarks. \"Carl's comments are absolutely reprehensible, and they serve no place in our public discourse,\" the statement read. Paladino\u00a0also has said he is considering another run for governor in 2018. In a tweet, Erie County (New York) Executive Mark Poloncarz' called the remarks attributed to Paladino \"so incredulous.\" \"If they were made by him there can be no room in our civil discourse for such hate and anger,\" wrote Poloncarz, a Democrat. 1408 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 326 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ioprZL NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Dec. 23, 2016, 2:28 p.m. Reporting from Honolulu Michael A. Memoli (Justin Lane / European Pressphoto Agency) President Obama personally directed Friday that the U.S. abstain from a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement activity, seeing the escalation of settlement building as an increasing threat to the viability of a two-state solution to the region's problems. Ahead of the expected vote, Obama, who is vacationing with his family in Hawaii, convened a discussion Thursday with Vice President Joe Biden , Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other top national security officials. The vote was postponed, but U.S. officials continued to monitor discussions over the Egyptian-authored resolution until Friday.\u00a0Obama spoke with national security advisor Susan Rice on Friday to issue his final decision. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s intervention in the discussions, which included a conversation with Egypt\u2019s president Thursday that preceded the delay in the planned vote, did not affect Obama\u2019s calculations, deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters.. \u201cThere\u2019s one president at a time,\u201d he said. The decision to allow the resolution to pass, rather than cast a veto to block it\u00a0\u201cis consistent with long-standing, bipartisan U.S. policy\u201d opposing Israeli settlement activity, Rhodes said. One of the administration\u2019s great concerns was that such activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem \u201chas accelerated significantly\u201d since 2011, when the U.S. last vetoed a comparable resolution. U.S. officials also have been concerned about continued incitements of violence by Palestinians, and Rhodes said the resolution voted on Friday included greater balance to reflect that than past resolutions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very concerned that these accelerating trends are putting the very viability of the two-state solution at risk,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cIn that context, we therefore thought that we could not in good conscience veto a resolution that expressed concerns about the very trends that are eroding the foundation for a two-state solution.\u201d He also underscored what he called Obama\u2019s iron-clad commitment to Israel and its security, noting that the administration recently concluded a major military assistance package. The U.S. did not vote for the resolution because of continued concerns about the United Nations as a venue for Middle East peace discussions, Rhodes said. He also responded to what he called \u201cstrident\u201d comments of Israeli officials criticizing the U.S. move. \u201cIt seems like the Israeli government wants the conversation to be about anything other than the settlement activity,\u201d he said.

(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) And now, another lesson from 2016: Do not mess up Megyn Kelly's Christmas card order. If you do, she's likely to do something she \"never\" does: Take to Twitter to call you\u00a0 a liar. Accuse you of a\u00a0\"coverup.\" Declare you deserve to be \"shamed.\" It will not be pretty. It's been a tumultuous year of lessons for all, but especially for Fox News star Kelly , who was crudely attacked by then-GOP nominee Donald Trump after a presidential debate, published a bestseller (Settle for More is #24 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list), helped take down the Fox media maestro, Roger Ailes, who made her a star, and now finds herself the most coveted soon-to-be-free agent journalist in all of TV news. Exclusive: Fox anchor Megyn Kelly describes scary, bullying 'Year of Trump' But Kelly spent part of Friday fulminating in tweets against Shutterfly , the online\u00a0publishing service best known for its photo books and do-it-yourself greeting cards. She was peeved, very peeved, about how they handled her family Christmas card order, which, apparently, did not get sent. Hey @Shutterfly - thanks for lying for weeks about sending out our Christmas card order only to admit today it was all B.S. #notprofessional \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) December 23, 2016 . \"I will never use this service again,\" she declared in the next tweet, adding she was lied to by Shutterfly up until they \"admitted later they failed & covered it up.\" Something had to be done. FWIW, I have never used twitter to publicly shame a company before in my life. @Shutterfly was so outrageously deceptive, they deserved it. \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) December 23, 2016 Some of Kelly's many Twitter fans sent her suggestions: Next time, try Simply To Impress , offered one tweeter, who described the service as \"cheaper, better and faster!\" \"Great! Am in the market for a new service & will definitely check out @SimplytoImpress. Everyone makes mistakes but lying is a deal breaker,\" Kelly replied. Let that be another lesson for all. USA TODAY reached out to Shutterfly for comment or explanation but there was no immediate response. The company has not responded on Twitter. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "By Tara Bahrampour December 23 at 5:09 PM Follow @TaraBahrampour For 73 years \u2014 through wars in Europe and Asia and civil rights battles at home, through the assassination of a president and the rise of rock-and-roll \u2014 they shared a bed. He\u2019d be gone sometimes, flying missions during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, but he always came back to her. So now, as he lies in a hospital bed unable to say or do much, she lies beside him. Like many hospitals, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, where retired Army Col. George Morris, 94, is receiving end-of-life care, allows family members to sleep in a patient\u2019s room on a foldout couch. But for George\u2019s wife, Eloise, 91, a cancer survivor who has suffered two broken hips and a broken shoulder, that would be hard. So the hospital made a special exception when they admitted him this month: They admitted her as a patient, too \u2014 a \u201ccompassionate admission,\u201d their doctor calls it. Standard rooms are normally private, but Eloise\u2019s hospital bed was rolled in and pushed up against George\u2019s \u2014 a final marriage berth for a husband and wife who met as teenagers in rural Kentucky in the late 1930s. He spotted her first. \u201cI was a sophomore in high school and I\u2019d gone to see a play in a country school,\u201d said Eloise, sitting up in her reclining bed, a birdlike woman in oversize bifocals whose hair is hardly touched by gray. George rested in his bed beside her. \u201cHe saw me and went home and told his mother, \u2018I just met the girl I\u2019m going to marry.\u2019 He said, \u2018I looked her over real well and I couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with her but one crooked tooth.\u2019 \u201d A movie date and a picnic followed. Eloise can\u2019t recall the movie \u2014 she was too distracted by the thrill of holding his hand in the dark. The picnic, however, was unforgettable. \u201cHere comes George and he had something in his hand with a crank on the end and I wondered what this was.\u201d It was something she\u2019d never seen before \u2014 a portable phonograph, and when he turned the crank it started playing \u201cSweet Eloise,\u201d a popular song at the time. He turned that crank all afternoon. \u201cOh, I thought that was great.\u201d The town of Russell Springs, Ky., where she lived on a farm, was eight miles from Columbia, where he lived. He didn\u2019t have a car, so he\u2019d walk the distance to see her. By 15 she was wearing an engagement ring and had no doubts about what she was doing. \u201cHe had thick eyebrows and devilish eyes, and I hadn\u2019t seen any guys my way that good- looking,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that he was more intelligent than any man I\u2019d ever met.\u201d They married and had two sons and a German shepherd who played outfield in family softball games. After stints in Tokyo and Alaska, they eventually settled in Annandale, Va. Those legendary eyebrows are wispy now, the devilish eyes half-closed as he lies beside a tray of juice and apple sauce. But every now and then as she spoke he chimed in, his voice rising alongside hers like an echo. \u201cWe had some lean times but some great times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of material things, but we could sure have a sweet time. There was lots of love around. George could always make me feel so protected.\u201d It was a stark contrast from her youth \u2014 her father left her mother before she was born, and she grew up an only child, helping her mother and grandparents tend to the sheep and cows and chickens. As partners, the two complemented each other. \u201cHe was strong-willed. I don\u2019t mean bossy-bossy. But his father would say, \u2018Eloise knows how to make George think he\u2019s boss.\u2019 Some people might call that tricky, but I know how to keep people happy. I know how to keep George thinking that he\u2019s making the decisions.\u201d Being married to an airman had its challenges. He took her up once in a P-51 Mustang fighter plane and it nearly killed her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear and I was very sick to my stomach. When he did the roll, that was fine, but when he did the loop, well, I kind of blacked out and my mouth opened and I just couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d George had a lot of friends who didn\u2019t come back from the wars. During Vietnam, \u201che said one of the saddest things was when he brought the dead soldiers home \u2014 he said that was heartbreaking because they were so young.\u201d He retired in the 1970s. The secret to seven decades of love? \u201cBe happy, whether you\u2019re happy or not. Laugh.\u201d Like they did the time they were posted somewhere new and they arrived before their belongings \u2014 including their sheets and pillows. \u201cWe cut up the newspaper and put our heads on one duffle bag, and every time we moved, the paper in it would rattle and we laughed all night,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cWe really, really loved each other. We were lonely, lonely when we were apart, and when he\u2019d come home, it was just heaven.\u201d Their sons have since died \u2014 the older one three or four years ago, the younger one several months ago \u2014 and most of their grandchildren, great- grandchildren, and a great-great-grandson live in other towns. Although they visit sometimes, it is mostly just the two of them. Admitting Eloise so she could be with George was not a hard decision, said the couple\u2019s doctor, U.S. Army Maj. Seth Dukes. \u201cWe take care of the people who\u2019ve taken care of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we extend that to their loved ones.\u201d At this point, Dukes said, George is dealing with a combination of medical issues, and the goal is to keep him comfortable. For Eloise, it\u2019s hard to see him unable to talk or eat much. \u201cThe expression on his face has changed; his eyes just look fixed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see somebody lose everything, especially the days that he doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d But her presence seems to comfort him. \u201cHe talks in his sleep, and when he starts I just put my hand on his and he stops.\u201d And during the day, she talks to him. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t know if he can hear me, I always thank him for looking after me so well.\u201d An aide peeked in. Eloise seemed tired. So she did what comes most naturally: She lay down beside her husband and reached for him, their hands now mottled and roped with veins, but their fingers still knowing how to intertwine. local ",

    "text": "Air Force facing dire personnel shortage By Lucas Tomlinson Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Earlier this year, top Air Force officials sounded the alarm about their thinning ranks -- saying they were 700 pilots and 4,000 mechanics short. Now they warn the problem is far worse. Under the latest estimates, the Air Force says it needs 30,000 airmen in the next five or six years. Today, the Air Force has 317,000 airmen.\u00a0 \"[T]he shortage of people has fundamentally changed the way we do business in terms of the operational risk day to day,\" Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein said in a statement. The former head of Air Force intelligence says it's not just the airmen needing a boost. \u201cWe've got a geriatric Air Force,\" said retired Lt. Gen. David Deptula. \u201cWe've got bombers and tankers that are over 50 years old. We have [training aircraft] that are over 40 years old, and we have [fighter jets] and helicopters that are over 30 years old. So this is a terrible place to be in when you have a world of ever-expanding threats.\u201d Air Force officials say they need\u00a0forces to bolster nuclear, intelligence, space and maintenance jobs. Earlier this year, Goldfein called the pilot shortage alone a crisis. \u201cAir superiority is not an American birthright. It's actually something you have to fight for and maintain,\u201d he told Pentagon reporters in August. On a visit to Shaw Air Force base, home of the 20th Fighter Wing, the former wing commander said the force has been at war for decades. \u201cYour Air Force has been at war since Desert Shield/Desert Storm. This wing has been at war since that time for 25 years. We went to the Middle East when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and we never left,\" said Col. Stephen Jost. At the start of the Gulf War, the Air Force had 134 fighter squadrons. Over the past few decades, that number has been cut to 55. Yet, the Air Force is conducting nearly 70 percent of the strike missions against ISIS and conducting 90 percent of midair refueling missions over Iraq and Syria since August 2014. The Air Force is not the only service that wants to grow. The United States Navy says it wants to increase its fleet by 30 percent as threats around the world intensify. Today, the Navy has 273 ships and submarines, and a new Navy study released by the secretary of the Navy last week says it needs 355 in the future. The focus is on attack submarines, necessary to keep tabs on the growing threat from China and what officials call the continued \u201cmilitarization\u201d of the South China Sea. The Army and Marine Corps have also expressed a desire to grow their personnel, and get badly needed spare parts for their equipment and aircraft. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Mr. Putin said again, as he had on Thursday, that the Russian armed forces were now strong enough to repulse any attacker . He suggested that officials from the Obama administration had overreacted by pointing out that the Russian military was far weaker than that of the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cOf course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,\u201d Mr. Putin said toward the beginning of the news conference, which typically lasts four hours or more. \u201cAs for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his election campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general,\u201d he added. Mr. Putin said that any new Russian nuclear weapons would stay within the limits of existing treaties. Although Moscow and Washington have taken to rattling sabers more than in the past, experts said that the architecture of previous nuclear arms treaties has so far held. In 2007, Russia spent 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, Mr. Putin said, but the figure grew to 4.7 percent in 2016. Russia spent about $52 billion on its military in 2015. He said that the proportion would gradually decline to 2.8 percent again by 2019. \u201cThis will not have an impact on our plan to increase our defense capabilities,\u201d he said. The budget cuts are being forced by an extended recession, though Mr. Putin tried to put a positive spin on that, as well. He said the overall economy had contracted 3.7 percent in 2015 and probably a further 0.5 to 0.6 percent in 2016, but that some sectors were expanding, like agriculture, which grew 4 percent. He said this had happened despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. In retaliation, Russia has banned imports of many Western dairy and other agricultural products. Some analysts have suggested that the growth in agriculture was nothing exceptional. Mr. Putin also noted other positive signs, including that inflation and capital outflows had slowed, but he said that there were still problems, including a drop in personal income for most Russians. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the American election, Mr. Putin said the Democrats were trying to blame their defeat on external factors like Russia. He said his popularity among American Republicans was not personal, but a reflection of their worldview. \u201cIt means that a significant part of the American people have the same perception about how the world should be developing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is good that people support us in this, in terms of traditional values.\u201d He said it was a good basis for improving Russian-American relations. Mr. Putin mocked recent statements by President Obama and others that former President Ronald Reagan would be turning in his grave over the support for Russia and for Mr. Putin among Republicans. If anything, he said, it would be former presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt who would be turning in their graves over the losses suffered by the Democratic Party. Mr. Roosevelt united the country, Mr. Putin said, but \u201cthe current administration divides it.\u201d The Obama administration has accused Russia of interfering in the American election , not least by hacking the computers at the Democratic National Committee and releasing emails embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton. Although Mr. Putin did not publicly endorse either candidate during the campaign, his administration made its preference for Mr. Trump clear. Among other reasons for disliking Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Putin has blamed her for the street demonstrations in Russia in 2011 and 2012 that greeted his return to the presidency, citing her endorsement of the protests while she was secretary of state to accuse her of fostering them. Asked directly about statements by Mr. Obama that he had warned Mr. Putin to stop hacking in the United States, Mr. Putin said that he would not reveal the contents of a private conversation. But he repeated statements by Mr. Trump that anyone could have done the hacking, including someone in the United States sitting on his couch. And Mr. Putin repeated his usual response to questions about the hacking, saying the main point was the contents of the emails and the light they shed on the Democrats\u2019 activities and plans. A version of this article appears in print on December 24, 2016, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Putin Chides Democrats for \u2018Humiliation\u2019 of Clinton Defeat.

Eric Trump said he would stop soliciting donations because he worried about the perception of buying access to his father. He says his namesake foundation has raised more than $15 million for terminally ill children. Trump tweeted early Friday, \"My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!\" Trump's tweets followed an Associated Press report that Eric Trump's foundation financially benefits charities connected to his family and members of his foundation's board. 0 Shares ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Carol Morello and Ruth Eglash December 23 at 2:27 PM Follow @CMorelloWP Follow @reglash The U.N. Security Council on Friday passed a resolution demanding that Israel cease Jewish settlement activity on Palestinian territory in a unanimous vote that passed when the United States abstained rather than using its veto as it has reliably done in the past. The resolution declares settlements constructed on land Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, including in East Jerusalem, to have \u201cno legal validity.\u201d It said settlements threaten the viability of the two-state solution, and it urged Israelis and Palestinians to return to negotiations that will lead to two independent nations. The United States\u2019 abstention Friday was a rare rebuke to Israel, and it reflected mounting frustration in the Obama administration over settlement growth that the United States considers an obstacle to peace. With President Obama\u2019s time in office due to end in barely a month, his decision not to veto was a last-minute symbolic statement of that displeasure and a sense of exasperation that the time has come for two states to be carved out of the contested land. The administration\u2019s move also defied Donald Trump\u2019s call on Thursday for the United States to veto the resolution. The incoming Trump administration has signaled that there will be a shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, a point the president-elect hammered home about an hour after Friday\u2019s vote when he tweeted, \u201cAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\u201d Trump has supported moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has appointed David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who believes Israelis should annex and settle the West Bank, as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel. (Reuters) [Trump picks a supporter of West Bank settlements for ambassador to Israel] It is unclear what, if any, impact this resolution will have. Resolutions reflect the opinion and will of the 15 members of the Security Council, but legal scholars differ about how binding they are. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not abide by the terms of the settlements resolution. About 400,000 Jews live in roughly 150 settlements in the West Bank on land that the Palestinians want for a future state east of the line formed after the 1967 war. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to become the capital of their future state. Many Israelis consider the settlements to be in the ancestral homeland of the Jews and refer to them by their biblical names, Judea and Samaria. Most nations consider the settlements illegal. U.S. diplomats characterize them as illegitimate and say they exacerbate tensions between Israelis and the Palestinians who live nearby, thereby undercutting efforts to advance peace. Twice, the Obama administration has made concerted attempts to broker peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. The most recent, involving nine months of intense diplomacy by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, collapsed in 2014, and nothing has been able to revive the talks. Throughout the year, the administration has been increasingly vocal in its exasperation. The State Department has issued several sharp criticisms of settlement construction, in July calling it \u201cprovocative and counterproductive.\u201d Since then, more than 2,600 housing units have been built in settlements. [Even Israel says this Jewish settlement is illegal. Now comes the showdown. ] Still, the United States agreed this year to provide Israel with $38\u00a0billion in military aid over 10 years, the largest such package ever. U.S. and Israeli officials both have said security and military cooperation between the two countries has remained excellent, even when Obama and Netanyahu have clashed. The international community has shown increasing impatience with the intractability of the \u00adIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. Proposals have been put forth in the last year by Egypt, France, and a group made up of the European Union, the United Nations, Russia and the United States. Israel has blamed the impasse on Palestinian refusal to recognize the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians blame Israel for occupying lands they consider rightfully theirs. The 14-to-0 vote, with only the United States abstaining, followed an intense campaign from Israel to derail it. It was to have been voted on Thursday, but Egypt withdrew its sponsorship after the country\u2019s president spoke by phone with Trump, who got involved at Israel\u2019s request. Friday\u2019s resolution was sponsored by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal. The resolution\u2019s passage brought a swift reaction, particularly in Israel and in Congress. Netanyahu said Friday that he welcomed Trump replacing Obama, whose administration, he said, had \u201ccolluded\u201d in a diplomatic assault on Israel. \u201cIsrael rejects this shameful \u00adanti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office. \u201cThe Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes.\u201d \u201cThis is absolutely shameful,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement, promising that next year \u201cour unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel.\u201d But Palestinian diplomats called the resolution a chance to salvage the possibility of two states and exulted in seeing the U.N. pass a resolution reflecting their views. \u201cAfter years of allowing the law to be trampled and the situation to spiral downward, today\u2019s resolution may rightly be seen as a last attempt to preserve the two-state solution and revive the path for peace,\u201d Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said Friday. Kerry said he would speak more in the coming days about the U.N. vote and \u201cthe way ahead\u201d for Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cThat future is now in jeopardy, with terrorism, violence and incitement continuing and unprecedented steps to expand settlements being advanced by avowed opponents of the two-state solution,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThat is why we cannot in good conscience stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\u201d Friday\u2019s resolution also condemned Palestinian incitement to violence and all acts of terrorism. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States would not have allowed its passage without that proviso. She also criticized the United Nations itself, saying it had perpetuated a double standard by repeatedly condemning Israeli actions while remaining silent about Palestinian incitement. In the hours before the vote, Israeli media reported harsh criticism toward Obama and Kerry coming from an unnamed official in Netanyahu\u2019s office. The office accused them of having \u201cabandoned\u201d Israel by refusing the block the resolution with a veto. White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday that the administration's pursuit of a two-state solution is \u201cguided by our belief that it is the only way to preserve Israel\u2019s security in the long run.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama has done more for Israel and its security than any previous U.S. president,\u201d Rhodes told reporters. That argument did not assuage Israeli anger at the U.S. decision not to veto the resolution, a decision the Obama administration still had not shared with the Israeli government a few hours before the vote. According to an Israeli official who spoke on the condition on anonymity because the conversations were private, a White House official told an Israeli official Thursday that the United States is Israel\u2019s best friend. The Israeli replied, \u201cFriends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council.\u201d Eglash reported from Jerusalem.

    "text": "UN Security Council Votes to End Israeli Settlements as US Abstains By Meghan Keneally Dec 23, 2016, 3:25 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH UN Security Council Votes to End Israeli Settlements After Trump Called for Veto 0 Shares Email The United Nations Security Council has passed a previously postponed vote to end Israeli settlements after the U.S. abstained from voting. U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power gave a statement after the vote saying that the U.S. chose not to vote on the resolution \"because the resolution is too narrowly focused on settlements.\" She began her statement in the Security Council with the words of Ronald Reagan in 1985 that settlements are \u201cin no way necessary for the security of Israel\u201d and \u201conly diminishes the confidence of Arabs.\u201d Justin Lane/EPA The U.N. Security Council votes to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction, Dec. 23, 2016, as Samantha Power, center at top, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, abstains. The Obama administration vetoed a very similar resolution in 2011, but Power today said the circumstances have changed dramatically because the growth of settlements has accelerated and efforts to pursue peace have failed. The controversial vote occurred a day after President-elect Donald Trump called for the resolution in question to be vetoed and after he had a call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. Egypt had previously sponsored the resolution but are no longer one of the sponsors. The meeting was listed on the revised Security Council schedule as being about \"the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.\" Trump Weighs In on Israeli Settlements While White House Stays Mum Israel is against the resolution. Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N., made it clear before the vote took place that he did not want it to pass. \u201cThis resolution is a Palestinian initiative which is intended to harm Israel,\u201d Danon, who has in the past supported groups raising money for settlements, said in a statement after the announcement was made that the vote was back on. \u201cWe call on the United States to stand by us and we expect our greatest ally to continue with its long-standing policy and to veto this resolution,\" Danon said in the statement. For his part, Trump has made it clear that he thinks it should be vetoed. \"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations. This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis,\" Trump said in a statement on Thursday. His call to El Sisi also touched on the subject. \"They agreed on the need to allow the new U.S. administration to deal in a comprehensive manner with all aspects of the Palestinian issue so as to achieve a comprehensive and final settlement for this issue,\" El Sisi's office said in a statement about the call. Trump sent a new tweet shortly after the resolution passed, saying \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J.

Mitch McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump have big plans for the new year with their party controlling both the White House and Congress. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images House Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump have big plans for the new year with their party controlling both the White House and Congress. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Just before House Republicans re-elected Paul Ryan as their speaker, the Wisconsin Republican made a bold proclamation. \"Welcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,\" Ryan told reporters one week after Election Day. \"This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people.\" Ryan continued: \"If we are going to put our country back on the right track, we have got to be bold, and we have to go big.\" FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's First 100 Days Action Plan That \"be bold, go big\" agenda is still in its early planning stages, but Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming President Donald Trump have outlined plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the federal tax code, slash federal regulations, invest in infrastructure projects and seal the U.S.-Mexico border. All told, it's a legislative program that would affect every single person and business in America. A lot can get done in the first two years Recent history is on the GOP's side. When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping \u2014 albeit politically polarizing \u2014 legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration \u2014 when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president \u2014 has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints. Article continues after sponsorship CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration President Obama's health care law and Wall Street overhaul both passed in 2010 under Democratic control and along party lines. President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind education law and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act into law and enacted a round of tax cuts, as well as legislation that created the Department of Homeland Security after the Sept. 11 attacks in his first two years in the Oval Office. (Senate control flipped back and forth in 2001 and 2002 due to the defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont from the GOP, but Republicans controlled Congress for the majority of Bush's first term in office.) President Bill Clinton signed the Family Medical Leave Act, gun-control legislation, including an assault weapons ban, and legislation to prevent and prosecute violence toward women before Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 wave election. \"Put up and show up\" McConnell has already outlined Republicans' plans to take aim at Obamacare and initiate an overhaul of the tax code in 2017. They also want to use the same budget rules that were used in the past to enact Bush's tax cuts and Obama's health care bill, because certain budget bills can't be filibustered in the Senate. \"The two biggest impediments to growth in our country are over-regulation and the tax structure,\" McConnell said. \"And the president-elect seems to be committed to addressing both of those, and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are as well.\" Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told conservative talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt that the first nine months of 2017 will be \"consumed\" by health care and tax legislative pushes. \"Now, it's time for being in the majority,\" Priebus said, \"and I can tell you President-elect Trump is going to lead the way to put up and show up.\" Democrats are skeptical Republicans will go through with it. Despite years of unanimous opposition to the law, the GOP has never found consensus on how to replace it. \"They don't know what to do,\" incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters before Congress adjourned for the year. \"They have nothing to put in its place and, believe me, just repealing Obamacare, even though they have nothing to put in its place and saying they'll do it sometime down the road, will cause huge calamity from one end of America to the other.\" Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid warned Republicans against dismantling the health care law. \"It will lead you into a quagmire that will cause pain for millions of Americans and bedevil you for the next four years,\" he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece. Is a Medicare overhaul coming? President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences Democrats like Reid and Schumer believe Republicans have misinterpreted the results of the 2016 election, with Trump claiming a mandate despite losing the popular vote and entering office with historically high negative ratings. Many Democrats say GOP efforts to dismantle Obamacare will hurt the party in the same way Bush's 2005 push to overhaul Social Security damaged the party and played a role in the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. \"We had a plan. We stuck with it. It was unified, strategic and unwavering,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., of the 2005 entitlement fight. Pelosi said Democrats won that legislative fight despite Bush enjoying high approval ratings at the time. That fight provides the blueprint Democrats are expected to follow next year to defend Obamacare and, potentially, GOP efforts to reshape Medicare. Ryan has long been a proponent of overhauling Medicare for future retirees from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support system in which seniors are given subsidies to purchase health insurance from the private market. Ryan will have a powerful ally next year: Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, shares Ryan's view on Medicare. But old rules and battle lines are unreliable future predictors for a Trump administration. At the risk of understatement, the incoming president has succeeded by defying political norms with a brand that appeals to the older, white voters that Democrats used to be able to rely on to scare Republicans away from touching entitlement programs. The \"Trump Wing\" has the upper hand among Republicans The Republican Party also remains philosophically divided between the traditional, interventionist, fiscal hawk \"Ryan Wing\" and the populist, isolationist \"Trump Wing\" of the party. Early signals point to the Trump Wing having the upper hand at the start. When Trump intervened with Indiana-based Carrier Corp. to pressure the company to remain in the U.S., Ryan, a staunch free-market conservative, applauded. \"Well, I'm pretty happy that we're keeping jobs in America, aren't you?\" Ryan said. Notably, one of the few voices of opposition to Trump was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin \u2014 an icon of the Tea Party movement \u2014 who called out the Carrier intervention as crony capitalism. It barely made a ripple. Another sign the Trump Wing of the party is ascendant: Ryan \u2014 long described as a rising star in the party \u2014 was booed at a Trump political rally in his home state of Wisconsin. Trump came to his defense. \"[Ryan] has been terrific and, you know, honestly, he is like a fine wine. Every day goes by I get to appreciate his genius more and more,\" Trump said, before adding a vaguely threatening disclaimer: \"Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that.\" It should be noted: Trump doesn't drink. \"I'm tired of divided government\" Ryan understands that 2017 is the best chance he will have in his political career so far to advance the causes he cares about. He recently discussed his discontent with divided government, which Washington has been operating under for the the past six years, a period that largely has been defined by polarization and obstruction, shutdown battles and ideological intransigence. \"I'm tired of divided government. It doesn't work very well,\" Ryan lamented a week prior to Election Day. \"We've gotten some good things done. But the big things \u2014 poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care \u2014 these things are stuck in divided government, and that's why we think a unified Republican government's the way to go.\" Up close, Congress has not been as unproductive as the public believes. Major legislation affecting health care, highways, public education and taxes has worked its way through the legislative process and made it to Obama's desk these past six years. One of the president's last acts was signing a sweeping $6.3 billion biomedical research bill that, among other ambitious goals, advances the cause of finding a cure for cancer. But the big, ideological battles over the size and scope of government have gone unsettled. Next year, Republicans will have their best chance in more than a decade to win the next chapter in that never-ending struggle and, maybe, redefine what it means to be a Republican in the Trump era.

Above, an Uber self-driving car during a test drive in San Francisco this month. (Eric Risberg / AP) Melissa Etehad Uber moved a fleet of self-driving vehicles to Arizona on Friday after California insisted it comply with local rules \u2014\u00a0a move that highlights the\u00a0regulatory discrepancies governing this new technology between states. The California Department of Motor Vehicles\u00a0revoked the registration of 16 Uber cars Wednesday because Uber refused to apply for a permit for testing autonomous vehicles. Uber\u2019s response: shipping the cars to a state where no such permits are required.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tactic that could have consequences for California\u2019s future as a hub for\u00a0self-driving technology, some experts said. Though California allows companies to test self-driving vehicles on its roads, it has established strict regulatory barriers.\u00a0For example, a company must gain approval from specific municipalities through which it plans to drive, according to Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. Self-driving vehicles in Arizona, however, operate with the \u201csame registration requirements as any other vehicle,\u201d according to the Arizona Department of Transportation . Such laws are a strategy to court high-tech companies \u2014\u00a0many of them based in California \u2014\u00a0and the people they employ. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who signed the executive order that gave self-driving vehicles the green light in his state, framed Uber\u2019s move on economic and regulatory terms.\u00a0 \u201cArizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads. While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses,\u201d Ducey said in a statement. But industry experts, including Jon Garon, dean and professor of law at Nova Southeastern University\u2019s Shepard Broad College of Law,\u00a0say California\u2019s track record proves its regulations are no impediment to innovation. California \u201chas created a fairly complex but pro innovation statute that balances the needs to develop the technology with the need to ensure public safety,\u201d Garon said. Twenty\u00a0companies, including Tesla and Google, abide by the state\u2019s self-driving ground rules.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 23, 2016 8:33 AM EST MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin said he sees \u201cnothing unusual\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to strengthen the U.S. nuclear forces, saying the statement is in line with the U.S. president-elect\u2019s campaign promises. Speaking at an annual news conference Friday, Putin also said Russia\u2019s military is stronger than that of any potential aggressor , though he admitted that the U.S. has a bigger military. \u201cIndeed, they have more missiles, more submarines and more aircraft carriers, we aren\u2019t arguing with that, but we are simply stronger than any aggressor.\u201d Is Donald Trump reviving the nuclear arms race? Putin says the Russian military modernization helped strengthen the nation\u2019s nuclear forces, adding that Russian military\u2019s nuclear missiles can penetrate any missile defense. Putin said Russia had to develop the capability after the U.S. in 2001 opted out of a Cold War-era treaty banning missile defense systems. He added that \u201cit\u2019s not us who have been speeding up the arms race.\u201d He argued that the modernization of Russian nuclear forces is in line with existing arms control agreements, including the New Start Treaty with the United States. He said that faced with the development of U.S. missile defense systems, Russia has developed nuclear weapons capable of piercing it. On Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team had attempted to clarify the president-elect\u2019s position on nuclear weapons .\u00a0 \u201cIn his quest to keep us safe and secure, he\u2019s putting the world on notice,\u201d senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC that day. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is we need to expand our nuclear capability, really our nuclear readiness or our capability to be ready for those who also have nuclear weapons. \u2026 I think that we\u2019re getting a little too far ahead of ourselves that he\u2019s changing policy and making policy in a way that he did not intend.\u201d\u00a0 On Friday, MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski reported that she had spoken with the president-elect regarding his tweet on the nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump reportedly told Brzezinski: \u201cLet it be an arms race because we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.\u201d\u00a0 Putin also praised Mr. Trump for keenly feeling American voters\u2019 mood to win the election, and he rejects the White House\u2019s accusations of meddling in the vote. He said that Russia hopes to develop \u201cbusinesslike and constructive relations that would benefit both Russia and the United States.\u201d In response to President Barack Obama, who said \u201cRonald Reagan would roll over in his grave\u201d upon seeing recent poll results showing that more than one-third of Republicans view Putin favorably, Putin said Reagan would be happy to see his party win. Putin also criticized the U.S. administration for trying to shift the blame for Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat by making claims of Russian interference. Putin said U.S. Democrats should have apologized to American voters over the information revealed by hackers who posted Democratic National Committee e-mails. Responding to accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election, Putin said that the hackers could have been located anywhere. He shrugged off Washington\u2019s claims of their Russian affiliation. Asked how he responded to Mr. Obama\u2019s hacking accusations brought up in their conversation, the Russian leader said he never makes confidential conversations public. ___ Putin touched on several other topics at his end-of-year press conference: Syria Putin said it\u2019s necessary to establish a cease-fire across the entire territory of Syria , to be followed by peace talks. Putin said that now that Syrian government forces have taken full control of Aleppo, \u201cthe next stage should be a cease-fire on the entire territory of Syria and the launch of talks on a political settlement.\u201d He said the leaders of Turkey and Iran, which have helped broker the withdrawal of the remaining civilians and militants from Aleppo, have agreed that Syria peace talks should be held in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, Astana. He added that Syrian President Bashar Assad agrees to that. Putin says that other regional players, including Saudi Arabia, could help contribute to peace efforts and the United States is welcome to join in. ___ Doping Putin said Russia will continue efforts to eradicate doping but fails to accept the widespread belief in world sports of a state-backed cheating program. He said Russia will work together with the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency to uproot doping, but added that some of the accusations against Russia have been unfair. He pointed at Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia\u2019s national anti-doping laboratory, accusing him of forging doping evidence against Russian athletes at the behest of foreign forces he didn\u2019t name. Putin said Rodchenkov was forcing Russian athletes to take illegal substances he had brought in from Canada, where he had previously worked. A WADA investigation has revealed massive tampering with doping samples in what it described as a state-sponsored scheme. Russia has denied the accusations of state sponsorship of doping and promised to help fix the shortcomings. ___ Ukraine Putin said that peace talks sponsored by France and Germany should remain the basis for efforts to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine . A peace deal brokered by Berlin and Paris in February 2015 has helped reduce the scale of fighting in eastern Ukraine, where more than 9,600 have died in battles between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists that erupted in April 2014. However, clashes have continued and political settlement has stalled. Putin said at a news conference Friday that the \u201cNormandy format hasn\u2019t been highly effective but there is nothing else, and work in that format should continue or the situation will deteriorate.\u201d Responding to demands to release Ukrainian filmmaker Oleh Sentsov and other Ukrainians jailed in Russia, Putin has called for a comprehensive deal to free all prisoners, including those held in Ukrainian prisons. ___ Ambassador\u2019s assassination Putin said the killing of the Russian ambassador to Turkey will not hurt cooperation between the two nations. He said the killing of Ambassador Andrei Karlov on Monday was \u201can attack on Russia-Turkey relations.\u201d Putin noted that the killer was a police officer, saying it reflected a high level of \u201cpenetration of destructive forces\u201d into the Turkish military and security forces. Turkish officials have claimed that the killer had links to the organization of Fethullah Gulen, a preacher who has been living in exile in the United States. Gulen has rejected the allegations. Putin said that despite the killing, Russia-Turkey relations will remain strong, noting cooperation with Ankara on Syria. ___ Economy Putin said the nation\u2019s economy is on the path to recovery, saying the Russian economy is expected to shrink by 0.6-0.7 percent this year - a much smaller decline compared to 2015 when it contracted by 3.7 percent. Russia is enduring a deep recession in the wake of Western sanctions and the sharp drop in oil prices. Putin said some sectors have posted growth this year, showing that the Russian economy is on the mend. Despite the economic backdrop, Putin said hard currency reserves of the Russian Central Bank increased this year, from $368 billion to about $385 billion. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
