By Elise Viebeck December 22 at 3:13 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Sean Spicer, right, and Jason Miller, left, talk with the media at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster on Nov. 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump named Republican National Committee official Sean Spicer as White House press secretary, filling what is likely to be a challenging position given Trump\u2019s sometimes hostile relationship with the media and his propensity to bypass staff to communicate directly with the public on Twitter. Spicer, the RNC\u2019s communications director since 2011 and chief strategist since 2015, has become an increasingly visible presence on Trump\u2019s team since the GOP nominee won the election on Nov. 8. Noted for his combative television interviews, he helps to lead daily transition news media calls and has a close relationship with RNC chairman Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff. Trump also announced that longtime aide Hope Hicks, his campaign press secretary, will serve as director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino will continue his current role as director of social media. Jason Miller, who leads the transition calls, will be communications director. [ Trump names campaign manager Kellyanne Conway as White House counselor to the president ] Spicer, Miller, Hicks and Scavino will all hold the title of assistant to the president, in addition to their other titles. \u201cSean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cI am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again.\u201d The announcement left open how Spicer, Miller and Hicks will divide up the communications work. Traditionally, the White House press secretary has served as the main conduit between the president and global media through daily news conferences. Priebus suggested last week that this practice could change in the new administration. \u201cLook, I think that many things have to change, and I think that it\u2019s important that we look at all of those traditions that are great, but quite frankly, as you know, don\u2019t really make news,\u201d Priebus said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cAnd you know, even looking at things like the daily White House briefing from the press secretary, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of different ways that things can be done, and I can assure you we\u2019re looking at that.\u201d Spicer went a bit further in a recent interview with Fox News. \u201cI think you have to look at everything. And so I don\u2019t know that it [the White House press briefing] needs to be daily. I don\u2019t know that they need to be on camera. And I think that\u2019s a view shared by a lot of former White House press secretaries, a view by some in the media, in fact, that the White House press briefings have become somewhat of a spectacle,\u201d Spicer told anchor Megyn Kelly on Dec. 15. The comments raised questions among transparency and press freedom advocates already concerned by limitations placed on the media by Trump\u2019s team. 1 of 31 ",

The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne \u2014 26-year-old man and 20-year-old woman \u2014 were released without being charged, a police statement said. Five men between ages 21 and 26 remained in custody. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship, police said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said. Police believed the threat had been neutralized through the raids Thursday night and Friday morning, he said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. Ashton said police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device ,\" Ashton said. He added: \"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" About 400 police officers were involved in the raids. Ashton described those arrested as \"self-radicalized\" and inspired by Islamic State propaganda. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "LOCAL L.A. Now More than 200 LAX flights canceled or delayed during holiday nightmare Several suspicious paackages were reported in three separate terminals Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of three terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. Veronica Rocha Planning on traveling through Los Angeles International Airport for the holidays?\u00a0You might have better luck hitching a ride on Santa\u2019s sleigh. Airport officials said nearly 230 flights have been either canceled or delayed as the first of two rain storms caused gridlock for hours and forced authorities to switch flight operations Wednesday and Thursday. Instead of flying west toward the ocean, planes were forced to head east over urban areas due to high winds, said airport spokeswoman Mary Grady. The switch, she said, \u201cslows things down.\u201d But that\u2019s not the only issue contributing to the crawl. \u201cThe airport is at capacity,\u201d she said. Airport terminals are packed with travelers because of the holiday season, Grady said. As holiday travelers flock to the airport, more equipment has been brought in to help with inspections. Daily takeoffs also increased from 1,750 to 1,900. And, if that wasn\u2019t enough, lost and forgotten luggage is causing major disruptions. On Wednesday, police evacuated passengers from three terminals after an unattended package was found. \u201cAs the day went on it started to back up,\u201d Grady said. Any time unattended baggage is spotted, airport workers are required to report it to police, Grady said. That triggers a massive response including bomb-sniffing\u00a0dogs, she said. In the rush of the holidays, it\u2019s easy to misplace items, Grady said. She asked passengers to keep their possessions close and make sure their baggage is with them at all times. Rain and snow in other parts of the country, she said, are also slowing operations in Los Angeles. Heavy snow in Colorado forced some airlines to cancel flights. Cancellations and delays have also affected travel in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a ripple effect,\u201d Grady said. But travelers can avoid headaches, she said, if they plan ahead. She advised passengers to check the status of their flights before they head to the airport. They should also monitor\u00a0weather or delays at their intended destinations. And don\u2019t forget to use same tips and plan ahead on Jan. 2 and 3 \u2014\u00a0those are the airport\u2019s busiest days.

    "text": "North Carolina's 'Anti-LGBT' Bill Likely to Remain Despite Election of Democratic Governor, Experts Say Jonathan Drake/Reuters North Carolina's House of Representatives convenes as the legislature considers repealing the controversial HB2 law limiting bathroom access for transgender people in Raleigh, North Carolina, Dec. 21, 2016. Many supporters of HB2 have argued that the law protects women and children from sexual offenders who, these supporters say, could falsely claim to be transgender to access bathrooms of the opposite sex. LGBT advocacy groups have dismissed such arguments, calling the idea of a \"bathroom predator\" a myth . The law became a main issue of contention during the gubernatorial race this year. McCrory, the Republican incumbent, stood by the bill during the race, while Democratic challenger Roy Cooper -- who is now the governor-elect -- argued the bill should be repealed. Election Day exit polls showed that 66 percent of North Carolina voters opposed HB2 while 29 percent supported it. Cooper said this month, after McCrory conceded defeat in the race, that state legislative leaders had promised to hold a special session to repeal HB2 if the Charlotte City Council rescinded its LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance. Republican lawmakers said earlier this year they had passed HB2 as a way to challenge Charlotte's ordinance. Charlotte rescinded its ordinance on Monday as part of the proposed deal, but the state's General Assembly failed to pass a bill repealing HB2 on Wednesday. The City of Charlotte said in a statement today that while it was \"disappointed with this unfortunate outcome, our commitment to maintaining and protecting diverse and inclusive communities remains unchanged.\" \u2014 City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) December 22, 2016 Cooper said in a news conference today that he was \"disappointed\" the effort to repeal failed: \"We have yet to remove the stain on the reputation of our great state that is around this country and around the world.\" My statement on yesterday's events at the General Assembly. pic.twitter.com/qCGD9Dz1ud \u2014 Roy Cooper (@RoyCooperNC) December 22, 2016 \"Republican legislative leaders failed to live up to their promise,\" the governor-elect said, after he and his staff had \"worked day and night over the past week to forge an agreement that would bring back the jobs and sporting events\" the state had lost in the backlash to the law. \"It is a shame that North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly is refusing to clean up the mess they made,\" Esseks of the ACLU said. \"The support for the LGBT community from political leaders, faith leaders, businesses, and everyday people that has emerged this year will not fade. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Antibiotic- and growth-hormone-free cattle gather at a farm in Yamhill, Ore. Despite farmers pledging to reduce or stop antibiotics use, a new report finds that sales of antibiotics for use on farms are going up. Don Ryan/AP hide caption toggle caption Don Ryan/AP Antibiotic- and growth-hormone-free cattle gather at a farm in Yamhill, Ore. Despite farmers pledging to reduce or stop antibiotics use, a new report finds that sales of antibiotics for use on farms are going up. Don Ryan/AP It's a continuing paradox of the meat industry. Every year, more restaurants and food companies announce that they will sell only meat produced with minimal or no use of antibiotics. And every year, despite those pledges, more antibiotics are administered to the nation's swine, cattle and poultry. According to the latest figures , released this week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, antibiotic sales for use on farm animals increased by 1 percent in 2015, compared to the previous year. The increase was slightly greater \u2013 2 percent \u2014 for antibiotics used as human medicine. The FDA and other public health agencies have been pushing farmers to rely less on these drugs. Heavy use of antibiotics both in human medicine and in agriculture has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, complicating the task of treating many infections. But the FDA finds a glimmer of good news in the latest figures, pointing out that the rate of increase has slowed. In the previous year, antibiotic use had increased by 4 percent, and a total of 22 percent from 2009 to 2014. Article continues after sponsorship The poultry industry has made the most ambitious promises to reduce antibiotic use. Perdue Farms says that 95 percent of its chickens already are raised with no antibiotics at all. Tyson Foods, the largest producer, has announced that it is \"striving\" to end the use of antibiotics that also are used in human medicine. Tyson will continue to deploy a class of antibiotics called ionophores, which can't be used on humans. The new report, however, doesn't shed any light on the impact of these moves, because it doesn't show how much of each drug is used on cattle, swine or poultry. In a statement, David Wallinga, from the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that \"this report further underscores how urgently we need more and stronger government action\" to reduce antibiotic use. Ron Phillips, from the Animal Health Institute, which represents veterinary drug manufacturers, says that the FDA's data on drug sales tell us little about what's most important \u2014 whether the use of those drugs is leading to more drug-resistant bacteria. He says that another recent government report , from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, shows \"very encouraging trends.\" According to that report, bacteria found on meat at slaughter have not shown increasing resistance to most antibiotics in recent years. There are some concerning trends, however. Some species of bacteria found on cattle have shown increasing levels of resistance to ciproflaxin, and turkey samples showed a big increase in Salmonella that's resistant to several different drugs.

USA TODAY President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Dec. 21, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump Thursday decried the state of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal,\u00a0saying in a tweet that it had to be strengthened \u201cgreatly\u201d during uncertain times. \u201cThe United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,\u201d he tweeted. Trump made his remarks a day after receiving a national security briefing from a group of mostly senior military officers, including Air Force\u00a0 Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein , deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 A nuclear arms reduction expert reacted to Trump's tweet with alarm. Joseph\u00a0Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund , said similar statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin could trigger a new and destabilizing nuclear arms race. The United States\u00a0and Russia have 95%\u00a0of the world's nuclear weapons, but smaller nuclear powers, such as China, North Korea, India and Pakistan, may view their statements as a call to bolster their own arsenals, he said. Read more: U.S., Russia dominate nuclear weapons list \"If the two guys with the biggest arsenals are talking about expanding, they're\u00a0sending a message to the other guys that it's time to start their engines,\" Cirincione said. \"And we\u2019re off to the races.\" An alternative, Cirincione suggested, would be for Trump and Putin to establish a relationship in which arms reduction is a centerpiece. \"He could assure his place his place in the history books with the deal of a lifetime,\" Cirincione said. Later Thursday afternoon, Jason Miller, Trump's communications director, said Trump was referring to potential nuclear terrorism and other issues. \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,\" Miller said in a statement. \"He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\u201d None of that was clear in Trump's initial tweet, and the president-elect did not speak publicly or send another tweet with more information. What's a triad? During the campaign for the Republican nomination and the general election, Trump struggled to show a firm grasp of U.S. nuclear strategy and capability. In a Republican debate, Trump failed to define the \u201cnuclear triad,\u201d the U.S. nuclear strategy of relying on three weapons platforms to launch weapons \u2014\u00a0bombers, land-based missiles and submarine-launched missiles. The decades-long strategy is meant to deter enemies from attacking because they will be unable to prevent a devastating response. Trump has also suggested that U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, all of whom rely on the U.S. nuclear deterrent, could acquire nuclear weapons for their own defense. The Pentagon, in its 2017, budget has several initiatives aimed at modernizing its nuclear arsenal. Among them is a $2.1 billion program to develop a new, radar-evading long-range bomber.

Robert Jervis, professor of international affairs at Columbia University and an expert on nuclear weapons, downplayed the notion that Trump\u2019s tweet would set off a new arms race. More troubling, he said, is that there\u2019s no evidence that Trump has thought long or hard about the policies for maintain and using them. Does he want to spend more than the $350 billion the Obama administration has proposed to modernize them, Jervis asked? What happens if Putin rejects his offers for better relations? The problems are complex, and the stakes exceedingly high, he said. \u201cUnless we\u2019re being fooled and he\u2019s done great thinking, these tweets are off the top of his head and are immediate responses,\u201d said Jervis, who acknowledged being a lifelong Democrat. \u201cIf you try to dig deep there isn\u2019t anything there. There\u2019s a reason states don\u2019t communicate in 140 characters without serious staff work.\u201d Gen David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, has emphasized the importance of the service's nuclear mission during a trip this week to air bases around the country. He spent a night in a missile alert facility in Nebraska and met with crew members and security personnel there. He has said the Air Force's top priority is maintaining a safe, secure and effective nuclear enterprise. The world has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of nuclear weapons in the last 25 years, Pentagon records show. Dec. 12 was the 25th anniversary of the\u00a0 Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 Since then, Pentagon statistics show, more than 7,600 nuclear warheads have been deactivated, while the United States, Russia and former Soviet republics have destroyed more than 3,600 missiles and missile launchers, 33 submarines, 155 bombers, more than 1.6 million chemical munitions, and more than 4,000 metric tons of chemical weapons.

Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images A woman is vaccinated at a health center in Conakry, Guinea, during the clinical trials of a vaccine against the Ebola virus. Cellou Binani /AFP/Getty Images When Ebola struck West Africa a few years ago, the world was defenseless. There was no cure. No vaccine. And the result was catastrophic: More than 11,000 people died. Nearly 30,000 were infected. Now it looks like such a large outbreak is unlikely to ever happen again. Ever. The world now has a potent weapon against Ebola: a vaccine that brings outbreaks to a screeching halt, scientists report Thursday in The Lancet. \"We were able to estimate the efficacy of the vaccine as being 100 percent in a trial with more than 5,000 people,\" says Ira Longini , a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who helped test the vaccine. \"It's very unusual to have a vaccine that protects people perfectly.\" Now, no vaccine \u2014 or drug for that matter \u2014 is perfect. And efficacy of the vaccine is clearly high but not \"100 percent.\" That value reflects the fact that they just haven't tested the vaccine on enough people yet. So it is likely to decrease as the vaccine is used over time. In the end, the efficacy is likely to sit somewhere between about 70 percent and 100 percent, Longini says. Article continues after sponsorship By comparison, the flu vaccine last year was about 50 percent effective. And the Ebola vaccine works lightning fast, within four or five days, he says. So it could even be given after a person is exposed to Ebola but hasn't yet developed the disease. Longini and his colleagues tested the vaccine on about 4,000 people in Guinea back in 2015, when Ebola was still spreading there. These people were at high risk of getting Ebola because they had had contact with someone who was infected. When they got the vaccine right away, they were completely protected. No one got sick. The vaccine \u2014 called rVSV-ZEBOV \u2014 hasn't been approved yet by either the World Health Organization or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That's predicted to happen sometime in 2018. And there are still a few open questions about the vaccine, says Dr. Anthony Fauci , at the National Institutes of Health. \"For example, we don't know how durable the vaccine is,\" he says. \"If you give health care workers the vaccine, for example, how long would they be protected? That's very important to learn.\" What is clear is that the vaccine offers short-term protection during outbreaks. And that's exactly what's needed to stop the virus from spreading and keep small outbreaks from getting out of control. For this reason, GAVI \u2014 the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \u2014 has already spent $5 million to stockpile the vaccine. \"So we have made 300,000 doses available, as of earlier this year, if there was to be sort of any resurgence or any kind of emergency,\" says Swati Gupta at Merck , which is manufacturing the shot. Vaccines typically take years, even a decade to test. But the field trials for this one took less than two years. \"It's been a pretty tremendous experience,\" Gupta says. \"There's been a lot of international partners that have come together in a real unprecedented effort.\" The magnitude of the outbreak in West Africa, she says, made companies, governments and academics push aside their own research agendas to come together and finish a vaccine.

(Photo: Courtesy image) EAST LANSING - A University of Michigan football player was arraigned Wednesday\u00a0on four charges related to a sexual assault that officials say took place in East Lansing in October. Grant Perry, a\u00a0sophomore wide receiver from Royal Oak, was arraigned in East Lansing in 54B District Court on one felony count of assaulting, battering, resisting or obstructing an officer, two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual assault and an underage drinking charge. He is accused of touching a female who was waiting in line outside a downtown East Lansing bar at 12:20 a.m. Oct. 15. \"When (police) arrived on scene, we tried to grab onto him, and we had to chase him,\" said Lt. Scott Wriggelsworth, a spokesman for the East Lansing Police Department. \"In the midst of that fracas, one of our officers suffered a minor hand injury.\" Michigan did not have a football game the weekend of the incident. Perry was suspended for the team's game the following week in Ann Arbor, for what head coach Jim Harbaugh then described as \"disciplinary reasons.\" On Thursday, Michigan Associate Athletic Director Dave Ablauf sent the following statement: \"The University was made aware of the arrest of student-athlete Grant Perry earlier this fall. He was immediately suspended from all team activities at that time and missed two games. Based on the information at that time, Grant was allowed to resume team activities pending the outcome of the investigation. Upon being informed that charges would be filed, he was immediately and indefinitely suspended from all team activities until the legal process is completed.\" East Lansing officials in November issued a press release asking anyone who witnessed the incident to contact police, although Perry was not identified as a suspect in the release. Perry, 19, turned himself in Wednesday and was released on a personal recognizance bond, Wriggelsworth said. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan 5, according to court records. In the meantime, Perry has been barred from contact with the victim. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Perry was the team's fourth-leading receiver this season, having caught 13 passes in 10 games. The sixth-ranked Wolverines play Florida State Dec. 30\u00a0in the Orange\u00a0Bowl.

    "text": "New Rules May Curb Classroom Cupcakes By BETTINA ELIAS SIEGEL Continue reading the main story Photo School parties can bring a wide range of food into the classroom, from fresh fruit treats to homemade cupcakes and processed junk food. Credit Phil Marino for The New York Times The season of junk-food-laden classroom holiday parties is upon us. And while some parents see all the cake, candy and salty snacks as a harmless indulgence during a festive season, others object to any unhealthy food in the classroom. Now the federal government is stepping in to help address the issue of classroom food. Federal school nutrition rules from the Department of Agriculture approved this past summer now require school districts participating in federal lunch or breakfast programs to come up with a nutritional standard for all foods and drinks offered to children at school, including those served by parents at classroom parties and treats awarded by teachers as prizes for a correct answer. The new standards won\u2019t go into effect until the 2017-18 school year, but right now, school district wellness committees around the country are debating which foods and drinks, if any, should be barred at the classroom door. While it\u2019s too soon to say how most districts will respond to the federal mandate, there\u2019s room for improvement in many classrooms. According to a national survey of school district wellness policies conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, most districts don\u2019t have standards for the foods and drinks served at classroom parties. Although nearly one in four districts discourage teachers from giving food as a reward, only 13 percent prohibit the practice. One option for districts is to simply adopt the so-called \u201cSmart Snacks\u201d rules that govern snacks and drinks sold to children through vending machines and school fund-raisers. The rules went into effect in 2014, and are familiar territory to most school districts. Adopting the Smart Snacks rules for classroom food would also steer parents toward store-bought items instead of homemade, reducing the risk of harm to food-allergic children. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cMany will use Smart Snacks because that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. But depending on a given community\u2019s nutritional ethos, the Smart Snacks rules could be seen as too lenient or too stringent. Unless otherwise exempted, homemade birthday cupcakes would be out, but many highly processed snacks, including some with considerable amounts of added sugar, would still be permissible. For instance, a Trix cereal bar , with 150 calories and more than 50 percent whole grain oats, would pass muster, even though the second and third ingredients are corn syrup and sugar. At the other end of the spectrum, districts could set a lax standard that intentionally does little or nothing to change the status quo. After the Smart Snacks rules were adopted, for instance, some states took advantage of a loophole to allow frequent sales of junk food for school fund-raising to continue. But that may not happen this time, since the federal rules require a wide range of stakeholders, including parents, to participate in the drafting process. \u201cWellness policies won\u2019t be decided by the state, but instead by local committees that will include teachers, school officials and members of the community,\u201d Ms. Wootan said. The new federal rules do require each school to appoint a staff member to help oversee the new healthy eating rules. And while states will audit a district\u2019s wellness policy every three years, they will review only a district\u2019s goals and its plan to implement them. In other words, says Ms. Wootan, \u201cThey won\u2019t be going into every classroom on Halloween to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d Parents can also have a voice in decisions made at their child\u2019s school. Individual schools have the option to institute classroom policies that are stricter than their district\u2019s standard. \u201cIf parents at a given school really want to take this issue on, they could,\u201d Ms. Wootan said. The National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity has created a useful clearinghouse of wellness policy guidance and resources from leading public health organizations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jodi Helman, who used to live in Stamford, Conn., said she believes more rules are needed. She said her daughter\u2019s previous elementary school took a decidedly lax approach to classroom food. \u201cThe amount of junk food was outrageous,\u201d she recalls. \u201cCandy was given out daily as rewards. The classrooms would have at least one party a week, sometimes two if it fell during a holiday.\u201d But her family recently moved to Barrington, R.I., where their new school has \u201ca zero-tolerance policy\u201d toward unhealthy food in the classroom. \u201cNo candy rewards, no cupcakes for birthdays, no holiday parties with food,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kids in Barrington live a healthy lifestyle, without even knowing it.\u201d ",

Since winning the election, Trump has said America's \"one-China\" policy regarding China and Taiwan is up for negotiation , tweeted that the US should refuse to accept an underwater drone seized and returned by China, criticized the intelligence community's findings on Russian hacking, and threatened to reverse ongoing overtures toward Cuba unless the Cuban government meets unspecified conditions.

Later in the day, Trump tweeted that the United States \"must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" Incoming leaders have typically abided by a \"one president at a time\" rule in order to avoid sending mixed messages and to give themselves time to consult intelligence and confer with their incoming cabinet and inherited civil service. \"It's confusing,\" Stephen Hess, a policy analyst at Brookings who has worked under presidents from both parties, said. \"The president-elect doesn't really have the power to do these things and, while suggesting them at this time, it may look very different to him after January 20.\" Related: Trump Stuns Nuclear Experts With Apparent Call to Expand Arsenal Trump shattered a variety of norms during the campaign and often complained about an atmosphere of \"political correctness\" that he said had prevented politicians from speaking plainly about challenges facing the country. Critics are concerned that his often unpredictable style could create problems for both his incoming administration and the current one. Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA) told NBC News he was so alarmed by Trump's behavior that he introduced the \"One President at a Time Act\" earlier this month, which would clarify that the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from conducting foreign policy, also applies to incoming presidents. \"In the past, president-elects have shown good judgement and restraint in understanding that our duly elected officials need to conduct foreign policy while they're in office,\" Huffman said. \"We've never had a president-elect with such impulse control problems.\" Modern presidents have used nearly identical language to skirt questions on foreign affairs during their transition. President Bill Clinton told the press after his 1992 victory that he would \"reaffirm the essential continuity of American foreign policy\" and recognized \"that America has only one president at a time.\" President George W. Bush declined questions on topics like North Korea and Israel until he took the oath of office in early 2001. \"We have one president, and we'll have one president, and the current president is President Clinton, and our nation must speak with one voice,\" Bush said at a press conference. Obama took a similar stance after his election in 2008, telling reporters that \"when it comes to foreign affairs, it is particularly important to emphasize that there is one president at a time\" after declining a question on Israeli operations in Gaza. He notably repeated the phrase last month after Trump's election, reminding the press that \"there is one president at a time\" before embarking to meet foreign leaders in Greece, Germany, and Peru.

Donald Trump faces a struggle proving himself to white, suburban women, who could be crucial in the November general election.</p> Close AP Photo/Ted S. Warren Donald Trump\u2019s transition team asked the State Department this week for information on its \u201cgender-related staffing, programming, and funding,\u201d raising questions over whether the incoming administration will slash U.S. efforts promoting women\u2019s equality worldwide. A one-page memo, obtained and published by the New York Times, was sent to senior State Department staffers Wednesday requesting that the offices provide further information \u201coutlining existing programs and activities to promote gender equality, such as ending gender-based violence, promoting women\u2019s participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc.\u201d Trump team wants names of Energy Dept. staff who worked on climate change While the document did not request specific names of employees working on these programs, it asked for the specific positions dedicated to gender parity issues and more information about funding amounts to these programs over the last year. Employees were instructed to respond by 5 p.m. on the same day it was sent out, according to the Times. The president\u2019s transition team explained it in a statement as a way to find methods to better such programs.\u00a0 \u201cPresident-elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected,\u201d the team said in a statement to CBS News. \u201cTo help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender-based violence, and promotes economic and political participation\u2014finding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests.\u201d During a State briefing Thursday, department spokesperson John Kirby said that \u201cit is normal, it is usual, it is typical, it is expected\u201d for such questions on the bureaucracy to be asked during a presidential transition period. \u201cIn helping any new team get a grip on a new organization that as they try to understand bureaus and how they\u2019re manned that there is going to be a discussion, there needs to be a discussion about what positions will remain open for them to fill and what positions they might not have to worry about filling,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen a new captain comes aboard a ship, you tell him who\u2019s on board and what jobs they have and how the ship operates. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d Still, though Kirby suggested there was nothing unusual about the memo, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that the document unnerved some State Department employees who feared that some would be singled out over work they\u2019d done on gender-related issues. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top ranking woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was equally wary of the Trump transition team request, calling it \u201cconcerning\u201d and requesting the transition \u201cclarify their intent.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI pledge to work with the incoming Administration to advance policies that support and protect women and girls worldwide,\u201d Shaheen wrote in a statement to CBS News, \u201cbut I can promise that if the next administration intends to roll back programs designed to lift women up, it will very quickly meet stiff opposition in the Senate.\u201d During Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, she prioritized women\u2019s issues as an important facet of America\u2019s foreign policy agenda. \u201cI want to pledge to you that as secretary of state I view [women\u2019s] issues as central to our foreign policy,\u201d Clinton said at her confirmation hearing, \u201cnot as adjunct or auxiliary or in any way lesser than all of the other issues that we have to confront.\u201d Shortly after, she created the Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues within the department, appointing a U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for global women\u2019s issues. While Mr. Trump has pledged to be \u201cthe best for women\u201d when it comes to domestic policy, it isn\u2019t known yet how much emphasis his secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, will place on women\u2019s issues at the State Department. The Trump transition team has also been questioned over similar memos to the Energy Department and the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. In those cases, the Trump team seemed focused on climate change and environmental conservation policies. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

REUTERS/Carlos Barria - RTX2VE1A Email WASHINGTON\u00a0-- The Obama administration said Thursday it is officially scrapping a post-9/11 requirement for immigrant men from predominantly Muslim countries to register with the federal government. It\u2019s a program that the U.S. hasn\u2019t used since 2011, but a top immigration adviser to President-elect Donald Trump has talked about renewing it. The decision to end the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERs), comes amid growing international terror fears and Trump\u2019s suggestions that he could ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. After a truck attack killed 12 in a Christmas market in Berlin this week, Trump told reporters, \u201cYou know my plans.\u201d The prelimination could make it more complicated for Trump\u2019s administration to launch its own registration system for Muslims. Trump never publicly spoke about introducing such a program. But a close adviser, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, said last month he was in favor of launching an updated system for all foreigners from \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas. Meeting Trump in New York, Kobach carried a document labeled \u201cDepartment of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for First 365 Days.\u201d It listed an NSEERS reboot as the top priority. Kobach helped draft the program while working at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. The registration system started about a year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, requiring men and boys from a variety of mostly Middle Eastern countries to register with the federal government upon their arrival in the United States. Such people already in the country had to register with immigration authorities inside the U.S. Registration, which also applied to immigrants from North Korea, included fingerprints and photographs. People also were required to notify the government if they changed addresses. The administration will publish its decision in the Federal Register on Friday. It had been widely derided by civil libertarians as an effort to profile people based on race and religion. The program is \u201cnot only obsolete,\u201d said Neema Hakim, spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, \u201cits use would divert limited personnel and resources from more effective measures.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union, which has opposed the program since its inception, described it as a \u201cfailed counterterrorism tool and massive profiling program that didn\u2019t yield a single terrorism conviction in nearly a decade.\u201d \u201cWith this action, the U.S. is on the right path to protect Muslim and Arab immigrants from discrimination,\u201d said Joanne Lin, the organization\u2019s senior legislative counsel. The program never prohibited travel for men and boys from the more than 20 affected countries, including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. When the Obama administration abandoned the system in April 2011, it said a newer data collection program would be sufficient to collect biometric information for all foreigners coming into the country. At the time, more than 80,000 foreigners were registered. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

Hunter Schafer of Raleigh holds a sign in favor of repealing North Carolina HB2 during a special session of the General Assembly on Wednesday. (Ben McKeown / Associated Press) Jenny Jarvie After North Carolina lawmakers refused to repeal House Bill 2, the law that curbs legal protections for LGBT people and has cost the state millions of dollars in boycotts and lost jobs, Democrats and Republicans took to a predictable pattern: blaming each other for the unraveling of the deal. The failure to repeal the measure\u00a0ensures that North Carolina politics will remained deeply divided as Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper takes office Jan. 1, and the issue of LGBT protections will continue to be a source of contention in state and national politics in 2017. Many were shocked Monday when leaders of the liberal city of Charlotte and the Republican state of North Carolina announced they had come to a deal to get rid of HB2. The plan, concocted by the Democratic governor-elect and outgoing Republican Gov. Pat McCrory , was relatively simple \u2013 but\u00a0it depended on Charlotte leaders rescinding part of the city\u2019s\u00a0anti-discrimination ordinance, which expanded LGBT protections and allowed transgender people to choose restrooms according to the gender with which they identify.\u00a0HB2 was initially proposed in reaction to that ordinance.\u00a0 For months, Charlotte\u2019s leaders had refused to do that. But on Monday, in an unexpected about-face, they announced they had repealed their ordinance. McCrory then upheld his part of the bargain, summoning state legislators to a special session Wednesday to repeal HB2. Republican leaders thought they had reached a compromise that would allow the state to move past the controversial law. But in the end, any bill they could get rural Republicans to support, they could not get Democrats to sign up on. After a long day of backroom negotiating behind closed doors, Republican Senate leaders offered a bill that repealed HB2 while introducing a moratorium, or \u201ccooling-off period,\u201d that would prevent local governments across the state from crafting or changing anti-discrimination ordinances. Democrats refused to sign. It may have been\u00a0doomed from the beginning.It started off with both sides wanting a pound of flesh from the other side, and it just went downhill from there. \u2014 Michael Bitzer, politics professor \u201cIt may have been\u00a0doomed from the beginning,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., who noted that many rural Republicans, who face re-election next year, would face outrage from their constituents if they repealed HB2. \u201cIt started off with both sides wanting a pound of flesh from the other side, and it just went downhill from there.\u201d The evening before Wednesday\u2019s special session, rural Republicans who opposed repealing the law were rattled when they found out Charlotte leaders had only partially repealed the nondiscrimination\u00a0ordinance. Swiftly, the city council held an emergency meeting Wednesday morning to fully repeal all the changes it made in February. But that did not allay\u00a0Republican suspicion. In the end, both the House and Senate adjourned without repealing the bill. \"Today the legislature had the chance to do the right thing for North Carolina\u00a0and they failed,\u201d Cooper said at a late-night press conference Wednesday, noting that he and his staff had consulted with legislators, businesses and activists for more than a week to build momentum for repeal. \u201cRepublican legislative leaders have broken their word to me and they have broken their trust with the people of North Carolina.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, folks. I don\u2019t trust them and our folks don\u2019t trust them,\u201d Republican\u00a0Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the Senate adjourned late Wednesday, blasting both Cooper and Charlotte\u2019s Democratic mayor, Jennifer Roberts. \u201cThey give us no reason to trust them\u201d Charlotte's LGBT residents do not face any immediate legal consequences after city officials rescinded the changes to its anti-discrimination ordinance \u2013 those components of the ordinance were already overruled by HB2. Charlotte officials cannot introduce fresh LGBT protections as the state law precludes local authorities from introducing such measures. \u201cWhile we are disappointed with this unfortunate outcome, our commitment to maintaining and protecting diverse and inclusive communities remains unchanged,\u201d the city of Charlotte said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to work with our partners at the state and local levels to develop a solution that protects the rights of individuals.\u201d The failure to repeal HB2 represents a blow not just to the LGBT community but to the entire state of North Carolina, said Chris Sgro, a Democratic representative and executive director of Equality NC. \u201cWith HB2 still on the books and the Charlotte Ordinance fully repealed we will only continue to lose businesses and put LGBTQ North Carolinians in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe North Carolina General Assembly Leadership has made clear today that North Carolina remains closed for business.\" On Thursday, LGBT advocacy groups and civil rights organizations vowed to ratchet up political and economic pressure on the state. The leader of the North Carolina branch of the NAACP said he planned to request a national NAACP economic boycott of the state after the General Assembly\u2019s failure Wednesday to repeal HB2. \"Some people like to say this is Democrat versus Republican, but this is extremism,\" North Carolina NAACP President William Barber said, noting that HB2 was just one of many conservative moves by Republicans in the last month. \"This is an out of control, extremist legislature, and we have to resist it in North Carolina before it spreads through the South and across the rest of the country.\u201d HB2 orders school and public agencies to require people to use multiple-occupancy restrooms based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.\u00a0The law, which also prevents cities from extending anti-discrimination laws to LBGT people and from passing any increase in the $7.25 minimum wage, generated economic boycotts and strong condemnation from major corporations including Apple, Google and Microsoft. PayPal abandoned its plan to bring 400 jobs to the state;\u00a0entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam canceled concerts;\u00a0and major sporting leagues such as the NBA, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference\u00a0pulled championships and games from Charlotte. \u00a0 Two months after the bill was signed, Charlotte\u2019s Chamber of Commerce estimated the law\u2019s economic impact on Mecklenburg County at $285 million, in addition to a loss of more than 1,300 Charlotte-area jobs. Republicans and Democrats appear divided on the possibility of a future repeal. \"I think today was our best shot,\" said Brian Turner, a Democratic representative. \"I don't think there's going to be another opportunity.\" The problem, he said, was that Republican leaders could not seem to control their representatives. \"Through gerrymandering, there are now Republican seats that are so safe that the leadership has lost the ability to control them. It's almost like a Frankenstein's monster.\" Still, some Republican leaders said they would be committed to working out a solution in the new year. \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for me, and it\u2019s a priority for many Republicans,\u201d House Rules Chairman David Lewis said after the House adjourned. \u201cWe in the state of North Carolina are going to find a way to respect everyone\u2019s basic human rights. \u201cYou know, I am a Republican, and our party was founded and grew under the belief that everyone\u2019s entitled to equal protection under the law,\u201d he added. \u201cSomehow we can find a way to craft legislation to find a solution.\u201d Some political experts expect the issue ultimately will  be resolved by federal courts rather than local and state politicians. In May, the Department of Justice filed a civil rights lawsuit against the state. \u201cThe courts are going to have the final say on HB2,\u201d said Bitzer. \u201cPolitically, both sides are so bitterly divided and don\u2019t seem to trust the other side at this point. At this point, I would be stunned if they came to any kind of compromise.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Toy shopping \u00a0around Christmas, a 78-year-old climbs Mt.

But Mr. Haggmark is bracing for more. He recently met with the officials from the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services to see what the state can do to help. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis has been the driest five years on records and this month we will be out of any water that was captured in the lake,\u201d he said. The city can get about 30 percent of the water it needs by importing water from other parts of the state, but that is often unpredictable because of the byzantine process that water is allocated throughout the region. But beginning in March, the city will largely rely on the nearby ocean. The water will be pumped from the ocean through pipes and filtration systems for desalination before hitting the faucets in homes. Still, Mr. Haggmark said there was not enough water to get by without cutting more. So far, residents have gone along with the calls for extreme conservation. Most lawns in town are already brown and some homeowners skip showers in favor of watering, Mr. Haggmark said. The city will continue using recycled water for grass in local schools and parks, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be out there playing on dirt, so there are places for grass, it just doesn\u2019t belong in people\u2019s front yard,\u201d Mr. Haggmark said. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-school landscaping tool that doesn\u2019t have a place here anymore.\u201d California Online Photo Officials with the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, Calpers, at a meeting on Monday.

In a statement, he said bluntly that the resolution should be vetoed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAs the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201d Mr. Trump amplified his position by posting the statement on Facebook and Twitter as well. The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....cont: https://t.co/s8rXKKZNF1 \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 22, 2016 His words closely echoed the positions expressed by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a breath of fresh air after years of clashes with Mr. Obama. Mr. Netanyahu treated the impending United Nations vote as a crisis, staying up late into the night discussing it with aides and posting on his own Twitter account, at 3:28 a.m. local time, a message urging Mr. Obama to veto what he called the \u201canti-Israel\u201d resolution. He then canceled a public appearance later in the day and called a meeting of security cabinet ministers to address the matter. \u201cThe Israelis leaned on the Egyptians this morning to postpone the vote, and the Egyptians basically caved,\u201d said a Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic delicacy of the matter. The Egyptian Mission to the United Nations could not be reached for an immediate comment. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, who was visibly upset, said: \u201cHe is acting on behalf of Netanyahu.\u201d Mr. Mansour said Arab ambassadors had met Thursday and endorsed the draft, and that a committee of the Arab League was due to meet in Cairo to discuss the text. If the White House had let the resolution pass, it would have been a symbolic blow to the diplomatic shield that the United States has always offered Israel. It would also have sent a strong signal of international disapproval over the construction of settlements, which are widely regarded as illegal under international law. The draft resolution, offered by Egypt in its role as the Arab representative to the Council, called settlements \u201ca flagrant violation under international law\u201d and \u201ca major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution.\u201d It called on Israel to \u201cimmediately and completely cease all settlement activities\u201d in the occupied West Bank. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It also included a nod to Israel and its backers by condemning \u201call acts of violence against civilians, including acts of terror, as well as all acts of provocation, incitement and destruction.\u201d That amounts to diplomatic scolding of Palestinian leaders, whom Israel accuses of encouraging attacks on Israeli civilians. Egypt, one of Israel\u2019s most reliable partners in the Middle East and a longtime United States ally, announced that it would put up the draft measure for a vote after extensive consultations with fellow Arab diplomats. The vote was scheduled for Thursday at 3 p.m. But by midmorning, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered his diplomats to pull the resolution. The Obama administration vetoed a 2011 resolution condemning settlements, and in 2013, another resolution did not muster enough votes to pass. According to Security Council Report, an independent research organization, the United States has vetoed 30 resolutions regarding Israel and the Palestinians, plus a dozen more regarding Israel and Lebanon or Syria, more than half of its 77 vetoes since the United Nations was founded in 1946. To be adopted, a resolution needs at least nine votes and no vetoes by the Council\u2019s five permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. Palestinian officials and other United Nations diplomats had said they thought the chances of passage were high. Part of the administration\u2019s calculation is likely to be based on Israel\u2019s own actions. Mr. Obama has not had a good relationship with Mr. Netanyahu, and the White House has consistently criticized Israel\u2019s continued settlement activities. The fight over the resolution comes amid another heated settlement battle unfolding in Israel. The government plans to relocate residents of Amona , a West Bank outpost that even Israel\u2019s Supreme Court declared illegal, to a nearby hilltop that Palestinians and their supporters believe is equally problematic. The court on Thursday agreed to a 45-day delay in the evacuation of Amona, putting off that fight, too, for another time. The United Nations resolution also represents the Obama administration\u2019s last chance to weigh in on the sharply deteriorating prospects for peace, and indeed the cornerstone of United States policy: a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador-designate, David M. Friedman , has suggested that Israel annex the West Bank, has denounced the two-state solution, and has likened Jewish members of the lobbying group J Street to \u201ckapos\u201d that cooperated with the Nazis. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Friedman, an Orthodox Jew who has an apartment in Jerusalem, is also a major backer of settlements, serving as president of an American fund-raising group that supports a yeshiva in Beit El, a religious settlement deep in the West Bank. Mr. Trump and Mr. Friedman have also said they plan to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, something counter to longstanding bipartisan policy that could yield ire throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Israel considers Jerusalem, including territory it captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, as its undivided capital, but the Palestinians see the holy city as the capital of their future state. Washington has long insisted that Jerusalem\u2019s status can only be determined through negotiations as part of a broader peace agreement.

Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them. While less detailed, the memo is reminiscent of one the transition team sent recently to the Energy Department , which asked for the names of people who had worked on climate change or attended global climate talks organized by the United Nations within the last five years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) President-elect Donald J. Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon\u2019s most sophisticated aircraft\u00a0on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in favor of an alternate plane due to high costs. In a message on Twitter, Trump said that\u00a0cost overruns in\u00a0Lockheed Martin\u2019s $400 billion program to develop the stealth aircraft had prompted him to ask Boeing, another major defense manufacturer, to \u201cprice-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.\u201d Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump has blasted the F-35 before, saying the cost is \u201cout of control\u201d and promising that his administration would find savings in military hardware purchases. His criticism of Bethesda-based Lockheed and another major aircraft\u00a0firm has roiled the defense industry and laid a marker for a hard line from the White House in dealings with major players doing business with the government. Even before Trump launched his public assault, the F-35, the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons program , has come in for widespread criticism for design flaws and spiraling costs. After President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth jet project, two of the $100 million fighter jets landed in Israel. They were greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Dec. 12. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP) This fall, Pentagon and officials from the Lockheed\u00a0failed to agree on a mutually acceptably price for the latest batch of planes. And last month,\u00a0Canada said it might buy F/A-18 Super Hornets until it decides whether to go ahead with planned F-35 purchases. A number of U.S. allies,\u00a0including Israel, have agreed to buy F-35s. Trump has also assailed \u00a0Boeing , another major aircraft manufacturer,\u00a0over the high cost of a new Air Force One plane. Its chief executive later met with the president-elect and promised to give the U.S. government a break on the aircraft. Carol Morello and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report. Read more: ",

USA TODAY Lisa Marie Naegle (Photo: Lawrence Altman, AP) INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A Southern California man has been charged with beating to death a former reality TV show contestant with a hammer and burying her in his backyard. Jackie Rogers was charged Thursday with murder. It's unclear whether he has an attorney because his scheduled Thursday arraignment was postponed. Rogers could face 26 years to life in prison if convicted. The 34-year-old Lennox man is charged with bludgeoning to death Lisa Marie Naegle of San Pedro last Sunday. Calif. police believe they've found 'Bridalplasty' contestant's body Naegle was a registered nurse who taught nursing at a local community college. She was a losing contestant in the 2010 reality series Bridalplasty. Rogers was a student of the 36-year-old married woman. He was arrested after video showed him leaving a Torrance beerhall with Naegle.

    "text": "Dec 22 2016, 4:09 pm ET Trump Tweets Apparent Call for More U.S. Nuclear Weapons by Ken Dilanian advertisement Donald Trump stunned nuclear experts Thursday by proclaiming in a tweet that the U.S. should \"expand its nuclear capability,\" something no president has called for in decades. While President Barack Obama has proposed a $500 billion plan to modernize the aging U.S. nuclear triad, no mainstream voices are arguing to increase the numbers of nuclear weapons beyond the 4,500 the U.S. currently possesses, several experts told NBC News. \"The thrust of U.S. nuclear policy for decades now has been to trim the fat off the U.S. nuclear arsenal,\" said James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"At a certain point, you are just making the rubble bounce higher.\" Play Trump: 'Can't Take Anything Off the Table' with Nuclear Weapons 0:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161223013559if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/773727811553\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump tweeted, \"The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" \"Can a tweet start an arms race? This one may just have done that,\" said Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement to NBC News that \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes. He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\" The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Miller did not respond to a follow-up question asking whether that meant Trump was not, in fact, calling for more nuclear weapons. The U.S. can deliver nukes by bomber, intercontinental missile and submarine \u2014 the three legs of the so-called nuclear triad. Under Obama, the Pentagon has been moving forward with a hugely expensive program to modernize many aspects of the aging weapons and delivery systems. Some experts question whether the U.S. needs all legs of the triad anymore. One who has raised that issue is James Mattis, the retired Marine general who is Trump's choice for defense chief. \"You should ask, 'Is it time to reduce the triad to a diad, removing the land-based missiles?'\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in January 2015, as the AP reported earlier this month. \"Can a tweet start an arms race? This one may just have done that.\" Keith Payne, a former Defense Department official and longtime nuclear expert, argues that modernization is badly overdue. But even Payne doesn't argue for expanding the number of nuclear weapons or launchers, he told NBC News in an interview. He declined to say whether he was advising the Trump team. Acton called Trump's tweet unprecedented, not only for its content, but for the notion that a president-elect would make a pronouncement about something so sensitive as nuclear weapons policy over a medium as casual as Twitter. \"Nuclear policy is not made on the hoof,\" he said. \"Because of the extraordinary implications, it is always the result of serious interagency review and careful deliberations. Allies are consulted, presidential statements pored over, words checked and double checked, crafted and re-crafted.\" But Trump doesn't appear to do business that way. \"I have no doubt in my mind that Trump's Twitter feed is monitored extremely closely by foreign governments and that this will cause significant heartache,\" Acton said.

By Abigail Hauslohner and Ellen Nakashima December 22 at 4:42 PM Follow @ahauslohner Follow @nakashimae Members of MoveOn and DRUM march past the White House during a protest to shut down the Muslim registry program NSEERS in D.C. on Dec. 12. (Gary Cameron/Reuters) The Obama administration on Thursday took the unprecedented step of creating obstacles to a widely-anticipated but poorly understood plan by President-elect Donald Trump to establish a Muslim ban or registry \u2014 by dismantling the registry system that already exists. The Department of Homeland Security issued a \u201cfinal rule\u201d to formally dismantle the regulatory framework for the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), a preexisting government program that was used to register and monitor visitors from \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries from 2002 to 2011. Civil rights advocates, who have been calling for such action, say the program, enacted under former president George W. Bush, already amounted to a registry for Muslims through discriminatory targeting. Obama shelved the program in 2011, but the regulations that allow it to function were never dismantled. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped the Bush administration create the program after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and now advises Trump, has been photographed holding a proposal for NSEERS\u2019s reinstatement while meeting with Trump. The move is the latest in a string of recent efforts by the Obama administration to safeguard current policies and Democratic values that they expect Trump to target. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a regulation to block discrimination against Planned Parenthood in the allocation of federal grants, and on Tuesday, the president announced a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in areas of the Arctic and the Atlantic Ocean. [ President Obama bans oil drilling in large areas of Atlantic and Arctic oceans ] The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that it was removing the \u201coutdated regulations\u201d that allowed the program to function. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants,\u201d the agency said Thursday in a document first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the agency. The program\u2019s end was a long time coming. \u201cNSEERS was a huge waste of time, money. But no one remembers it. Everyone talks about a Muslim registry, but we had one,\u201d said Mirriam Seddiq, a criminal defense and immigration attorney. Civil rights activists and immigration attorneys say the program disproportionately targeted Muslim men. The program mandated that men over the age of 16 from one of 25 countries on a list were required to register if they were living in the United States. Twenty-four of those countries were Muslim majority countries. Registration, which involved fingerprinting, interrogations and sometimes parole-like check-ins, was required, regardless whether the people had broken the law. Those men who overstayed their visas or failed to comply with annual registration requirements or more frequent check-ins were deported. Nearly 180,000 people registered with the program when it was in place; more than 83,500 of them were already residing in the United States when the program was enacted. Activists from MoveOn.org and smaller groups, who staged a protest against NSEERS outside the Justice Department last week, say that 13,000 of them were deported \u2014 claims that the Department of Homeland Security have neither confirmed nor denied. The DHS inspector general in 2012 recommended abandoning it on the grounds that it was \u201cinefficient and ineffective.\u201d But, said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, \u201cwith the heat of the rhetoric of a Muslim registry, with the hyper-politicization of religious tests as a kind of purity filter and patriotism filter, a renewed, energized push was begun\u201d to get rid of it. The push was supported by senior administration officials and career civil servants alike across the government, from the White House to DHS to the Justice Department to the FBI and the intelligence community, several senior U.S. officials said. \u201cThis is huge,\u201d said Elizabeith Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to prevent Donald Trump from trying to institute a Muslim registry, but it will make the process longer and harder. It also sends an important signal to Muslim American communities that they shouldn\u2019t be treated differently, that they shouldn\u2019t be signaled out as automatically suspect.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump called Monday's attacks in Europe \"terrible\" as he spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday. One reporter asked Trump if the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Turkey caused him to \"rethink\" his policy on immigration and a ban on Muslims. \"You've known my plans all along, and I've been proven to be right,\" Trump said. (Reuters) Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond Thursday to a request for comment on the measure, and to clarify its intentions in regards to a registry or ban. Asked by reporters about the ban proposal Wednesday, Trump appeared to reaffirm his commitment to the idea, saying: \u201cYou know my plans all along.\u201d His former campaign manager and newly-named White House counselor Kellyanne Conway then told CNN Thursday morning that Trump would not pursue a ban based on religion but rather on country of origin. The incoming administration\u2019s website also contains conflicting statements on this subject. Experts say if Trump wanted to relaunch NSEERS, he could do by having the Department of Homeland Security issue a new administrative rule, which would require a public comments period, which tend to last 30 to 60 days, said Naureen Shah, the director of the Security and Human Rights program at Amnesty International USA, and would likely invite litigation by civil rights attorneys, on the grounds that the program would be discriminatory, in violation of the constitution. politics ",

Nick Ut/AP hide caption toggle caption Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca leaves federal court in Los Angeles on Monday. Nick Ut/AP The judge has declared a mistrial in the corruption trial against former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca. The jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked after three days of deliberations, according to The Associated Press. It is now up to prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office about whether to retry Baca. Baca had initially pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about corruption and prisoner abuse in the county jail he oversaw, but this summer he changed his mind and rejected a plea deal. As The Two-Way has reported : \"Baca, 74, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, was the top elected law enforcement official in Los Angeles beginning in 1998. By withdrawing his plea, Baca chose to face trial. ... \"Baca retired under pressure in 2014 amid allegations of widespread abuse of inmates' civil rights. For example, Baca's jail staff was accused of assaulting unresisting inmates. Initially, Baca blamed the allegations on rogue officers . 'There is no institutional problem within the sheriff's department when it comes to correcting itself,' he said. \"But FBI agents found a deeply rooted culture of corruption in which sheriff's deputies actively attempted to thwart federal attempts to enlist a jailhouse informant.\" Article continues after sponsorship The Los Angeles Times reported that prosecutors argued during the trial \"that Baca resented the FBI's efforts to investigate his jails and believed sheriff's officials should, as he said in a TV news interview, 'police ourselves.' \" ",

A \"significant\" Islamic State-inspired Christmas Day terror plot targeting central Melbourne has been foiled after a series of arrests in raids across the city, police said on December 23, 2016. (Photo: WILLIAM WEST, AFP/Getty Images) Australian authorities say they have broken up a\u00a0Christmas Day plot to set off bombs in Melbourne, the country's second-largest city. Dubbing their investigation \"Operation Kastelholm,\" Victoria police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization said Friday that five people are being held in connection with the plot. All of them are listed as having Australian addresses. \"It will be alleged four of the men arrested were involved in undertaking preparations for planning a terrorist act in Melbourne,\" Victoria police said in a statement, adding that \"the threat has been contained and there is no on-going threat.\" The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne \u2014 26-year-old man and 20-year-old woman \u2014 were released without being charged, a police statement said. Five men between ages 21 and 26 remained in custody. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship, police said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. Ashton said police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device,\" Ashton said. He added: \"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" About 400 police officers were involved in the raids.

By Karen DeYoung December 22 at 7:22 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Before lunchtime Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump said he would expand the U.S. nuclear arsenal , upending a reduction course set by presidents of both parties over the past four decades, and called for the United States to veto a pending U.N. resolution that criticized Israel\u2019s settlements policy. The policy prescriptions, communicated in morning tweets, followed calls since last month\u2019s election to reconsider the arms-length U.S. relationship with Taiwan and to let China keep an underwater U.S. vessel seized by its navy. Trump declared within hours of this week\u2019s Berlin terrorist attack that it was part of a global Islamic State campaign to \u201cslaughter Christians\u201d and later said it reaffirmed the wisdom of his plans to bar Muslim immigrants. Late Thursday, Trump suggested in another tweet that the U.S. military\u2019s years-in-the-making plans for a new stealth fighter, Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 , might be reconsidered, saying he had \u201casked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\u201d With weeks to go before he becomes president, Trump has not hesitated to voice his opinions on national security issues of the day and to publicly advise the current president on what to do about them. Ultimately, the nuclear statement was tempered by a Trump spokesman. And the likely fallout from a tentative decision by the Obama administration to break years of precedent and abstain on the Israel resolution was avoided when Egypt, its sponsor, abruptly postponed it just hours before a scheduled Security Council vote. But the president-elect\u2019s pronouncements have privately riled a White House that has repeatedly insisted in public that the transition has been smooth sailing. Asked last week whether he was trying to help Trump, a professed admirer of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, understand Russia\u2019s responsibility for the civil-war carnage in Aleppo , Syria, President Obama said he would \u201chelp President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he\u2019s sworn in, can make a decision.\u201d \u201cBetween now and then,\u201d Obama said firmly, it was up to him to decide what to do. \u201cThese are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations that I have with our military and the people who have been working this every day.\u201d Even as the White House has held its tongue, however, others have not. Trump provided no details in his tweet calling for the United States to \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.\u201d But \u201cif he means what he says,\u201d said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a Washington-based security foundation, \u201cthis could be the end of the arms-control process that reduced 80\u00a0percent of our Cold War arsenal.\u201d Former congressman John Tierney (D-Mass.), executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in a statement, \u201cIt is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet.\u201d Under New START, the treaty negotiated by Obama with Russia and ratified by the Senate in 2010, the United States and Russia by February 2018 must have no more than 1,550 strategic weapons deployed. While there is widespread agreement that the U.S. deterrent must be modernized, little enthusiasm has been expressed elsewhere for increasing the number of nuclear warheads. Trump spokesman Jason Miller later said that was not precisely what Trump meant. Rather than calling for more nuclear weapons, Miller told Yahoo News, he was referring to \u201cthe threat of nuclear proliferation\u201d and \u201cthe need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s U.N. tweet was more explicit and more immediate. \u201cThe resolution being considered . . . should be vetoed,\u201d he said in a pre-dawn tweet referring to the Egyptian measure. The resolution condemned \u201cthe construction and expansion of settlements\u201d in the West Bank and mostly Palestinian East Jerusalem, along with \u201cthe transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians.\u201d Saying the settlements have \u201cno legal validity,\u201d it demanded that Israel \u201cimmediately cease all settlement activities.\u201d Although consideration of such a measure has been circulated at the United Nations for weeks \u2014 and similar measures have for years brought a consistent U.S. veto \u2014 it was not until Wednesday night that word began to circulate that the United States might abstain and allow it to pass. While successive administrations have considered the settlements an impediment to an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Obama administration has grown increasingly irate over what it feels is Israel\u2019s flouting of its concerns. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A July announcement that 770 new homes were to be built in the East Jerusalem settlement of Gilo drew particularly sharp U.S. criticism. At the same time, right-wing voices in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are pushing for legislation that would legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. The \u201clegalization bill\u201d stems from a court-ordered demolition of the Amona settlement, which sits on land owned by a Palestinian farmer. Amona was meant to be demolished next week, but on Thursday it received an additional month of reprieve from the court. Residents brokered a deal with the government to move their homes to a nearby location, essentially creating a new settlement. During the campaign, Trump frequently criticized what he described as the administration\u2019s failure to fully support Israel. Last week, he named David Friedman \u2014 a New York bankruptcy lawyer who has given strong financial support and other backing to the Israeli settlement movement and has said Trump supports Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory \u2014 as his ambassador to Israel. During the campaign, Trump also charged that Obama had helped promote terrorism by supporting \u201cthe ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt\u201d \u2014 that of long-standing autocrat Hosni Mubarak \u2014 and more recently by failing to fully back the military government that overthrew Mubarak\u2019s elected replacement. In an interview last weekend with a Portuguese news agency, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi said that Trump \u201chas shown deep and great understanding of what is taking place in the region as a whole and Egypt in particular. I am looking forward and expecting more support and reinforcement of our bilateral relations.\u201d Once it became clear late Wednesday that the settlements vote was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, Trump officials said the transition gave the administration a \u201cheads-up\u201d that the president-elect was going to publicly call for a U.S. veto. At the end of the day Thursday, it was not entirely clear what led Egypt to withdraw the resolution. At the State Department, spokesman John Kirby said that Egypt had pulled it back in order to have \u201cdiscussions with its Arab League partners\u201d over the wording of the text. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who supported an abstention and was clearly expecting to deliver a pre-vote speech announcing it, along with an outline of future prospects for Middle East peace, canceled his plans. Elsewhere within the administration, officials said Israel had twisted Egypt\u2019s arm and threatened to work against its interests in Congress. Several Arab officials said they were convinced that the United States had pressured Egypt to postpone the vote. In Israel, where a late-night cabinet meeting was convened Wednesday to consider the possibility of a U.S. abstention, Netanyahu sent out a dead-of-night tweet calling for a U.S. veto. It was quickly followed by Trump\u2019s own, near-identical tweet. Deriding \u201cthe imposition of terms set by the United Nations,\u201d Trump said in a later statement that passage of the resolution would put Israel \u201cin a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201d Later in the day, a transition official told the Reuters news agency, Trump spoke by telephone with Sissi.

    "text": "Read more stories He greeted a handful of supporters who came and went throughout the trial, some with lapel pins in the shape of a sheriff\u2019s badge. On some days it was just his wife, Carol, by the aging lawman\u2019s side.\u00a0 He chose not to testify in his defense, unlike Tanaka, who took the stand in his own obstruction trial earlier this year and sought to lay the blame squarely at Baca\u2019s feet. Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before convicting Tanaka, who has since been sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the obstruction plot. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors struck a deal with Baca, in which the retired sheriff\u00a0pleaded guilty to a single charge of making false statements to federal investigators. In exchange, he was to receive\u00a0a sentence of no more than six months in prison. U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson\u00a0rejected the deal, calling it\u00a0too lenient, and Baca and his attorneys chose instead to withdraw his plea and put his fate in the hands of 12\u00a0fellow citizens. Although prosecutors told the six-man, six-woman jury at the outset of the trial that Baca was the \u201cheartbeat,\u201d the \u201cleader\u201d and the \u201cdriving force\u201d of the conspiracy, few of the government\u2019s witnesses testified to direct interactions with Baca during the time of the alleged interference with federal authorities. A former L.A. Times reporter testified that Baca said in an interview that he directed two sergeants to go to the home of FBI agent Leah Tanner, then known as Leah Marx. The sergeants confronted her and falsely informed her they were obtaining a warrant for her arrest. Prosecutors alleged\u00a0the move was an attempt to intimidate Tanner\u00a0and get the FBI to back off. A former U.S. attorney, now a federal judge, recalled phone calls and meetings with Baca in which the\u00a0then-sheriff seemed to be in the know about developments in the case.\u00a0 Jurors also heard a recorded conversation between an FBI supervisor and Sgt. Maricela Long, who has also been convicted in the obstruction case, in which the supervisor asked\u00a0whether Baca was aware his subordinates had threatened Tanner\u00a0with arrest.\u00a0 \u201cThe\u00a0sheriff knows this, sir,\u201d Long said on the recording. Two other deputies who have been convicted of playing a part in the conspiracy told jurors that while they had little to no contact with Baca, it was made clear to them the orders came all the way\u00a0from the top.\u00a0One said he watched a nervous supervisor walk into Baca\u2019s office to notify him that deputies had mistakenly allowed FBI agents to meet with the inmate who was working as a federal informant. The prosecution presented jurors with phone records, emails and meetings scheduled on calendars to show that Baca was in contact with Tanaka as the machinations played out. But Hochman countered that his client could have been discussing any number of issues he dealt with as the head of the department's sprawling operation. In more than 100 emails presented by prosecutors as evidence of the obstruction plot,\u00a0Baca\u00a0was directly involved in only two, Hochman said. And while Tanaka was exchanging dozens of calls with the subordinates charged in the case,\u00a0Baca\u00a0was on only one. \u201cThe sheriff never knew about this;\u00a0the sheriff was out of the loop,\u201d Hochman said. He asked jurors to instead look at the rest of Baca\u2019s\u00a0lengthy career to decide whether he would be the type of leader to evade federal scrutiny. He\u00a0pointed to steps Baca took to better conditions in the jails, and put on the stand Baca\u2019s high-powered friends \u2014\u00a0including two former district attorneys \u2014\u00a0who called him \u201claw-abiding\u201d with an \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cvery solid\u201d reputation. Prosecutors, Hochman argued, were \u201cthrowing some spaghetti against the wall to see if anything sticks against Sheriff\u00a0Baca.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Toy shopping \u00a0around Christmas, a 78-year-old climbs Mt.

To be fair, the robot is the only of its kind, and the record it broke was its own. The Benthic Rover, a project of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), is an untethered, autonomous seafloor crawler. It is deployed in an area known as Station M, 136 miles (220 kilometers) from the California coastline, and 2.5 miles (4,000 meters \u2015 the abyssal zone) below the surface. The bot is tasked with measuring the seafloor community's consumption of marine snow \u2014 organic material from animal poop , zooplankton (tiny marine animals) and phytoplankton that falls from the upper layers of water and into the deep ocean. Related: Images of the Strange Life Along Antarctic Seafloor A team of MBARI researchers have been studying Station M since 1989, and the Benthic Rover has helped them see more clearly how the seafloor ecosystem is affecting and being affected by climate change. \"A major unknown component of the global carbon cycle is the amount of organic carbon that reaches the deep ocean and its ultimate utilization or long-term sequestration in the sediments,\" MBARI's senior scientist on the project, Ken Smith, wrote in a 2013 paper on the subject. The Benthic Rover's fluorescence imaging system highlights chlorophyll-rich marine snow, which glows under the rover's special lights. Courtesy of MBARI When marine snow falls to the seafloor, some is eaten by deep-dwelling organisms that respire it as carbon dioxide, and some is buried in seafloor sediment. Data on how much carbon is respired and sequestered is important for climate science , because the gas is a greenhouse gas that intensifies warming in the atmosphere when released. When deployed along the seafloor, the autonomous rover takes overlapping images every meter with a high-resolution camera. It also has a fluorescence-imaging system that detects the pigment called chlorophyll from phytoplankton in the marine snow that sank from the surface waters. Each day, the Benthic Rover lowers two chambers into the seafloor to measure how much oxygen is being consumed by organisms in the mud, something that reveals how organic carbon is being used. One significant finding from the rover's deployments over the past few years was the detection of several large pulses of marine snow that rapidly sank to the seafloor. Several of these brief pulses, which lasted two to four weeks, would dump nearly an entire year's worth of nutrient-rich debris on the seafloor. The pulses could be related to stronger winds along the shore, which drive the upwelling of nutrients in coastal waters. Related: A Look at the Near Future of Tactical Police Robots According to MBARI, the pulse events would have gone undetected without the Benthic Rover's long-term presence in Station M. \"In documenting such events, the Rover helped solve an important piece of Earth's carbon-cycle puzzle \u2014 showing that a much larger percentage of carbon than previously expected can sink rapidly from the surface into deeper water,\" according to an MBARI statement . \"These periodic events can now be factored into global climate change models.\" After recovering the rover for maintenance in November 2016, MBARI deployed the Benthic Rover back to the seafloor at Station M. The research institute expects the rover to operate for roughly another year before another maintenance recovery. Original article on Live Science.

Rory Woods clears snow from the sidewalk outside his business, Main Street Barber Shop, in Hutchinson, Kan., Sunday, Dec. 18, 2016.  By this weekend, rain will replace snow as the main precipitation in Kansas, though more snow is expected farther to the north. (Photo: Lindsey Bauman, AP) 10203 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE A potent storm will be putting a lump of coal in the stockings of travelers and residents alike in much of the western and central U.S. this Christmas weekend. The system\u00a0is forecast to bring everything from a wintry mix and a blizzard to drenching rain and severe thunderstorms to a large swath of the U.S. from Friday through Sunday. Only the eastern part of the country will remain relatively tranquil. The storm will first move\u00a0into the West Coast on Friday, bringing heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding in California, with heavy snowfall expected in the higher terrain of the Sierras, the National Weather Service said. Snow will also fall over the Cascades, northern Great Basin and northern Rockies. Winter Storm #Europa will be a #Christmas #blizzard in parts of the N. Plains. https://t.co/bfbIQD35PJ pic.twitter.com/rP7Isnt7rt \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) December 22, 2016 As the system pushes eastward, conditions should begin to dry out by the weekend along the West Coast, the weather service predicts. By Christmas Eve, the Rockies will see additional snow, which will spread into the Plains by Saturday evening. On Christmas Day, howling winds of up to 60 mph and heavy snow totaling up to 9 inches will likely lead to\u00a0a full-fledged blizzard in portions of the Rockies and the Dakotas. Whiteout conditions are possible across much of the northern Plains over the weekend: https://t.co/gwJQeO6v7M pic.twitter.com/APMpFm6JWW \u2014 AccuWeather (@breakingweather) December 22, 2016 Travel may become \"impossible\" in those areas Christmas Day, lingering into early Monday, with numerous roads, including major interstates, likely to be shut down, the Weather Channel said. \"This has the potential to become a widespread and significant winter storm across the northern Plains,\" the National Weather Service in Bismarck, N.D., warned. The Weather Channel has named the storm Winter Storm Europa. Parts of the central U.S. will be threatened by severe storms on Christmas Day: https://t.co/TBpDlV7jK8 pic.twitter.com/X2Dlf8BWuo \u2014 AccuWeather (@breakingweather) December 22, 2016 Farther east, in the Midwest, milder air will mean rain and wet travel conditions for cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa\u00a0and Omaha, Neb., on Christmas Day. To the south, in the central and southern Plains, thunderstorms will \"bring the potential for large hail and isolated tornadoes\" on Christmas afternoon,\u00a0AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Rossio said. A few severe thunderstorms will be possible on #Christmas Day in parts of the #Plains , we break down the threat on @AMHQ . pic.twitter.com/5JqStRYy9I \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) December 22, 2016 A few isolated, severe thunderstorms are also possible in southern and eastern Texas into Louisiana by Monday. Other than some scattered showers Friday and Saturday, most of the eastern U.S. will enjoy a calm, mild holiday weekend, though some wintry weather is possible in northern New England by Monday. 10203 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ijQBAO ",

DEC. 22, 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December It was a year to be confounded, shocked, humbled. Donald J. Trump won the American presidency, defying polls, mockery and fear to defeat Hillary Clinton. Britons jolted their country and the world by voting to leave the European Union. Syria\u2019s agony played out before a largely indifferent world, its children staring into the camera with eyes wide in terror, blood flecking their clothing. The president of the Philippines unleashed a merciless war on drugs, boasting of killing drug dealers himself when he was a mayor, and many of his citizens cheered him on. Climate change created a new class of refugees, even as climate-change skeptics were nominated to key United States cabinet posts. And talk about shocking: The Chicago Cubs won the World Series after a drought of 108 years. It was a year so unexpected, so tumultuous, that the fight has just begun over which narrative might possibly explain it. For some, it was the comeuppance of the elites and the rebellion of the forgotten white working class. Or it was the triumph of resentment, rage and racism. Or payback for identity politics. Or perhaps it was a rallying cry for identity politics. One lesson was clear: Economic and cultural upheavals have consequences. Free trade and globalization, many economists argue, are inexorable forces. But in the United States as in Europe, the exodus of high-paying manufacturing jobs has taken a political as well as an economic toll. Chancellor Angela Merkel lifted many hearts and outraged others when she opened Germany\u2019s doors to desperate refugees. But as in Britain, France, and Italy, there was a backlash from those who conflate Muslim refugees with terrorism, and migrants with economic competition. After terrorist attacks from Paris to Nice, Berlin to Brussels, a frightened world is further barring its doors. Was there ever such an American election? The spectacle that was the Trump campaign riveted the world. The images are indelible: Mr. Trump in silhouette drawing thousands to ecstatic rallies where he pledged to bring back jobs, but also of crowds spewing hate. Hillary Clinton raced to make history as the first female president, allowing herself a brief moment of exultation, arms thrown wide. Then the surprise of her narrow defeat: Women pasted \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers on Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave, while soon after, President Obama welcomed President-elect Trump to the White House. Violence struck in Orlando, with gay revelers attacked at the Pulse nightclub, and in Dallas and Baton Rouge, where the targets were law enforcement officers. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were gunned down by the police. Rape, as ever a tool of war, was deployed by the Islamic State against Yazidi sex slaves. Mexican women, sexually assaulted by the police, broke their silence. Meanwhile, Zika continued to ravage its victims. Cholera was the latest of the scourges visited on Haiti. Empty shelves and emaciated mental patients showed the worsening toll of Venezuela\u2019s failing economy. It was a year in desperate need of grace notes. Simone Biles and American gymnastics team entranced the world at the Olympic Games in Brazil. Vienna waltzes soared at the New York City Ballet. And then there was Zarifeh Shalabi, elected prom queen in Fontana, Calif., with her crown atop her hijab. So much to absorb. Yet if 2016 was a world turned upside down, as the cast of the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton\u201d sings of the American Revolution, just wait until next year. \u2014 SUSAN CHIRA Speaking at the White House, President Obama condemned gun violence with tears in his eyes.

(Photo: Rainer Jensen, EPA) The Islamic State is urging its followers to attack U.S. churches and has published names and addresses of thousands of prospective targets, according to a report in the news website Vocativ . Messages posted in Arabic to the group\u2019s \u201cSecrets of Jihadis\u201d social media site\u00a0called \"for bloody celebrations in the Christian New Year.\" The post, under the name\u00a0Abu Marya al-Iraqi,\u00a0said the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, hopes to tap lone wolf attackers to \u201cturn the Christian New Year into a bloody horror movie,\u201d Vocativ reports. The series of messages\u00a0appeared on Telegram, a messaging app\u00a0that allows users to\u00a0send encrypted messages to\u00a0one another. The group also uses social media to provide instructions on constructing and igniting explosives. The information on U.S. churches was based on information already available online and includes a public directory of churches across all 50 states, Vocativ said. Another post urged followers to attack churches, hotels, crowded coffee shops, streets, markets and public places and provided some examples in the U.S. Canada, France and the Netherlands, Vocativ said.

A global manhunt is underway for suspect Anis Amri, 24, a\u00a0Tunisian national. Cities across the U.S. have bolstered\u00a0security around holiday events following the Berlin attack. In New York and Chicago, law enforcement officials said police presence has been increased for holiday events despite no intelligence that indicates specific threats to their cities.\u00a0In Boston, Mayor Martin Walsh said the city deployed police and put barriers in place around the Boston Holiday\u00a0market.

(Photo: Richard Drew, AP) Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, and their three young children were confronted on a JetBlue flight by a hostile\u00a0passenger who was subsequently kicked off the plane Thursday for causing \"conflict.\" Trump, 35, the eldest of President-elect Trump's five children, was preparing to travel on a JetBlue flight out of New York's JFK International Airport\u00a0when a male passenger berated her, demanding to know why she was on the flight and, according to TMZ , telling her, \u201cYour father is ruining the country!\u201d \u201cWhy is she on our flight? She should be riding private,\u201d the man, later identified as Daniel Goldstein, exclaimed, TMZ reported. Another passenger told TMZ that Trump ignored the man and distracted her kids with crayons\u00a0before he was escorted off the flight. As he was removed, the man yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re kicking me off for expressing my opinion?\u201d Goldstein's husband, Hunter College professor Matthew Lasner , said on Twitter that he and his husband were kicked off the flight after Goldstein \"expressed displeasure\" about flying with Trump. Lasner also tweeted that his husband was chasing the couple down in the terminal \"to harass them.\" He\u00a0has since deleted his Twitter account but savvy Twitter users resurrected some of his tweets.

The airline said\u00a0the couple was rebooked for the next available flight. \"The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly,\" according to an airline statement emailed to USA TODAY. \"If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. In this instance, our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight.\" A spokeswoman for the Trump family declined comment but did not dispute the accounts, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, tweeters poured scorn on the ejected couple for \"harassing\" a mother and her children. Wish I was on the @IvankaTrump flight.

The vaccine was not ready in time to stop the outbreak, which probably began in a hollow, bat-filled tree in Guinea and swept Liberia and Guinea before being defeated. But the prospect of a vaccine stockpile now has brought optimism among public health experts.

The new vaccine has some flaws, experts said. It appears to work only against one of the two most common strains of the Ebola virus, and it may not give long-lasting protection. Some of those who get it report side effects like joint pain and headaches. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly good news with regard to any new outbreak \u2014 and one will occur somewhere,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which makes many vaccines and did some early testing on this one. \u201cBut we still need to continue working on Ebola vaccines.\u201d The Lancet study was done in 11,841 residents of Guinea last year. Among the 5,837 people who got the vaccine, none came down with Ebola 10 or more days later. There were 23 Ebola cases among the thousands of others not immediately vaccinated. (The 10-day window was important because the trial used the \u201cring vaccination\u201d technique developed during the drive to eliminate smallpox . Once a confirmed case was found, researchers contacted everyone in the circle of family, friends, neighbors and caregivers around the victim. About half the \u201ccircles\u201d were offered vaccine. No one who fell ill within the first nine days after vaccination was counted, however, because it was assumed that they had already been infected before vaccination.) The Ebola trial was led by the World Health Organization, the Guinean Health Ministry, Norway\u2019s Institute of Public Health and other institutions. The vaccine, known as rVSV-EBOV, was developed over a decade ago by the Public Health Agency of Canada and the United States Army and is now licensed to Merck.

Spliced into the spine is the gene coding for an Ebola virus surface protein that prompts the immune system to make antibodies . Tests in monkeys showed that one shot protected all of them when it was given at least a week before they were given a high dose of Ebola. The shot even protected a few monkeys who received it a day after being infected with Ebola. The Times produced more than 400 articles, including about 50 front-page stories from inside the Ebola-afflicted countries themselves. Here is a sample of work. The Ebola virus has five known subtypes, the most common of which are Ebola-Zaire, the one that caused the West African outbreak, and Ebola-Sudan. Ebola is also related to Marburg virus , which is similarly lethal. An ideal vaccine would protect against all Ebola strains and Marburg. However, Dr. Kieny said, it may not be possible to make a shot effective against several strains if it is t based on the VSV spine because VSV triggers a lot of side effects. Risks that are acceptable in the midst of a deadly epidemic are not acceptable in a preventive vaccine given to healthy children and adults, several experts noted. The new vaccine is \u201ca step in the right direction but not the ultimate solution,\u201d said Dr. Gary J. Nabel, chief scientific officer for global health research at the Sanofi pharmaceutical company, who designed a different Ebola vaccine in the 1990s when he worked at the National Institutes of Health. A randomized clinical trial involving tens of thousands of subjects is the preferred way to test any vaccine, he noted. But by the time testing could start in mid-2015 in West Africa, isolation and treatment of the sick in tent hospitals had made Ebola cases so rare that researchers had to switch to ring vaccination around the few they could find. A likely candidate for a routine Ebola vaccine is one now being developed by GSK, Dr. Nabel said. It uses two shots: the first has the Ebola surface protein attached to a chimpanzee adenovirus that can infect humans without harming them; the second uses a weakened pox virus similar to that used in smallpox vaccine. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Seth F. Berkley, chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said his organization\u2019s board voted in late 2014 to spend up to $390 million for 12 million doses of an Ebola vaccine. At the time, several companies had candidates but none had been fully tested in humans. \u201cThat was at a time when the epidemic was raging and we did not know if it could be controlled without a vaccine,\u201d he said. By early last year, when preliminary results suggested the Merck vaccine worked well, Gavi gave the company $5 million to make 300,000 doses as an emergency supply to be used if Ebola-Zaire exploded again. It is not yet clear how big a stockpile will eventually be created. Merck is now required to seek approval of its vaccine from the World Health Organization, which itself requires licensing by a major regulatory agency like the United States Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency.

    "text": "CBS/AP December 22, 2016, 1:03 PM Vladimir Putin says Russia's military is stronger than any potential foe Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian businessmen in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. (Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) AP Email MOSCOW -- \u00a0Russia\u2019s military today can overpower any potential foe, President Vladimir Putin told an annual end-of-year meeting Thursday with defense chiefs. \u201cWe can say with certainty: We are stronger now than any potential aggressor,\u201d he told the meeting. \u201cAnyone!\u201d His comments come at the end of a year when tensions between Russia and the West have remained on edge over the civil war in Syria . Tensions between Russia and the West have been souring ever since Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea and surreptitious support of separatists in eastern Ukraine . Relations dipped further after Russia last year launched an air offensive in Syria to support President Bashar Assad. At his year-end press conference, President Obama backed up U.S. intelligence community claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly... Both Russia and NATO members have conducted a flurry of military drills near Russia\u2019s borders this year. Russia insists it is responding to a growing NATO threat. Speaking at the defense ministry\u2019s headquarters in Moscow, Putin said Russia should be swift in \u201cadjusting plans to neutralize potential threats to our country.\u201d Putin spoke after Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu presented an annual report that lauded Russian military achievements in Syria and ongoing efforts to modernize the army. Shoigu said Russia has fully covered the Russian border with early warning anti-missile systems for the first time. He complained about increased NATO drone flights in border areas and announced plans to send more troops to Russia\u2019s west, southwest and the Arctic. Analysts say Russia\u2019s military forces remain materially weaker than NATO armies but are gaining technological ground, aided by Putin\u2019s aggressive command. Igor Sutyagin, a senior research fellow at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, said the Russian military was not the world\u2019s strongest. But he said Russian military performance was improving in part because Putin wields more control over his military compared to NATO nations. \u201cThe lack of restrictions makes them better equipped for combat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are stronger because if Putin wants to use them, he doesn\u2019t ask advice. He doesn\u2019t come to Parliament or to Capitol Hill.\u201d In its annual report on the global military balance, Britain\u2019s International Institute for Strategic Studies noted that Russia\u2019s use of new cruise missile designs in Syria and other recent military displays showed that it was catching up with the West on advanced weapons systems. \u201cThe efficiency and high quality of Russian weapons have been clearly shown in Syria,\u201d Putin said earlier this year. Putin thanked the defense ministry for its work but cautioned that \u201cthe situation might change very quickly (if) ... we let ourselves relax even for a moment.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "72 Dead in Siberia After Drinking Counterfeit Alcohol By PATRICK REEVELL Dec 22, 2016, 8:25 AM ET 0 Shares Star Kommersant via Getty Images Medical staff hold a press conference following an accident where people poisoned themselves with fake alcohol-containing liquid \"Boyaryshnik,\" Hawthorn infusion, in Irkutsk, Russia, Dec. 20, 2016. 0 Shares Email Seventy-two people in a Siberian city have died after drinking tainted bath oils, in one of the worst poisonings in Russian history. There are fears the death toll may climb further, with 33 people still hospitalized, according to authorities in the city, Irkutsk, in Russia\u2019s far east. Most of the victims, who were all from one neighborhood, were poisoned by drinking a counterfeit bath oil, police said. Although marked not for consumption, it was being drunk regularly as a cheap substitute for vodka. According to police, a batch was produced containing methanol, a highly toxic type of alcohol. Irkutsk\u2019s authorities have declared a state of emergency in an effort to halt the poisonings, launching raids and seizing tons of the bath oils and counterfeit spirits. Police have arrested 12 people over the production and sale of the oil and said they may have found the illegal factory that made the lethal batch. The Russian state news agency Tass reported today that authorities feared the cause of the poisonings may not be limited to the bath oil; counterfeit branded vodkas could have also played a factor. Irkutsk\u2019s Mayor Dmitry Berdnikov said authorities believe they have nonetheless succeeded in cutting off the source of the poisonings, with no new cases reported in the past two days. The catastrophe has prompted horror and outrage in Russia, recalling for many the darkest periods of the 1990s, when surrogate alcohols caused large numbers of deaths and mass poisonings were not uncommon. Rising living standards and a crackdown on counterfeit spirits saw such incidents largely disappear. But in the past two years, ordinary Russians\u2019 living standards have been adversely affected by an economic crisis prompted by low oil prices and Western sanctions. Prices have risen sharply, pushing people into poverty, particularly in provincial areas such as Irkutsk. Alcoholism in Russia remains a dire problem, with half a million Russians dying from alcohol-related causes in 2012, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development \u2014 accounting for 30 percent of deaths in the country that year. A rise in the price of vodka has been accompanied by a surge in the sale of substitute alcohols. Russia\u2019s Finance Ministry announced earlier this year it would take steps to lower the prices of the cheapest vodkas to discourage people from drinking dangerous alternatives. The poisonings in Irkutsk, though, illustrate how desperate the situation has become for some of Russia\u2019s poorest residents. The cheapest vodkas are priced at about $3 for a half-liter bottle, while the bath oil costs only 65 cents or so. Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday intervened in response to the disaster in Irkutsk, ordering the government to strengthen laws regulating the sale of products such as perfumes, lotions and cleaners that contain high levels of alcohol. \u201cWe have to raise excise duty, unfortunately or fortunately, on products containing alcohol, so that there won\u2019t be these little bottles for three cents,\u201d Putin said in comments broadcast on state television. \u201cPeople are dropping like flies. It doesn\u2019t matter if cosmetics will be more expensive in the end. People\u2019s lives cost more.\u201d 0 Shares ",

President-elect Donald Trump, seen here at the Republican convention, has received a judge's permission to settle a lawsuit he said he'd never settle. (Getty Images) David Lazarus Contact Reporter Mr. I-Don\u2019t-Settle-Lawsuits received the go-ahead this week to settle his lawsuits over alleged fraudulent practices by Trump University. U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego issued an order giving preliminary approval to a settlement agreed to by Trump\u2019s lawyers last month. According to the deal, Trump University now has to pony up $25 million to fund the settlement by Jan. 18. If Trump\u2019s namesake house of learning fails to come across with the cash \u2014 it\u2019s said by the Better Business Bureau to be \u201cno longer in business\u201d \u2014 Trump himself will have to make good. Two days later, he\u2019ll be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. \"In light of the multiple risks of continued litigation, the complexity of individualized damages determinations and the likelihood of delay of any recovery, the court preliminarily finds that the estimated amount of recovery that eligible class members will receive is fair, adequate and reasonable,\" Curiel said in his order. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the president-elect chose to settle so he can focus on running the country. He\u2019s admitted no wrongdoing. The Better Business Bureau waded into the icky mess that is Trump University on Tuesday. It\u00a0wanted to clarify the letter grade received by Donald Trump's Excellent Academic Adventure. All this to-do brings back happy memories for me of the time I attended a Trump University seminar and Trump tried... The Better Business Bureau waded into the icky mess that is Trump University on Tuesday. It\u00a0wanted to clarify the letter grade received by Donald Trump's Excellent Academic Adventure. All this to-do brings back happy memories for me of the time I attended a Trump University seminar and Trump tried... (David Lazarus) But let\u2019s not kid ourselves. There\u2019s nothing more sacrosanct to Trump\u2019s reputation as a businessman than the perception that he\u2019s second to none when it comes to wheeling and dealing in the property market. He was alleged in two California class-action lawsuits and one civil case filed by the New York attorney general to have defrauded Trump University students by offering \u201csecrets\u201d to real estate riches that seldom materialized. Trump settled because the last thing he wanted was weeks of testimony claiming he was defrauding people. (Full disclosure: I was on the witness list because of columns I\u2019d written about Trump University; Trump\u2019s lawyers filed a motion to block me from taking the witness stand.) Trump insisted during a campaign debate that even though\u00a0he could have settled the cases on any number of occasions, he refused to do so \u201cout of principle.\u201d \u201cThe people that took the course all signed \u2014 most \u2014 many \u2014 many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful,\u201d he declared. I got a distinctly different impression when I attended a Trump University seminar at the Pasadena Hilton in 2007 and spoke with prospective and former students. The event turned out to be nothing more than a two-hour sales pitch for a three-day workshop costing nearly $1,500. The \u201cpriceless information\u201d on making millions from real estate promised in an ad could be boiled down to this: Buy low, sell high. After I wrote about my seminar experience , Trump called to say he was going to sue me for the \u201cinaccurate and libelous\u201d things I\u2019d written. He also contacted my editor to say that I\u2019m a \u201cnasty guy\u201d and that the Los Angeles Times should fire me. He never sued. I\u2019m still employed. If Trump had gone to trial, he\u2019d have to explain hundreds of pages of Trump University \u201cplaybooks\u201d that had been introduced by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers as evidence in the case. The playbooks were intended to guide university employees in closing sales with seminar participants. \u201cWhen you introduce the price, don\u2019t make it sound like you think it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d one playbook advised. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make a big deal out of it, they won\u2019t.\u201d It emphasized that salespeople need to size up prospective students for how big a payout they\u2019d be good for \u2014 \u201cAre they a single parent of three children that may need money for food?\u201d \u2014 and identify those \u201cmost likely to buy.\u201d ",

    "text": "Aides to Mr. Trump, asked to clarify what the president-elect meant by the need to \u201cexpand\u201d the nuclear ability of the United States, responded with a statement that did not address that point. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jason Miller, the incoming White House communications director, said in a statement that Mr. Trump was referring to \u201cthe threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes.\u201d Mr. Miller added that the president-elect had in the past \u201cemphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\u201d Mr. Trump, in a Twitter post on Thursday, appeared to announce his new nuclear strategy. Here is what he might have meant. It was the second time in two days that aides had tried to recast a statement from Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, the president-elect appeared to say that recent terror attacks in Europe had vindicated his campaign pledge to bar Muslims from entering the United States. Aides later said he was merely restating his promise to implement strict vetting and suspend the admission of people from countries associated with terrorism. The vagueness of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on the country\u2019s nuclear abilities made it difficult to assess its possible impact on foreign policy once he takes office. Nuclear weapons are so fearsome that only a president can order their use, and deterrence is normally a complicated subject debated in academic treatises and negotiated over years by diplomats, and not normally in thoughts limited to 140 characters. It remained unclear from his use of the word \u201cexpand\u201d whether Mr. Trump would try to reverse agreements such as the New Start treaty , which Russia and the United States signed in 2010 and commits both nations to modest reductions in strategic nuclear forces. But the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s post \u2014 if it signals the beginning of a new era of nuclear weapons expansion in the United States \u2014 could be profound. Derek Johnson, the executive director of Global Zero , a group that seeks the elimination of nuclear weapons, accused Mr. Trump of calling for a \u201cnew nuclear arms race,\u201d even as Mr. Putin appears eager for a major expansion of Russian nuclear abilities. \u201cThe use of even a single nuclear weapon, anywhere in the world, would be a global humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in a statement. \u201cA nuclear buildup in the U.S. and Russia only makes that nightmare scenario more likely.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The United States and Russia are already racing to modernize their existing nuclear arsenals, replacing aging missile systems with smaller, more modern weapons that are harder to stop and more precise. That effort by Moscow and Washington, while allowed by current arms control treaties, has nonetheless caused fears of renewing a kind of Cold War-era arms race as the two nations seek technological dominance. Photo A Minuteman 3 missile in a training launch tube at Minot Air Force Base, N.D., in 2014. Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press The United States is also moving ahead with a modest system of missile defenses in Europe, a program that has deeply angered the Kremlin, which rejects arguments that it is aimed solely at the threat from Iran. But if Mr. Trump also intends to increase the number of America\u2019s nuclear weapons, it could represent a significant break in strategic policy that dates to talks between the two nations that began under President Richard M. Nixon. It could also be a drastic reversal of President Obama\u2019s approach. In one of his first major speeches in 2009, Mr. Obama told a cheering crowd in Prague that the United States would lead an effort to pursue rules and treaties that would result in a world without any nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama has had some limited success in pursuing that vision during his eight years in office. He convened a regular nuclear nonproliferation summit meeting aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear material with special concerns about terror groups gaining access to these materials. Mr. Obama negotiated a deal with Iran that his administration says would delay that government\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. But during Mr. Obama\u2019s time in office, North Korea has conducted several nuclear weapons tests. Contrary to Mr. Obama\u2019s own conciliatory nuclear posture, and concrete steps in that direction, his administration has also embarked on a sweeping modernization of the American nuclear arsenal that is estimated to cost up to $1 trillion over three decades. It features new factories, refurbished nuclear arms and a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. The bombers are to carry a new super-stealthy cruise missile meant to slip through enemy air defenses. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons even though he called their potential use \u201ca horror.\u201d Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The emails show he used his personal email accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. Emails of Mayor Rahm Emanuel have been released under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits. The emails show he used his personal email accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Ally Marotti and Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel is just as bullish on Chicago business in private emails as he is in public. Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, the mayor on Wednesday turned over about 2,700 pages of emails from his personal accounts that his attorney determined were government-related. Though many of the emails are short, and the mayor's only involvement often was forwarding them to an aide, they show Emanuel using his personal accounts to pursue business deals benefiting Chicago. They also show that business leaders knew how to reach him outside of his government email address. The emails reveal Emanuel's desire to bring a PayPal operations center to the city, and his reluctance to \"bash\" one of the city's largest private-sector employers. There are also emails with big asks from companies like Airbnb and H.J. Heinz. United Airlines Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... In April 2014, investment banker Byron Trott sent an email to Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's personal account in which he promised to co-host a political fundraiser, before making a series of requests that included asking that the mayor provide high-level access to a new executive at Trott's firm. \"Both... (Rick Pearson, David Heinzmann and Jeff Coen) Jonathan Tisch, co-chairman of the board of Loews, chairman and CEO of its Loews Hotel subsidiary and chairman emeritus of the United States Travel Association, emailed Emanuel in May, seeking to rebut airlines' concerns about competition from Middle Eastern airlines allegedly receiving unfair subsidies. Emanuel responded that he was unlikely to square off against Chicago-based United Continental Holdings. \"I dont (sic) plan on being like some mayors and bash my largest private sector employer,\" Emanuel wrote in an email last May. \"That said please send someone to brief us.\" United's name popped up again in a July 1 exchange between Emanuel and Kirkland & Ellis attorney William Singer, who sent Emanuel a copy of a letter to Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans. Singer said the letter explained a United proposal that reflects \"short term, but significant growth for O'Hare\" and that United is \"fully committed to the city's long term growth and expansion plans.\" The email exchange doesn't offer details on the proposal, but Emanuel appeared frustrated by the pace of progress and lack of detailed plans. \"If you all expected yippie lets go you got the wrong mayor,\" he said. Still, he said he told the aviation commissioner to give the proposal \"her full attention,\" signing off with \"be bold.\" Kraft Heinz Before H.J. Heinz completed its purchase of Kraft Foods Group in July 2015, an executive emailed then-deputy mayor Steve Koch to push the state and city to spell out what tax breaks they would be willing to offer to put some of the combined company's jobs in Chicago. \"If the state and Chicago are not going to offer a significant tax incentive program that will weight heavenly (sic) in our decision on how many jobs remain in Illinois given how aggressive Pennsylvania is being,\" senior vice president of corporate and government affairs Michael Mullen wrote in a June 2015 email. The email was shared with Emanuel, whose reply to Koch was redacted. A few weeks after Kraft, then based in north suburban Northfield, and Pittsburgh-based Heinz combined to form the third-largest food and beverage company in the U.S., Kraft Heinz announced it would move the Northfield headquarters to downtown Chicago's Aon Center. Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... Under pressure from a pair of open records lawsuits, Mayor Rahm Emanuel acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that allowed him to hide some of his government correspondence from the public since he took office. ... (Bill Ruthhart, Hal Dardick and Jeff Coen) Kraft Heinz ended up not getting any tax incentives related to the move, Mullen said in an email to the Tribune Thursday. \"The Mayor and his staff were instrumental in our decision to move downtown and we appreciate their ongoing cooperation and partnership,\" he said. PayPal Emanuel reached out to PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready in October, to figure out why the San Jose, Calif.-based company passed over Chicago as a location for an operations center. Other cities offered better incentives, Ready explained in his lengthy response. He specifically mentioned Illinois' EDGE program, which provides tax breaks for companies that bring jobs to the state. Mayor Rahm Emanuel turned over about 2,700 pages of emails Wednesday as part of a settlement with the Better Government Association, which had sued for the mayor's communications about official business on his personal email accounts.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel turned over about 2,700 pages of emails Wednesday as part of a settlement with the Better Government Association, which had sued for the mayor's communications about official business on his personal email accounts. A Chicago Tribune suit on similar issues, filed before the BGA... (Chicago Tribune) \"We are unable to monetize a majority of the credits being offered to the company before they expire.\" The top contending city was offering cash grants and refundable tax credits, Ready wrote. That reasoning was news to Emanuel. \"Somewhere there is a breakdown of information,\" he replied. There is still time for Chicago, and the potential operations center is part of a bigger strategy, Ready said in an email Oct. 28. PayPal representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Airbnb The city's new shared-housing ordinance and how it would affect Airbnb hosts was a hot topic in the mayor's inbox. Investor Marc Andreessen emailed Emanuel in November 2015, asking him to meet with Chris Lehane, Airbnb's head of global policy, to discuss Chicago's regulatory plans. Emanuel's private emails released These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 These are some of the emails in which Mayor Emanuel sounded off on a number of issues. Dec. 21, 2016. (CBS Chicago)\u00a0 See more videos Airbnb representatives said they thought Emanuel wasn't \"fully aware of what the bureaucrats have been working on,\" according to an email Andreessen forwarded to the mayor. Asking for the meeting seemed to be a drastic measure: In one of the emails, Andreessen's people call it an \"unusual ask\" by Airbnb. Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit said in a statement that the home-sharing company works with cities worldwide on clear and progressive home-sharing rules. \"Speaking with policymakers and community leaders is essential to crafting home-sharing rules that work for everyone,\" he said. The implementation of the ordinance has since been delayed and tweaked after being challenged by a couple of lawsuits. Talking up Chicago Occasionally, Emanuel sent emails to Chicago executives and other heavy hitters from his private account touting positive news about the city. On Sept. 1, he sent four dozen people, including United CEO Oscar Munoz, Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld and McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook the same email, with personalized salutations, highlighting improvements in Chicago Public Schools students' test scores and Fitch Ratings agency's decision to shift the city's credit outlook from \"negative\" to \"stable.\" ",

Since then, more than 100,000 people been detained, fired or suspended from their jobs on suspicion of sympathizing with or aiding the coup attempt. Defne Karadeniz/Getty Images A group of Turkish military officers deployed to the U.S. wants to stay in America much longer than a typical rotation for visiting foreign officers. More than two dozen officers deployed to a NATO command in the Norfolk, Va., area, are seeking asylum in the U.S., fearing they will be wrongly imprisoned by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, NPR has learned. Stark Choice For NATO's Turkish Officers: Arrests At Home, Limbo In Europe The men, including Turkish navy, air force and army officers who rank from major to much more senior grades, have been accused of ties to this summer's failed coup attempt against Erdogan. Some have been posted in the U.S. for as long as three years. The regime in Ankara is already putting pressure on their family members back home. \"I just got off the phone with my brother yesterday,\" one officer told NPR. \"He told me police officers arrived to arrest me \u2014 and if I were in Turkey right now, I [would be] arrested. ... I think they could arrest my family members.\" The men who spoke to NPR asked not to be identified, to protect friends and relatives in Turkey from potential reprisals for speaking out about their circumstances. They all received arrest warrants after the coup. Many of their names were on a long list of more than 1,000 Turkish officers.

Renfroe/U.S. Navy A stack of covers from senior leaders of international navies sits on a shelf during the 20th International Seapower Symposium at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I., in 2011. Senior military officers from around the world frequently visit the U.S. on official exchanges, such as the one in Virginia in which the Turkish officers took part. MC2 Shannon E. Renfroe/U.S. Navy The officers told NPR that only one colleague returned to Turkey when he was relieved by the government. They said he was arrested and imprisoned. Each officer told NPR he had nothing to do with the failed coup nor had any connection to Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish cleric living in the U.S. whom Erdogan has accused of masterminding the coup. Turkey has demanded the extradition of Gulen, whom it also implicated in this week's assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara. Gulen has denied both charges. A second, senior Turkish officer, who talked with NPR over tea and sweets, said more than 50 officers he knows have already been arrested back home \u2014 just some of the more than 100,000 people who have been detained in a huge purge affecting the Turkish military, academia, journalism and civil society. Several Turkish officers in Virginia said they believe they're being targeted because of their English skills and their time in service with Americans or NATO nations \u2014 all now suspect under the Erdogan government. In Turkey, The Man To Blame For Most Everything Is A U.S.-Based Cleric \"I did my master's degree in the U.S. and I was in a NATO position at the time\" of the coup, one said. \"In Turkey, they blame ... the coups on the United States or NATO. Based on this crazy fact, we are targeted.\" The officers showed NPR a request from the Turkish government for surveillance camera footage from various NATO commands during the time of the July coup attempt. \"Due to an ongoing investigation carried out by the office of public prosecutor in Ankara regarding the coup attempt in Turkey, the Turkish Military Authorities have demanded the surveillance camera recordings of work places and facilities between and including 15 and 20 July 2016 ... where Turkish Staff Personnel served,\" it said. NATO officials said they would not provide the footage. Erdogan has also charged that some American officers supported the failed coup attempt or were aware of it \u2014 charges President Obama and his administration have firmly rejected. Erdogan has called on Washington to hand over Gulen to face authorities in Ankara over the role Turkey says he played in the coup. The State Department says it is reviewing evidence sent by the Turks of Gulen's alleged involvement. Victims Of Turkey's Post-Coup Purge Invited To Prove Their Innocence As for the Turkish officers in Virginia, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NPR he could not comment on requests for asylum by foreigners, citing privacy regulations. Typical cases can last more than two years. The requests create another point of tension between Washington and Ankara. Granting asylum to Turkish officers considered criminals by their own government might further strain the relationship at a time when the U.S. wants to keep Turkey in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. American warplanes use a Turkish air base to launch some attacks on ISIS. Now out of work, the Turkish officers stranded in Virginia say they're getting support from their American colleagues, including at least one invitation last month to Thanksgiving dinner. They're no longer receiving their salaries, so the Turks are dipping into their savings, downsizing into smaller homes, even selling their cars and furniture. They not only need the money just to live, they said, but also to pay legal fees. Even so, one said they actually are lucky. \"Right now, I have my family. I have my freedom. I feel safe here, thanks to the U.S.,\" he said. \"But in Turkey, I am worried about friends and family and people, innocent people, who lost their freedom \u2014 who lost their basic human rights.\" ",

It requires Transgender people to use public restrooms matching their birth certificate gender. (Dec. 22) AP In this June 24, 2016, file photo, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper speaks during a forum in Charlotte. Cooper made appealing House Bill 2 part of his campaign. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) Spite has a price. If North Carolina lawmakers are going to continue targeting the LGBT community with legalized discrimination, as they indicated by this week\u2019s failure to repeal HB2, they can expect the state to be treated with equal disdain when it comes to major sporting events. The NBA All-Star Game, the NCAA tournament, ACC championships \u2014 there\u2019s more shunning where that came from. To get an idea of what being a pariah feels like, North Carolina only has to look across the border. For almost 15 years, the NCAA refused to award championships to South Carolina while the Confederate flag flew on the grounds of the state capitol. That\u2019s almost 15 years of lost income from traveling fans. Almost 15 years of some other state profiting from South Carolina residents who wanted to see the NCAA tournament, too. Before legislators dismiss this as a minor loss, consider that hosting a weekend of NCAA tournament games can bring a city $10 to $15 million. Losing the NBA All-Star Game is estimated to have cost Charlotte $100 million. That\u2019s a lot of money to pass up for a law that the majority of North Carolina doesn\u2019t even want. Repeal of N.C.\u2019s \u2018bathroom bill\u2019 stumbles. What happens now? House Bill 2 eliminated discrimination protections for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people, and barred cities from passing their own anti-discrimination ordinances. But it\u2019s become known as \u201cThe Bathroom Bill\u201d because it would require everyone to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. Proponents claim the bill will protect women and children from predators, unfounded hysteria that ignores the real danger it poses for transgendered people. As North Carolina took repeated hits to both its reputation and pocketbook \u2014 Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam canceled concerts in the state, and PayPal dropped plans for a facility that would have added 400 jobs in Charlotte \u2014\u00a0resident backlash to HB2 grew. By the time Gov. Pat McCrory, the bill\u2019s biggest champion, was voted out of office and replaced by Roy Cooper, who made overturning the bill a centerpiece of his campaign, polls showed more than 50% of voters opposed HB2. Guided by that, legislators met Wednesday to repeal HB2. But the deal fell apart. Cooper told The News & Observer he would continue to push for the repeal, saying, \u201cThis is not the kind of state we are.\u201d He also said he would plead the state\u2019s case with the various sports leagues. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get the ACC and the NCAA and try to get them to come to North Carolina anyway,\u201d Cooper told the paper. \u201cI\u2019m going to recruit businesses anyway.\u201d Good luck with that. For its many faults, the NCAA has been a consistent and vocal proponent of inclusion. Again, look at South Carolina.\u00a0A persona non grata with the folks in Indianapolis for almost 15 years, South Carolina got off the blacklist when it removed the Confederate flag from Capitol grounds in 2015. Lo and behold, when the NCAA stripped North Carolina of its championship events this fall, who was one of the states to benefit? \u201cBids were reviewed based on various criteria, including a site\u2019s capacity to host championships on the dates specified and the ability to ensure a quality student-athlete experience,\u201d the NCAA said in its release announcing that Greenville, S.C., would now host the first- and second-round games of the men\u2019s tournament that originally were awarded to the North Carolina city of Greensboro. \u201cHost cities were also required to complete a questionnaire outlining how they will protect participants and spectators from discrimination.\u201d The NBA isn\u2019t likely to be any more forgiving. It has long been the measuring stick on issues of equality and tolerance, and takes great pride in that role. Being a willing party to discrimination would go against everything the league stands for, and Commissioner Adam Silver isn\u2019t the type to sell the NBA\u2019s soul. North Carolina has chosen to stay on the wrong side of history and decency. It shouldn't be surprised when the NCAA and other major sports organizations refuse to play along. *** 222 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 26 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

    "text": "Inquiry Says Snowden in Contact With Russia's Spy Services By eileen sullivan and richard lardner, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 22, 2016, 2:05 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Edward Snowden on Trump, Petraeus, Having 'No Regrets' 0 Shares Email Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden remains in contact with Russian intelligence services, according to a bipartisan congressional report released at a time when Russia is considered a top national security concern. The two-year inquiry focused on Snowden's 2013 leak of classified U.S. material about America's surveillance programs. It concluded that Snowden compromised national security by these disclosures and is avoiding prosecution while living in a country that is considered one of the top U.S. adversaries. In recent months, U.S. intelligence agencies have been outspoken about their beliefs that Russia actively interfered in the U.S. political process by hacking into private email accounts. The report sends a strong message to President Barack Obama during his final days in office: Do not pardon Edward Snowden. Obama has not offered any indication that he is considering pardoning Snowden for the leaks that embarrassed the U.S. and angered allies. Lisa Monaco, Obama's adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, said last year that Snowden \"should come home to the United States and be judged by a jury of his peers \u2014 not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime.\" However, there has been a push by privacy advocacy groups to pardon the former NSA contractor who they herald as a whistleblower for leaking documents that disclosed the extent of the data the U.S. collects on Americans in its efforts to fight terrorism. After the disclosures, Obama reined in some of the surveillance authorities and put in place additional measures to provide more transparency to the classified programs. The House intelligence committee released the report to provide what the panel's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called \"a fuller account of Edward Snowden's crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U.S. national security.\" The 33-page unclassified report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliament's upper house, who asserted that \"Snowden did share intelligence\" with the Russian government. The report said, \"Since Snowden's arrival in Moscow, he has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services.\" The following sentence was redacted, and there is nothing in the unclassified report that explains why the committee believes Snowden is still sharing intelligence with the Russians. The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden isn't a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. \"Most of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans' privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America's adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,\" Schiff said. Ben Wizner, Snowden's lawyer, dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. \"The House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,\" Wizner said. \"The report wholly ignores Snowden's repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.\" One of the programs that came under great scrutiny is set to expire in a year, and it will be a top priority for the House committee, among others in Congress, to get it renewed. Under that program, the NSA sweeps up communications of non-Americans outside the U.S., and it can also capture the domestic communications of any American in contact with the terror suspect, even if those contacts have nothing to do with terrorism. The resulting sweeps are likely to have included emails and other data from tens of thousands of Americans over the past decade, experts have said. Three years ago, Snowden revealed U.S. government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

The five suspects, between age 21 and 26, were expected to appear in court Friday to be charged with acts in preparation of a terrorist event. They are believed to have been \"self-radicalized\" and inspired by ISIS, police said. Four of the five suspects were born in Australia. The fifth is from Egypt. They were arrested in a series of overnight raids at properties in Melbourne's northern suburbs. Two other people initially arrested in the raids -- a 26-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman -- were released without being charged, a police statement said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton told reporters that police had gathered evidence in the raids that the plotters were planning to use explosives in their attack. \"We gathered the makings of an improvised explosive device,\" he said. Ashton said the suspects had planned attacks on Melbourne's Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and nearby St. Paul's Cathedral.\u00a0 \"If this had got under our guard this would have been a significant attack,\" Ashton told reporters.\u00a0\"Certainly (there was the) potential for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.\" Ashton said police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, adding that intelligence suggested no threats to any other events. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. The arrests were made days after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people in the latest terror attack to strike Europe this year.

It is trifling,\u201d Gellman wrote back in September after reading a three-page executive summary of the report.\u00a0 Gellman, who is now a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, challenged multiple claims in the report, including the fact that Snowden \u201cfled to Russia\u201d (he tried to fly to Ecuador, but the U.S. government trapped him in Moscow when they revoked his passport) and that Snowden exaggerated his duties as an entry-level computer technician (he had multiple information security roles with the CIA, including one that deployed him to Geneva under diplomatic cover and another that involved regular meetings with the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the CIA\u2019s technical branches, Gellman said.)\u00a0 Three years later, the Snowden leaks continue to reverberate.

    "text": "Rise in Christmas Season Cardiac Deaths Not Necessarily Linked to Cold Weather, Study Finds By Gillian Mohney Dec 22, 2016, 4:00 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Heart Attack Warning Signs 0 Shares Email Doctors in the U.S. have long known that fatal cardiac events seem to occur more frequently during the winter holidays, but deciphering if these events are related to weather, holiday stress or some other cause has been difficult to parse out. But a study published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association offers some evidence that cold weather may not be behind the uptick in cardiac deaths -- long thought to be a possible culprit since it can put additional strain on the body. \"What is always difficult in observational studies such as this is separating correlation from causation,\" said Dr. Richard Josephson, a cardiologist at University Hospitals Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute at UH Cleveland Medical Center. Josephson was not involved in this study. \"In the U.S. and England or in Great Britain there is an upsurge in death around Christmas. It could be related to holiday or it could be related to the weather,\" Josephson told ABC News. What Does the Future Hold for Youngest Double Hand Transplant Patient To find out if weather was behind this increase in cardiac deaths during the holidays, the researchers from multiple institutions, including the University of Melbourne and University of Auckland, studied mortality data from New Zealand, where summer coincides with the holiday season. After examining 25 years of data from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, the researchers were able to see if fatal cardiac events increased during the holiday season. Despite the naturally warm weather in December and January, they found that 4.2 percent more people die from cardiac-related causes during the Christmas period -- Dec. 25 to Jan. 7 -- compared to the rest of the year. Only deaths that took place outside a hospital were counted. The researchers found that these deadly cardiac events also seemed to affect slightly younger people during the Christmas period compared to the rest of the year. During the Christmas period the average age of those who died via cardiac-event was 76, while during the rest of the year the average age was 77. As a result of the findings, the researchers theorize that the uptick in cardiac death around the holidays is likely not due to cold weather. Instead they theorize it might be due to holiday stress, changes in diet or alcohol consumption, delay in seeking medical care or even due people who are extremely sick and want to live long enough to get through the holidays with family. \"The Christmas holiday period is a common time for travel within New Zealand, with people frequently holidaying away from their main medical facilities,\" Josh Knight, a study author and research fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said in a statement. \"This could contribute to delays in both seeking treatment, due to a lack of familiarity with nearby medical facilities, and due to geographic isolation from appropriate medical care in emergency situations.\" Josephson said the study was interesting but noted that the effect \"is only modest in size.\" People can take basic steps to safeguard their health, Josephson noted, including checking they have their medication, eating a healthy diet and not overindulging in alcohol. \"The Greeks said everything in moderation and I don't know that we'll find anything more wise than that over the years,\" Josephson said. 0 Shares ",

Erich Nowsch, 21, said \"I've never been in trouble my whole life\" and sobbed after the sentence was read, NBC affiliate KSNV reported . Nowsch had pleaded guilty to fatally shooting Tammy Meyers, 44, in front of their home on Feb. 12, 2015, but later tried unsuccessfully to withdraw the plea. From left, Derrick Andrews and Eric Nowsch. Nowsch is accused of fatally shooting a mother of four in Las Vegas in 2015 and Andrews is accused of being the driver. Las Vegas Sun; AP The shooting came at the end of what may have been a case of mistaken identity in which Meyers with her armed son went looking for the driver from another road-rage incident earlier that day \u2014 and came upon Nowsch in a similar-looking car and followed it, a prosecutor has said. Nowsch allegedly opened fire on Meyers' car on the road and later shot at Meyers and her son, Brandon, outside their home. Meyers was shot in the head and died two days later. Brandon Meyers returned fire outside the home but no one was hit, authorities have said. Nowsch told police he thought he was being targeted by someone who had threatened him, according to a video of the confession made public in August of 2015. Meyers' husband, Robert, said Thursday that Nowsch \"had a way out\" and could have left, KSNV reported. Nowsch in March pleaded guilty to second-degree murder with a deadly weapon, attempted murder with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm from a vehicle. Months later Nowsch later tried to change his plea to not guilty, claiming \"ineffective counsel,\" but a judge denied that request . Derrick Andrews, 28, who drove Nowsch the night of the shooting, pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntary manslaughter and accessory to commit murder and was sentenced to between 5 and 15 years in prison.

People wait to withdraw money from an ATM in Caracas, Venezuela, on Dec. 19, 2016. (Miguel Gutierrez / European Pressphoto Agency) Mery Mogollon and Chris Kraul Juan Artega said he had the money to buy Christmas toys for his 5-year-old daughter. The problem was that the bank would allow him to take out only the equivalent of $4 a day. On Thursday, for the third straight day, the construction worker spent his lunch hour in east Caracas in line at an ATM. \u201cI still don\u2019t have what I need,\u201d Artega said after making his withdrawl. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Add a new hardship to the economic, political and social chaos plaguing Venezuela: a scarcity of cash. Two Sundays ago, President Nicolas Maduro declared that the 100-bolivar bill, the largest and most common note in circulation, would become obsolete and illegal as tender in a week. He later extended the deadline to Jan. 2. Maduro said his aim was to frustrate currency speculators in Colombia and Brazil who he claimed had driven down the bolivar\u2019s value. But the effect has been the drying up of cash as 100-bolivar notes \u2014 though each worth just over 2 U.S. pennies \u2014 account for about 70% of the total cash value in circulation. Coming at the busiest shopping season of the year, the cash scarcity has sent frustrated citizens into the streets to protest. Hundreds of stores in nine states were reported looted over the last week, and authorities said that in confrontations with police 233 people were arrested and four were killed. In the eastern state of Bolivar, 600 businesses in its capital, Ciudad Bolivar, were reported to have been looted. In the month before Maduro\u2019s decree, the bolivar had lost 80% of its value in most exchange houses. Carrying the equivalent of $20 now means stuffing nearly 1,000 bills into a backpack. Insisting that Venezuela\u2019s economic chaos is due not to his mismanagement but interference from outside the country, Maduro said the culprits were dark forces waging economic war against him. \u201cWe have to strike back at the mafias,\u201d Maduro told a national TV audience. \u201cWe are being made victims of an international sabotage.\u201d But the president\u2019s order that \u00a0all Venezuelans return the 100-bolivar bills to banks to be exchanged for new bills later in the month backfired. The new, 500-bolivar bills have yet to appear. Although merchants are legally required to accept the 100-bolivar notes until Jan. 2, many are refusing to do so because they don\u2019t want to be stuck with bills that could be worthless in a few days. Although the bolivar recovered some of its value at the exchange houses this week, economists said the decree is ravaging an already frail economy. The cash shortage could shave up to 1% off the country\u2019s economic output this year, said Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan economist at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. he said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a very costly decision that has had and will continue to have long lasting negative economic and social effects,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of incompetence, ignorance and ideology that I think has backfired. \u201c The cash scarcity is the latest in a litany of problems for an economy that will contract this year by as much as 10% after shrinking 6% in 2015. Much of that drop stems from a sharp decline in the price of oil, exports of which account for more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign trade. The government also has spent more on social programs than it collects in taxes, creating budget deficits and fueling inflation that this year will reach 500%. For many Venezuelans, holiday plans have been scaled back. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the government has taken such hasty measures without any planning,\" said Karim Mendez, a secretary. \u201cThis has really affected the tranquility of the people during the holidays.\u201d She said her bank\u2019s cash machines are simply dispensing 100-bolivar notes. \u201cIt makes no sense at all,\u201d she said.

Sun December 22 at 8:00 AM Follow @bylenasun Erich Burger, of Baltimore, is recovering at home from a rare and often fatal disease. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) The problems started after Erich Burger returned from an unforgettable safari in Botswana and Zambia last month. The Baltimore software engineer got sick the day after he got home. He headed to a community hospital after about a week of fever and chills, thinking he might have malaria given his recent travel to Africa. Clinicians took a detailed travel history, admitted him to the intensive care unit as his blood pressure plummeted and ordered blood tests. A sharp-eyed hematology technician discovered when she looked in her microscope that he was suffering from a disease so rare in the United States that it has been seen only 40 times in the past 50 years. The disease is one of the few \u201cuniversally lethal\u201d infections: It always kills unless it is treated, and it kills quickly. It is often what went wrong that dictates the course of stories about exotic diseases or the challenge of diagnosis. But in this case, the opposite was true: At every step, Burger encountered health-care workers who did the right thing at the right time, with little precedent for their decisions, while everyone raced the clock. \u00a0 Erich Burger near Chobe National Park in Botswana. He went on safari and became ill. (Patrick Sosnowski) Burger, 48, spent about four weeks this fall in\u00a0Botswana and Zambia with his wife, Bernadette, his brother, Dorsey, a wildlife biologist, and friend, Patrick Sosnowski. It was a reunion of a safari trip they had taken together\u00a0two decades earlier. They roamed game parks without guides, driving 30 to 60 miles a day in rented Toyota Land Cruisers, spotting wildlife that included lions, elephants, hyenas, even a python. Burger and his wife returned to Baltimore on Nov. 19.\u00a0When he developed\u00a0fever, aches and chills the next day, he thought he had picked up a minor bug \u2014 and that the long flights were catching up with him. He got progressively worse and had to skip Thanksgiving at a relative\u2019s house. On Monday, Nov. 28, Burger went to his primary care doctor. Initial blood tests showed some troubling indicators, such as elevated readings of liver enzymes. The doctor suggested\u00a0over-the-counter medication to control the fever. But by Dec. 1, Burger had nausea and was having bad night sweats\u00a0and difficulty getting out of bed. His wife drove him to the emergency room at Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Md., the hospital where his doctor is affiliated. Burger could barely stand. His blood pressure had fallen to 70 over 52 millimeters of mercury; a typical reading is 120 over 80. For several hours, Burger received intravenous fluids to stabilize his blood pressure before being admitted to the intensive care unit. \u201cHe was very sick. Once that top number is much below 100, it\u2019s often associated with a patient who is in shock,\u201d said David Vitberg, the ICU doctor at GBMC who oversaw Burger's care. The ER team took his travel history, including the specific countries he had visited. Like Burger, doctors thought malaria was the most likely suspect, even though he had taken anti-malarial medication. \u00a0The ICU team started Burger on medication to treat malaria and sent his blood to the lab for a positive diagnosis. While on safari in Botswana and Zambia, Burger and his group saw a great variety of wildlife, including hippos. (Erich Burger) A panic alert The order for a blood parasite test was at the top of Gail Wilson\u2019s to-do list when she arrived for work at 7 a.m. Friday, Dec. 2. She has worked for 22 years as a medical technologist, the last two at GBMC. She knew the procedure would take several hours. The blood smears \u2014 one thin and one thick \u2014 needed to dry for three hours first before a stain could be applied that would highlight any parasites. Looking at his blood cells under a microscope, she realized he didn't have malaria. Instead, she found a rare and lethal parasite most clinicians have only seen in textbooks.\u00a0Wilson had to look really hard because \u201cthere were just a few on my slide and could have easily been missed,\u201d she said. But there they were, some purplish-blue parasites that looked \u201clike a wavy kind of ribbon with a dot in the middle,\u201d she said.\u00a0Wilson recognized the distinctive shape from competency exams she is required to take every year. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I was like, \u2018Oh, no,' \u201d recalled Wilson. \u201cI knew it was serious and that the patient could die.\u201d After conferring with colleagues and supervisors, she notified Burger\u2019s nurse that the blood parasite screen was positive for trypanosome parasites. The notification was a panic alert reserved for lab tests that show extreme or unusual results. Wilson realized that Burger had\u00a0African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness \u2014 a deadly disease spread by the tsetse fly. It was 10:55 a.m. This slide shows the parasite, in dark blue, in Burger's blood. The parasite causes African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which is fatal within months if not treated. (Courtesy of the Greater Baltimore Medical Center) Among infections, African trypanosomiasis is in a special category. \u201cUnlike almost any other infection, this is a death sentence if it\u2019s not treated,\u201d said Theresa Shapiro, a clinical pharmacology professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who has spent much of her career studying the disease. Along with HIV and rabies, sleeping sickness is one of the few \u201cuniversally lethal\u201d diseases: they are always fatal without treatment. The disease has two forms, both transmitted by the tsetse fly , which lives only in rural Africa. The parasites for both forms look identical. West African trypanosomiasis accounts for virtually all reported cases of sleeping sickness , according to the World Health Organization. A person can be infected for months or years without major signs or symptoms of the disease. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, and muscle and joint aches. But left untreated, the disease progresses to the central nervous system after one to two years, leading to personality changes, daytime sleepiness and progressive confusion, according to the CDC. Death usually occurs in about three years. East African trypanosomiasis is more rare but kills within months. Nearly all cases are reported in parts of eastern and southeastern Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia. People at greatest risk are tourists, hunters and others working in or visiting game parks, where hoofed animals are the main reservoirs for the parasite that causes the disease and tsetse flies are common. Over the past century, the disease has caused several epidemics in Africa, and those hardest hit live in the most remote parts of the continent . In the United States, most cases of sleeping sickness have been in travelers such as Burger, on safari in East Africa. Within seconds of Wilson's panic alert, the information popped up in Burger\u2019s electronic medical record. Vitberg and the rest of Burger\u2019s medical team happened to be in his room during their daily rounds. \u201cI think I said, \u2018Holy cow, I\u2019ve never seen that before,\u2019 \u201d Vitberg recalled. He knew that making a diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis in the United States was \u201cprobably a once-in-a-medical career experience.\u201d He wanted to make absolutely sure. On the laptop, he immediately pulled up an online medical reference, an industry standard known as UpToDate, and rifled through the sections on the disease. He asked Burger whether he remembered being bitten by tsetse flies, \u201cand he was immediately able to tell me he was bitten when he was in Africa,\u201d Vitberg recalled. Burger suspects he was bitten by tsetse flies while walking through game parks. \u201cThey\u2019re sizable and they hurt and they tend to land on you and they stay,\u201d Burger said. Once, he had a dozen flies on his back. It was too hot to wear anything but shorts and T-shirts, he said. Insect repellent is not particularly effective against tsetse flies, which can bite through lightweight clothing. Immediately, the diagnosis shifted from a consideration to near 100 percent confidence. What was worse, Burger's medical team knew he must have the fast-acting East African form of the disease because of his travel history and because\u00a0he got sick so quickly after infection. But no one knew which stage of the disease he had, and the treatments are different \u2014 and dangerous. Within minutes, the hospital\u2019s infectious disease doctor, Alina Sanda, started making calls, including to the CDC\u2019s 24-hour parasitic diseases hotline , to ask for help. The drugs to treat the disease are extremely toxic, and only the CDC has a supply . Sanda, with seven years as an infectious disease doctor, had only learned about sleeping sickness in theory. \u201cI never took care of a patient with it, so that made me anxious and worried,\u201d she said. Unable to reach someone at the CDC right away \u2014 she left a message on a recording \u2014 Sanda contacted an infectious disease colleague at Hopkins for help. Robin McKenzie, an infectious disease specialist, had never treated African trypanosomiasis, either. But she was able to reach an epidemiologist at CDC\u2019s parasitics diseases branch. It was just before 2 p.m. 'The stakes are very high' At the CDC, epidemiologist Eugene Liu spoke with both infectious disease experts,\u00a0consulted with another CDC expert and began putting the wheels in motion for the agency to get the medicine and transport it to Baltimore. His background is also infectious disease, but he had also never cared for a patient with African trypanosomiasis. \u201cIt is very rare, even for the CDC,\u201d he said. GBMC sent electronic images of the blood smear to Atlanta, and the CDC lab confirmed it showed the lethal parasites. But now a critical question loomed. Which medicines to send? The medications differ depending on the form of the disease and how far the infection has spread. Suramin, discovered in 1920, is used to treat patients with the East African form if the parasites are only in blood. But if the parasites have reached the central nervous system, a much more toxic medication is the only treatment. Called melarsoprol, it is basically arsenic. \u201cBetween five and 10 percent of people die from the treatment because it\u2019s so toxic,\u201d said Shapiro, the Hopkins sleeping sickness expert. Untreated, the patients always die. \u201cSo the stakes are very high,\u201d she said. Burger and wife Bernadette on safari. He is recovering from African sleeping sickness after a sharp-eyed technician spotted the parasite in a lab test. (Patrick Sosnowski) The CDC, which maintains a stockpile of therapeutics to treat rare, serious or life-threatening diseases, decided to send both medicines, just in case. By then, the agency\u2019s regular drug service was closed. Liu had to get the medicines from an emergency supply at the Parasitic Diseases Branch. He wrapped 10 ampuls of the melarsoprol and five vials of suramin in bubble wrap and put them in a package marked with a red-and-white \u201cemergency medical supply\u201d label. The agency\u2019s Emergency Operations Center arranged for the medicine to be flown on a Delta Air Lines flight leaving Atlanta at 10 p.m. for Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Liu waited outside the agency\u2019s security gate for the courier. There would be no charge for the medicine or the emergency transportation. The only way to tell whether Burger had parasites in his central nervous system was by performing a spinal tap\u00a0to collect the clear fluid that circulates in the space surrounding the spine and brain. But there was concern about when to do the spinal tap. If the infection had not yet spread to the central nervous system, injecting a needle into Burger's back could make things worse. \u201cOften when you do a spinal tap, as you push the needle through the skin and muscle, you drag in red blood cells from those tissues,\u201d Vitberg said. That could introduce parasites from the blood into the spinal column. By then, it became clear that Hopkins, an academic medical center with more resources and expertise, would be better equipped to treat Burger than GBMC, a community hospital. Burger arrived by ambulance at Hopkins on Friday evening. The medicines from the CDC arrived a few hours later, at 1:30 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 3. Burger got his first dose of suramin on Saturday, an intravenous treatment that lasted four hours. That allowed the drug to reduce the level of parasites in his blood so doctors could do a spinal tap the next day to check for parasites or evidence of infection in his spinal fluid. The results showed no parasites and no sign of infection. \u201cThat was a big relief for me,\u201d Burger said. Within days, he was feeling better. On Dec. 8, he was discharged, one week after he showed up in the emergency room. He still needs one more treatment, on Friday. And doctors must monitor him closely because the drug can be toxic to the kidneys and liver. He has developed an itchy rash on his arms, legs and chest. But he feels lucky and grateful to the CDC and the personnel at both hospitals, especially to technician Wilson who first spotted the parasite. She, more than anyone, saved his life. He\u2019s thinking of framing the electronic image of the parasite from her blood test, but he may hold off. He still needs to have a spinal tap every six months for the next two years to make sure the parasites aren't lurking in his nervous system. And he doesn\u2019t want to press his luck. And yet, he would not hesitate to travel to Africa again. \u201cReally, my answer has always been, of course I'll go back to Africa,\u201d said Burger, who has made several trips, starting when he was 15. \u201cI don't want to go through life too frightened of the risks to actually live and enjoy. I'm not going to stop traveling because a fly bit me.\u201d Read more: ",

The only confirmed talent so far are 16-year-old \"America\u2019s Got Talent\" 2010 runner-up Jackie Evancho, the\u00a0Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and the Rockettes. Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway insisted to ABC News there will be more singers, but refused to name them. Many performers -- some who have been asked, others who have not -- have already taken a pass.\u00a0 SYLVESTER STALLONE WON'T GO FOR JOB IN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Gene Simmons' wife told\u00a0 TMZ \u00a0KISS \"politely declined\" the invitation to perform at the inauguration. Simmons said he would be touring Europe at the time. Trump's longtime friend Steve Wynn reportedly promised to deliver Celine Dion to perform at the\u00a0inauguration, but could not follow through. Producer David Foster released a statement \u201cpolitely declining\u201d the offer to participate in the inauguration after rumors swirled he was participating. Elton John told the New York Times he was not performing after Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the presidential transition team,\u00a0told the BBC the singer would sing a song or two. Page Six reported that Andrea Bocelli will not perform because of the backlash he received over accepting the gig. They also reported that President-Elect Trump suggested the tenor not participate because of said backlash. Variety and the NY Post have reported that Garth Brooks will not perform at the inauguration after\u00a0 he said earlier this month he \"would be honored\" \u00a0to perform. Brooks did not return FOX411\u2019s request for comment. The manager for the band Chainsmokers had to respond to New York Magazine\u2019s Brian Feldman after he tweeted the band was performing. They are not. \u201cWill and Grace\u201d star Eric McCormack told The Wrap he would perform at the inauguration, but only in exchange for a lobotomy, adding: \"My whole brain removed from my head\u2026I don\u2019t know what the line-up will be, but I hear Scott Baio\u2019s doing dramatic readings.\u201d There is no indication that McCormack was asked. But for those who expect a good dose of entertainment with their inauguration, there's still hope! ALEC BALDWIN PLANS DONALD TRUMP ON 'SNL' FOR HOW MUCH? A spokesperson for the Beach Boys told FOX411 that the band has been asked to play at the inauguration but \u201cno decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate.\u201d And what about those other celebs who have supported Trump like Kid Rock and Kanye West? Or Ted Nugent or Paris Hilton or any of the other vocal celebs that have publicly endorsed Trump along the way? Those celebs did not return FOX411\u2019s request for comment. Which isn't a no. Trump's team did not respond to our request for comment, either. You can follow Blanche Johnson on Twitter @blancheFOXLA . Advertisement ",

The incident began in a Fort Worth neighborhood Wednesday afternoon when an officer was called by Jacqueline Craig who had been arguing with a man who she said physically confronted her 7-year-old son for littering. In the video, posted live on Facebook Wednesday, Craig can be seen telling a Fort Worth police officer that a neighbor choked her son after the neighbor said the child littered in his yard.\u00a0 The officer is heard asking her, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you teach your son not to litter?\u201d The woman says the neighbor can\u2019t prove to her the boy littered, but said \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if he did or didn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t give him the right to put his hands on him.\u201d The officer replies, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Warning: Video may be disturbing and contains graphic language The conversation escalates and the officer can be seen taking Craig to the ground, handcuffing her and pointing what appears to be a Taser at a teen girl, later identified as Craig\u2019s daughter. A family attorney said Thursday the Taser was not deployed. The officer is also seen taking the teen to the ground and handcuffing her. The woman filming identifies herself as Craig\u2019s daughter and is heard yelling at the officer, telling him she\u2019s filming and he\u2019s \u201con live.\u201d The woman filming was also later detained, reports CBS DFW. The video has sparked several calls for civil rights protests in downtown Fort Worth, the station reports. In a statement, Fort Worth police say they became aware of the Facebook video around 10 p.m. Wednesday and their internal affairs unit immediately began investigating. Two of the three arrestees were interviewed at the Fort Worth jail and officials also interviewed witnesses and reviewed the Facebook video. In a press conference, family attorney Lee Merritt said the officer was the one to \u201cbrutally escalate\u201d the situation and called for him to be immediately terminated and charged. Merritt also called for charges to be dropped against his clients and for the man accused of choking the boy to be arrested. \u201cThe man should have been placed under arrest; instead, the mother was questioned,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Anis Amri, 24, was at the center of an international manhunt Thursday after authorities found his personal documents inside the vehicle that plowed through the Christmas market on Monday. Twelve people were killed and almost 50 others injured in the attack that has since been claimed by ISIS. Amri's apparent journey is a well-trodden path familiar to experts: a youngster gets in trouble with the law, goes to jail and finally winds up on the path of extremism.

The report said groups such as ISIS are able to offer criminals \"redemption\" from their life of crime, while \"satisfying [their] personal needs and desires\" by giving them a cause to carry on offending. \"The 'jump' from criminality to terrorism [is] smaller than is commonly perceived,\" it added. Anis Amri is being sought by German police in connection with the Christmas market truck ramming in Berlin. Bundeskriminalamt From Troubled Teen to Alleged Terrorist Amri was born in Tunisia in 1992. He left his rural hometown of Oueslatia in 2011 following the Arab Spring uprising of that year. Interviewed following the attack this week, friends back home described a regular kid who showed no signs of radicalization when he left the country as a teenager. \"He's not a terrorist \u2014 Anis is a random citizen, he's like me, like many other people,\" one of his friends, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters. \"He's a normal guy who fled despair in search of a better life.\" Aged 19, he appears to have taken the dangerous migrant crossing from North Africa to Europe, a route now traveled by hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees each year. The teenager landed in Italy, where he had his first brush with the law. Terror suspect Anis Amri left Tunisia for a better life, his family said. ZOUBEIR SOUISSI / Reuters According to Italian media reports, he was jailed for four years in the fall of 2011 for starting a fire, although there were conflicting reports about the details. One version of events, according to daily newspaper La Repubblica, said he was among a group of migrants who landed on the island of Lampedusa and, upon hearing they were about to be repatriated to Tunisia, started a revolt and burned down the island's migrant reception center. Another newspaper, La Stampa, said he set fire to a school he enrolled with in the Sicilian city of Catania. Italian officials did not respond to a request from NBC News for clarification. After he left jail in 2015, Tunisia resisted attempts by Italian authorities to repatriate him. His brother, Abdelkader Amri, told The Associated Press he may have been radicalized while in prison in Italy. Play ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Kellyanne Conway (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) Donald Trump appointed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway to a high-ranking White House position on Thursday while also wading into an\u00a0Israeli-Palestinian dispute at the United Nations. In appointing Conway as counselor to the president, Trump said she\u00a0\"has been a trusted adviser and strategist who played a crucial role in my victory. She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message.\" As he prepared for another set of transition meetings on Thursday, Trump also issued a statement criticizing a proposed United Nations Security Council resolution seeking to halt Israeli settlements on land disputed with the Palestinians. \"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\" Trump said. \"This (proposal)\u00a0puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\" Trump nominates Friedman as ambassador to Israel Trump and aides had talked to Conway about becoming White House press secretary, but she sought a more advisory position. Some aides had criticized Conway for making public criticism of secretary of State candidate Mitt Romney, and at one time Conway talked about taking a job outside the Trump administration, perhaps with a newly formed pro-Trump political organization. In thanking the president-elect for an \"amazing opportunity\" to be presidential counselor, Conway said that \"a\u00a0Trump presidency will bring real change to Washington and to Americans across\u00a0this great nation. I am humbled and\u00a0honored to play a role in helping transform the movement he has led into a real agenda of action and results.\" The transition team said that Trump's victory last month \"shattered the glass ceiling for women. Conway is the first female campaign manager of either major party to win a presidential general election.\" Conway now becomes the highest-ranking woman in Trump's White House. Trump made the Conway announcement before another day of meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. In other developments, the Trump transition announced that: \u2022\u00a0Vice President-elect Mike Pence will hold a conference call Thursday with Cabinet nominees. \u2022\u00a0The president-elect will interview former Texas A&M University president Elsa Murano for the still-vacant position of secretary of Agriculture.

By Hugh Naylor December 22 at 4:58 PM Follow @HughNaylor BEIRUT \u2014 Syria\u2019s government declared Thursday that it had regained full control of Aleppo after the last rebel fighters and civilians evacuated the key city as part of an agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey. The Syrian military announced on state media that \u201csecurity and stability\u201d had been returned to eastern Aleppo, once the largest rebel stronghold. The \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 a term used by the Syrian government to describe nearly all of its opponents \u2014 had exited the city, the military said. President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s consolidation of Aleppo marks the end of the opposition presence in the city for the first time since 2012, in perhaps the most important battleground in the country\u2019s raging civil war and a major blow to the rebellion to unseat Assad. With crucial military and economic aid from Russia and Iran, Assad\u2019s grip on power now looks much firmer compared with the uprising against him that erupted in 2011 . The Syrian leader and his allies are poised to consolidate their hold on areas of the country under their control and further squeeze the beleaguered rebellion elsewhere. His critics in the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia must increasingly grapple with a Syria, or at least major parts of it, that is now firmly under his control. 1 of 41 Images from inside the besieged Syrian city. Caption Images from inside the Syrian city. \u00a0Dec. 19, 2016 Syrians evacuated from Fuaa and Kafraya, two Shiite villages under rebel siege, are welcomed by pro-government forces as they arrive in Jibrin, on the eastern outskirts of Aleppo. George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images [ Endgame in Aleppo, the most decisive battle yet in Syria\u2019s war ] The foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey met in the Russian capital Tuesday to discuss ways to end the Syrian war, which has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced millions. On Thursday, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said in an interview with the RIA Novosti news agency that Assad\u2019s future is \u201cabsolutely not a topic for discussion right now.\u201d Last week, pro-rebel residents of Aleppo began boarding buses to flee the war-ravaged eastern districts of the city as part of the Russia-Turkey deal that effectively surrendered their areas to Assad\u2019s forces. In frigid winter weather, desperate men, women and children waited in the thousands to be shuttled westward to the rebel-held Idlib province. The deal broke down multiple times as government-allied militia from Lebanon and Iran demanded similar evacuations from nearby Shiite villages besieged by rebel fighters. \u201cWe left Aleppo with broken hearts,\u201d said Abu Jaafar, a 60-year-old father of five who was evacuated from eastern Aleppo. U.N. officials said earlier Thursday that more than 40,000 people have been evacuated since Thursday, but the total number is unclear. Before the agreement, the United Nations estimated that about 250,000 people lived in eastern Aleppo. For Syria\u2019s armed opposition, Thursday\u2019s events are a severe setback, if not an outright catastrophe. As the final buses departed the snow-glazed ruins of eastern Aleppo late Thursday, rebel fighters expressed sadness. Some lashed out at the international community for what they said was insufficient support \u2014 especially weapons \u2014 to battle Assad and his powerful allies, including Iranian-controlled Shiite militia from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cAll the world remained silent toward the crimes committed by the Russians, Iranians and 60 Shiite sectarian groups by not enabling rebels to obtain the means for defending themselves and their lands,\u201d said Lt. Col. Abu Bakr, a commander of the Jaish al-Mujahideen group that is part of the rebel umbrella Free Syrian Army. \u201cThis victory of Russia and Iran\u2019s sectarian militias is over the ruins of a destroyed city.\u201d In 2012, rebel forces had triumphantly stormed the eastern districts of Aleppo and hoped to use the city as a staging ground for their eventual assault on the capital, Damascus, where they hoped to unseat Assad. Instead, the war dragged on. Government allies, notably Iran and Russia, helped Assad gain the momentum. And in that time, residents of eastern Aleppo endured years of horrific bombardment from government and Russian warplanes that decimated hospitals, homes and entire families.

Shares of Lockheed Martin fell Monday, Dec. 12, 2016, as President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that making F-35 fighter planes is too costly and that he will cut \"billions\" in costs for military purchases. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump has taken to Twitter again to express his displeasure about the price tag of an aircraft. \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\" he tweeted Thursday. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump's tweet comes the day after he met with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin to discuss the F-35 fighter and the new Air Force One . In recent weeks Trump has tweeted about the high costs of the new Air Force One and the F-35 that is intended to become the main fighter aircraft for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps . On Wednesday Trump met separately with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida to discuss both programs. Those meetings were followed by a separate meeting with senior military officials involved with the development of both aircraft. The Pentagon is in the process of purchasing 2,443 F-35 fighters that will become the standard fighter aircraft for the military. The F-35 has stealth capability and is one of the most highly computerized aircraft to ever fly. Each F-35 costs about $112 million to produce, but Lockheed Martin estimates that costs will go down as more aircraft are produced so that by 2019 each F-35 will cost $85 million. The F/A-18 is a fighter aircraft that went into use in the 1980s by the Navy and Marine Corps as a carrier-based aircraft. It is not flown by the Air Force. The Navy and Marine Corps are in the process of modernizing their F/A-18 aircraft until they are all eventually replaced by the F-35. \"I had a productive meeting with President-elect Trump this afternoon,\" Marillyn Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed Martin, said in a statement following her meeting Wednesday with Trump. \"I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 program and the progress we've made in bringing costs down. The F-35 is a critical program to our national security , and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our U.S. military and our allies.\" Trump later met with Air Force generals and Navy admirals involved with both programs. He told reporters the meeting was focused on \"trying to get costs down cost primarily the F-35 trying to get the costs down cause it's a program that's very very expensive.\" \"We are going to get the costs down and get it done beautifully,\" he added. He described the senior military officials he met with as \"great people, amazing people, I'm very impressed with them and very good negotiators.\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg described his meeting with Trump about the new Air Force One as a \"very productive\" discussion. Muilenberg said that they could produce the new Air Force One \"affordably\" for less than the $4 billion price tag that Trump has described for the aircraft that will go into service in 2024. \"We will get it done for less than that,\" Muilenberg told reporters. The Air Force has projected that over the next five years the new Air Force One could cost $2.78 billion, but there is no full contract with Boeing yet. For now, the Air Force has spent almost $170 million on three small contracts with Boeing related to the project. 0 Shares ",

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune N'DIGO publisher Hermene Hartman took a political risk when she became an early and prominent African-American supporter of Rahm Emanuel 's first run for mayor in 2011. So she may have felt her bold rejection of \"consensus\" black candidate Carol Moseley Braun gave her clout. How else to explain her chutzpah in writing an email directly to Emanuel in December 2014, asking him personally to tear up $225 worth of parking tickets? An indignant Hartman, 69, wrote Emanuel to complain that \"I feel like I have gifted the city with a donation or that I have been robbed\" after she'd been given three tickets for parking with the wrong city sticker on her windshield on her South Loop block. \"It is a DAMN shame that you cannot park your car in front of your house without being ticketed,\" she continued, complaining that it had not been clear to her that she needed to buy a city sticker with her residential zone printed on it. \"I am requesting that you consider waiving this fee and issue me a refund,\" she added. \"I am hopeful that the police of our city are as diligent in fighting crime as they are in issuing parking tickets to law abiding and tax paying citizens.\" The email was released by the mayor's attorney Wednesday as part of a settlement of a lawsuit with the Better Government Association. No response from Emanuel, if there was any, was included, and his office did not immediately say what help, if any, the mayor gave Hartman. ",

    "text": "Obama Scraps Registry for Some Immigrant Men, Mostly Muslims By alicia a. caldwell, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 22, 2016, 4:25 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Kellyanne Conway on Her New White House Role 0 Shares Email The Obama administration on Thursday officially scrapped the last vestiges of a U.S. registration system for Muslim immigrants. If President-elect Donald Trump now wants to introduce an expanded version of the program, he will have to start from scratch. The post-9/11 registration program for immigrant men arriving mainly from the Islamic world hasn't been enforced since 2011. Although it never prohibited travel for men and boys from the more than 20 affected countries, including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, Trump's suggestions about banning Muslim immigrants from the United States have led to fears that it could be reinstated and used for new and enhanced purposes. The decision to erase it from the books entirely marks one of President Barack Obama's last administrative actions on immigration and will at least slow any Trump effort to introduce even tougher requirements, as has been suggested by a top adviser. The registration program is \"not only obsolete,\" said Neema Hakim, spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, \"its use would divert limited personnel and resources from more effective measures.\" The registration system started about a year after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, requiring men and boys from a variety of mostly Middle Eastern countries to register with the federal government upon their arrival in the United States. Such people already in the country had to register with immigration authorities inside the U.S. Registration, which also applied to immigrants from North Korea , included fingerprints and photographs. People also were required to notify the government if they changed addresses. Trump has never publicly spoken about the program, but has made clear his desire to take a far tougher approach toward immigration than Obama. He and his advisers have suggested the rising terror threat in the United States, Europe and elsewhere is linked to insufficiently vetted refugees and immigrants arriving from predominantly Muslim countries. After a truck attack killed 12 in a Christmas market in Berlin this week, Trump told reporters, \"You know my plans.\" Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Trump confidant on immigration, has been more explicit on his plans for the registry. Last month, he said he wanted to launch an updated system for all foreigners from \"high-risk\" areas. Meeting Trump in New York, Kobach carried a document labeled \"Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for First 365 Days.\" It described a reboot of the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System as the top priority. Kobach helped draft the program while working at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. If Trump opts to restart NSEERS and create a new program, he will have to start from scratch with a process that includes notifying the public about his plans. That could delay a new effort by months. The program had been widely derided by civil libertarians as an effort to profile people based on race and religion. \"With this action, the U.S. is on the right path to protect Muslim and Arab immigrants from discrimination,\" said Joanne Lin, the senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the registry \"didn't yield a single terrorism conviction in nearly a decade.\" When the Obama administration abandoned the system in April 2011, it said a newer data collection program would be sufficient to collect biometric information for all foreigners coming into the country. At the time, more than 80,000 foreigners were registered. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Alicia A.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print FILE -- Pedestrians wait for cabs across the street from The New York Times in New York. \u00a0(AP) The New York Times recently published an article purporting to trace the history of the \u201cWar on Christmas.\u201d\u00a0 The article concludes that \u201cthere is no evidence of an organized attack on Christmas in the United States,\u201d and expressed skepticism about the \u201calleged liberal antagonism toward the holiday.\u201d\u00a0 As the author would tell it, Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly stirred up the passions of his viewers based on a book written in 2005 by another Fox News host, John Gibson, entitled \u201c The War on Christmas. \u201d John Gibson interviewed me for that book, and I detailed the legal battles I and others had fought against Christmas censorship from the mid-1980s.\u00a0 I even wrote a book in 1987 on the topic that detailed ongoing efforts to suppress celebrating or observing the religious aspects of Christmas \u2013 the birth of Jesus Christ. I can confidently say that the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d was not concocted by people at Fox News in 2005. It really happened. I know because I was there. Here are three ways the New York Times article got it wrong about the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d: 1. The \u201cWar On Christmas\u201d is real, and started well before Fox News even existed\u00a0 Here\u2019s just one example. When I worked at Concerned Women for America, we litigated a case against the Seminole County, Florida School District in 1985 in which officials at the Tuscawilla Middle School removed the songs, \u201cSilent Night\u201d and \u201cHanukkah Dance\u201d from the middle school choir concert on the objection of one parent.\u00a0 Officials at another school in the same district at a different school stopped a second grader, Olivia Myers, from passing out homemade Christmas cards to her classmates because they had a sticker of Jesus on them.\u00a0 At another middle school in the district, the PTA sponsored a contest to decorate classroom doors. The two students selected to create the art for one classroom door chose a nativity scene of Jesus\u2019 birth, and the teacher ordered it removed because of perceived Establishment Clause concerns. Just before trial, we settled the case out of court with the school district changing its policy to allow school music programs to \u201ccontain music that is religious in nature.\u201d\u00a0 It also allowed the school to \u201cuse themes traditionally associated with a particular holiday season\u201d and to allow classroom displays of religious themes if they were not prompted by the teacher and contained nonreligious symbols.\u00a0 And the school paid some monetary damages to the students involved. I litigated this case.\u00a0 It was not made up by Fox News (which did not exist until 1996) or by anyone else.\u00a0 And this is not an isolated incident. The ACLU and its allies provoked many more examples of Christmas censorship with its lawsuits. 2. The ACLU filed numerous lawsuits to suppress public observances of Christmas Beginning in the 1970\u2019s, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed many lawsuits to stop Christmas observances in public schools, city halls, and other governmental entities.\u00a0 The New York Times quotes a carefully worded statement by an ACLU spokesperson that downplays the concerted efforts the ACLU and its allies engaged in to censor Christmas in public venues in the past.\u00a0 The ACLU\u2019s efforts were real and systematic. They created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation and disinformation about what the law said about Christmas. The ACLU has filed suit to keep school districts from singing religious Christmas carols. It has also filed suits to prevent the display of nativity scenes and other Christmas symbols like a Christmas tree and a menorah. The ACLU lost a major case it filed in 1980 to eliminate the singing of religious Christmas carols in public schools.\u00a0 A federal appeals court ruled that singing religious songs could have a legitimate pedagogical purpose in a public school.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, there is no court decision anywhere that says it is unconstitutional to sing religious songs, including Christmas carols, in public schools.\u00a0 Yet many people wrongly believe that.\u00a0 When I spoke about this topic, I would carry a copy of the court decision ruling against the ACLU\u2019s extreme views to show disbelieving audience members that it existed. In another case the ACLU lost, the Supreme Court upheld the city\u2019s use of the nativity scene because it also contained a number of secular Christmas symbols, such as Santa\u2019s sleigh and carolers.\u00a0 However, the Supreme Court did declare in another ACLU lawsuit in 1989 that a nativity scene violates the Constitution, adding to the cultural zeitgeist that celebrating Christmas publicly was somehow inappropriate.\u00a0 So the ACLU conducted a litigation campaign to suppress the observance of Christmas in public schools and other government venues.\u00a0 Some of the cases succeeded, but many failed.\u00a0 And all of these cases occurred well before the existence of Fox News. These are just a few examples.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. People resisted the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d because they knew firsthand it was real Fox News did not rile up gullible people to fight a war against Christmas that did not exist.\u00a0 This out-of-touch thinking by the New York Times assumes that most people who watch Fox News are easily manipulated.\u00a0 People responded to John Gibson\u2019s book and Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s protests against these efforts to suppress Christmas because they had experienced it firsthand. Many knew from their own experience that businesses, feeling that social pressure, began ordering their workers to say \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d rather than \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\u00a0 That happened to me. In the early 2000\u2019s, I was flying on Continental Airlines in December.\u00a0 As we landed, the flight attendant wished us all, \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d over the intercom.\u00a0 As we disembarked, I asked the flight attendant if Continental Airlines would allow her to say, \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d to the passengers on the plane.\u00a0 \u201cOh no,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cI would be written up if I did that.\u201d Alliance Defending Freedom looked into this matter and others like it. We saw many such instances around the nation.\u00a0 We also learned that 92% of all Americans \u2013 which includes many non-Christians \u2013 celebrate Christmas.\u00a0 Even so, businesses who are free to have their employees wish people a Merry Christmas opted to suppress the greeting.\u00a0 Many public schools violated the freedom of speech rights of their students by censoring their Christmas art projects and Christmas carols. In 2003, the problem became so widespread that ADF formally launched an effort to combat the fear, intimidation and disinformation spread by the ACLU and its allies via these Christmas censorship lawsuits \u2013 two years before John Gibson published his book. And we\u2019ve had some success. The more extreme forms of Christmas censorship that we saw 10 and 20 years ago seem to be receding, due to the efforts by ADF and many others to bring a balanced, reasonable approach to the Christmas observances. People agreed with ADF and Fox News and others that the War on Christmas was real and wanted an end to hostilities. Our increasingly diverse nation tends to fragment unless we have common values or touch points that bring us together. A holiday that points us to love one another as God first loved us, and has us give generously to others is something many people think worthy of preserving and that everyone benefits by doing so. That is why so many people agreed to resist the efforts to suppress the religious aspects of Christmas.\u00a0 The New York Times missed this important aspect of this cultural phenomenon with its scoffing denial that Christmas censorship ever happened. So, next time the New York Times runs a piece like this, perhaps its author should talk to people who were actually in the fight, not just those who started it.\u00a0\u00a0 Merry Christmas.

    "text": "advertisement The Obama administration has eliminated a dormant Bush-era program that could have been used by Donald Trump to implement his promised Muslim registry, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The tracking program, called the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, was created by the Justice Department in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It required men from 25 countries considered to be at \"higher risk\" of extremist activities to register in person and submit to questioning and fingerprinting at an Immigration and Naturalization Service office. Civil rights groups complained that it targeted residents of Muslim- and Arab-majority countries. Related: Trump Immigration Adviser Kris Kobach Wrote the Book on Muslim Registry NSEERS hasn't been used since 2011, but it could potentially be revitalized. Obama apparently wants to avoid that happening. By removing regulations that provided a legal framework for the program, Obama aims to prevent Trump from using it, U.S. officials told NBC News on Thursday. US President-elect Donald Trump (L) and Kris Kobach Kansas Secretary of State pose at the clubhouse of Trump International Golf Club, in Bedminster Township, N.J. Nov. 20, 2016. Peter Foley / EPA The Department of Homeland Security filing , posted in the Federal Register Thursday, calls NSEERS \"outdated,\" \"obsolete\" and \"redundant\" due to updated rules and systems that allow the department to accomplish its security goals with more efficiency. A 2012 report by the department's inspector general found the program to be \"inefficient and ineffective,\" and with new tracking measures in place, \"NSEERS and its regulatory structure serve no public benefit,\" the DHS said in a statement. But Trump appears to be considering whether to bring it back.

Peter Foley / EPA He pledged a ban on Muslims entering the country during the presidential campaign, and his aides have since stressed the need for \"extreme vetting\" of them. One of his immigration advisers is Kris Kobach, an architect of NSEERS. After the election, a photograph of the two men together captured Kobach's briefing papers, which put the reinstatement of NSEERS as a top bullet point. Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said in a conference call Friday that the incoming administration would have a response to the dismantling of NSEERS as part of a broader plan on executive orders.

Vice President Joe Biden during a campaign rally in Virginia on the eve of the November election. After his speech, Biden remarked backstage on the lack of apparent enthusiasm for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. (Molly Riley / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli Contact Reporter Over a career in elected public office lasting more than 46 years, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. has seen campaigns from the rudimentary, family-run effort that first launched him unexpectedly to the U.S. Senate as a 29-year-old to the sophisticated, data-driven juggernaut that helped elect him and Barack Obama twice to the nation\u2019s highest offices. But rarely has he trusted anything as much as his own gut instinct, attuned to the middle- and working-class sensibilities of his former neighbors in towns like Scranton, Pa., and Claymont, Del. And so as he sat in his office one day in October and\u00a0watched footage of a Donald Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., not far from his childhood home, Biden sensed trouble. \u201cSon of a gun. We may lose this election,\u201d Biden said,\u00a0recalling his reaction\u00a0during an interview in his West Wing office. \u201cThey\u2019re all the people I grew up with. They\u2019re their kids.

It begins, in typical Biden fashion, with a reference to\u00a0family wisdom. \u201cMy dad used to have an expression. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect them to understand it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI believe that we were not letting an awful lot of people \u2014 high school-educated, mostly Caucasian, but also people of color \u2014 know that we understood their problems.\u201d There\u2019s \u201ca bit of elitism that\u2019s crept in\u201d to party thinking, he worries,\u00a0setting up what he sees as the\u00a0false impression that progressive values are inconsistent with working-class values. \u201cWhat are the arguments we\u2019re hearing? \u2018Well, we\u2019ve got to be more progressive.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying we should be less progressive,\u201d he said, adding that he would \u201cstack my progressive credentials against anyone\u201d in the party. \u201cWe should be proud of where the hell we are, and not yield an inch. But,\u201d he added,\u00a0\u201cin the meantime, you can\u2019t eat equality. You know?\u201d He also distinguishes what he describes as\u00a0the middle-class agenda that President Obama has put forth from the more populist, anti-Wall Street message that helped power Bernie Sanders\u2019 rise in the Democratic primary. \u201cI like Bernie,\u201d Biden said, adding he agrees with the Vermont senator\u00a0on many issues. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think 500 billionaires caused all our problems.\u201d :: It was election eve, and\u00a0Biden had just concluded the last of 83 campaign events he would headline on Hillary Clinton \u2019s behalf. Something once again didn\u2019t feel right. Stepping off the stage after an at-times sentimental appearance in northern Virginia with Sen. Tim Kaine , the man he hoped would succeed him, the vice president shared a nagging concern with aides:\u00a0Any enthusiasm among the crowd of several thousand was not about the party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see any Hillary signs,\u201d Biden recalled. \u201cEvery time I talked about Hillary they listened. But \u2026\u201d Biden\u2019s speech that night mirrors his message to Democrats now. ",

According to vote tallies from The Associated Press, Clinton amassed 65,844,610 votes across all 50 states and Washington D.C ., 48.2 percent of all votes cast. Trump received 62,979,636 votes, 46.1 percent of all votes cast. The Associated Press announced today that all votes had officially been certified. Clinton had 2,864,974 votes more than Trump, the largest popular vote margin of any losing presidential candidate in U.S. history, according to the AP. Trump won the presidency by clinching 304 electoral votes, well over the minimum 270 needed. Clinton won 227 electoral votes. Clinton is the fifth presidential candidate in history to win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College . The only other time this has happened this century was in 2000, when Democrat Al Gore came up short in the Electoral College but won the popular vote by 540,000 more votes than George W. Bush, the AP reported. 0 Shares ",

Top Trump surrogate and adviser Sean Spicer will serve as the next White House press secretary. Spicer, a Washington veteran, is no stranger to Republican politics. He has served six years as communications director for the Republican National Committee and was a chief strategist for the committee for almost two years. Trump Leaves Press Behind to Dine With Family in New York Unlike some others involved in the transition, Spicer is seen by many in the press corps as among the more accessible members of Trump's team. Though combative at times, Spicer makes regular television appearances and hosts a daily briefing call for reporters about the presidential transition. Also participating in the briefing call is Spicer's colleague Jason Miller, who will serve as Trump's director of communications. The president-elect also announced that the transition press secretary, Hope Hicks, will be director of strategic communications and Dan Scavino will serve as director of social media for the White House. \u201cSean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition. I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will 'Make America Great Again,'\u201d Trump said in a press release. Spicer as press secretary is considered likely to be responsible for easing any tension between reporters and the White House. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Friends of a Certain Age Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30? By ALEX WILLIAMS Continue reading the main story Editor\u2019s note: This article first ran on July 13, 2012, but we\u2019re running it again because the topic is timeless. IT was like one of those magical blind-date scenes out of a Hollywood rom-com, without the \u201crom.\u201d I met Brian, a New York screenwriter, a few years ago through work, which led to dinner with our wives and friend chemistry that was instant and obvious. We liked the same songs off Dylan\u2019s \u201cBlonde on Blonde, \u201d the same lines from \u201cChinatown.\u201d By the time the green curry shrimp had arrived, we were finishing each other\u2019s sentences. Our wives were forced to cut in: \u201cHey, guys, want to come up for air?\u201d As Brian and his wife wandered off toward the No. 2 train afterward, it crossed my mind that he was the kind of guy who might have ended up a groomsman at my wedding if we had met in college. That was four years ago. We\u2019ve seen each other four times since. We are \u201cfriends,\u201d but not quite friends. We keep trying to get over the hump, but life gets in the way. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Our story is not unusual. In your 30s and 40s, plenty of new people enter your life, through work, children\u2019s play dates and, of course, Facebook. But actual close friends \u2014 the kind you make in college, the kind you call in a crisis \u2014 those are in shorter supply. As people approach midlife, the days of youthful exploration, when life felt like one big blind date, are fading. Schedules compress, priorities change and people often become pickier in what they want in their friends. No matter how many friends you make, a sense of fatalism can creep in: the period for making B.F.F.\u2019s, the way you did in your teens or early 20s, is pretty much over. It\u2019s time to resign yourself to situational friends: K.O.F.\u2019s (kind of friends) \u2014 for now. But often, people realize how much they have neglected to restock their pool of friends only when they encounter a big life event, like a move, say, or a divorce. That thought struck Lisa Degliantoni, an educational fund-raising executive in Chicago, a few months ago when she was planning her 39th birthday party. After a move from New York to Evanston, Ill., she realized that she had 857 Facebook friends and 509 Twitter followers, but still did not know if she could fill her party\u2019s invitation list. \u201cI did an inventory of the phases of my life where I\u2019ve managed to make the most friends, and it was definitely high school and my first job,\u201d she said. After a divorce in his 40s, Robert Glover, a psychotherapist in Bellevue, Wash., realized that his roster of friends had quietly atrophied for years as he focused on career and family. \u201cAll of a sudden, with your wife out of the picture, you realize you\u2019re lonely,\u201d said Dr. Glover, now 56. \u201cI\u2019d go to salsa lessons. Instead of trying to pick up the women, I\u2019d introduce myself to the men: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go get a drink.\u2019\u00a0\u201d In studies of peer groups, Laura L. Carstensen, a psychology professor who is the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity in California, observed that people tended to interact with fewer people as they moved toward midlife, but that they grew closer to the friends they already had. Photo Lisa Degliantoni has downsized expectations in trying to make new friends. \u201cI take an extremely efficient approach and seek out like-minded folks to fill very specific needs,\u201d she said. Credit Sally Ryan for The New York Times Basically, she suggests, this is because people have an internal alarm clock that goes off at big life events, like turning 30. It reminds them that time horizons are shrinking, so it is a point to pull back on exploration and concentrate on the here and now. \u201cYou tend to focus on what is most emotionally important to you,\u201d she said, \u201cso you\u2019re not interested in going to that cocktail party, you\u2019re interested in spending time with your kids.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added. In the professional world, \u201cproximity\u201d is hard to maintain, as work colleagues are reassigned or move on to new jobs. Last year, Erica Rivinoja, a writer on the NBC series \u201cUp All Night,\u201d became close with a woman, Jen, when they worked together on a pilot. Almost instantly, they knew each other\u2019s exercise schedules and food preferences. Jen could sense when Ms. Rivinoja needed a jolt of caffeine, and without asking would be there with an iced tea. \u201cBut as soon as the pilot was over, it was hard to be as close without that constant day-to-day interaction,\u201d said Ms. Rivinoja, 35. They can occasionally carve out time for a quick gin and tonic, she said, but \u201cthere aren\u2019t those long afternoons which bleed into evenings hanging out at the beach and then heading to a bar.\u201d The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues, Dr. Adams said. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins. Differences in professional status and income also complicate matters. \u201cIt really does get weird when your friends are making tons more than you, or tons less,\u201d said Adriane Duckworth, a former marketing executive now working as an artist in Hamilton, Ontario. She recently welcomed a promising new couple into her circle of friends, but they quickly turned people off with their obsession with money. \u201cAt our wedding, other friends of ours who were seated with them actually complained to us afterward about the couple who was asking everyone how much money they made,\u201d said Ms. Duckworth, 32. \u201cPeople who made less felt uncomfortable discussing it, and people who made the same or more just felt it was weird to talk about it so nonchalantly.\u201d Once people start coupling up, the challenges only increase. Making friends with other couples \u201cis like matchmaking for two,\u201d said Kara Baskin, a journalist who works in Boston . \u201cNot only are you worrying about whether the other woman likes you, you\u2019re also worrying if her husband likes you, if your husband likes her, if your husband likes him.\u201d Not long ago, she invited her husband\u2019s new work buddy over for dinner with his wife. But the wife was visibly unimpressed by Ms. Baskin\u2019s half-furnished home (they had just moved in) and thrown-together spaghetti dinner. \u201cIt was basically clear that his wife had been cajoled into attending,\u201d said Ms. Baskin, 33. \u201cShe settled on to our rickety Ikea kitchen chairs like she was lowering herself into a coal mine.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The couple departed quickly after dessert. The next day at work, the husband made an excuse about his wife being tired. \u201cBut it was unspoken that we wouldn\u2019t be seeking their company again,\u201d Ms. Baskin said. ADDING children to the mix muddles things further. Suddenly, you are surrounded by a new circle of parent friends \u2014 but the emotional ties can be tenuous at best, as the comedian Louis C. K. related in one stand-up routine: \u201cI spend whole days with people, I\u2019m like, I never would have hung out with you, I didn\u2019t choose you. Our children chose each other. Based on no criteria, by the way. They\u2019re the same size.\u201d Even when parent friends develop a bond, the resulting friendships can be fleeting \u2014 and subject to the whims of the children themselves. Caryl Lyons, an event planner in Danville, Calif., and her husband found a budding friendship with a parent-friend couple hit a roadblock when their young sons, who had been close friends, drifted apart. When the families planned a barbecue together, her son would say, \u201cCan I have my other friends over?\u201d said Ms. Lyons, 44. Photo Kara Baskin said that being part of a couple presents obstacles in making friends. She described it as \u201clike matchmaking for two.\u201d Credit Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times External factors are not the only hurdle. After 30, people often experience internal shifts in how they approach friendship. Self-discovery gives way to self-knowledge, so you become pickier about whom you surround yourself with, said Marla Paul , the author of the 2004 book \u201cThe Friendship Crisis: Finding, Making, and Keeping Friends When You\u2019re Not a Kid Anymore.\u201d \u201cThe bar is higher than when we were younger and were willing to meet almost anyone for a margarita,\u201d she said. Manipulators, drama queens, egomaniacs: a lot of them just no longer make the cut. Thayer Prime, a 32-year-old strategy consultant who lives in London, has even developed a playful 100-point scale (100 being \u201cbest friend forever\u201d). In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior. Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance. \u201cYou meet someone really nice, but if they don\u2019t return a call, drop to 90, if they don\u2019t return two calls, that\u2019s an immediate 50,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re late to something in the first month, that\u2019s another 10 off.\u201d (But people can move up the scale with nice behavior, too, she added.) Having been hardened by experience, many people develop a more fatalistic view of friendship. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you define what it really means to be friends in a more serious way,\u201d said my screenwriter friend, Brian. (His full name is Brian Koppelman, and he wrote and is a co-director of \u201c Solitary Man ,\u201d a 2010 film starring Michael Douglas about a middle-aged man trying to reconnect with friends and family.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cMy ideas of friendship were built by \u2018The Godfather\u2019 and \u2018Diner,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cYour friends were your brothers, and anything but total loyalty at all costs meant excommunication. As you get older, that model becomes unrealistic.\u201d By that point, you have been through your share of wearying or failed relationships. You have come to grips with the responsibilities of juggling work, family and existing friends, so you become more wary about making yourself emotionally available to new people. \u201cYou\u2019re more keenly aware of the downside,\u201d said Mr. Koppelman, 46. \u201cYou\u2019re also more keenly aware of your own capacity to disappoint.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t really changed my standards for what it means to actually be friends,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I use the word \u2018friends\u2019 more loosely. Making the real kind, the brother kind, is much harder now.\u201d Some, like Ms. Degliantoni, the fund-raising executive, simply downsize their expectations. \u201cI take an extremely efficient approach and seek out like-minded folks to fill very specific needs,\u201d she said of her current strategy. \u201cI have a cocktail friend and a book friend and a parenting friend and several basketball friends and a neighbor friend and a workout friend.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s much easier filling in those gaps in my life,\u201d she added, \u201cthan doing an exhaustive approach for a new friend.\u201d Or, they hit rock bottom and turn back the clock to their breathlessly social 20s. After a move to New York in his 30s, Dave Cervini, a radio station executive, was so lonely that he would walk his cat in Central Park, hoping to stoke conversations. Finding only curious stares, he decided to start the New York Social Network , an activities group for people to find friends by hanging out at Yankees games or wine-tasting mixers. The company now counts 2,000 members, most in their 30s. He considers 200 of them close friends. \u201cIt takes courage for people to take the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, I make it easier, having been there myself.\u201d\u00a0 In that spirit, I recently called Brian. We joked about our inability to find time to hang out, and made a dinner date at the next available opening. It is three months from now.

Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner were on a flight at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Thursday when a passenger confronted them, according to Matthew Lasner, who tweeted about the encounter between his husband and the couple. \"Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil,\" Lasner said in a now-deleted tweet. Ivanka Trump John Locher / AP file Lasner said in another deleted post that his husband \"expressed displeasure in a calm tone\" about Trump and Kushner's presence on their flight when \"JetBlue staff overheard, and they kicked us off the plane.\" Lasner also tweeted a photo appearing to show Ivanka on the flight. JetBlue said in a statement that \"The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly.\" \"If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight,\" the company said in the statement. \"In this instance, our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight.\" Passenger Marc Scheff told NBC News he witnessed the incident before the plane took off. Scheff said Lasner's husband was agitated and began making comments. \"The comments were definitely for everyone but he was directing them towards her,\" he said. In a post on Facebook , Scheff said he and his son were featured in the photo that appeared to show Ivanka Trump on the flight. Scheff wrote that the passenger who addressed Trump did not accost her directly and did not yell. \"He was also not what I would describe as calm. Agitated maybe,\" he said in the post. Lasner remained calm throughout the incident, he added. Scheff wrote that Lasner's husband exclaimed \"they ruin the country now they ruin our flight!\" The flight was delayed because the Trump family needed to get on first through different a different area than the other passengers, he said. \"When the JetBlue staff went back to speak to the man I overheard Ivanka say to them 'I don't want to make this a thing,'\" Scheff wrote.

Jones , USA TODAY Sports 2:49 p.m. EST December 22, 2016 x Share The Scottsdale Police Department has released body-cam video of the DUI arrest of former Arizona Cardinals receiver Michael Floyd. USA TODAY NETWORK WR Michael Floyd is set to debut with the Patriots on Saturday. (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) The New England Patriots did not know that wide receiver Michael Floyd\u2019s blood alcohol level after an arrest on a drunk driving charge earlier this month was .217 when the team claimed him off waivers from the Arizona Cardinals. Floyd was arrested on Dec. 12 in Scottsdale, Ariz., hours after the Cards returned from a road game at Miami. He was released by Arizona two days later and subsequently claimed by the Patriots. Floyd is expected to make his debut for the Patriots during Saturday's home game against the New York Jets. Former Cardinal Michael Floyd's blood-alcohol level was 0.217% after his Scottsdale arrest, blood test shows New England\u00a0coach Bill Belichick revealed Thursday that the team was unaware of the extent of Floyd\u2019s DUI. The BAC results as well as video footage of Floyd\u2019s arrest, recorded on a Scottsdale police officer\u2019s body camera, were released Wednesday. Belichick declined additional comment when asked if the new information changed the team's opinion on Floyd or their decision to claim him. A BAC of .217 would be considered an \u201cextreme DUI\u201d under Arizona law, and Floyd could face mandatory jail time. \u201cHe's in a legal situation. I can't comment on his legal situation,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cI appreciate you asking about it, though. I really do.\u201d Floyd met with reporters Thursday for the first time since the arrest, and said his DUI was a mistake. \u201cI think in life everyone makes mistakes,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cI think right now it\u2019s about learning from that mistake.\u201d USA TODAY Sports' Week 16 NFL picks This is Floyd\u2019s second arrest for DUI. He was also charged while attending Notre Dame in 2011. A first-round pick in 2012, Floyd was in the final year of his contract with the Cardinals before being cut. He has just 33 catches for 446 yards this year and four touchdowns. \u201cI understand what happened last week was last week,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about my opportunity here, being a Patriot, with a great group of guys\u00a0and a great group of coaches and an organization that just treats people well.\u201d *** Follow Lindsay H.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 8:37 PM EST CANBERRA, Australia - Police in Australia have detained five men suspected of planning a series of Christmas Day bomb attacks in the heart of the country\u2019s second-largest city, officials said Friday. The suspects had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne\u2019s Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Victoria state Police\u00a0 Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The arrests came after a truck smashed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, killing 12 people. A manhunt is underway for the person behind that attack, which prompted increases in security around the world. Two of seven people initially arrested in raids Thursday night and Friday morning in Melbourne - a 26-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman - were released without being charged, police said. Five men between the ages 21 and 26 remained in custody and would be charged later Friday with preparing a terrorist attack. They were not identified but police said four were born in Australia and the fifth was Egyptian-born with Egyptian and Australian citizenship. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives, knives and a gun, Ashton said. Police believed the threat had been neutralized through the raids on five Melbourne premises, he said. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cThis is one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years.\u201d \u201cIslamist terrorism is a global challenge that affects us all. But we must not be cowed by the terrorists,\u201d Turnbull told reporter. \u201cWe will continue to go about our lives as we always have. What these criminals seek to do is to kill. But they also seek to frighten us, to cow us into abandoning our Australian way of life. They want to frighten Australians. They want to divide Australians. They want us to turn on each other. We will not let them succeed,\u201d he added. Since Australia\u2019s terrorist threat level was elevated in September 2014, the government says there have been four extremist attacks and 12 plots foiled by police. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the plotters had moved very quickly from a plan to develop a capability to attack. \u201cIn terms of events that we have seen over the past few years in Australia, this certainly concerns me more than any other event that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cWe believe that we have removed the bulk of this particular cell, this group,\u201d he said. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there will be extra police on the streets of Melbourne on Christmas Day to make the public feel safe. About 400 police officers were involved in the raids. Ashton described those arrested as \u201cself-radicalized\u201d and inspired by Islamic State propaganda. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Police raided properties in Berlin and the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia where Amri is believed to have spent time. They also swooped on a bus in the southwestern city of Heilbronn after receiving a tip that turned up nothing. No arrests were made, said Frauke Koehler, a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors. Even so, investigators were increasingly confident that Amri carried out the rampage after finding his fingerprints in the cab of the truck that had been hijacked shortly before Monday\u2019s attack. \u201cWe can tell you today that there are additional indications that this suspect is with high probability really the perpetrator,\u201d Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said after visiting the Federal Criminal Police Office along with Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cFingerprints were found in the cab, and there are other, additional indications that suggest this,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt is all the more important that the search is successful as soon as possible.\u201d 24 Photos Truck plows into Berlin Christmas market German authorities have been on the defensive after it emerged that Amri had been considered a potential threat for months, subjected to surveillance and put in pre-deportation detention in August only to be released again due to paperwork problems. The fact that the attack is alleged to have been carried out by a man who came to Germany seeking asylum last year also prompted fresh criticism of Merkel\u2019s decision to allow hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country without thorough security checks. While police have noted that most migrants are law-abiding, a number of high-profile crimes, including the New Year\u2019s Eve assaults in Cologne and several violent attacks over the summer have stoked anti-migrant feeling in Germany. Two attacks in July, along with the truck attack in Berlin, were claimed by the Islamic State group. \u201cWe have made great efforts in recent years to better prepare for terrorist threats,\u201d Merkel told reporters. \u201cThis makes me confident that we will withstand the test that we now face.\u201d German police launch raids as terror suspect manhunt intensifies While members of Merkel\u2019s party have called for tighter asylum laws and a crackdown on potential extremists in the wake of the attack, the chancellor appealed once more for calm. \u201cI want to say how very proud I\u2019ve been in recent days that the great majority of people have reacted soberly,\u201d she said. At the site of the bloodbath, Berliners made a show of defiance. Vendors reopened their stalls at the Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church even as police placed concrete blocks by the roadside to provide extra security. In tribute to the victims, organizers decided to do without festive music and bright lights. Berliners and visitors placed candles and flowers at a makeshift shrine for the victims . Berlin\u2019s state Health Ministry raised the number of injured in the attack to 56, saying some victims went to hospitals on their own. The agency said 12 people were being treated for severe injuries, with some still in critical condition. Another 14 people with less-serious injuries remained hospitalized and 30 others had been discharged. CBS affiliate KDBC reported that Richard Ramirez, initially of Texas, is among the victims in the attack. Ramirez\u2019s brother Armando told KDBC that Ramirez suffered major injuries and his partner, who also lived in Berlin, did not survive the attack. German authorities have offered a reward of 100,000 euros ($105,000) for information leading to Amri\u2019s arrest, but they warned he could be \u201cviolent and armed.\u201d In Tunisia, Amri\u2019s brothers spoke to The Associated Press, urging him to surrender to authorities. \u201cWhether he did it or not, I ask him to report to the police. We are suffering because of him,\u201d said Abdelkader Amri. Abdelkader Amri questioned if his brother had been involved in the attack in an interview with Agence France-Presse . \u201cI\u2019m sure he can\u2019t have done this, that\u2019s not why he emigrated. May God reveal the truth \u00a0\u2026 \u201cIf my brother is behind the attack, I say to him: \u2018You dishonour us.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Another brother, Walid, said Amri may have been radicalized in prison in Italy, where he went after leaving Tunisia in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Italy\u2019s Justice Ministry confirmed reports that Amri was repeatedly transferred among Sicilian prisons for bad conduct, with prison records saying he bullied inmates and tried to spark insurrections. He served 3\u00bd years for setting a fire at a refugee center and making threats, among other things - but Italy apparently detected no signs that he was becoming radicalized. Amri\u2019s mother, Nour El Houda Hassani, insisted he had shown no signs of radicalization and questioned whether he was really the market attacker. Speaking in the central Tunisian town of Oueslatia, she said poverty drove Amri to steal and to travel illegally to Europe. \u201cI want the truth to be revealed about my son,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he is the perpetrator of the attack, let him assume his responsibilities and I\u2019ll renounce him before God. If he didn\u2019t do anything, I want my son\u2019s rights to be restored.\u201d Amri\u2019s father said he had not seen his son for seven years. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t call me at all and I don\u2019t even have his telephone number,\u201d his father said. \u201cAnis calls his brothers once every three to four months. I swear to you he doesn\u2019t call me and his brothers do not call me either.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "<p>Travelers walk past waiting planes at San Francisco International Airport, Thursday, Dec. 22, 2016, in San Francisco.</p> Close Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP Starting this week, for some foreigners travelling to the United States, the government has added a new question about social media user information, as part of an effort to help identify potential terrorist threats. In June, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposed adding an optional question to travel authorization applications. It asked applicants to volunteer their social media account identifiers, as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to enhance its vetting of people who travel to the U.S. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the addition of the question this month, the Department of Homeland Security told CBS News.\u00a0 Should applicants provide the requested information about their social media accounts, CBP officers would only be able to see what\u2019s publicly available on the accounts submitted -- applicants wouldn\u2019t be asked to violate privacy settings or policies. After CBP proposed the new question, several civil liberties and internet groups raised objections. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that there were \u201cno standards to ensure that innocent travelers would not be misjudged and denied entry into the U.S.\u201d What it takes to enter the U.S. on a K-1 \"fianc\u00e9e\" visa And EFF also predicted that the new question would \u201cbe ineffective at protecting homeland security,\u201d given that CBP would only be looking at publicly available posts on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms. Surmising that the social media question stemmed from having missed the threat posed by San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik , who entered the U.S. on a \u201c fiancee visa ,\u201d EFF pointed out that the evidence of her sympathies with terrorists was only expressed \u201cin private messages to her Facebook friends. She did not do so in public posts prior to the attack, according to the FBI.\u201d The question is marked as \u201coptional\u201d on the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application, and the new change only applies to people who come here under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the U.S. and stay here without a visa for up to 90 days. The\u00a0 new question , according to the Federal Register, reads, \u201cPlease enter information associated with your online presence--Provider/Platform--Social media identifier.\u201d Officers would be able to use information they collect from applicants\u2019 social media to evaluate ESTA applications. That data could not, however, be used to ban an applicant\u2019s travel based on his or her political views, race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, though. The changes went into effect on Tuesday, Politico first reported. CBS News\u2019 Andres Triay contributed to this report. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Passenger Removed from Flight After Allegedly Harassing Ivanka Trump By Aaron Katersky Dec 22, 2016, 12:23 PM ET 0 Shares Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images WATCH Passenger Removed from Flight After Allegedly Harassing Ivanka Trump 0 Shares Email A passenger was removed from a JetBlue flight after allegedly harassing another passenger, according to the airline, which Trump sources identified as Ivanka Trump. Senior sources in the Trump transition team told ABC News the president-elect's daughter and her children were heading to Hawaii for vacation when a passenger shouted at them. The family was flying JetBlue, and airline staffers decided to remove the passenger at JFK Airport in New York. \"The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. In this instance, our team worked to reaccommodate the party on the next available flight,\" a JetBlue representative said in a statement. A U.S. Secret Service official told ABC News the airline made the decision to remove the passenger from the plane. Secret Service agents were on board the flight with Ivanka Trump but were not involved in the situation. Matthew Lasner, a man claiming that his husband was the person who had the confrontation with Ivanka Trump and was removed from the plane, posted some tweets and a picture of Ivanka on the plane. He has since deleted these tweets from his profile and appears to have shut down his account. He posted his first tweet about the incident apparently before any interaction occurred, writing \"Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil\". Jared Kushner was traveling with his wife Ivanka on the flight today, senior Trump transition sources told ABC News. An hour later, Lasner tweeted again. \"Ivanka and Jared on our flight. My husband expressed displeasure in a calm tone, JetBlue staff overheard, and they kicked us off the plane,\" he wrote. The third tweet included the picture of Ivanka, with the caption \"Ivanka just before @JetBlue kicked us off our flight when a flt [sic] attendant overhead [sic] my husband expressing displeasure about flying w/ Trumps.\" ABC News has reached out to Lasner but did not immediately receive a response. Donald Trump was not with his daughter on the flight. He is currently at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. ABC News' Jack Date contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Republicans accuse Dems of 'hypocrisy' after 'bathroom bill' repeal falls apart Published               December 22, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 North Carolina Republican leaders are blasting their Democratic colleagues after a supposedly bipartisan deal to repeal the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d limiting LGBT protections collapsed Wednesday night, with every Senate Democrat balking in the end. Both sides were pointing fingers in the aftermath of the unproductive special session, called specifically to consider repeal legislation for the law known as House Bill 2. The law omits gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people from state anti-discrimination protections, bars local governments from passing broad non-discrimination ordinances covering them, and orders transgender people to use bathrooms and showers that align with their sex at birth. \"I'm disappointed that we have yet to remove the stain from the reputation of our great state that is around this country and around the world,\" Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper said. But Republicans put the blame squarely on Democrats, noting that all 16 Senate Democrats voted against the repeal legislation in the end. Republicans in the Senate fell on both sides of the issue, with some voting to repeal and some voting against. Senate leader Phil Berger, a Republican, blamed Cooper and his allies for sinking the effort. He issued a lengthy statement on Facebook and Twitter accusing Democrats of \u201chypocrisy\u201d and accusing them of using the controversy for political gain. See the HYPOCRISY for yourself. Every Democrat in the Senate voted AGAINST repealing HB 2: https://t.co/7SJwDEm5nb #NCGA #NCPOL pic.twitter.com/3LS3N4pa3j \u2014 Senator Phil Berger (@SenatorBerger) December 22, 2016 \u201cThis should tell you all you need to know about Cooper and Senate Democrats\u2019 motives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t interested in moving past this issue or protecting the privacy and safety of North Carolina families. They\u2019re brass-knuckled politicians who want to wage a nasty culture war with divisive issues, so they can keep filling their campaign coffers with cash from fringe liberal activists.\u201d GOP legislators who see themselves as business-friendly appeared shaken by a months-long backlash as major companies like BASF, IBM and Bank of America described HB2 as bad for business. The compromise touted by both Cooper and outgoing GOP Gov. Pat McCrory called for Charlotte to do away with its own expanded antidiscrimination ordinance. In exchange, lawmakers would undo the LGBT law. But some conservatives never wanted to repeal the law. And when the Senate bill went a step further and called for a months-long ban on cities passing similar ordinances, Democrats said Republicans were going back on their promise.\u00a0 Cooper reportedly said GOP leaders \u201cbroke the deal\u201d by adding the local ordinance moratorium.\u00a0 Berger, however, noted that the Senate ended up splitting the bill into two parts, allowing a straight vote on the repeal only. It still failed. \u201cAll 16 of them voted NO. Why? Politics. Hypocrisy. And Roy Cooper,\u201d he wrote. North Carolina GOP Chairman Robin Hayes accused Democrats of \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Social conservatives also opposed the repeal for their own reasons, defending the law's transgender bathroom requirement -- which has no enforcement or punishment provisions -- as necessary to prevent heterosexual predators from masquerading as transgender to molest women and girls when they are vulnerable. \"We continue to encourage our leaders to never sacrifice the privacy, safety, or freedom of young girls by forcing them to use the bathroom, shower, or change clothes with grown men just to satisfy the demands of greedy businesses, immoral sports organizations, or angry mobs,\" North Carolina Values Coalition Executive Director Tami Fitzgerald said in a statement. HB2 has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in conventions, jobs and sporting events such as the NBA All-Star Game shunning North Carolina. Corporate critics of the law included Deutsche Bank and Paypal, which both backed out of projects that would have brought hundreds of jobs to the state. \"The NCAA's decision to withhold championships from North Carolina remains unchanged,\" spokesman Bob Williams said. McCrory signed the law and became its national face. HB2, along with other right-leaning bills he signed, turned this fall's gubernatorial campaign into a referendum on the state's recent conservative slant. He lost by about 10,000 votes to Cooper. Meanwhile, fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. McCrory, the first sitting North Carolina governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election, echoed Republican accusations that \"the left sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes.\" Repealing the state law could also have ended protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access.

    "text": "Twitter From Cambridge and Oxford to Lancashire and Surrey, the fees at all English universities are capped \u2014 and a new rate hike, from \u00a39,000 to \u00a39,250 (roughly $11,070 to $11,378) is angering critics, particularly those who say the increase didn't undergo legislative review. Opponents of the tuition hike had pledged to fight the move when it was floated this summer ; now, the BBC says , they're angry that the change seems to have been made final without being posted on the Department for Education's website. \"This is a shabby little way to announce something, hiding it away in a far-flung corner of a government website,\" says Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, according to the BBC. Another member of Parliament, the Labour Party's Gordon Marsden, said the government was being sneaky about an \"increase that doesn't like to speak its name,\" the BBC reports. The rise in fees is already reflected on the University of Oxford's website for students from Britain and the European Union who'll begin studying in 2017; the Cambridge site lists the same rate of 9,250 pounds, with the stipulation that the price \"is subject to government approval.\" Reacting to news of the tuition hike, the National Union of Students is promising to organize a boycott of the government's National Student Survey that's taken by undergraduates in their final year of college. Article continues after sponsorship England's broad cap on university tuition stands in contrast to the system in the U.S., where costs vary wildly between private and public schools. In the 2015-15 school year, the average cost of tuition and fees at all four-year universities was nearly $15,000 in the U.S., according to the National Center for Education Statistics . That figure represents both public colleges, whose average tuition rate was $8,543, and private institutions' average of $26,740. As with the English university fees we're discussing, those figures include only tuition and related fees \u2014 not room and board. When comparing the affordability of American and English schools, we should also note that many undergraduate programs in England award degrees after three years' study rather than four. Both in the U.S. and England, college costs have risen sharply since the economic crisis that hit its peak in many places back in 2008. For instance, some American states saw rises of more than 70 percent from 2009 to 2015. And many English students protested back in 2010, when a plan was announced to raise the limit on university fees from 3,225 pounds yearly to 9,000 pounds. ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Sari Horwitz December 22 at 7:27 PM Follow @sarihorwitz FBI Director James B. Comey testifies during a hearing on July 7 before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) Twelve days before the presidential election, FBI Director James B. Comey dispatched a senior aide to deliver a startling message to the Justice Department. Comey wanted to send a letter to Congress alerting lawmakers that his agents had discovered more emails potentially relevant to the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. The official in Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates\u2019s office who received the FBI call immediately understood the explosive potential of Comey\u2019s message, coming so close to the presidential election. Federal attorneys scrambled into offices on the fourth and fifth floors of Justice Department headquarters, where they huddled to figure out how to stop what they viewed as a ticking time bomb. \u201cIt was DEFCON\u00a01,\u201d said an official familiar with the deliberations. \u201cWe were in\u00adcred\u00adibly concerned this could have an impact on the election.\u201d Aides at Justice and the FBI \u2014 located in offices directly across the street from each other on Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 began exchanging increasingly tense and heated phone calls, nearly a half-dozen throughout the afternoon and evening of Oct.\u00a027 and into the next morning. Justice officials laid out a number of arguments against releasing the letter. It violated two long-standing policies. Never publicly discuss an ongoing investigation. And never take an action affecting a candidate for office close to Election Day. Besides, they said, the FBI did not know yet what was in the emails or if they had anything to do with the Clinton case. Remarkably, the country\u2019s two top law enforcement officials never spoke. As Comey\u2019s boss, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch could have given the FBI director an order to not send the letter. But Lynch and her advisers feared that Comey would not listen. He seemed to feel strongly about updating Congress on his sworn testimony about the Clinton investigation. Instead, they tried to relay their concerns through the Justice official whom the FBI had called. Their efforts failed. Within 24\u00a0hours of the first FBI call, Comey\u2019s letter was out. [ Read the letter Comey sent to FBI employees ] Nearly two months later, the effect of that letter on the 2016 race is still being debated. Clinton told donors recently that she blamed a pair of \u201cunprecedented\u201d events for her loss. One was the Russian hacking of Democratic Party officials. The other was Comey\u2019s letter . Corey Lewandowski, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, said in a speech at Oxford University shortly after the election that what Comey did was \u201camazing\u201d and gave Trump the \u201cspring in his step\u201d he needed to win the election. (The Washington Post) An examination of how a single letter from the FBI became a political bombshell reveals that it was the result of two law enforcement leaders failing over months to navigate the unusually ugly politics of 2016. Having a presidential candidate under active criminal investigation was extraordinary. But Comey and Lynch repeatedly underestimated how much their actions would reverberate in a closely contested presidential race. Lynch\u2019s meeting in June with Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix led to a crisis in leadership at the department over how to handle the Clinton email investigation. Rather than formally recuse herself, Lynch left ambiguous who would be making final decisions on issues regarding Hillary Clinton. Into that vacuum stepped Comey, an FBI director who prides himself on having a finely tuned moral compass that allows him to rise above politics. Weeks before the letter, Comey had advised against the Obama administration public statement admonishing Russia for the Democratic Party hacks, arguing it would make the administration appear partisan too close to the election. But to him, the Clinton email investigation was different. Battered by Republican lawmakers during a hearing that summer, Comey feared he would come under further attack if word leaked about the Clinton case picking up again. He was surprised by the intensity of the reaction to his letter, according to people familiar with Comey\u2019s thinking. His reputation fell further after the FBI acknowledged three days before the election that the emails amounted to nothing. Comey has taken the harsher beating in public for his decision, but some political observers and former Justice officials say that Lynch deserves at least as much scrutiny. Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, said that the controversy shines a light on Lynch\u2019s compromised position and failed leadership as attorney general. \u201cIf she thought [the letter] violated department policy or was otherwise a bad idea, she could have ordered him not to send the letter,\u201d said Goldsmith, who noted that soon after the letter was released, Justice officials proceeded to criticize Comey when Lynch had the power all along to stop him. \u201cIt was an astonishing failure of leadership and eschewal of responsibility, especially if Lynch really thought what Comey did was wrong.\u201d A former senior FBI official who worked closely with Comey for several years said that Comey\u2019s sense of obligation to Congress was the key factor driving his decision. He had testified under oath months earlier that the Clinton investigation was closed. But another factor that day was that Lynch\u2019s credibility had been compromised months earlier in Phoenix. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s ever worked with Jim Comey knows that he has an independent spirit,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut he still very much believes in the chain of command. If he has a boss who\u2019s asking him to do something that\u2019s in the scope of the law and reason, he\u2019s going to follow it. He would have followed protocol. Had the issue with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac not happened, things would be different. People forget that.\u201d The tarmac Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, shown in Phoenix on June 28, spoke to Bill Clinton on the tarmac at the airport. (Nancy Wiechec/Reuters) It was a sweltering June day in Phoenix, and Lynch\u2019s plane had just landed at the airport. She and four staffers had flown west for a series of meetings with local police officers. The staffers walked down the plane stairs first and stepped into a van on the tarmac. The plan was for Lynch \u2014 and her husband, who was also on the trip \u2014 to follow quickly afterward and step into another vehicle. As the staffers waited for about five minutes in the van, checking their smartphones, they suddenly saw a man with silvery white hair approaching the plane. At first, the staffers could not tell who it was. But then, as the man got close to the airplane steps, one of the staffers said with surprise, \u201cIs that Bill Clinton?\u201d It was. Clinton had just wrapped up a fundraiser for his wife and arrived at the tarmac to fly out of Phoenix. His Secret Service detail tipped him off that Lynch was there, too, and he sent word that he wanted to say hello. Lynch felt she could not say no to the former president, who 17\u00a0years ago promoted her to U.S. attorney. Once inside the plane, Lynch said that she, Clinton and her husband discussed their travels, Clinton\u2019s grandchildren, golfing and Brexit. But as the visit dragged on, Lynch became anxious. The Justice Department was still conducting an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices during her tenure as secretary of state. Lynch had just wanted to say a quick hello to Bill Clinton, and now they had been talking for close to half an hour. Her aides outside were also concerned. One of them got out of the van and walked back onto the plane to tell Lynch that they needed to get moving. Lynch would later insist that she and Clinton did not discuss the investigation into his wife. But the optics were immediately damaging. Republican legislators raised questions about whether Lynch and the Justice Department\u2019s investigation had been compromised. [ How everyone looks bad because Clinton met with Lynch ] Four days later on July\u00a01, Lynch acknowledged in an interview with Washington Post editorial writer Jonathan Capehart that her meeting with the former president \u201ccast a shadow over how [the Clinton] case may be perceived\u201d and she \u201ccertainly would not do it again.\u201d Then, in an effort to allay any concerns, Lynch said she would \u201cfully accept\u201d the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI on how to proceed with the Clinton case. Capehart pressed her to explain. Did that mean she would review their recommendation and make her own judgment? No, she said. He asked further. Did that mean she was recusing herself from the case? Lynch did not give a clear answer. Those close to Lynch said that she planned all along \u2014 before the tarmac incident even \u2014 to accept the recommendations of the FBI and career prosecutors. To this day, aides say she does not see any connection between her meeting with Bill Clinton and what Comey would do next. \u2018Extremely careless\u2019 FBI Director James B. Comey, shown at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington on July 5, filled the leadership vacuum created by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, some analysts say. (Cliff Owen/Associated Press) Four days after Lynch\u2019s remarks, Comey, known for his independent streak, called reporters to FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue to announce the conclusion of the year-long Clinton investigation. It was a stunning event both because of what he said and how he said it. Usually, in a high-profile case, the FBI makes a recommendation to the Justice Department, and then the attorney general \u2014 not the FBI director \u2014 announces in a news conference the final decision on any charges. It is rare for officials to hold a briefing when prosecutors decline to pursue a case. In this case, Lynch and other Justice officials did not even find out that Comey was holding a briefing until shortly before he began speaking. At the news conference, Comey stood wedged between two FBI flags as he read a prepared speech to reporters. \u201cI have not coordinated this statement or reviewed it in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThey do not know what I\u2019m about to say.\u201d He proceeded to sharply criticize Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, calling her behavior \u201cextremely careless.\u201d But he said that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against her. \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\u201d Comey said. Justice officials were shocked. They had never seen an FBI director deliver such remarks. \u201cHe was out there on his own,\u201d said a former high-ranking Justice Department official. \u201cThat was unheard of, unprecedented. Lynch did not recuse herself but also was not fully participating, which left a vacuum that the FBI director decided to fill.\u201d Comey, though, felt that given the highly politicized nature of the case, the FBI needed to practice radical transparency for the public to trust the government\u2019s findings on the case. \u201cI think the confidence of the American people in the FBI is a precious thing, and I want them to understand that we did this investigation in a competent, honest and independent way,\u201d Comey said in a three-paragraph internal memo sent to all FBI employees shortly before he spoke. \u201cFolks outside the FBI may disagree about the result, but I don\u2019t want there to be any doubt that this was done in an apolitical and professional way and that our conclusion is honestly held, carefully considered, and ours alone.\u201d Two weeks before the Republican National Convention, Comey\u2019s announcement ignited a blast of criticism from Republicans and Trump supporters who said the investigation\u2019s outcome had been influenced by politics. \u201cThe system is rigged,\u201d Trump tweeted. Two days later, Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee grilled Comey for five hours. In September, he was brought before the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cMy first question is this, would you reopen the Clinton investigation if you discovered new information that was both relevant and substantial?\u201d Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) asked Comey during the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to answer in the abstract,\u201d Comey replied. \u201cWe would certainly look at any new and substantial information.\u201d \u2018Case reopened\u2019 Part of a Nov. 6 letter from FBI Director James B. Comey to Congress is shown. Comey tells Congress that a review of new Hillary Clinton emails has \u201cnot changed our conclusions\u201d from earlier this year that she should not face charges. (Jon Elswick/Associated Press) On Oct.\u00a03, FBI agents seized a computer and other electronic devices from Anthony Weiner , the disgraced former congressman who was now being accused of having a sexual relationship online with a 15-year-old girl. In their search for evidence, the agents stumbled upon something else: 650,000 emails stretching over several years with thousands possibly tied to Clinton\u2019s private server and associated with Clinton and Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a senior aide to the Democratic presidential nominee. Within days, Comey was notified of the discovery. At that point, the agents and their supervisors did not know how many of the emails could be relevant, if they contained classified information or were duplicates of evidence that had already been investigated. They also could not peer into the contents of any Abedin or Clinton emails because they only had a search warrant for Weiner-related evidence. The agents were directed by FBI officials to do more work and report back to Washington when they had a better idea of the scope of the material on the computer and how much might be linked to Clinton. Two more weeks went by as the bureau brought in their computer forensic experts to further examine what appeared to be on the computer, but not look at the contents of the emails. Finally on Oct.\u00a027, three weeks after the emails had first been discovered, agents made a presentation to Comey in his office. They still had no idea what was in the emails, only that there were thousands associated with Abedin, including some correspondence with Clinton. To learn if there was classified information on the emails, they would need a search warrant. Comey agreed it was time. He also began wrestling with whether to notify lawmakers. He worried that getting a warrant would alert more people to the probe, increasing the chances of a leak to the media. He feared a huge outcry if anyone learned the FBI was again investigating Clinton\u2019s emails without informing Congress. Comey would later privately tell lawmakers that he was \u201cstuck in a really bad place.\u201d FBI officials contacted career prosecutors who had worked the Clinton email case to ask what they thought about sending the letter. Don\u2019t do it, they advised. Meanwhile, Justice officials decided that neither Lynch nor her deputy, Yates, should order Comey to not send the letter. They were not sure how Comey would respond to such a command. And they too feared leaks. Lynch and her advisers were nervous about how it would look if people found out that she, a Democratic presidential appointee, told Comey to keep secret from Congress a new development in the Clinton investigation. Instead, they tried to convince Comey that he had never promised to update Congress at every turn. He had merely said he would \u201clook at\u201d any new information in the case. When that did not work, they made one last effort to contain the damage. Justice officials wanted Comey to simply say that he had new information that might be related to the Clinton probe, and to make clear the FBI did not know whether the new material was significant. The FBI did not take their advice, as Justice officials would learn after they saw Comey\u2019s final letter when he sent it to Capitol Hill. The FBI director said the emails \u201cappear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) tweeted, \u201cCase reopened.\u201d This was exactly the impression from the letter that Justice officials feared most. Half an hour later, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted, \u201cA great day in our campaign just got even better. FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe.\u201d Matt Zapotosky and Adam Entous contributed to this report. Read more: ",

That alone presents a significant financial-vetting challenge to Senate Republicans, who hope to begin confirmation hearings in a few weeks. Mr. Trump\u2019s selection process \u2014 begun, unlike that of most predecessors, after his election rather than before \u2014 may have added to the challenge of moving quickly now. \u201cThey need to step on the gas and get it done,\u201d said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush. \u201cThey need to tell the Senate what they are going to do with their assets.\u201d Cabinet nominees undergo rigorous background checks by the F.B.I. and the Office of Government Ethics, as well as a complicated process involving the agencies they are nominated to run. This is to ensure that nominees have no financial conflicts of interest or outstanding tax matters that could later expose them to criminal prosecution. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More For nominees with extensive financial holdings, preparation for confirmation hearings can take weeks or even months, as was the case with Penny Pritzker, a billionaire who is President Obama\u2019s commerce secretary. Previous new administrations have taken longer to name cabinet picks than Mr. Trump has done, in part because they were doing their own vetting that the Trump transition has largely forgone. Three people who have discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees with officials involved in the screening, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations of a highly secretive government agency, were told of the slow pace, which has alarmed Senate Democrats. Mr. McConnell has said he hopes to move ahead on several of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees \u201con Day 1.\u201d Emails to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team were not returned. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees come with a complex web of financial interests and investments. They include Mr. Tillerson; Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner picked to head the Treasury; the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chosen as commerce secretary; and Betsy DeVos, the president-elect\u2019s choice to run the Department of Education. Lawmakers have already raised questions about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s seeming reluctance to turn over his personal financial information . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has tentatively set Jan. 11 for the start of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing. ",

    "text": "Rebecca Hersher A New York art dealer has been arrested and charged with possessing and selling stolen artifacts from countries throughout Asia. Nancy Wiener is accused of using her gallery in New York City, called Nancy Wiener Gallery, to \"buy, smuggle, launder and sell millions of dollars' worth of antiquities stolen from Afghanistan, Cambodia, China, India, Pakistan, and Thailand,\" according to a complaint filed in Manhattan Criminal Court . According to the gallery's website , it has sold art to private collectors and museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum, Art Institute of Chicago and National Gallery of Australia. A Baphuon Shiva statue from Cambodia, dated to the 11th century, that was allegedly purchased by Nancy Wiener in 2008 and which investigators believe was obtained by looting. Case State of New York v. Nancy Wiener/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Case State of New York v. Nancy Wiener/Screenshot by NPR Jason Felch, an investigative reporter who writes about the trafficking of stolen art, described Wiener's business as \"one of the country's most prestigious Asian art galleries on Manhattan's Upper East Side,\" on his blog Chasing Aphrodite . The 12-page complaint, which is signed by Special Agent Brenton Easter of the Department of Homeland Security, reads less like a court filing than an art heist thriller. It tells of an elaborate scheme, carried out with co-conspirators around the world, to buy stolen artifacts and then cover up their origin to make hundreds of thousands of dollars selling them. Take, for example, the story of an Indian sandstone sculpture from around the second century, referred to as \"Seated Buddha #1.\" In 1999, Wiener allegedly sold the sculpture to Singapore's Asian Civilisations Museum. When, years later, the museum asked for documents about the sculpture's origin, Wiener gave them three answers: First, she said it had belonged to \"an unnamed European collector for at least 35 to 40 years,\" then she said her own father had acquired it in India, and finally she gave the name of a man she said bought it when \"he was posted in Vietnam between 1964 and 1966.\" Article continues after sponsorship The name she gave was Ian Donaldson, a fact that later became relevant to investigators. None of the three claims about the statue's origin appeared to be true. Investigators searching a storage locker rented by another art dealer found an \"unlabeled computer disc.\" On it were three pictures of Seated Buddha #1. In one of them, the statue appeared \"still wet as it lay on a dirty floor.\" The date stamp on the picture appears to be Nov. 8, 1992. In 1999, Wiener allegedly sold this sculpture, listed as \"Seated Buddha #1,\" to Singapore's Asian Civilisations Museum. Case State of New York State v. Nancy Wiener/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Case State of New York State v. Nancy Wiener/Screenshot by NPR Meanwhile, Wiener acquired a second Buddha statue. She sold that one, referred to as \"Seated Buddha #2,\" to the National Gallery of Australia in 2007 for more than $1 million, saying that it had originally been purchased in Hong Kong by a man who \"had been posted there between 1964 and 1966.\" The man's name was also Ian Donaldson. India's patrimony laws, which spells out the right of the country to retain its artifacts, took effect in 1972, according to the complaint. A looted red sandstone relief from India, dated between the first and second century, that was purchased by Nancy Wiener's mother, Doris, in 2002 and consigned to Christie's after Doris' death. Case State of New York v. Nancy Wiener/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Case State of New York v. Nancy Wiener/Screenshot by NPR The complaint also describes methods Wiener appeared to have used to create the false air of legitimacy around possibly stolen artifacts she and her family owned. For example, the state alleges Wiener attempted to consign a collection of 380 artifacts owned by her mother, Doris Wiener, to the auction house Sotheby's but didn't have adequate documentation about their origin. So she consigned the collection to Christie's New York instead. According to the complaint, Doris Wiener had previously consigned some of the artifacts and re-bought them at auction \u2014 so-called straw purchases meant to launder their purchase history by adding apparent owners. Christie's did not ask for extensive documentation about where the Wieners acquired the art and sold the entire lot in 2012 for $12.7 million. The New York Times reported some of the artifacts Wiener is accused of possessing \"were said to have been smuggled into the United States by Subhash Kapoor, a well-known Manhattan art dealer who is now on trial in India.\" The paper also quote Wiener's lawyer, Georges Lederman, as saying, \"We are examining the charges and will respond at the appropriate time.\" ",

    "text": "Email Temperatures around the North Pole will almost certainly pass the melting point, 32 degrees Fahrenheit, in the days leading up to Christmas, as global warming wreaks havoc on some of the world\u2019s coldest and iciest areas, scientists say. \u201cHigh up into the Arctic and close to the North Pole, the temperatures are very, very possibly above freezing,\u201d Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News Wednesday. He called the current temperatures in the Arctic \u201cremarkable.\u201d The Arctic has seen a dramatic transformation in recent years, with significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice , and more open water. In November, the average Arctic sea ice extent \u2014 the measurement scientists use to represent the area of ocean where there is at least some sea ice \u2014 was 17.7 percent below the averages from 1981 to 2010, according to NOAA. That\u2019s the lowest November extent since the NOAA began keeping records in 1979. At the moment, temperatures at the North Pole are about 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal. Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli of CBS affiliate WPEC explains that \u201cessentially a conveyor belt of very warm, most air\u201d is currently pushing north into the Arctic.\u00a0 ClimateReanalyzer.org The ongoing\u00a0warming trend is hardly news to people in the region, where Mayewski does field research collecting and analyzing snow samples and ice cores. \u201cFor the people in the Arctic, no one has to tell them an abrupt climate change has hit,\u201d Mayewski said.\u00a0 But, he noted, the same cannot be said for people living farther down in the Northern Hemisphere who are unknowingly experiencing the ripple effects of Arctic warming. \u201cThey assume the Arctic is far away, and they assume, \u2018What impact could this have on us?\u2019\u201d Mayewski said. But Arctic warming is directly tied to extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere, he explained. With the barrier between the cold north and warm south weakening, cold air masses are more easily moving south and warm air masses are more easily moving north, fueling the changes in surface ocean currents that can exacerbate extreme weather events. In addition, as sea ice transforms into open water, that open water absorbs more heat, a cycle of warming that increasing moisture levels and raises the odds of events like floods and droughts throughout the hemisphere.\u00a0 Mayewski cited a long list of recent extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere: the drought in the western United States, the historically cold East Coast winter of 2014, the initially mild winter of 2015-16 that suddenly gave way to record cold temperatures. \u201cAll of this points to instability,\u201d he said. In historical perspective, Arctic warming over the past five years is \u201cas fast and as large a magnitude\u201d as the warming that occurred during the last vestiges of the Ice Age 11,500 years ago \u2014 the transition that gave birth to our modern climate age, Mayewski said. The Arctic\u2019s climate system has followed largely linear patterns until now. \u201cWhile none of the global climate models predicted we\u2019d have an Arctic warming so fast, it no less happened. The models are based on input from the last few decades. We\u2019re experiencing something which is a surprise, a quick change in the climate system,\u201d he said, citing the rapid release of greenhouse gases and the hole in the ozone as accelerating factors.\u00a0 As the Arctic continues to warm, it will release dangerous amounts of the greenhouse gas methane , which absorbs the sun\u2019s heat and further warms the atmosphere. In the first two decades after its release, methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. ",

The announcement was made through an army statement broadcast on Syrian state TV shortly after the last four buses carrying fighters left through the Ramousseh crossing. Western Aleppo erupted in celebratory gunfire seen on Syrian TV, which showed uniformed soldiers and civilians shouting slogans in support of President Bashar Assad. The Syrian government's recapture of Aleppo is a major turning point in the Syrian civil war with potentially powerful political repercussions. Syrians walks down a destroyed street in Aleppo's al-Akroub neighbourhood on Dec. 17. Youssef Karwashan / AFP - Getty Images It represents a momentous victory for President Bashar Assad and a crushing defeat for Syria's opposition which will struggle to forge a way forward. Related: Syrians Face an Uncertain Future After Being Evacuated From Aleppo The ancient city has been divided into rebel and government parts since 2012. \"Thanks to the blood of our heroic martyrs, the heroic deeds and sacrifices of our armed forces and the allied forces, and the steadfastness of our people, the General Command of the Army and the Armed Forces announces the return of security and stability to Aleppo,\" said the statement read by an army general. The statement said the victory in Aleppo is a \"strategic transformation and a turning point in the war on terrorism and a deadly blow to the terrorist project and its supporters.\" It is a further incentive, it added, to go on fighting to \"eradicate terrorism and restore security and stability to every span of the homeland.\" Syrian President Bashar Assad said earlier that his forces' achievements in Aleppo are a \"major step on the road to wiping out terrorism\" and should pave the way toward ending Syria's civil war. Related: Aleppo Twitter Sensation Bana al-Abed Evacuated From Syrian City The rebel evacuations were set in motion last week after Syria's opposition agreed to surrender its last footholds in eastern Aleppo. Since then, some 35,000 fighters and civilians have been bused out, according to the United Nations. The ICRC said in a statement that more than 4,000 additional fighters were evacuated in private cars, vans, and pick-ups from eastern Aleppo since Wednesday. The departure of the last convoy paves the way for Assad to assume full control after more than four years of fighting over Syria's largest city. It marks his most significant victory since an uprising against his family's four-decade rule swept the country in 2011. Thousands of civilians were evacuated from the besieged city in the last week as government forces sought to completely recapture Aleppo. The U.N. estimates 1.3 million people were under siege by rebels or regime in 39 communities across Syria. The Associated Press ",

    "text": "Dec 22 2016, 4:26 pm ET Texas Police Probing Arrest of Black Women by White Officer After They Called Cops by Corky Siemaszko Video Showing Texas Police Arrest Stirs Controversy 1:30 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161223023317if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/839841347972\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> A white Texas police officer whose violent arrest of three black women went viral when it hit the internet was placed on restricted duty Thursday while an internal investigation is under way, officials said. The Fort Worth Police Department did not identify the officer who was caught on camera wrestling at least two of the women to the ground and pointing a Taser at another person. \"We acknowledge that the initial appearance of the video may raise serious questions,\" the department said in a statement. \"We ask that our investigators are given the time and opportunity to thoroughly examine this incident and submit their findings.\" That means that for now the most vivid account of what happened on Wednesday is the footage recorded by a cousin of one of the arrested women, identified by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram as Porsha Carver. \"Since this is an internal investigation, state law limits the information that may be released, including the officer's body cam footage,\" the police said. \"We ask our community for patience and calm during this investigation process.\" The confrontation erupted after Jacqueline Craig called the Fort Worth Police department to report that her 7-year-old son was choked by a white neighbor, the NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported. We are aware of the video circulating on social media.  IA is currently investigating - a formal statement to follow later today. pic.twitter.com/wKmVQk9BET \u2014 Fort Worth Police (@fortworthpd) December 22, 2016 In the video, the responding officer can be seen talking to the neighbor, who claimed that Craig's son left litter on his property and defied his request to pick it up, the affiliate reported. Then the officer turns to Craig and asks, \"Why don't you teach your son not to litter?\" Brea Hymond and Jacqueline Craig wait to get released after getting arrested by police. Courtesy S. Lee Merritt \"He can't prove to me that he did or didn't,\" a furious Craig replies. \"But it doesn't matter. That doesn't give him the right to put his hands on him.\" \"Why not?\" the officer replies. When Craig's daughter Brea Hymond tries to get between them the officer tackles her. At one point, the officer is seen on the video pulling out his Taser as he wrestles Craig and Hymond to the ground. But it was not immediately clear if he used it or who he was aiming the device at. The person recording the arrests can be heard swearing a blue streak in the background, calling the officer a \"racist pig\" and worse. Post by NBC News . As of Thursday afternoon, Craver's video had garnered 1.2 million views. Craig, 46, was charged with resisting arrest and for outstanding traffic warrants, police said. Hymond, 19, was charged with resisting arrest and interfering with public duty. The name of the third woman in custody and the charges against her were not immediately available. The ACLU of Texas came down on the side of the arrested women and said the officer \"ignored basic community policing standards and his own responsibility to de-escalate the confrontation.\" \"When the mother of a seven-year-old boy calls the police to report an assault on her son, the responding officer should expect to find her distraught,\" executive director Terri Burke said Thursday. \"This incident and countless others like them demonstrate that for people of color, showing anything less than absolute deference to police officers \u2014regardless of the circumstances \u2014 can have unjust and often tragic consequences.\" Burke said incidents like these are a \"threat to public safety.\" \"If a black woman in Fort Worth can't call the cops after her son is allegedly choked by a neighbor without getting arrested, why would she ever call the cops again?\" The racially-charged encounter in Fort Worth came a day after a JCPenney shopper was videotaped going on an expletive-laden tirade against two Latina customers.

The mayor turned the offer down. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune It's a cliche of lazy Hollywood scriptwriters: If you want to make someone look like a nice guy, have him pet a dog. And yet Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who has worked hard to give himself a more cuddly persona \u2014 has so far turned down the offer of a warm puppy, according to his pal, 1871 CEO Howard Tullman. Buried among the trove of emails released by Emanuel's lawyers Wednesday is a note Tullman sent the mayor in July 2011, offering him a \"Chocolate Lab puppy\" from the PAWS Chicago shelter and the chance to go to a Cubs game with Larry King. \"No thanks to Larry King,\" Emanuel replied. \"Is the dog pure-bred?\" PAWS Fur Ball James C.

Svehla for the Tribune) Though the Labrador, was, indeed, pure-bred, Emanuel felt it was not the right time, Tullman told Chicago Inc. on Thursday. But \"we continue to lobby him to get a dog,\" Tullman said, adding that his wife, Judy, is an active supporter of PAWS and that the Tullmans have three dogs, \"all mutts.\" ",
