    "text": "Durst Interrogation: 'Worst Fugitive' in the World By brian melley, associated press LOS ANGELES \u0097 Dec 17, 2016, 3:25 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In March 17, 2015, file photo, New York real estate heir Robert Durst smiles as he is transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on murder charges in New Orleans. Durst, 73, charged with murdering a friend in Los Angeles told a prosecutor he never fled because of inertia. Documents released Friday, Dec. 16, 2016, show Durst told a prosecutor he was the world's worst fugitive. Durst did not confess to the killing but he said he was willing to provide information Deputy District Attorney John Lewin sought in exchange for a better prison assignment. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) 0 Shares Email New York real estate heir Robert Durst knew he was suspected in the Los Angeles killing of his best friend, but he never fled when he had the chance because years had passed and he didn't think police would come after him, according to recently released court documents. Durst was asked why he didn't split after documentary filmmakers confronted him in 2012 with a letter anonymously sent to police in 2000 tipping them to the location of Susan Berman's body that matched handwriting on a letter he had sent her years before. \"You saw the envelopes. How come you didn't ... leave then?\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked. \"It's mind-boggling to me.\" \"I guess inertia,\" Durst replied. \"I just didn't really, really, really think that I was gonna end up arrested.\" The comment was one of several that hinted at his involvement in three suspected killings chronicled in the documentary \"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\" but Durst stopped short of confessing to any of them. The documents detail his interrogation by Los Angeles prosecutors while he was in custody in New Orleans after his arrest March 15 last year on a charge of murder in Berman's death. Durst acknowledged he was in the process of fleeing when he was arrested. He was found in a hotel with a false Texas ID, stacks of $100 bills, bags of marijuana, a .38-caliber revolver, a map folded to show Louisiana and Cuba, and a flesh-toned latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair. \"I was the worst fugitive the world has ever met,\" he said. His arrest came the day the final installment of the six-part series aired on HBO. After being confronted with the two identical-looking envelopes, the documentary ended with Durst going into a bathroom where his live microphone captured him muttering to himself: \"There it is. You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" Durst, 73, told Lewin that he took meth during his interviews with the filmmakers and had smoked pot every day of his life. The series traced the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in New York in 1982, his acquittal on murder charges in the 2001 dismemberment killing of a neighbor Galveston, Texas, and the killing of Berman in Los Angeles as she was about to speak with prosecutors investigating his wife's suspected slaying. When asked why he cooperated with the makers of \"The Jinx,\" Durst said he felt filmmaker Andrew Jarecki had been sympathetic toward him in a feature-length film, \"All Good Things,\" about his wife's disappearance. He gave Jarecki and his partner, Marc Smerling, two lengthy interviews and provided access to boxes of documents so they would get the full picture of his life. \"I wanted them to see the whole thing,\" Durst said. \"That they would see me as an acceptable human being, as opposed to all this other stuff.\" The 110-page transcript of his interrogation was included to bolster a motion filed by prosecutors Friday asking a judge to appoint a \"special master\" to sort through the boxes of seized documents to separate material that might be protected by lawyer-client confidentiality. Defense attorneys would not comment. But the motion filed by prosecutors said the defense claims the interview with Durst after his arrest was improper, his statements were not voluntary and prosecutors knew he had lawyers and should not have interviewed him. Throughout the interrogation, Lewin complimented Durst, telling him he was brilliant and the most interesting suspect he'd ever investigated. He prodded and coaxed and constantly pushed for a confession. \"I know that when you killed Susan, that was not something you wanted to do,\" Lewin said. \"Um, I'm gonna stay away from killing Susan,\" Durst replied. Toward the end of the interview, Durst negotiated with Lewin on what he could get in exchange for providing more information, though he acknowledged at his advanced age and poor health there wasn't much the prosecutor could offer. He'd been told that his missing wife's mother, Ann McCormack, was 101 years old and he said he would like to do something for her family. \"I think what you wanted to hear \u2014 to make Ann McCormack happy \u2014 is ... 'What did you do with Kathie?' And I think you want me to go through details of, of Susan. ... Now, what would I ask for?\" Lewin said he had no control over where Durst would be imprisoned, but he gave his word he would recommend a better place. \"I'm hoping that there's a part of you in there that is saying, 'You know what? I can't undo what I've done in the past. But I can try to \u2014 I don't have many years left.' Will you at least think about that?\" Durst said he would. ",

Police officers guard hostages during their release in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero. (Emiliana Barrera / AFP/Getty Images) Patrick J. McDonnell Contact Reporter The self-proclaimed good guys, masked men bearing shotguns and ancient hunting rifles, kept guard last week outside what used to be the town police station,\u00a0back when the town still had a police force. Emblazoned in large blue letters against a white facade were the words \u201cMovement for Peace.\u201d \u201cThe people couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d said one of the men, who hid his face behind a yellow handkerchief and identified himself only as Jose, a 42-year-old father of three. \u201cThe government does nothing to help, and we want peace for the future generations. \u201cMaybe in the end, they will kill us all, including our families,\u201d he said, drawing nods from the other vigilantes hunched in white plastic chairs in a sliver of shade. \u201cBut we are in this till the final reckoning.\u201d Maybe in the end, they will kill us all, including our families \u2014 Jose, a 42-year-old father of three Inside the building, fellow townsfolk were holding at least 17 hostages they say were members or allies of the local drug gang. After years of violence and intimidation, the fed-up citizens of San Miguel Totolapan, population 4,000, had taken the perilous step of striking back against Los Tequileros (\u201cthe Tequila drinkers\u201d), the syndicate that dominates drug trafficking and other illicit activity in this steamy stretch of Guerrero state in southwestern Mexico. Their tactics included kidnapping the mother of a gang kingpin. The violence-ridden region is a major production zone of the opium poppy, the raw material used to produce heroin smuggled north to the United States. The zone is also an abyss of lawlessness. Armed bands, including Los Tequileros, battle for control of the lucrative smuggling trade in the\u00a0so-called tierra caliente, or hot land. The phrase refers to the area\u2019s stifling heat and humidity\u00a0but has taken on additional meaning as organized crime has soared. Guerrero state authorities reported a record 2,068 homicides between January and November 2016. November topped the list with 231 killings. The fragmented drug gangs also traffic in extortion, kidnapping, robbery and murder. Los Tequileros boasts its own \u201cspecial forces\u201d of professional killers with colorful nicknames. Last year, police arrested an alleged tequilero enforcer, Juan Vargas Macedo, a.k.a. \u201cEl Garfield.\u201d The thuggish turmoil has left some towns, including San Miguel Totolapan, as virtual no-go zones, where residents say police and the army are seldom seen.\u00a0Taxi drivers in the nearby market town of Altamirano politely demur when asked for a lift here. \u201cDemasiado peligroso,\u201d\u00a0they say. Too dangerous. The town cops were in cahoots with the criminals, according to state authorities, who solved that problem two years ago by disbanding the police force. No one filled the law enforcement void. Some nearby hamlets\u00a0are abandoned because\u00a0residents decamped in fear. Gouges from high-caliber rounds mark a few buildings along\u00a0winding roads through stands of corn, bean fields and dense brush where cows and goats graze. In June 2014, the bullet-riddled body of Maria Felix Jaimes, a former councilwoman in San Miguel Totolapan, was found with a placard, presumably from Los Tequileros.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is going to happen to anyone who passes information to \u2018the fish,\u2019 \u201d said the sign, referring\u00a0to the head of a rival gang known as the Michoacan Family. \u201cYou are next.\u201d Last week, things reached a boiling\u00a0point here. It started with the kidnapping last Sunday  of 37-year-old Isauro de Paz Duque, a widely respected engineer whose firm is one of the area\u2019s few regular sources of employment. In retaliation the next day, townsfolk launched a dicey gambit. Calling themselves a \u201cself-defense force,\u201d they took up arms and abducted the mother of Raybel Jacobo de Almonte, known as El Tequilero (\u201cthe Tequila Drinker\u201d), notorious capo of the gang that bears his handle. The vigilantes abducted at least 17 others who\u00a0they said were\u00a0were\u00a0linked to his mob.\u00a0 The drama played out on videos posted on YouTube. Yadira Guillermo, wife of the kidnapped engineer, appeared in a clip urging the Guerrero governor to intervene to secure the release of her husband. \u201cWe have here \u2026 the mother of the man called Tequilero,\u201d the wife declared. \u201cI ask for an exchange: I will deliver his mother if they deliver my husband. \u2026 But I want him safe and sound.\u201d The gaunt-looking mother, Maria Felix de Almonte, was videotaped in captivity pleading with her infamous offspring to do the right thing. \u201cLook, son, if you have the engineer, turn him over, please,\u201d she said in a chastising tone as she looked into the camera.\u00a0\u201cIf you have him, I\u2019m confident that you will release him. Do it, please.\u201d Her son is a figure of dark legend here. Authorities say he is wanted on suspicion of murder, kidnapping and extortion, among other crimes. Last month, \u00a0he eluded a massive manhunt. \u201cAll indications are that he is hiding out in caves,\u201d the state\u2019s top prosecutor, Xavier Olea, told local radio at the time.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not someone who can be walking in the mountains for two or three hours,\u201d\u00a0added the prosecutor, noting that\u00a0de Almonte suffers from a bullet wound to a leg and sometimes must be carried by his confederates. By late Wednesday,\u00a0the vigilantes and Los Tequileros struck a deal.\u00a0News footage showed the engineer being reunited with his wife and children. A separate clip documented El Tequilero\u2019s frail mother stepping into a pickup, surrounded by heavily armed state police. Even with the other hostages still captive, some measure of calm returned to San Miguel Totolapan by the next day.\u00a0 State and federal police pickups rumbled up and down largely abandoned streets. In the central plaza, the doors to city hall were opened, but no one was inside. A plastic Christmas tree towered\u00a0above the mostly vacant plaza. Local vigilantes who call themselves a \"self-defense force\" walk past police officers in San Miguel Totolapan. Cecilia Sanchez / For The Times Local vigilantes who call themselves a \"self-defense force\" walk past police officers in San Miguel Totolapan. Local vigilantes who call themselves a \"self-defense force\" walk past police officers in San Miguel Totolapan. (Cecilia Sanchez / For The Times) Women with scarves concealing their faces waved\u00a0white flags and occasionally chanted, \u201cWe want peace!\u201d \u201cReally, we are all just tired of the lawlessness and violence,\u201d said one of them, who identified herself only as Maria out of fear, she said,\u00a0that the gangs would retaliate against her for taking part in the vigilante uprising.\u00a0 A mother of three, she said she was\u00a0familiar with kidnapping, having been a victim two years ago\u00a0when she was held for a week until her family paid a ransom. \u201cI am only fortunate to be here alive today,\u201d she said. The armed \u201cself-defense\u201d\u00a0militiamen\u00a0lingered outside the former police headquarters, their hostages inside.\u00a0They conceded that in confronting\u00a0the thugs, they had resorted to their tactics. But the vigilantes\u00a0said they had no choice: It was the only way anybody would listen to them. On Friday, the state police and army met the demands of the townsfolk and agreed to establish a strong local presence and hunt down the fugitive El Tequilero. In return, the citizens released the hostages. The crisis appeared to have passed, for now. De Paz, the engineer whose kidnapping sparked the confrontation, has been welcomed back as a hero since his release.\u00a0Outside his home, ecstatic neighbors embraced him and celebrated his survival. \u201cThe people of this pueblo never raised arms till now,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThe people took to the streets, and that is their right,\u201d added a smiling de Paz.\u00a0\u201cThey have had enough with what is going on in this country. \u2026 It\u2019s like when a person has a fever. That means something is wrong, no? Or when a car overheats. Eventually it explodes. That is what happened here in San Miguel.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss The Ghost Ship fire has brought scrutiny to warehouses and unconventional living spaces, the L.A.

In a Friday statement , the department more than doubled the amount it's been offering for the self-proclaimed leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria who's\u00a0urging\u00a0militants to confront their enemy until \u201ctheir blood flows like rivers.\u201d \u201cISIL has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the Middle East, including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States,\u201d the State Department said in its release, using an acronym for the group. \u201cThe group also has conducted chemical weapons attacks in Iraq and Syria in defiance of the longstanding global norm against the use of these appalling weapons, and has enabled or directed terrorist attacks beyond the borders of its self-declared caliphate,\u201d the statement said. In June 2014, the Islamic State\u00a0seized portions of Syria and Iraq, declaring an Islamic \u201ccaliphate\u201d and naming Baghdadi as its leader. The group has since radicalized individuals around the world, leading to homegrown attacks in the U.S. and Europe. A U.S.-backed offensive that began in October is seeking to secure the last major Islamic State stronghold in Iraq \u2013 the city of Mosul. It is amounting to the biggest battle in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.

(Photo: Stephen R. Sylvanie, USA TODAY Sports) LAS VEGAS\u00a0\u2014 The scoring never slowed down as Kentucky and North Carolina raced to 100 points and beyond Saturday in the CBS Classic. Malik Monk scored 47 points and hit two three-pointers to clinch the No. 7 Wildcats' 103-100\u00a0victory over the No. 6 Tar Heels\u00a0in front of a record 19,298 in attendance at\u00a0T-Mobile Arena. North Carolina's Justin Jackson and Monk put on an epic show to the finish line. Jackson scored five of his career-high 34 points in the final 1:37, but Monk answered with two three-pointers in a game where it seemed like he couldn't miss. Monk scored the most points in John Calipari era, hitting 18 of 28\u00a0shots and 8 of 12 from beyond the arc. His freshman backcourt mate was equally ready for the much anticipated heavyweight bout, posting 24 points and 10 assists. The list of records broken by Monk grew as the game went along. He was the first to hit the 40-mark since Jodie Meeks in 2009, and tied Jamal Murray's record for points in a half when he scored 27 in the opening 20 minutes. North Carolina's backcourt put on a show, too. Jackson finished with 34 points and five rebounds, and Joel Berry added 21 in his return after missing the past two games with an ankle injury.

    "text": "By Robert Samuels December 17 at 6:38 PM Follow @newsbysamuels Pressure on members of the country\u2019s electoral college to select someone other than Donald Trump has grown dramatically \u2014 and noisily \u2014 in recent weeks, causing some to waver, but yielding little evidence Trump will fall short when electors convene in most state capitals Monday to cast their votes. Carole Joyce of Arizona expected her role as a GOP elector to be pretty simple: She would meet the others in Phoenix and carry out a vote for Trump, who won the most votes in her state and whom she personally supported. But then came the mail and the emails and the phone calls \u2014 first hundreds, then thousands of voters worrying Trump\u2019s impulsive nature would lead the country into another war. \u201cHonestly, it had an impact,\u201d said Joyce, a 72-year-old Republican state committeewoman. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough funerals. I\u2019m tired of hearing bagpipes. . . . But I signed a loyalty pledge. And that matters.\u201d Such is the life these days for many of the 538\u00a0men and women who are scheduled to meet Monday across the country to carry out what has traditionally been a perfunctory vote after most every presidential election. In this image from video, Electoral College voter Jim Skaggs looks through his mail from people writing him about being an elector in Bowling Green, Ky. (Dylan Lovan/AP) The role of elector has intensified this year, in the wake of a bitter election in which Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of nearly 3 \u00a0million and a secret CIA assessment revealed that Russia interfered to help Trump get elected. Amid the uncertainty caused by Russian influence, 10 electors \u2014 nine Democrats and one Republican \u2014 asked for an intelligence briefing to get more information about Moscow\u2019s role. Their request was endorsed by John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThe administration should brief members of the electoral college on the extent and manner of Russia\u2019s interference in our election before they vote on Dec. 19,\u201d Podesta wrote Thursday in a Washington Post op-ed . The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Friday evening that it would not brief the electors, because it is engaged in a presidentially ordered review of the Russian interference. \u201cOnce the review is complete in the coming weeks, the intelligence community stands ready to brief Congress\u201d and may release findings, the ODNI said in a statement posted to its website. Meanwhile, Joyce and the other 305\u00a0Republican electors who are supposed to cast their votes for Trump have been subject to intense campaigns orchestrated by anti-Trump forces to convince them that they alone can block the reality television star from the White House. Others have targeted Democratic electors, who are supposed to cast votes for Hillary Clinton, to persuade them to switch to a more conventional Republican who could also draw enough support from GOP electors to swoop into office. While there is little sign the efforts will prove successful, the push has unleashed intense pressure on individual electors, who have now been thrust into a sometimes uncomfortable spotlight. Rex Teter, 59, a music teacher and preacher, received about 35,000 emails and 200 letters urging him not to support Donald Trump. (David J. Phillip/AP) Joyce has received emails from \u201cBenjamin Franklin\u201d and \u201cJohn Jay\u201d \u2014 and a Christmas card that read: \u201cPlease, in the name of God, don\u2019t vote for Trump.\u201d The rancor about the role of electors started early in the campaign. In August, Baoky Vu, a GOP activist in Atlanta, said he planned to resign from the job because he was so morally opposed to Trump. He planned to defer his voting responsibility to someone more willing \u2014 an alternate who would be put in place Monday. After the election, Vu started getting phone calls and emails asking him not to resign. He was asked instead to consider joining a coalition of electors hoping to vote against Trump. He declined. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should drag this election out any longer,\u201d Vu said. \u201cAnd can you imagine if the electors overturned the results? If we attempt to change them in anyway, you\u2019ve got these far-right elements that are just going to go haywire.\u201d Mark Hersch, a 60-year-old Chicago-based marketing strategist, joined a group known as the Hamilton Electors, who have been organizing efforts to contact electors and change their minds. Before the election, Hersch said, the most political activism he had ever undertaken was planting a yard sign. He said he believes the goal to deny Trump seems reachable if not probable. Rather than persuade an entire country, he and his allies must find 37\u00a0Republicans willing to vote for someone else, a tipping point at which the responsibility of picking the president would shift to the U.S. House of Representatives. No one knows for sure how many are considering alternate votes; estimates vary from one to 25. The GOP-controlled House could vote for Trump anyway, but those trying to flip voters say there is still value in taking a stand. Hersch said he was inspired to continue to flip electors by the movie \u201c300,\u201d which depicts ancient Sparta\u2019s war against a Persian army that outnumbered them 1,000 to one. \u201cI would like to think we would be successful, but if not, we need to do all we could to prevent this man from being president,\u201d he said. Then he modified a line from the movie: \u201cPrepare your breakfast, and eat hearty, for tonight, we will go to battle. This isn\u2019t 300, but 538.\u201d That \u201cbattle\u201d has intensified as electors draw closer to their convening Monday. Joyce was getting 15\u00a0letters a day and 300\u00a0emails in the days after Nov.\u00a08, but those numbers quickly increased to 50\u00a0and 3,000. Some of them have been form letters, others handwritten. The letters came from Washington state and from China, stuffed with copies of the U.S. Constitution or Alexander Hamilton\u2019s writing in Federalist Paper No. 68, which states that the meeting of the electoral college \u201caffords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.\u201d On Thursday, Joyce received so many letters that the letter carrier just gave her a U.S. Postal Service bucket filled to the brim. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this is happening to you,\u201d Joyce recalled the letter carrier saying in a phone interview. While some electors have complained of harassment, Joyce shrugged off the mail and placed it all on a sofa decorated with American flag pillows. \u201cThis is America,\u201d she said, adding that most of the messages were thoughtful. \u201cPeople have a right to say what they want.\u201d On Friday, she said, her emails became more positive. The messages were from Republicans, thanking her for taking Trump to the finish line of an arduous process. \u201cHow refreshing!\u201d she said. Although some Democrats (who have in the past five elections lost two in which they won the popular vote) and even Trump himself have questioned the necessity of the electoral college, many opposing Trump have said this election proves just how important it is. Norman Eisen, a former ambassador to the Czech Republic who served as legal counsel to both the Bush and Obama administrations, began telephoning electors to explain that their job is not necessarily to certify the results, but to have a reasonable discussion over whether the public made the right decision. For instance, Eisen, who focused on government ethics in Obama\u2019s White House, noted that Trump could be violating a clause in the Constitution that prevents presidents from receiving gifts and funds from foreign governments; it is unclear whether his businesses do because he has not publicly disclosed his tax returns. In Massachusetts, Republican operative and attorney R.J. Lyman said he didn\u2019t want to harass anyone, so he used his connections to find electors who were willing to chat about the lessons he learned in American history class and at the dinner table. He became one of the few people in America more willing to talk about Hamilton the man than about \u201cHamilton: An American Musical.\u201d The electoral college, he said he tells them, was \u201cnot intended to be a rubber stamp.\u201d Otherwise, he said, the Founding Fathers would have tasked the responsibility to a clerk or simply used the popular vote as a way of choosing a president. \u201cI\u2019m reminding them of their duty to think about their choice in a way that\u2019s consistent with their conscience and the Constitution,\u201d Lyman said. So far, Lyman said, he has identified 20 electors who might be willing to vote \u201cother than their party pledge.\u201d He couldn\u2019t name more than one publicly but insisted that more were out there. Earlier this month, Chris Suprun of Texas became the first Republican elector in a red state that voted for Trump to declare, in a Dec. 5 New York Times column , that he would not cast his electoral vote for Trump. Suprun voted for Cruz in the primary and said he left behind his wallet on Election Day and thus did not vote in the general. Nonetheless, Suprun said, he was willing to vote for Trump in the electoral college until the candidate claimed with no evidence that millions of Clinton supporters voted illegally. Suprun\u2019s public stance has elicited death threats and hate mail, he said. \u201cAs of yesterday, people are calling to say, \u2018Get your ass together, or we\u2019re coming for you,\u2019 \u201d said Suprun, who was the sole Republican elector to ask for an intelligence briefing on Russia. \u201cThey are doing it with their own phone number, not even blocking the number. That\u2019s not been surprising \u2014 look at what Trump says himself.\u201d Vinz Koller, a Democratic elector from Monterey County, Calif., said he read Suprun\u2019s column and started thinking about his own role in the college. It inspired him to support a new theory: If he could persuade other Democrats to abandon their Clinton votes, perhaps he and Republicans could agree on a more conventional choice \u2014 a la Ohio governor and failed candidate John Kasich \u2014 to vote for over Trump. The plan seemed unlikely, he said, but Trump\u2019s candidacy unsettled him so much that he felt he needed to try anything. California is one of 29 states that mandate electors vote for the candidate who won the state, so Koller sued them to continue his plan. \u201cFrankly, this is hard and not something I do lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in partisan politics a long time, and I don\u2019t like voting against my candidate, but I never thought that the country might be unstable until now.\u201d On Thursday evening, he found himself in the Library of Congress. Strolling through its stacks, Koller sought a librarian with one request: Can I see the original Federalist Papers? He looked to see Federalist No. 68, written by Hamilton to describe the need for the electoral college. \u201cWe have been getting a civic lesson we weren\u2019t prepared to get,\u201d Koller said. \u201cThey gave us the fail-safe emergency brake, in case the people got it wrong. And here we are, 200 years later. It\u2019s the last shot we have.\u201d Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Rush-hour snow, freezing rain, possibly record-breaking cold Subzero cold sets in across the Chicago area, making for a frigid commutes and a sunrise that looks deceptively warm. (Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staff Contact Reporter Chicago will get a break from the arctic chill long enough for a snowstorm around the evening rush Friday, freezing rain on Saturday morning, then more snow before polar air returns and possibly breaks some records by the end of the weekend.

In Rockford, 1.5 inches of snow had fallen while less than half an inch of snow had fallen at Midway Airport.\u00a0 The snow may turn to sleet and freezing rain Saturday morning, especially in areas to the south of the city. \"Any amount of light freezing rain or freezing drizzle could have large impact,\" the weather service warned. The wind will pick up and the temperature will drop by evening, when more snow is expected. The two waves of snow Friday and Saturday are expected to dump as much as 8 inches near the Wisconsin border, less to the south.

Alex Wong/Getty Images Email Attorney General Loretta Lynch pushed back Friday on criticisms of the FBI following its investigation into the Russian-directed hacks of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign staff. In an interview published late Friday, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper spoke with Lynch about charges -- leveled by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this week -- that the FBI probe into the DNC cyberattacks were substandard. Asked if she agreed, the attorney general responded: \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cFirst of all the investigation isn\u2019t even over, so I think it\u2019s impossible to characterize it in any one way or the other,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Mr. Podesta is obtaining information one way or another.\u201d Lynch, who helms the department that oversees the FBI, went on to say that Podesta\u2019s assessment may be affected by his partisan views. \u201cI know also because of his involvement with the campaign, he\u2019s going to have a certain interest in this and a certain view of that,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has a great deal of respect for him. So I allow him that opinion, but I disagree with that, if that is in fact the characterization he is trying to make.\u201d In his op-ed published late Thursday, Podesta singled out FBI Director James Comey for his agents\u2019 neglect in raising the alarm on the DNC hacks. \u201cI was surprised to read in the New York Times that when the FBI discovered the Russian attack in September 2015, it failed to send even a single agent to warn senior Democratic National Committee officials,\u201d Podesta wrote. He contrasted those actions to those that\u00a0 involved the year-long investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email server , which saw \u201cdozens of agents who conducted at least 80 interviews and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.\u201d Lynch explained the differences in the probes, saying \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to look at every investigation separately, you\u2019ve got to look at every case separately.\u201d ",

Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Wonder and Worry, as a Syrian Child Transforms Canada welcomes Syrian refugees like no other country. But for one 10-year-old\u2019s parents, is she leaving too much behind? By CATRIN EINHORN and JODI KANTOR DEC. 17, 2016 TORONTO \u2014 As soon as Bayan Mohammad, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee, arrived here last winter, she began her transformation. In her first hour of ice-skating, she managed to glide on her own. She made fast friends with girls different from any she had ever known. New to competitive sports, she propelled herself down the school track so fast that she was soon collecting ribbons. Bayan glued herself to the movie \u201cAnnie,\u201d the ballet \u201cCinderella\u201d and episodes of \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d all stories of metamorphosis. As her English went from halting to chatty, she ticked off everything she hungered to do: An overnight school trip. Gymnastics lessons. Building a snowman \u2014 no, a snow-woman. \u201cI just want to be Canadian,\u201d she said. The volunteers resettling her family \u2014 a group of teachers, pediatricians and other friends and neighbors spurred by devastating images of young refugees and casualties of war \u2014 watched Bayan with wonder. Her parents, Abdullah and Eman Mohammad, a former grocery store owner and a nurse from a rural village, felt both pride and alarm. Coming to Canada with their four children, they had braced themselves for the hostility that so many refugees were encountering around the world, including just across the border, where Donald J. Trump warned of the threat posed by Syrian refugees. Instead, they found a national movement to aid them . Advertisement Continue reading the main story As Syria shattered, everyday citizens, called private sponsors, were adopting the newcomers, donating their time and thousands of dollars to help guide them through their first year. The volunteers attended to the family\u2019s every need: an apartment, doctors, tips on finding a mosque and halal food. The sponsors even applied to bring other family members to Canada \u2014 and still they wanted to know what more they could do. Continue reading the main story The Mohammads were astonished and grateful. But over 10 months, the relationship was reshaping the family, rewriting roles and rules they had always followed. Abdullah and Eman found their marriage on new ground, the fundamental compact between them shifting. Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their now-obliterated life in Syria. On some days, her parents believed that she could meld her old and new identities; on others, they feared her Syrianness was being erased. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan was eager to embrace the regular pastimes of Canadian youth, like ice-skating. Within her first hour, Bayan was gliding on her own, \u201carms outstretched and a smile as wide to match,\u201d said one of her sponsors, Yolanda Mak. Credit Cole Burston for The New York Times If the family had landed in Munich or Minneapolis, they would have encountered new cultural dilemmas, too. But Canada\u2019s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another\u2019s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. \u201cWhat they gave us, a brother wouldn\u2019t even give to his own brother,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said. Still, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons \u2014 which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday? \u201cSponsorship brings the tension between East and West so close,\u201d said Sam Nammoura, a Syrian-Canadian refugee advocate in Calgary, Alberta. The Mohammads had left Syria and then Jordan to safeguard their children \u2014 but once they arrived here, they were bewildered by what they found. Why were teenagers here allowed to stay out past midnight? Did children move away from home at 18 and never look back? How much control did parents even have? \u201cEvery day I have this dilemma,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. \u201cAm I letting the kids do the right thing?\u201d In October, Bayan craved one item above all on her wish list: to join her school\u2019s overnight trip. For three days at the end of the month, the whole fifth grade would travel to an island in Toronto\u2019s harbor, exploring, conducting science experiments and sleeping in dorms. Advertisement \u201cI want to go but my dad said no,\u201d Bayan said over a family lunch of chicken and stuffed cabbage rolls. Her parents felt their children belonged at home; they had never been on a sleepover. \u201cI want to go!\u201d Bayan repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sad because my best friends are going.\u201d By Canadian or American standards, she was being polite: no eye-rolling or accusations. Continue reading the main story Photo Kerry McLorg, center, the organizer of group of sponsors helping to resettle the Mohammad family in Canada, showed the children and their mother how to make gingerbread houses last month. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times But in Syria, children are bound to respect the authority of their parents, even in adulthood. The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,\u201d her mother explained. Bayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group. Meticulous and restrained, Ms. McLorg never wanted to push the Mohammads, and when they asked for her advice, she tended to answer with clinical distance, lest her own preferences show. But she knew Bayan yearned for the adventure. She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl\u2019s integration into Canada. Her two children had gone on the trip years ago and still talked about the traditions \u2014 visiting a lighthouse, telling ghost stories. \u201cEvery kid in Toronto does this,\u201d Ms. McLorg had told Bayan\u2019s parents when they had asked. \u201cAcademically, it\u2019s not important. But socially, it is very important.\u201d Mr. Mohammad told Bayan again: No trip. He was not an immigrant who set out to adapt to a new world; he was a refugee trying to hold on to what had been ripped from him. \u201cWe\u2019re forced to be here,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said later. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, but we\u2019re forced to be here.\u201d Advertisement He still had a shot at preserving the identity he wanted for Bayan, but he and his wife would have to be vigilant, willing to deny their daughter some of what she wanted. \u201cI will do this for her,\u201d he said. \u201cGod help us.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Abdullah Mohammad looked at images of his village near Daraa, Syria, on Google Earth as the rest of the family was making gingerbread houses. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Shifting Family Dynamics Only one thing about Canada seemed to disconcert Bayan: its types of families she had never seen or even imagined. She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. \u201cMy mom and dad, they will not do that,\u201d she declared. The Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband\u2019s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah\u2019s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children. Now she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework. Meanwhile, she found new purpose: helping lead a therapy group for Syrian women coping with trauma and displacement. Standing in front of a whiteboard, she peppered her presentations with motivational statements: \u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d \u201cWhen we work, we are helping society around us, not ourselves alone.\u201d She earned about 70 Canadian dollars for each weekly session. Being in Canada \u201copened new doors for me that I didn\u2019t even know existed,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. Continue reading the main story Photo Clockwise from left, Batoul, Bayan, Mohammad and Ahmad walking home from school. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Her husband, however, was having difficulty. In Syria, he co-owned a grocery store and two butcher shops, and had been the unquestioned head of the household. Now the sponsors were helping support his family, along with government subsidies. While his wife went to one of the therapy groups, he took care of Bayan and the younger children, and he had been helping in the kitchen. \u201cSometimes I feel weak doing these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s job.\u201d He told himself that spending more time with his children would draw them closer. Bayan had ambitions for her father: to learn to swim, to drive, to buy a car with six seats. \u201cI dream, like, all the time we have a big house and a pool,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Mohammad was nowhere near finding work that could support a family of six in an expensive city, and he felt torn about whether he should continue to study English full time or just get the best job he could. \u201cI feel lost,\u201d he had said. Because his wife\u2019s language skills were better, he sometimes was left out of conversations. (The Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, because they feared reprisals against relatives still in Syria. This article uses part of their family name.) If Syria heals, Mr. Mohammad said, he definitely wants to go back. His wife countered: \u201cMy future and my kids\u2019 future is in this country.\u201d We have been reporting on Canada's unusual welcome of Syrian refugees for nearly a year, paying frequent visits to the Mohammad family, the volunteers helping them, and other Syrians and Canadians involved in private sponsorship. Then they laughed. The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil. Mrs. Mohammad\u2019s counseling groups were filled with women whose husbands had turned bitter at the changed circumstances. Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse. The Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband\u2019s authority \u2014 before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one\u2019s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, \u201cflexibility.\u201d Even as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls\u2019 school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone. Now that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter\u2019s life. \u201cI want to try everything here,\u201d Bayan said. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan checked her application of fake blood on Halloween before she went out trick-or-treating. Credit Cole Burston for The New York Times On the day of the school trip, with her classmates off on Toronto Island in a freezing rain, the family moved on to their next cultural debate. \u201cWhat is the meaning of Halloween?\u201d Mrs. Mohammad asked. The holiday was four days away. Bayan burst with answers. It was about being frightened in a fun way, she said, dressing as skeletons and ghosts. \u201cIt has to be something scary,\u201d she explained. She wanted to wear a devil costume. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One of the sponsors had already arranged to take them trick-or-treating. But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead? Just then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family\u2019s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve. Bayan had asked Ms. McLorg to join them for the coming trick-or-treat date, but the sponsor did not realize how Mrs. Mohammad felt. Ms. McLorg was trying to introduce Canadian customs without imposing on the family\u2019s own. \u201cThey should not have to change their essence in order to become Canadian,\u201d Ms. McLorg said later. In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture. In the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess. Abdullah Mohammad headed home early; Bayan pleaded to stay later. Her mother surveyed the spiderwebs and chains lacing the street, watching her children merge into the flowing highway of trick-or-treaters. Continue reading the main story Photo Bayan studying the Quran at the school on a recent Sunday when the rest of the family were at a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Memories of Home Two weeks later, Mrs. Mohammad and her two daughters were propelled into a local Walmart by Bayan\u2019s sheer force of will. She longed for a pair of sparkly purple sneakers, and begged, nagged and nearly cried until her mother agreed. As they navigated the aisles, mother and daughters looked like members of two different families. Mrs. Mohammad wore her head scarf, neck-to-toe gown and shawl, while the girls were in leggings and skinny jeans. The question about when Bayan would start covering her head loomed over her and her parents. As they were in Canada, her mother was willing to postpone it until seventh grade. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cNo!\u201d Bayan yelled when she overheard her mother talking about it. She looked ugly with her head covered, she thought. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in grade nine \u2014 maybe,\u201d she said. But the next day, Bayan and her mother slipped inside a building a few blocks from their apartment, where the 10-year-old kicked off the brand-new sneakers and knelt. Her mother draped a thin scarf over her daughter\u2019s head, expertly folding, tucking and pinning until it covered her hair without a strand showing. Photo Eman Mohammad helped her daughter Bayan put on a head scarf before she attended the Islamic school at a local mosque. Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times This was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan\u2019s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning; that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss. Sunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head. For the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an 18-year-old whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. \u201cSometimes there are tests in life,\u201d she told the children. \u201cAnd sometimes they break us.\u201d Then she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to break things when they\u2019re all together, right?\u201d Ms. Ali asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly like us.\u201d But it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan\u2019s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at \u201cCat in the Hat\u201d level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school. Other classmates\u2019 parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is foreign-born, a reflection of Canada\u2019s openness to immigrants. In her apartment building, Bayan has friends whose families are from Israel and China.

During lunch at home, as she chatted in English, he interjected: \u201cArabic!\u201d She continued in a mix of both. When she talked about the stick exercise, her father gave a look of recognition. \u201cI was Bayan\u2019s age when they told me the same story,\u201d he said.

But Bayan and her sister could no longer agree on how many olive trees stood there: 20? 100? (Eight, their mother said.)

Far from the much-reported Macedonian teenagers running fake news factories solely for profit, Mr. Dowson made it his mission, according to messages posted on one of his sites, to \u201cspread devastating anti-Clinton, pro-Trump memes and sound bites into sections of the population too disillusioned with politics to have taken any notice of conventional campaigning.\u201d Photo An image from one of Mr. Dowson\u2019s websites. He said his mission was to \u201cspread devastating anti-Clinton, pro-Trump memes and sound bites.\u201d \u201c Together , people like us helped change the course of history,\u201d one message said, adding in another: \u201c Every single one of you who forwarded even just one of our posts on social media contributed to the stunning victory for Trump, America and God.\u201d In a recent email interview from Belgrade, where he has met with Serbian nationalists, Mr. Dowson explained how his decision to establish an American social media presence was similar to the move into European markets by Breitbart News, the conservative provocateur media operation run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cSimple truth is that after 40 years of the right having no voice because the media was owned by the enemy, we were FORCED to become incredibly good at alternative media in a way the left simply can\u2019t grasp or handle,\u201d Mr. Dowson said. \u201cBottom line is: BREXIT, TRUMP and much more to follow.\u201d While it is easy to overstate the influence of fringe elements whose overall numbers remain very small, the explosion of fake news and propaganda sites and their possible impact on the presidential election have ignited alarm across the American political spectrum. A recent study found that most people who read fabricated stories on Facebook \u2014 such as a widely circulated hoax about Pope Francis endorsing Mr. Trump \u2014 were inclined to believe them. Then there is the added element of Russian meddling. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Moscow put its thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump through the release of hacked Democratic emails, which provided fodder for many of the most pernicious false attacks on Mrs. Clinton on social media. Some of those attacks found a home on Russian websites such as the one for Katehon , a right-wing Christian think tank aligned with Mr. Putin. Katehon recirculated anti-Clinton conspiracies under headlines like \u201cBloody Hillary: 5 Mysterious Murders Linked to Clinton.\u201d Another Russian site that urged support for Mr. Trump, called \u201c Just Trump It ,\u201d is linked to the International Russian Conservative Forum, an annual gathering of far-right leaders in St. Petersburg that has featured Mr. Dowson, among others, as a speaker. The site, which seems mostly aimed at selling Trump T-shirts, was registered to an individual at a Russian company that trademarked a logo used to certify that merchandise was not made with migrant labor. Some analysts see danger signs in the nexus of Russian interests and far-right agitators in Europe and the United States. Social media can amplify even the most obscure voices, giving them a stage from which to broadcast a distorted message to credulous audiences. \u201cThese messages seep into the mainstream,\u201d said Alina Polyakova, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council , a nonpartisan international affairs institute in Washington. \u201cThey may have been extreme or fringe at one point in time, but they have been incredibly influential in shaping people\u2019s views about key geopolitical events in a very specific direction.\u201d Russia is particularly adept at playing this game, Ms. Polyakova said. \u201cMoscow specifically encourages and facilitates\u201d the spreading of propaganda through proxies, she said, as well as through events like the Russian conservative forum, which showcases views and narratives favored by the Putin government. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the inaugural forum in March 2015, Mr. Dowson praised Mr. Putin as a strong defender of traditional values, while belittling President Obama and the United States itself as \u201cfeminized men.\u201d In the email interview, Mr. Dowson said he was not supported by Russia in any way, and he accused critics of trying to tar conservatives as dupes of Moscow. Photo Mr. Dowson spoke in 2015 at the International Russian Conservative Forum, a gathering of far-right leaders in St. Petersburg. Credit Ruslan Shamukov/TASS, via Newscom \u201cI look on this rebirth of McCarthy-type anti-Russian hysteria by the LEFT as a hilarious reaction born out of the left\u2019s inability to realize THEY elected Trump, not me, not the Russians, not even the right,\u201d he said via email. A colorful if somewhat enigmatic figure in Britain \u2014 The Times of London recently described him as \u201cthe invisible man of Britain\u2019s far right\u201d \u2014 Mr. Dowson, at first blush, would not be an obvious mouthpiece for Russia. Formerly a church minister in Northern Ireland and the father of nine, he became involved in anti-abortion campaigns, joined the British National Party in the mid-2000s and, later, founded Britain First, a stridently anti-immigrant group opposed to what it called a creeping Islamic threat to traditional British values. He publicly split with the group in 2014 after some of its leaders started invading mosques and threatening Muslims, which he criticized as un-Christian and counterproductive. While involved with Britain First, Mr. Dowson made deft use of social media and websites to promote its work and convey the impression of a mass following. A British watchdog group called Hope Not Hate , which has tracked Mr. Dowson\u2019s online activities, concluded that he has \u201ca rather canny knack for building up protest groups and movements on the basis that it was your Christian duty to follow his work.\u201d Mr. Dowson claims to have reached millions of Americans across all of his online platforms in the run-up to the November presidential election, a number that could not be verified, in part, because he would not confirm all of his sites. Online visits to Patriot News did not come close to that, although when combined with several other sites that appear to be connected to Mr. Dowson, the total number edges above a million; most viewers were in Britain. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Whatever the precise numbers, there is little question that postings on the sites and Facebook pages linked to him were viewed and shared hundreds of thousands of times. Many of the postings appear to be lifted from other conspiracy websites, repackaged and launched back into the social media maelstrom. Another site that trafficked heavily in pro-Trump news was run by Knights Templar International , a militant religious group that Mr. Dowson is involved in, which has recently supported anti-immigrant militias patrolling border areas in Bulgaria and Hungary. For Mr. Dowson, such activities are in keeping with his philosophy that traditional Christian values are under siege because of feckless leadership by America and European powers. The success of Mr. Trump, he said, is the logical result of voters\u2019 rejection of the weakness of global elites.

During the 2015 conservative forum in Russia, he spoke presciently about the looming online battle for the attention of American voters. \u201cWe have the ability to take a video from today and put it in half of every single household in the United States of America, where these people can for the first time learn the truth, because their own media tell lies, they tell lies about Russia,\u201d Mr. Dowson said then. \u201cWe have to use popular culture to reach into the living rooms of the youth of America, of Britain, France, Germany, and bring them in,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we can get them the message.\u201d Follow Mike McIntire on Twitter .

China has expanded small land formations it controls in the South China Sea, piling sand onto outcroppings and building landing strips. The land reclamation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands is seen here in 2015. (Ritchie B. Tongo / Associated Press) Jessica Meyers China agreed\u00a0Saturday to return an American sea drone it had captured after the Pentagon demanded it back, defusing tensions at the end of a week of confrontations over Beijing\u2019s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. China\u2019s Defense Ministry said it would return \u201cin an appropriate manner\u201d the U.S. sea vessel seized this week by the Chinese navy. But the ministry also accused the U.S. of \u201cpublic hyping\u201d that was \u201cnot conducive to solving the problem smoothly.\u201d Chinese officials did not specify what happened or when Beijing would hand back the device. The ministry, in a statement, said that the device was unidentified when found and that officials later concluded it was an American drone. The Pentagon on Friday demanded the return of the equipment , which officials said was gathering scientific data near the Philippines when it was taken. The U.S. issued a formal protest, and the open hostility threatened to further strain relations as China expands its claims in the South China Sea and prepares for a new U.S. president whose policy on the region remains unclear. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook on Saturday affirmed China\u2019s actions, saying the U.S. came to an understanding that Beijing would return the drone \u201cthrough direct engagement.\u201d Just before both sides made their announcements, President-elect Donald Trump condemned the seizure in a tweet. \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters \u2014\u00a0rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act,\u201d he wrote, deleting an initial tweet that said \u201cunpresidented.\u201d China\u2019s statement followed a pledge this week by Adm. Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, to confront Chinese aggression in the contested waters, and a Washington think tank\u2019s publication of satellite photos that show Chinese militarization of artificial islands in the South China Sea. The standoff began Thursday when a Chinese ship snatched the unmanned vehicle off the Philippine coast, in the midst of an effort by the U.S. survey ship Bowditch to retrieve it. \u201cIt is ours,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe would like it back, and we would like this not to happen again.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss The Ghost Ship fire has brought scrutiny to warehouses and unconventional living spaces, the L.A.

(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Ending Obamacare could change how insurance works for the Trovato family, as well as an estimated 6.8 million Illinoisans and 156 million Americans who were covered through employers last year. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Lisa Schencker Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune One of the first things Tracy Trovato did \u2014 once she overcame the shock of learning her 42-year-old, marathon-training husband had leukemia \u2014 was look through their health insurance documents. She dug up one paper that said the plan would pay no more than $1 million for medical services in a lifetime. The Chicago woman and her husband, Carlo, called their insurance company in a panic. \"Our first question was, 'Can we take care of leukemia in a million dollars?'\" Tracy Trovato said. The woman on the other end of the line reassured them, telling them, \"The president took care of that, we don't have maximum caps anymore,\" Trovato recalled. \"Those were among the sweetest words,\" said Trovato, whose insurance is through her husband's employer. Obamacare and Medicaid could result in \"grave harm to our communities and the financial well-being of the state.\" The groups... More than 100 Illinois health care advocacy groups, medical providers and social service organizations are urging Gov. Bruce Rauner to tell Congress that proposed changes to Obamacare and Medicaid could result in \"grave harm to our communities and the financial well-being of the state.\" The groups... (Lisa Schencker) Now, however, that ban on lifetime limits, along with other health insurance protections, has been thrown into question with the election of Donald Trump, who's promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare. In recent weeks, much attention has focused on what repealing and replacing the law might mean for the roughly 1 million Illinois residents and nearly 20 million Americans who get health insurance through the law's exchanges or Medicaid expansion. But Obamacare is far broader than that. Scrapping the law also could change how health insurance works for 6.8 million Illinois residents and 156 million Americans who had coverage last year through employers, as estimated by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \"We view everything as being threatened right now,\" said Kathy Waligora, director of the health reform initiative of EverThrive Illinois. In addition to banning lifetime coverage caps, the Affordable Care Act lets consumers keep children on their plans until age 26; requires companies with at least 50 employees to offer coverage; and makes preventive care, such as health screenings, flu shots, breast-feeding supplies and contraception, free to those with insurance. The Trovatos Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune Carlo Trovato and his wife, Tracy, sit in the dining room with their children Paolo, 13, and Maggie, 16, before dinner Dec. 15, 2016. Carlo Tovato, once diagnosed with leukemia, has been cancer-free for about three years but the family is concerned that lifetime limits on health insurance coverage could return if Obamacare is repealed.

Carlo Tovato, once diagnosed with leukemia, has been cancer-free for about three years but the family is concerned that lifetime limits on health insurance coverage could return if Obamacare is repealed. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Obamacare also bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, though a shake-up of that requirement is more likely to affect those shopping for coverage outside of employer plans. Before Obamacare, a separate federal law generally prohibited plans offered by employers from withholding coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Republicans aren't expected to immediately repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. They don't have enough votes in the Senate to stop a filibuster over a repeal bill. Instead, many observers expect they'll pass a reconciliation bill, which will allow them to roll back some, but not all, of the law's provisions while they work on a full replacement. Experts agree some of Obamacare's requirements are likely to stay and others are likely to go. The requirement that companies with at least 50 full-time employees provide health care coverage is likely on its way out, possibly in a reconciliation bill, said Robert Moffit, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Avik Roy, who served as a health care adviser to former presidential candidate Mitt Romney and founded the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, said that requirement has led to a lot of problems, such as companies limiting their full-time hiring so as not to hit the 50-employee threshold.

    "text": "Forced to Leave, Aleppo Evacuees Tell of Their Pain By sarah el deeb, associated press BEIRUT \u0097 Dec 17, 2016, 4:46 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press This image released on Thursday, Dec. 15, 2016 by Aleppo 24, shows residents gathered near a green government bus as they hold their belongings for evacuation from eastern Aleppo, Syria. As the last holdouts leave the rebel-held enclave in Aleppo, they speak of their love for the city despite witnessing so much destruction and death. Bit by bit over three weeks, the government offensive chipped away at their last refuge. (Aleppo 24 via AP) 0 Shares Death in Aleppo was personal for Modar Sheikho. He lost his sister to government bombing early in the revolt. His brother was killed last month. And as they looked for a place to bury him, another airstrike killed his father. Still, Shekho held out in the besieged city as long as he could. When he finally was forced to evacuate Friday, he made a video bidding farewell to the city. \"We were asking for our freedom. This is what we get,\" he said against a backdrop of bombed-out buildings and thousands of people waiting for buses to take them away from Aleppo. But even in his first hours of exile, the 28-year-old nurse longed to return. \"My soul is torn out more with each step away from Aleppo,\" he whispered in an audio message to The Associated Press, not wanting to wake other evacuees in their temporary home in a village west of the ancient city. He and thousands of others held tight to their crumbling enclave despite a grueling four years of war. Bit by bit over three weeks, the government offensive chipped away at their last refuge. Their realm of destroyed buildings and crater-filled roads in eastern Aleppo shrank from 17 square miles to just one over a few weeks as forces loyal to President Bashar Assad swept through, neighborhood by neighborhood. The promise of boarding buses to safety was a relief. But for many like Sheikho, losing Aleppo was inconceivable. Of the more than half-dozen residents and activists that AP has maintained regular contact with in recent months, only one said he felt disillusioned with the rebellion. \"This revolution is one of the biggest failures in the world,\" said 21-year-old Ahmed, who has not left the enclave yet and refused to give his family name out of fear of reprisal. \"If God saves me from this, I will go to Turkey and start a new life, away from the criminal regime and the deceiving rebels.\" Most seemed haunted by the city's struggle, saying they can't let go of their dream to create a Syria without Assad. They said they will continue their anti-government activities somehow from wherever they end up. One gynecologist who had refused to leave her patients said her husband forced her to flee to a government-controlled area for safety. The woman, who identified herself only as Farida to protect her family, earlier had sent her daughter out with thousands of other evacuees. Farida said she could not stand living for even two days in the government-controlled sector and fled to the countryside, where the rebels are in control. \"Despite how hard it was under siege and bombardment, I was at peace with myself,\" she said. Farida's husband, also a doctor, followed. But she is still angry at him for forcing her to leave, adding: \"I can't continue my life with him.\" \"I can't feel any joy when my colleagues are getting slaughtered,\" she said in text messages. She hopes to be reunited one day with her daughter. Sheikho left on the first day of the evacuation, which was monitored by the Red Cross . He and thousands of other holdouts boarded green government buses with portraits of Assad in the windshield and were taken to rebel-controlled areas. \"It is very painful that I separate from my city of 28 years,\" Sheikho said. \"I hope it is quickly liberated so I can return to it.\" Besides seeing his city crumble, Sheikho watched his family shattered by more than five years of civil war. On the first day of the government's big ground offensive three weeks ago, Sheikho and his family sought a new home to avoid intense bombing. Like many others, his family was caught on the road by the bombardment, and his brother was killed on the spot. He and his father had to search for a cemetery because Aleppo was running out of burial space. In the process, his father \u2014 a prominent professor of Arabic \u2014 also was killed. Four years earlier, an airstrike killed his sister outside the hospital where she worked as a nurse. After mourning his father and brother, Sheikho had told the AP: \"We are all on the road to death. May God accept them as martyrs.\" Before he boarded the bus, he roamed the few streets of Aleppo still open to him for one last time \u2014 but he couldn't visit the graves of his relatives because the government had seized the neighborhood where they are buried. \"I hope they forgive us\" for losing Aleppo, Sheikho said. He said he plans to be reunited with his wife, who left as the fighting intensified, and also wants to see his English teachers again. Most likely, he will settle in a town on the Orontes River in Idlib province where rebels are in control. Many predict that Idlib may be the next front in a government offensive. Asked what he expected in his new life, he said: \"It is the unknown future filled with painful memories.\" 0 Shares ",

The unusual incident happened Friday morning in the city of Hudson. The Times Union of Albany reports that a caller told police there was an elderly woman \"frozen to death\" in a parked car. Officers rushed to the scene and found what appeared to be a woman sitting in a car's front passenger seat wearing an oxygen mask. A sergeant busted a rear window, opened the door and discovered that the woman was a realistic mannequin. The car owner arrived and said he uses the dummy for his job selling medical training aids. The police chief says the owner was \"incredulous\" that police broke the window to rescue the mannequin. Advertisement ",

Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio Fermin Domingo, 61, climbs up the side of a sugar cane hauler for the last time. The haul truck driver has worked at Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar (HC&S;) company for the past 40 years, harvesting and hauling sugar cane to the mill. This is the last of Hawaii's sugar mills, and it too, is closing. Domingo and hundreds of other co-workers have gathered to wrap up the final harvest and say goodbye to a crop that shaped the islands. Domingo fires up the engine and the truck slowly rumbles toward the mill, its tires churning through thick mud. It stops at the base of a conveyor belt and a giant crane hooks the final load of Maui sugar cane. Cheers break out from the hundreds of workers standing nearby. \"I came here when I was 18 from the Philippines,\" says Domingo. \"I joined the company and I started harvesting. It was fun working out there, but we're at the end and I don't know what to do later.\" Workers at the mill look on as the last piece of the final harvest drives up to the factory to be processed. Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio For over a century, the sugar industry dominated Hawaii's economy. But that changed in recent decades as the industry struggled to keep up with the mechanization in mills on mainland U.S. That and rising labor costs have caused Hawaii's sugar mills to shut down, shrinking the industry to this one last mill. Article continues after sponsorship Bill Cavilla is one of 675 workers who will lose their jobs once this operation closes by the end of the year. \"It's just an emotional thing,\" he says. \"Just realizing it's going to end.\" The sugar mill started harvesting cane on Maui 145 years ago, around the time sugarcane plantations began taking over the islands' landscapes when the Civil War cut off sugar supplies from the south. Then, in the 1870s, the U.S. signed a \"reciprocity treaty\" with the Kingdom of Hawaii. The United States agreed to cut tariffs on Hawaiian sugar and rice, in exchange for Hawaii cutting tariffs on imported cotton and other American products. The spread of sugarcane plantations on the islands brought immigrant labor in waves from China, Japan and the Philippines. A smaller number of people also came from Portugal, Puerto Rico, Scotland and Germany. That immigration laid the foundation for the multicultural population of today's Hawaii. Some of the remaining workers at the mill stand in front of the last hauler truck of Hawaiian sugar cane. Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Molly Solomon/Hawaii Public Radio \"My grandparents emigrated from Japan to work in the plantations more than 100 years ago, like so many others,\" says David Ige, Governor of Hawaii, who has briefly stopped by to attend the last harvest at HC&S;, along with some 500 other people. The company has been financially struggling for decades, reporting losses of $30 million last year. Like other sugar companies, it blames the losses on rising costs from labor and transportation to land, as well as increased competition from producers such as Brazil. The HC&S; mill is owned by Alexander & Baldwin (A&B;), a real estate and agricultural company in the state. Ige says the state supports A&B;'s plan to keep HC&S; lands in agriculture. The company currently has about 140 acres of biofuel crops in the ground, as it transitions toward diversified agriculture. A&B; also recently expanded its cattle pasturelands to 4,000 acres. Back at the mill, Howard Scott Pereira, a retired worker, has come by to say his final goodbyes. The 78-year-old brought his daughter Colleen who says the story of sugar is what brought her family to Hawai'i. \"Our families came when it was a territory to work the plantations,\" she says. \"So we had to come.\" Fields of sorghum, one of the trial crops planted by Alexander & Baldwin. The company plans to replace the sugar cane acreage with diversified agriculture and cattle pasture.

A U.S. government aid agency, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, said earlier in the week that its board deferred a vote on a renewal of the development assistance package for the Philippines \"subject to a further review of concerns around rule of law and civil liberties.\" The agency has clearly not voted to scrap or approve the aid package, but Duterte unleashed an expletives-laden tirade upon his arrival in his southern hometown of Davao after back-to-back visits to Cambodia and Singapore. \"I understand that we have been stricken out of the Millennium Challenge. Well, good, I welcome it,\" Duterte said with apparent sarcasm. \"We can survive without American money,\" he said. \"But you know, America, you might also be put to notice. Prepare to leave the Philippines, prepare for the eventual repeal or the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement,\" he said, referring to a 1998 accord that governs American forces visiting the Philippines for joint combat exercises. Speaking with reporters Friday, Duterte also told U.S. workers or troops to \u201cstart packing.\u201d \"You know, tit for tat ... if you can do this, so (can) we. It ain't a one-way traffic,\" Duterte said, adding tauntingly, \"Bye-bye America.\" The U.S. Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Philippines was a U.S. colony from 1898 until the 1940s. The island group hosted permanent U.S. military bases until the Philippine government ordered them removed 25 years ago. As many as 600 U.S. troops are currently stationed in the Philippines, and at least two major training exercises involving American and other forces are held in the country each year. As Duterte speaks, U.S. military might need to listen It's not the first time Duterte raised the specter of removing troops or killing defense pacts with longtime allies in Washington. In September, Duterte ordered out 100-plus\u00a0American special forces out of the southern Philippines, where they had been advising local troops battling Muslim extremists. All four military services have rotated training or small missions into the Philippines this year, according to the Military Times . The Army has supplied Green Berets for training and missions to counter Abu Sayyaff; The Marine Corps has rotating training missions to the Pacific Nation; The Air Force conducts joint training flights with Philippine air counterparts; The Navy has increased port visits to Manila and Subic Bay in part a response to China's aggressive operations in the South China Sea. Philippines' Duterte wants U.S. troops out in two years In November, Duterte said he wanted U.S. troops out of his country in the next two years. \"I want in the next two years, to be freed from the presence of foreign military troops. I want them out,\" Duterte told reporters\u00a0Nov.\u00a01.\u00a0\"And if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, executive agreements, I will.\" The 71-year-old Duterte, who describes himself as a left-wing politician, has made similar threats before and after taking office in June, but he and his officials have walked back on many of his public statements, causing confusion. While calling Americans \"sons of b------\" and \"hypocrites,\" Duterte praised China as having \"the kindest soul of all\" for offering what he said was significant financial assistance. \"So, what do I need America for?\" he asked. He also said Russia can be a very important ally. \"They do not insult people, they do not interfere,\" he said. Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. also criticized the U.S. aid decision, saying it happened after Duterte declared he would chart a foreign policy course independent of Washington. God told me to stop cursing, Philippine leader says The Philippines had been slated for another aid package after its previous five-year, $434 million poverty reduction program was successfully completed in May under Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III. The agency's spokeswoman, Laura Allen, said Thursday that it would continue to monitor events in the Philippines before the next board review in March 2017. The U.S. decision is among the first signs of how concerns about the rule of law and human rights under Duterte could entail economic costs. The U.S. government, along with European Union and U.N. officials, has raised concerns about Duterte's crackdown on illegal drugs, which has left more than 2,000 suspected drug users and dealers dead in purported gunbattles with police. More than 3,000 other deaths are being investigated to determine if they were linked to illegal drugs. Philippine President Duterte says he killed criminals: reports In his news conference, Duterte was pointedly asked how many crime suspects he has killed in the past when he was still a crime-busting city mayor amid his vague and contradicting accounts of his exploits. The former government prosecutor again gave contrasting replies. \"Maybe one, two three ... I'm saying, maybe my bullets hit them, maybe not, but after the burumbumbumbum, they're all dead,\" Duterte said. Replying to another question, he said that he indeed has killed, but did not provide details and tried to justify his act. \"When I tell you now that I killed, do not term them as suspects because all of them died while they were fighting government people.\" He asked God for forgiveness in advance, saying he may not have time to pray if he's assassinated. \"God, forgive me for killing these idiots,\" Duterte said, then blamed God for the presence of criminals. \"You create a human monster so if you are God, why do you have to create these idiots? That's why they die.\" Duterte, who has had a difficult relationship with President Obama, said he would change his mindset if President-elect Donald Trump appeals to him. \"I have talked to Trump, he was very nice, very courteous,\" he said. \"I could not sense any hostile drift, or even the manner he was saying it, so, in deference, I'll just wait.\" Philippine President Duterte: I can be friend to Trump \"I will let Obama fade away and if he disappears, then I will begin to reassess,\" Duterte said, adding that he and Trump acknowledged each other's similarly brash manners. \"We talk in the same language,\" Duterte said. He recalled that when he told Trump in a recent phone call that \"I like your mouth, it's like mine,\" he said Trump responded by saying, \"Yes, Mr. President, we're similar.\" \"And you know, people with the same feather flock together,\" Duterte said. Despite the latest sharp words about the U.S. from Duterte, the\u00a0Trump administration could re-establish the partnership without sacrificing America's core values, said\u00a0Patrick Cronin, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \"The Philippines and the United States have long, multi-layered relationship between our two societies, and Manila and Washington share a great deal of interests with respect to maintaining regional order,\" Cronin told USA TODAY.

    "text": "By Dan Balz December 17 at 12:02 PM Follow @danbalz Presidents often are tested early, by unexpected crises or provocations by foreign adversaries. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first test has come even before he is sworn in, and so far, he has responded with denial, equivocation and deflection. The test has come over Russia\u2019s brazen intrusion into the U.S. election process through its hacking of the servers at the Democratic National Committee and the email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. Contrary to what Trump said this week, the Russian intrusion was known long before the election. The Washington Post\u2019s Ellen Nakashima reported in June that the Russians had penetrated the DNC network. Then on Oct. 7, intelligence officials publicly stated that the hacking had occurred, that the Russians were behind it and that \u201conly Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d That was an obvious reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump may have missed the October announcement. He was preoccupied with the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video, which The Post had released the same afternoon. At the time, the video captured most of the media attention. It seemed to present a dire threat to Trump\u2019s chances of winning the election. Trump weathered that storm and is a month away from being sworn in as president. Now he has a bigger problem awaiting him when he takes office, one he seems resistant to addressing. In the past week, intelligence officials have added to their findings, concluding that the motivation behind Russia\u2019s hacking was to help Trump win. (Reuters) The findings about Russian interference and the motive behind their actions will not change the outcome of the election. On Monday, the electoral college\u2019s electors will cast their votes in the states, and no doubt Trump will have his comfortable majority secured. Throughout the campaign, Trump described his philosophy as one of \u201cAmerica first.\u201d He drew an enthusiastic response from his supporters for signaling that he would refocus U.S. foreign policy, away from the course pursued for the past eight years by President Obama and seemingly abandoning a broader consensus that has guided presidents of both parties for decades. But if standing up to Russian attempts to interfere with American democracy isn\u2019t a foundational principle of an \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy, what is? Trump\u2019s response has suggested a different focus and different philosophy, one that might be described as \u201cTrump first,\u201d rather than \u201cAmerica first.\u201d His instincts appear to be aimed at shielding himself. [ Intelligence agencies agree that Russians aimed to help Trump ] The hacking has become the elephant in the room since the election. It is a significant national security threat that Trump will have to deal with and also a roiling political debate that has threatened to complicate the transfer of power. Trump\u2019s posture toward Putin and to the hacking long has puzzled and alarmed current and former government officials who have experience in these areas. His friendly attitude toward Putin is contrary to the views of officials in both parties about the man behind Russian aggression in various parts of the world. His invitation to Russia to try to hack Clinton\u2019s emails, issued last summer during the Democratic National Convention, was inexcusable, even if in jest. He has long resisted embracing the evidence that the Russians were behind the hacking. He said it could have been done by other countries or by \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201d (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) When it was reported about a week ago that the CIA had concluded that the Russians were trying to help him win the election, he responded with a tweet slamming the intelligence community for claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq War. The CIA was tragically wrong in that case, but was it necessary for the incoming president to publicly rebuke and provoke the agency? All of this has put Trump at odds with the intelligence community he will soon oversee as commander in chief. That should be as worrisome to the incoming president as it is to the intelligence professionals. It has also put him at odds with many Republicans in Congress who are joining Democrats in their call for a thorough investigation and who already question whether Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chief executive nominated by Trump to become secretary of state, is too friendly toward Putin. Meanwhile, the political implications of the hacking have added to the raw emotions left behind by an election outcome that surprised people in both parties. Clinton is on record as believing that the combination of the Russian hacking and especially the interference of FBI Director James B. Comey over her emails cost her the election. [ Obama says partisan divisions make U.S. vulnerable to propaganda ] Caught in the middle is Obama, who is obviously loyal to Clinton and disappointed that Trump will be his successor. During his Friday news conference, he skirted some direct questions, showing the degree to which he is trying to maintain a working relationship with Trump during the transition while still trying to highlight the findings of the intelligence community. As he put it, \u201cnot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.\u201d Since the election, Trump has rejected what would seem to be the obvious course to follow in light of the conclusions of the intelligence community. The simpler reaction would have been to respond the way many in Congress did, which was to express outrage at the interference and call for an investigation to examine exactly how the cyberintrusion happened and how similar activities can be prevented in the future. Instead, he has continued to question the intelligence community and to suggest partisan motivations of those who accept the findings. Perhaps his fear is that the more legitimacy is given to the conclusions that the Russians were motivated by their desire to help him or hurt Clinton, the less his victory will be seen as legitimate. Or perhaps all of his tweets and statements are a prelude to Monday\u2019s electoral college vote, after which he will feel freer to reverse course and join others in calling for a congressional investigation to go along with the review and report ordered by Obama. In recent days, some of his advisers appeared to be preparing for that kind of shift. But the American people \u2014 and Trump advisers \u2014 have learned that no one safely speaks for Trump other than Trump himself. And they have learned how difficult it is for Trump to admit error. On top of all this is the president-elect\u2019s apparent lack of interest in receiving daily intelligence briefings, a standard procedure for presidents. That raises questions about how he plans to conduct foreign policy. Will he seek all available evidence as he weighs decisions? Who will he listen to and trust?

Jayme Deerwester , USA TODAY 5:42 p.m. EST December 17, 2016 x Share The 39-year-old rapper was all smiles on Friday night as he attended the private opening of Rick Owens: Furniture at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles Time Kanye West appeared upbeat as he put in an appearance at an L.A. furniture exhibit Friday. (Photo: Rachel Murray, Getty Images for MOCA) Kanye West sightings are once again becoming a frequent occurrence. Just three days after his much-discussed meeting with President-elect Donald Trump , the rapper turned up Friday night at West Hollywood's MOCA Pacific Design Center for the opening of an exhibit by Paris-based furniture designer Rick Owens. West, 39, had made his first public appearance since his hospitalization on Dec. 8 when he visited Owens and wife Michele Lamy as they put the finishing touches on the show. The past two weeks have also produced\u00a0 reports that West is already back at work in the\u00a0studio , collaborating with Pete Rock on an album he's dubbed Turbo Grafx 16. But is it too much, too soon, for a person who is only two weeks removed from a hospitalization for\u00a0 exhaustion \u00a0and sleep deprivation? Kanye West resurfaces as a blond after hospitalization Vibe's\u00a0 Michael Saponara \u00a0argued pain is good for Kanye's art, writing, \"In my opinion, \u2018Ye has done some of his best work after his lowest points in life. Just re-listen to\u00a0Through The Wire\u00a0and\u00a0808s And Heartbreak.\" Dr. Jenn Mann,\u00a0a Los Angeles-based marriage and family therapist and the author of The Relationship Fix: Dr. Jenn's 6-Step Guide to Improving Communication, Connection & Intimacy , agrees \u2014 to a point. \u201cIt\u2019s important that creative people have creative outlets,\" she notes. But more importantly, \"he needs to get proper care, get stabilized and have the support of his wife and family. Being near them is good for him. (Wife) Kim (Kardashian) seems like a very stabilizing force. And I always think it\u2019s best to have your regular doctors seeing you face-to-face on a regular basis after you have that kind of breakdown.\u201d Posted!

Trump Tower received a special visitor Tuesday morning, unlike the politicians and businessmen that have been arriving during the presidential transition, when Kanye West stopped by to meet with President-elect Trump.\u00a0 TIMOTHY A. CLARY, AFP/Getty Images West arrived at the NYC building with an entourage around 9:30 a.m. ET.\u00a0 JOHN TAGGART / BLOOMBERG / POOL, EPA West re-emerged with Trump about 30 minutes after he arrived.\u00a0 TIMOTHY A. CLARY, AFP/Getty Images The rapper refused to answer reporters' questions, saying,\"I just want to take a picture right now.\"\u00a0 JOHN TAGGART / BLOOMBERG / POOL, EPA Trump did speak to reporters, saying he and West discussed \"life,\" and called the rapper a friend and a \"good man.\"\u00a0 Seth Wenig, AP West declared publicly last month that, though he didn't vote in the election, he would have voted for Trump.\u00a0 Drew Angerer, Getty Images He's not the first celebrity to pay Trump Tower a visit. Leonardo DiCaprio had a meeting with the President-elect Dec. 8.\u00a0\u00a0 TIMOTHY A. CLARY, AFP/Getty Images Like this topic?

But I also do understand that when you sign a contract, breaking that contract is also stress-inducing so it\u2019s about finding a balance.\u201d Kanye West's revolutionary floating stage has been in storage since he canceled his Saint Pablo tour in November. \u00a0(Photo: Kevin Mazur, Getty Images) In an interview earlier this year with Britain's\u00a0 Guardian , electronic music veteran Moby, 51,\u00a0cataloged the negative mental-health effects of life on the road:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never gone on a tour and not experienced anxiety,\u00a0depression\u00a0and insomnia.\u00a0In the early days, it seemed like a small price to pay. But at this point in my life, I can\u2019t in good conscious punish myself and my body and my mental health out of obligation to go on tour.\u201d The emotional high of performing and the subsequent come-down can bring on what is known as post-performance depression , a condition that Utah therapist John C. Buckner \u00a0 says can be aggravated when artists don't take proper care of themselves. \"Just as 2-year-olds are more likely to have temper tantrums when they are hungry or sleepy, musicians and athletes are more likely to be emotionally vulnerable if their basic needs have not been cared for,\" he wrote in a 2013 article for the music journal Percussive Notes . \"Balancing out sleep, healthy eating, etc., will allow you to have more emotional control, thus allowing more control over the emotional swings of PPD.\" Plus, Mann cautions, \"Jumping back on tour too fast or being too busy recording or taking business and social meetings can really take your eye off your focus, which needs to be your recovery and your well-being. And when you take your eye off that ball, a lot of the time, you drop it and it can cause bigger problems.\u201d Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Ye, Yeezy, Yeezus \u2014whatever you call him, Kanye West's evolution has been a defining story in entertainment for the last decade. Retrace Kanye's evolution from Chi-town producer to pop culture behemoth.\u00a0 Matt Sayles, AP Fullscreen Before Yeezy, there was 'Louis Vuitton Don.' Yes, that's what he called himself. Sporting high-fashion backpacks in 2002, this was the era Kanye made his mark in mainstream music, receiving album of the year honors from 'Rolling Stone' for his debut, 'The College Dropout.'\u00a0 Nabil Elderkin, Nabil Photography In 2005, we were all jamming out to 'Gold Digger' and don't think he didn't know it. He won three Grammys that year, in addition to occupying the top of the 'Billboard' Top 100 list for 10 weeks straight.\u00a0 DAN MACMEDAN, USA TODAY Kanye's music was so hot, he needed shades to shield himself from all that fire. 'Stronger' was born from Kanye's collaboration with Daft Punk during a time when he experimented with electronic beats, not to mention those iconic shutter shades.\u00a0 Kevin Winter, Getty Images After losing his mom and spitting with fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer, Kanye poured his heart out in melodic rap style. With Auto-Tuned rhymes, he bared his soul in chart-topping songs like 'Heartless' and 'Love Lockdown.'\u00a0 Kevin Winter, Getty Images Fullscreen We'll never forget that time he stole the mic from T-swift during the 2009 VMAs. Haters will hate, but after the release of 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' in 2010, Kanye's message was pretty clear: He is not afraid to steal the spotlight \u2014 and voice his opinions, too.\u00a0 Jason DeCrow, AP Dabbling in style, design and fashion, Kanye showed off more than his vocal chords in 2011 when he debuted his 'dw' line at Paris Fashion Week.\u00a0 Pascal Le Segretain, Getty Images Kanye raps, \u201cI fell in love with Kim\" on 'Cruel Summer,' a 2012 compilation album. This time also marked the beginning of his much-talked-about romance with the most famous Kardashian.\u00a0 Eric Ryan, Getty Images Kanye earned a new nickname with the release of his sixth album, 'Yeezus,' in 2013. Even though record sales weren't so hot at first, it  marked Kanye's seventh platinum record.\u00a0 13thWitness, Getty Images for Samsung After welcoming his first child, daughter North, in June 2013, 2014 was all about firming up Kanye's home life. He and Kim tied the knot May 14 in Florence, Italy.\u00a0 E! News Fullscreen 'Kimye,' as the couple have long been called, aren't the kind of parents to shield their kids from the spotlight. Daughter North has been a frequent fixture with her parents at fashion shows and features in their social media accounts. Son Saint, born in December 2015, has yet to make his public debut.\u00a0 Craig Barritt, Getty Images 2016 was a tumultuous year for the rapper. It started out on a high note with the release of a much-anticipated new album, 'The Life of Pablo' and a new fashion collection, both of which debuted in February.\u00a0 Jeff Kravitz/MTV1415, FilmMagic Fall 2016 saw him embark on an eye-popping concert tour featuring a groundbreaking floating stage.\u00a0 Kevin Winter, Getty Images But on Oct. 3, Kanye had to leave a New York music festival mid-show after learning wife Kim Kardashian had been robbed in Paris.\u00a0 Josiah Kamau, BuzzFoto via Getty Images In mid-November, he drew ire when he told an audience in San Jose, Calif., that he didn't vote, but if he had, he would have chosen Donald Trump.\u00a0 Chris Pizzello, AP Fullscreen Days later, he went on a rant about Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. Seeming to realize that his fans weren't taking to his words, West added, \"I been sent here to give y'all my truth, even at the risk of my own life, my own success, my own career.\"\u00a0 Scott Dudelson On Nov. 21, he abruptly canceled the remainder of his tour and reportedly sought treatment for exhaustion at UCLA Medical Center.\u00a0 Christopher Polk, Getty Images Like this topic?

Rowe Price. Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY staff (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) You just pretty much needed to own stocks in 2016 to make money.\u00a0Don't expect such an easy time in 2017 as the market braces for changes that could shake things up. Practically anything with a ticker symbol\u00a0rose in 2016. It\u00a0was just a matter of by how much. With a little more than two weeks before the New Year, owning the Standard & Poor's 500 index has delivered investors an 11.1% gain. Holding small companies has been even better, with the Russell 2000 index up 21%. But the days of easy stock gains are over as the market prepares for big changes, according to experts tapped in the 2017 USA TODAY Investment Roundtable.\u00a0Higher\u00a0interest rates, massive investments moving to corporate cloud computing and important\u00a0bets on new forms of transportation and advanced manufacturing are just a few of the important shifts investors need to be prepared for.\u00a0That's why our gurus think investors will find the best success with the following playbook and they name names. Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager T. Rowe Price U.S. Large-Cap Core Fund\u00a0 Jeff Rottinghaus, Portfolio Manager, T, Rowe Price Large Cap Core Fund, T. Rowe Price. Investment Roundtable Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY staff \u00a0(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) * AutoZone, AZO: Thursday's close $795.57. Sells automotive replacement parts from more than 5,000 stores in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. Why he likes it: AutoZone has steadily increased\u00a0its earnings per share and sales at stores open at least a year\u00a0and has also been buying back stock. AutoZone is trading for 14 times expected earnings in 2018, making it an attractive relative value especially if tax rates come down. The company also has limited competition as it's the \"industry that's largely consolidated amongst two big guys\" including Advance Auto Parts (AAP). Share Stock to Watch in \u201917: Amazon.com * Amazon, AMZN: Thursday's close $761. The USA's biggest online retailer also has a fast-growing business of selling computer capabilities to other companies. Why he likes it: While it might seem Amazon has a firm grip on online shopping, T. Rowe Price estimates that\u00a0it only has a 3% share\u00a0of the entire future e-commerce market. A big piece of growth comes from its Amazon Web Services business, where Amazon rents out computing capability to other companies for a fee. This could be a dramatically larger opportunity as more businesses shift their technology\u00a0to the cloud. \"Talk about disruption, this is a disruptive company going after two of the largest end market opportunities that we see,\" namely online retail and cloud services, he says. * JP Morgan Chase, JPM: Thursday's close $86. The most valuable U.S. bank by market value with community banking, investment banking and asset management operations. Why he likes it: The management team continues to show an ability to boost returns. That strong management could be even more successful if there are benefits for financial firms\u00a0in terms of tax reform or lower regulation. Specifically, any new regulation that lowers the amount of capital banks must keep could boost profitability.\u00a0\"It's the highest quality bank in the market,\" he says. * Visa, V: Thursday's close $79.50. Visa is a global leader in payment systems and it gives\u00a0merchants the ability to be paid online or in physical locations. Why he likes it: Visa is a classic example of a \"secular growth\" stock, in other words, a company that could benefit no matter what happens with the global economy. Only 20% of global payments are electronic, a percentage that will increase as more consumers turn away from the inconveniences of cash. Growth will only continue in 2017 as Visa integrates its acquisition of Visa's European operations. \"There's a lot of room to run here,\" he says. * American Tower, AMT. Thursday's close $106.06. A real-estate investment trust that focuses on leasing communication locations to wireless service providers. Why he likes it: The company has long-term contracts with wireless telecom companies, which offers stable returns. The company has been steadily increasing its cash flow and benefits from its corporate structure from a tax perspective. The company's dividend has increased by 20% a year. Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer of international and global equities at Ariel Investments Rupal Bhansali, Chief Investment Officer, International and Global Equities, Ariel Investments. Investment Roundtable  --    Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY staff \u00a0(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) * Gilead Sciences, GILD. Thursday's close $75.55. A biotechnology company working on treatments and cures for a variety of diseases ranging from liver malfunctions to HIV and hepatitis. Why she likes it: \u00a0The stock is \"dirt cheap\" as it has\u00a0been sold off, she says. The company generates \"ridiculous amounts\" of\u00a0cash flow, so much so it could buy back the entire company in five years at the current rate. The company's big promise is that it's not just working on drugs to improve conditions, but rather, to cure them. Justifying a high drug price is easier when\u00a0selling a cure. \u00a0\"Companies that create value will be able to charge for that. And they are curing a disease. That's the Holy Grail of medicine,\" she says. Share Stock to Watch in \u201917: Gilead Sciences USA TODAY * Nokia (ADR), NOK. Thursday's close $4.72. A seller of wireless networking infrastructure equipment and mobile Internet gear. Why she likes it: Growing demand for mobile data is a boon for Nokia, which is one of the biggest left of a \"handful\" of players that have largely merged with each other. While there is a \"lull\" in investment in mobile data infrastructure technology, since there was a big wave of investment already, demand will increase as mobile workers and consumers demand access to information from anywhere. The stock has fallen this year, but \"if you are patient, as we are, you can look forward to the next wave that will ensue inevitably,\" she says. * China Mobile (ADR): CHL. Thursday's close $52.78. \u00a0A leading provider of mobile telecom services in mainland China and Hong Kong. Why she likes it: China Mobile is already larger than Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile combined. It has 66% market share in China with 800 million subscribers. Currently, customers in China are only paying about $10 a month for telecom services, versus $60 in the U.S. Expect Chinese consumers to demand faster speeds and more data, which will likely boost the amount they're willing to pay. Chinese consumers are still shifting to smartphones which will increase demands for data telecom services. \"In China, you're still migrating towards smartphone penetration. So that's another opportunity,\" she says. * Telefonica Deutschland: DB:O2D. Thursday's close 3.98. A telecommunication service in Germany that offers wireless and hardwired communications services to consumers and businesses. Why she likes it: European regulators have been more permissive about mergers in the industry, which is a potential win for this major company. In the U.S., there are four major wireless carriers for a population roughly equal to Europe. Yet, in Europe, each country has three of four telecom players. \"It is a market that is crying for market consolidation,\" she says. With fewer companies, prices for telecom services should rise. Currently, consumers can get a decent wireless plan for 5 euros, which could rise if there are fewer competitors and consumers use wireless more. * GlaxoSmithKline (ADR): GSK. Thursday's close $38.12. A U.K.-based maker of medical treatments including vaccines and anti-viral products. Why she likes it: This is a health care company that has both a solid dividend yield (5%) but also growth opportunities. The company is finding its footing with new drugs that are \"trending well\" in the market. New management in the unit of the company that manages consumer products such as Tums, Flonase and Sensodyne has been successful. Currently, the company only keeps 10 cents on the dollar after paying operating costs, but that could increase to 15 cents to \u00a020 cents. Gavin Baker, portfolio manager at Fidelity OTC Fund Gavin Baker, Portfolio Manager, Fidelity OTC Fund, Fidelity Investments.  Investment Roundtable  --    Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY staff \u00a0(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) * Alphabet: GOOGL. Thursday's close $815.65. A leading online advertising company with interests in mobile technology, cloud software and the Google search engine. Why he likes it: \u00a0The company's large database on consumer behavior used for online advertising paired with viewing consumption on YouTube and its mobile technology allow it to be a winner in the artificial intelligence era. The company's hand with the Android mobile operating system also puts it in a position of strength. \"If anyone is going to bring us the Star Trek computer which can answer any question or do any task ... I think it's Google,\" he says. * Activision Blizzard:\u00a0ATVI. Thursday's close $36.99. A top publisher of video games for computers, video game consoles and mobile including titles like Candy Crush Saga and Call of Duty. Why he likes it: Video-game companies are winning as technology used in gaming devices continues to improve. Video game companies' ability to sell directly to consumers with app stores and downloads - rather through physical retailers - boosts profitability and allows them to sell add-on features over time to extend the lure of the game. Electronic sports competitions draw many gamers and customers who want to watch the professionals play. Games like \"Call of Duty, Overwatch and Battlefield are the new NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball,\" he says. Call of Duty and Overwatch are both published by Activision, while Battlefield is owned by Electronic Arts. * Ubisoft Entertainment: ENXTPA: UBI. Thursday's close 32.29. French video game publisher of titles ranging from Far Cry to Assassin's Creed. Why he likes it: The company has been trying to launch more titles to get beyond its biggest sellers and has introduced new properties like Watchdogs and The Division. \"They've suffered from introducing all these new franchises. Now they're moving into a phase where they're very focused on digital,\" he says. * Chipotle Mexican Grill: CMG. Thursday's close $382.85. A fast-casual Mexican food chain operating more than 2,000 locations. Why he likes it: The company's stock and customer traffic have taken a hit following food safety scares. But those concerns will pass, as has been the case with other restaurants. \"Lots of restaurants all over the world have been through food safety scares, and there's a very predictable pattern for how they ... recover,\" he says. Adjusted for stock buybacks, the company's peak profit was $21 a share in the 12 months ended in the third quarter of 2015. Now the company is earning about $3 a share annually. Profits are hurt by investments in food safety and lower customer visits. But Baker is looking for better digital marketing and mobile payments to boost results. ",

    "text": "Email The Pentagon says China has agreed to return a U.S. Navy underwater drone that had been seized in international waters in the South China Sea. The incident had sparked a diplomatic protest from the United States demanding the return of the drone, which is used for oceanographic research. \"We have registered our objection to China's unlawful seizure of a U.S. unmanned underwater vehicle operating in international waters in the South China Sea,\" said Peter Cook , the Pentagon press secretary, in a statement released Saturday. \"Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the UUV to the United States.\" No details were provided on how the drone would be returned to U.S. control. Earlier Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry had said the U.S. and China were using military channels to appropriately handle the seizure of the drone. US Demands Return of Seized Drone by Chinese Navy in South China Sea The drone was seized Thursday 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines by the crew of a Chinese naval vessel that had been shadowing the USNS Bowditch, a U.S Navy oceanographic vessel. The crew had been conducting research in the area. The American ship was in the process of recovering one of two unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) known as an \"Ocean Glider.\" The UUV was \"gathering military oceanographic data such as salinity, water temperature and sound speed ... in accordance with international law,\" Cook said Friday. A small boat launched from the Chinese Navy warship and retrieved the other drone from the water and brought it to the Chinese vessel. The American crew contacted the Chinese vessel by radio multiple times, demanding the return of the drone. The demands were ignored, the Pentagon said. The only response the Chinese vessel gave was \"we are returning to normal operations\" as it pulled away from the Bowditch, according to the Pentagon. \"The UUV is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States,\" Cook said Friday. \"We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law.\" A U.S. defense official said there was no indication as to why the Chinese would want to pick up an unclassified drone used for ocean research. The South China Sea has become an international focal point for China, the United States and other countries in the region. China has claimed seven reefs in the Spratly Island chain as its own, essentially dredging them into islands. There are also territorial claims over the Paracel Islands located east of Vietnam and the Scarborough Shoal, 200 miles west of the Philippines. New satellite imagery released publicly by a Washington think-tank this week seems to indicate that China has begun placing \"significant\" military defenses on the artificial islands it has built up in the Spratly Islands. 0 Shares ",

LOUIS \u0097 Dec 17, 2016, 10:30 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this photo made Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, firefighters and medics try to help a man onto a stretcher after he was found semiconscious on the ground in St. Louis. The man is believed to be one of several hundred who have become ill recently in St. Louis after possibly using a latest version of synthetic marijuana, a man-made hallucinogen that experts believe is far more dangerous and unpredictable than the real thing. (David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) 0 Shares Email The nation's homeless are proving to be especially susceptible to a new, dirt-cheap version of synthetic marijuana , which leaves users glassy-eyed, aimless, sprawled on streets and sidewalks oblivious to their surroundings or wandering into traffic. Nearly 300 homeless people became ill last month in St. Louis due to the man-made hallucinogen that experts believe is far more dangerous and unpredictable than the real thing. Other outbreaks have occurred in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. \"It was common for us to see reactions where they were violent, incoherent, sometimes catatonic on the ground,\" Austin police Lt. Kurt Thomas said. The homeless are easy targets in a confined area, experts say. The drug is cheap \u2014 as little as $1 or $2 for a joint \u2014 more difficult to detect in drug tests and is a fast escape from a harsh reality. Things got so bad in St. Louis last month that the region's largest provider of homeless services urged people to stop giving the homeless handouts, because they were worried the money would be used to buy the drug. The Rev. Larry Rice saw the odd behaviors from several homeless people in the streets outside his New Life Evangelistic Center shelter in downtown St. Louis. \"They told me, 'You get so low, you get such a sense of hopelessness. Somebody wants to sell this for a dollar and you take it,'\" Rice said. \"People are desperate out there.\" Synthetic marijuana has been around since the late 2000s, packaged under names like K2, Darkness and Mr. Happy. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is usually a mixture of herbs and spices sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana. It is typically manufactured in China and sold in places like head shops, but it's also on the street and over the internet. State legislatures have outlawed it based on its chemical makeup, but the makers tweak the formula enough that it escapes the provisions of the law. So far in St. Louis, only one charge has been filed \u2014 a homeless man accused of selling to others on the street. \"You factor in some of the despair or difficult circumstances that these folks are going through, and they often fall prey to the suppliers offering an outlet to deal with their unfortunate situation,\" Thomas said. The medical dangers are real with synthetic marijuana, which can be up to 100 times more potent than real marijuana, said Dr. Anthony Scalzo, director of toxicology for the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. Users often experience rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure , anxiety and hallucinations, he said. Research published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 20 deaths from August 2011 through April 2015 were blamed on synthetic marijuana, though that doesn't account for overdose deaths of undetermined or multiple causes. Scalzo said those who survive can suffer permanent kidney failure and brain damage. \"We have no idea how the body is going to react to the next wave of chemicals,\" Scalzo said. \"It's like Russian roulette. You just don't know what you're getting.\" During one outbreak in Brooklyn in July, 130 people were hospitalized. Witnesses said many of users were shaking or leaning aimlessly against trees and fire hydrants. In emergency room interviews, users said they would prefer to smoke real marijuana but took the synthetic drug to avoid detection in urine tests typically mandated for probation and parole issues and other reasons, according to Michelle Nolan of the New York City Health Department . \"For individuals still using a psychoactive substance, this afforded them, criminally speaking, fewer risks,\" Nolan said. The Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles saw the scourge over a few days in August, when 36 people were treated for overdoses. Some had seizures, others staggered through traffic or collapsed on curbs. Around 150 homeless people have overdosed on synthetic marijuana since August in Austin, and one death was blamed on the drug, Thomas said. Police and homeless advocates in Austin are warning those on the street to avoid the temptation to use, but know it's an uphill battle. \"Being realistic, we're always going to have a group of folks who are willing to engage in self-destructive behavior,\" Thomas said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The idea of exposing Mr. Putin\u2019s links to oligarchs was set aside after some aides argued that it would not come as a shock to Russians. Still, there are proposals to cut off leaders in Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle from their hidden bank accounts in Europe and Asia. There is an option to use sanctions under a year-old executive order to ban international travel for senior officials in the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence unit that American spy agencies say stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, then doled them out to WikiLeaks, betting that media outlets eager for insider details would amplify them, doing the Kremlin\u2019s work for it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Security Agency and its military cousin, the United States Cyber Command, which is responsible for computer-network warfare, have worked up other ideas, officials said, though some have been rejected by the Pentagon. Those plans could deploy the world-class arsenal of cyberweapons assembled at a cost of billions of dollars during Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure to expose or neutralize some of the hacking tools favored by Russia\u2019s spies \u2014 the digital equivalent of a pre-emptive strike. But the selection of targets by Americans and the accuracy of that retaliation could also expose software \u201cimplants\u201d that the United States has patiently inserted and nurtured in Russian networks, in case of future cyberconflicts. And the revelation in August about some of the N.S.A.\u2019s own tools for breaking into foreign computer networks has raised the possibility that the Russians are already inside American networks and are sending a warning that they can respond in kind. All of this has led Mr. Obama to ask how the Russians might escalate the confrontation, and whether the United States in the end may have more to lose than Russia. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have great options,\u201d said Michael D. McFaul, formerly one of Mr. Obama\u2019s top national security aides and then his ambassador to Moscow. Photo Mr. Obama has been cautious in weighing a response to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. Credit Pool photo by Alexei Druzhinin Mr. Obama is the president who, in his first year in office, reached for some of the most sophisticated cyberweapons on earth to blow up parts of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. Now, at the end of his presidency, he has run headlong into a different challenge in the cyberwarfare arena. The president has reached two conclusions, senior officials report: The only thing worse than not using a weapon is using it ineffectively. And if he does choose to retaliate, he has insisted on maintaining what is known as \u201cescalation dominance,\u201d the ability to ensure you can end a conflict on your terms. Mr. Obama hinted as much at his news conference on Friday, as he was set to leave for his annual Hawaii vacation, his last as president. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cOur goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is also important to us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it, we will do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will.\u201d He rejected calls for a big, symbolic show of power, dismissing the idea that if the United States \u201cthumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians.\u201d The goal, Mr. Obama said, was to come up with a response \u201cthat increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future but does not create problems for us.\u201d There is not much new in tampering with elections, except for the technical sophistication of the tools. For all the outrage voiced by Democrats and Republicans in the past week about the Russian action \u2014 with the notable exception of Mr. Trump, who has dismissed the intelligence findings as politically motivated \u2014 it is worth remembering that trying to manipulate elections is a well-honed American art form. The C.I.A. got its start trying to influence the outcome of Italy\u2019s elections in 1948, as the author Tim Weiner documented in his book \u201c Legacy of Ashes ,\u201d in an effort to keep Communists from taking power. Five years later, the C.I.A. engineered a coup against Mohammad Mossadegh, Iran\u2019s democratically elected leader, when the United States and Britain installed the Shah. \u201cThe military coup that overthrew Mosaddeq and his National Front cabinet was carried out under CIA direction as an act of U.S. foreign policy , conceived and approved at the highest levels of government,\u201d the agency concluded in one of its own reports, declassified around the 60th anniversary of those events, which were engineered in large part by Kermit Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt. There were similar interferences over the years in Guatemala, Chile and even in Japan, hailed as a model of post- World War II democracy, where the Liberal Democratic Party owes its early grip on power in the 1950s and 1960s to millions of dollars in covert C.I.A. support. The only differences this year are that the effort was directed at the United States, and that it was cyberenabled, giving Moscow a tool to amplify its efforts through the echo chamber of social media and news organizations that quoted from the leaked emails. \u201cWhat has changed is that this was using cyberspace for advancing a political objective,\u201d said Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., who served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until he retired last year. Cybertechniques, he said, have amplified an old form of \u201cpolitical warfare, and the issue is not whether it successfully influenced the election \u2014 but the fact that they did it.\u201d The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Over the past few months, an administration that prided itself on its work on cyberoffense and cyberdefense has learned a hard lesson: When it came to the 2016 election, an economically failing Russia, dismissed by Mr. Obama on Friday for its inability to grow or to innovate, exploited giant holes in the American system. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama conceded that he first heard about the attack on the Democratic National Committee \u201cearly last summer,\u201d or nine months after the F.B.I. first alerted low-level D.N.C. officials about what had happened. That now appears to be critical lost time. If Mr. Obama had confronted the Russians immediately, in public or in the kind of private warning he said he delivered to Mr. Putin only three months ago during a meeting in China, the United States might have derailed the hacking campaign before it harvested and revealed thousands of emails. But the election hacking also raised questions about whether the American fixation on a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a devastating attack on the power grid, cellphone network, financial system or computer-controlled gas pipelines \u2014 overlooked a more obvious vulnerability. As a detailed account in The New York Times last Wednesday revealed, the D.N.C. had virtually no protections for its electronic systems, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, had failed to sign up for the \u201ctwo-factor authentication\u201d on his Gmail account. Doing so probably would have foiled what Mr. Obama called a fairly primitive attack. Now the question facing Mr. Obama is how public a retaliation to execute. The president laid out a case on Friday for acting with subtlety, so as not to start a tit-for-tat conflict. But as Joseph Nye, a strategist on so-called soft power, noted on Friday, \u201cThe reason to make some of this public is not just to deter the Russians, it is to deter others as well,\u201d in future elections. It is possible, said Mr. McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that Mr. Obama\u2019s most lasting contribution may be to get the details of the Russian hack declassified and to publish a report he has instructed the intelligence community to assemble before he leaves office. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cGiven that Obama only has a few more weeks in office, I think he needs to focus his remaining time on attribution \u2014 that is declassification of intelligence so that there is no ambiguity about the Russian actions,\u201d Mr. McFaul said. That \u201cis completely within his powers,\u201d he added, and would spur more congressional investigations regardless of the stance taken by Mr. Trump on the hack. Mr. Obama\u2019s comments on Friday have led Democrats to demand further action. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the response should mix \u201cadditional economic sanctions along with our allies, and clandestine means of exacting a cost on the Russians for their flagrant meddling in our election.\u201d \u201cI have little confidence,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat the incoming president will take the actions necessary to make the Russians pay any price for the most consequential \u2018active measures\u2019 campaign against us in history.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 18, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wary President Takes On Riddles Of Cyberwarfare.

By Pamela Constable December 17 at 7:00 AM Follow @pamconstable1 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0It was\u00a0just a few seconds, a video clip of several young women laughing and clapping to music, dressed for a party or a wedding in orange headscarves and robes with floral patterns. Then a few more seconds of a young man dancing alone, apparently in the same room. The cellphone video was made six years ago, in a village deep in Kohistan, a rugged area of northwest Pakistan. It was the last time the young women, known only as Bazeegha, Sareen Jan, Begum Jan, Amina and Shaheen, have ever been definitively seen alive. What happened to them remains a mystery. Their fates have been shrouded by cultural taboos, official inertia, implacable resistance from elders and religious leaders suspected of ordering their deaths, and elaborate subterfuges by the families who reportedly carried out those orders. [ Killed in the name of \u2018honor\u2019 in Pakistan ] Even in Pakistan, where hundreds of\u00a0 \u201chonor killings\u201d are\u00a0 reported every year, \u00a0this case was extreme. According to court filings and interviews with people who investigated it, the families confined the girls for weeks, threw boiling water and hot coals on them, then killed them and buried them somewhere in the Kohistan hills. Later, when investigators appeared, relatives and community leaders insisted that the girls were still alive and produced a second set of similar-looking girls to prove it. They even disfigured one girl\u2019s thumbprints so she couldn\u2019t be checked against the identity of the victim she was supposed to impersonate. The story illustrates many of the reasons Pakistani officials have failed to curb the problem of honor killings. These include the cruel sway of traditional tribal councils, known as\u00a0jirgas, over uneducated villagers; the lengths to which such leaders may go to defy state authority; and the casual worthlessness they assign to the rights, lives and even identities of young women.\u00a0 Today, the truth is finally beginning to emerge, mostly through the efforts of a few individuals including Afzal Kohistani, a young man whose brothers were killed as a result of the incident. He spent years seeking help from local and provincial officials, then petitioned the Supreme Court. In 2012, his case was dismissed, but last month the high court reopened it and ordered a new investigation that has produced a chilling report. \u201cThis has destroyed my family. The girls are dead, my brothers have been killed and nothing has been done to bring justice or protect us,\u201d said Kohistani, 26, who has received death threats. \u201cI know I will probably be killed, too, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cWhat happened is wrong, and it has to change.\u201d Renewed judicial interest in these long-ago events coincided with another encouraging development:\u00a0the passage of a new law in Parliament that strengthened judicial powers in honor-killing cases. Often, even when such crimes manage to reach the courts, there is no punishment because the law allows victims\u2019 families to \u201cforgive\u201d the perpetrators \u2014 who are often their own relatives.\u00a0\u00a0 [ After Qandeel Baloch\u2019s death, Pakistan takes a small step to discourage \u2018honor killings\u2019 ] The new law, passed in October, gives judges more ammunition to impose life sentences for honor killings in extreme circumstances, allowing them to overrule personal deals by making the murder a crime against the state. But supporters fear that cultural and political resistance will continue to prevent justice being done. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet whether the law will make much difference. Punishment is still not mandatory, and forgiveness can still negate justice,\u201d said Benazir Jatoi, a lawyer who works on women\u2019s rights. \u201cUntil there is more political will, I don\u2019t think the\u00a0 lives of ordinary women threatened with honor violence will change.\u201d The Kohistan case unfolded in a conservative rural region where social mingling between genders is taboo. The girls\u2019 participation in a coed singing party was risky enough, but someone posted the video on the Internet, where it spread rapidly, bringing shame on their community before the vast virtual world.\u00a0 (TWP) The head of the local jirga, a Muslim cleric, allegedly issued a religious decree ordering the five girls to be killed for dishonoring their tribe, along with the boy seen dancing and every member of his family. There was no resistance from the community. After the girls were disposed of, several brothers of the boy were also caught and killed. The rest of the family, including Kohistani, fled the area. There things stood for more than a year. No crimes were reported and no one came to investigate. Kohistani, a college graduate from one of the area\u2019s wealthier families, said he repeatedly approached local and provincial officials, reporting the killings and seeking protection, but was chided for opposing the\u00a0jirga\u2019s verdict.\u00a0 \u201cNo one in my district or my province has ever spoken against honor killing. They tell me I have defamed my culture, my religion, my tribe,\u201d Kohistani said this month. \u201cEverybody knows what happened, but no one is ready to come forward. This an illegal, unconstitutional and un-Islamic tradition, but people don\u2019t even consider it a crime.\u201d Finally, with assistance from a lawyer in Islamabad, Kohistani appealed directly to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Iftikhar\u00a0Chaudhry, a liberal activist, personally took up the case in 2012 and ordered two fact-finding missions sent to the remote area by helicopter.\u00a0\u00a0 When the visitors demanded to see the girls, their families at first refused, but eventually presented three girls and said they were the ones in the video. The three delegates had no chance to speak to the girls in private, but they compared their faces to images from the video. Two were convinced of the likenesses; the third, Farzana Bari, said she had doubts.\u00a0 \u201cI was upset and confused. We had no translators who knew their dialect, and everyone there insisted these were the same girls,\u201d recounted Bari, an academic in Islamabad. \u201cWhen we got back the second time, I filed a dissenting report, but the judge closed the case. I still feel terrible.\u201d After that, life in the village apparently returned to normal for several years. One journalist sent photos of both groups of girls to analysts in England, who found only a 14\u00a0percent chance they were the same individuals. That evidence was taken to a provincial court, but it declined to take action. Kohistani, in the interview, named each of the original girls and their replacements, who he said were similar-looking sisters, cousins and sisters-in-law.\u00a0 [ Before she was murdered by her brother in an apparent \u2018honor killing,\u2019 who was Qandeel Baloch? ] Finally, last month, Kohistani\u2019s crusade got an unexpected break when the Supreme Court, under a new chief justice, agreed to accept his petition. Once more, a fact-finding mission was sent to the village. This time, it included a district judge and two police officers, armed with government ID records with the heights and thumbprints of the missing girls.\u00a0 What they encountered was hair-raising.\u00a0 In his report afterward, Kohistan Judge Shoaib Khan said the village elders were \u201cunanimous\u201d in insisting that the girls were alive. But two of the girls they produced were much younger than the victims, according to their official birth dates. A third could not be identified because both thumbs had been burned; her parents insisted that it was from a cooking accident. He concluded that at least two girls did not match the ones in the video and that the others were probably also impostors. \u201cAll this leads to the suspicious conclusion that something is wrong at bottom,\u201d Khan wrote. The case, he advised, \u201cneeds exhaustive inquiry.\u201d On a recent day, Kohistani, wearing a conservative suit and carrying a copy of the judge\u2019s report, walked up to the Supreme Court. He smiled slightly as he shook hands with his attorney, and they went inside to wait for the next hearing.\u00a0 Read more: ",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump brought his \"thank you\" tour to the battleground state of Florida Friday night -- his first time holding a rally in the state since winning the election. The Sunshine State was his most-visited battleground state during the election, spending 19 days campaigning in the state since clinching the nomination May 26. Trump kicked off his rally thanking the \u201cincredible\u201d people of Florida, who he later called out for being \u201cvicious\u201d and violent during the campaign. \"Four weeks ago just prior to, you people were vicious violent, screaming, 'we want the wall,' screaming 'prison, prison, lock her up!' You were going crazy. I mean, you were nasty and mean and vicious and you wanted to win, right?\u201d Trump said at the Central Florida Fairgrounds Complex. \"But now it's much different. Now you're laid back, you're cool, you're mellow, right? You're basking in the glory of victory.\" President-Elect Trump Goes After Obama Press Secretary Josh Earnest in Speech During the campaign, Trump defended his supporters, arguing they should respond if anti-Trump protesters provoked them. \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them , would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,\" Trump said told supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on the day of the state's GOP caucuses. In addition to thanking his supporters, Trump finally identified \"that guy from Utah,\" whom he frequently mentions at his rallies: Former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin . But Trump didn\u2019t exactly call him by his proper name: Trupm referred to McMullin as \"McMuffin\u201d after it was shouted by a supporter in the crowd. \"That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s his name,\" Trump said. \u201cI never heard of this guy before.\u201d Days before the election, McMullin tweeted a photo of himself holding an Egg McMuffin, writing, \u201cMcMuffins for McMuFinn. #McMullinFinn.\u201d \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 5, 2016 Trump did not address President Barack's Obama's news conference, nor Russia or Aleppo. But for the second time in a row, he brought up the need for safe zones to protect refugees. \"So we are going to start using our head. We are going to do things right and try to patch that up and try to help people. We'll build safe Zones,\" Trump ensured his supporters. \"We are going to build safe Zones in Syria. We are going to build safe Zones. And we are going to get the gulf states to pay for the safe Zones and we'll try on help people. We are going to try and we are going to get it done.\" On Saturday, Trump is expected to make the final stop on his \"thank you\" tour in Mobile, Alabama. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "<p>President-elect Donald Trump arrives to speak during a USA Thank You Tour event in Mobile, Alabama, Dec. 17, 2016.</p> Close REUTERS President-elect Donald Trump took his last bow Saturday in Mobile, Alabama, concluding his victory tour with a final look back at his campaign trail triumphs, an election night tick-tock and a promise to focus on an economic agenda that \u201ccan be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d \u201cThere is no better place to celebrate than right here,\u201d the president-elect told a crowd in Mobile, saying that the Alabama city was \u201cwhere it all began.\u201d Amid intermittent cheers of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d the president-elect crowed his approval of the state, saying voters \u201cpropelled\u201d the campaign to \u201ca historic win for the American worker and the American people.\u201d The president-elect relived what he counted among his campaign\u2019s greatest hits, including his defeat of third-party candidate Evan McMullin in Utah , his scant spending on political advertising and the frenetic pace of his rallies in the home stretch of the election. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s worked harder in the last months of a presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referencing himself. Trump evades discussion of Russia's election tampering But the spotlight wasn\u2019t all on the president-elect. Mr. Trump also brought out a parade of surrogates during his own speech, calling to the stage Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now a top adviser to his transition team. (She told rally-goers that the president-elect had won \u201cover 2,600 counties\u201d and 306 electoral votes.) He also had spokeswoman Hope Hicks join him at the podium (she smiled and wished the crowd a \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d) and, earlier, his first Senate backer, Jeff Sessions, took over the mic. Later, Mr. Trump gave his account of Nov. 8, claiming that halfway through election night he wanted to switch venues with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, which had rented out a convention center on the west side of Manhattan. \u201cI took sort of a small ballroom because if I lost, I wanted to get out,\u201d Mr. Trump jokingly explained. He added that his campaign had even offered to buy the fireworks ordered by the Clinton team because \u201cI found fireworks just don\u2019t work when you lose.\u201d The last stop on what was billed as a \u201cThank You\u201d tour, Mobile was an appropriate place for the president-elect to reminisce on his year-and-a-half long journey to the White House: It was in the state where Mr. Trump won one of his largest margins of victory, where Sessions (now his attorney general pick) first publicly jumped aboard the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d train and where, as the president-elect said, people began to think \u201csomething was really going on there.\u201d But the jaunt through Mobile was also an attempt to look toward Jan. 20, his inauguration, and the four years to come.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to the old days,\u201d the president-elect said, with an economic agenda that included the promise to \u201cbuy American and hire American.\u201d \u201cMade in the USA, remember?\u201d he asked. Mr. Trump once again promised to build \u201ca great wall\u201d that would stop illegal immigration \u201cfor good.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cwe will have doors in that wall,\u201d where people can come through -- legally -- \u201cby the tens of thousands.\u201d \u00a0 The president-elect did not address the latest reports of Russia hacking during the U.S. election season. At the conclusion, Mr. Trump addressed first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s recent remarks about a hopeless America, pushing back on the notion and saying \u201cwe have tremendous hope.\u201d \u201cI actually think she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out,\u201d he said, referring to an interview with Oprah Winfrey that\u2019s scheduled to be broadcast Monday. \u201cNow we\u2019re feeling what not having hope feels like. You know? Hope is necessary. It\u2019s a necessary concept,\u201d Mrs. Obama told Winfrey in a clip released in advance. \u201cAnd Barack didn\u2019t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes. I mean, he and I and so many believe that if you -- what else do you have if you don\u2019t have hope?\u201d The president-elect countered that by saying of his administration and the country as a whole: \u201cWe have tremendous potential.\u201d \u201cWe are going to be so successful as a country again,\u201d he vowed. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., is President-elect Donald Trump's choice as budget director. Alex Brandon/AP President-elect Donald Trump is nominating Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., to the Cabinet-level post of director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mulvaney, 49, has been in Congress since 2011; in that time, he has frequently pushed for tighter budget controls. \"We are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,\" Trump said in a press release announcing his pick. \"Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation's finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.\" Mulvaney is a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of around 40 conservatives that grew out of the Tea Party movement. The group often tangled with former Speaker John Boehner and backed Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida as his replacement. \"Mulvaney was not an early Trump backer during the presidential campaign,\" South Carolina's The State newspaper notes. \"He initially supported U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. for the Republican nomination. Mulvaney endorsed Trump in June, hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. did the same.\" Article continues after sponsorship As a federal sequestration loomed back in 2013, NPR's Tamara Keith attended one of Mulvaney's town hall meetings in South Carolina. At the time, Mulvaney said the sequester cuts were real and not just tricks of accounting \u2014 but he also said he'd prefer to replace them with more strategic cuts. Here's some of what the congressman said about the budget impasse: \"I'm comfortable that the federal government will continue to exist after the sequester. I don't think people are going to, you know, go to the streets and revolt when the U.S. Department of Commerce has to go back a couple of years in their budgets.\" The Cabinet-level job of budget director requires Senate confirmation. With the choice, Trump now has four Cabinet-ranking jobs to fill , from Agriculture secretary and secretary of Veterans Affairs to two more economics-related posts: chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and U.S. trade representative.

Walmart has a new program that offers prizes as incentives to get its legion of shoppers to sock away money in saving accounts. The \"Prize Savings\" program features Walmart's branded reloadable prepaid debit cards, which are linked to a free savings \"vault.\" (Photo: Seth Perlman, AP) NEW YORK \u2014 Walmart has a new program that offers prizes as incentives to get its legion of shoppers to sock away money in saving accounts. The \"Prize Savings\" program features Walmart's branded reloadable pre-paid debit cards, which are linked to a free savings \"vault.\" Savers are given one entry into a monthly prize drawing for every dollar they stash in the vault. The sweepstakes will award 500 cash prizes every month, with the average prize being about $25. The monthly sweepstakes includes one $1,000 grand prize. Walmart says the program, launched without fanfare in August, is the first national and retail prize-linked savings program. It's also a way to encourage saving by its low-income shoppers, many of whom might not have enough saved to cover even the smallest emergencies, like fixing a flat tire. The move underscores how the world's largest retailer is expanding its financial services, which already includes check-cashing and money transfers. Savings programs tied to prizes are becoming more widely available in the U.S. with the enactment of the American Savings Promotion Act, which became law in December 2014. That removed all federal regulatory barriers to banks and thrifts offering prize-linked savings programs. With Walmart's program, users log into their MoneyCard app or website to transfer money from their balance into the separate MoneyCard Vault, a free savings feature. The program is in partnership with Green Dot Corp., which is the issuing bank for Walmart's prepaid cards. They enlisted Commonwealth, a national organization that uses innovative ways to encourage people to save through programs like prize-linked savings. An American Express Serve prepaid debit card is shown for sale at a store in New York. More prepaid debit card users will be getting the option to have overdraft features on their cards in 2017, but the way it will operate will be very different than how traditional checking account overdraft operates. \u00a0(Photo: Swayne B. Hall, AP) Executives with Walmart Stores Inc., which is based in Bentonville, Ark., told reporters Thursday that the \"Prize Savings\" program is already enticing customers to save more. When the program first started, the average customer savings balance was $413. Now, that figure is $572, a 35 percent increase. 63 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hTsg99 ",

Mick Mulvaney to be head of the Office of Management and Budget . A South Carolina Republican who has advocated for spending cuts in Congress, Mulvaney will become the chief architect of Trump's budget as the director of the OMB. In a statement, Trump pledged that his administration will do \"great things\" and bring the national debt down with Mulvaney leading the office. \"With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America's budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer's trust in how their money is spent,\" Trump said. Mulvaney called it a \"great honor\" to be selected for the post. \"The Trump administration will restore budgetary and fiscal sanity back in Washington after eight years of an out-of-control, tax and spend financial agenda, and will work with Congress to create policies that will be friendly to American workers and businesses,\" Mulvaney said in a statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin called Mulvaney \"the absolute right choice\" to lead the OMB, in a statement released following the announcement. \"Mick is someone I have come to greatly respect and rely on, going back to our time serving together on the Budget Committee,\" Ryan said. \"I look forward to working with Mick in his new role, and I commend President-elect Trump on this excellent selection.\" 0 Shares ",

Basically they were piling up at 50 mph,\" eyewitness Marvellous Amasiatu said of the 4:45 a.m. pileup on the elevated portion of I-95 in downtown Baltimore near the Washington Boulevard exit. \"Oh my God,\" he said. \"I could see those trailers coming. They had no idea how bad that bridge froze.\" The driver of the tanker truck was killed and one other person died in the pileup, which was sparked by debris from the tanker crash and explosion, Maryland Transportation Authority Police Lt. Kevin Ayd said. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Winter storms and frigid temperatures that have affected large parts of the country have been blamed in 13 deaths since Tuesday and hundreds of car crashes. At least seven people were killed in crashes since Friday night. A third person in Maryland was killed Saturday morning after he stepped out of his car on I-95 to inspect damage from a fender-bender and was struck by a vehicle, Ayd said. More than two dozen people were injured in the pileup, four of whom were in critical condition, NBC affiliate WBAL-TV reported .

Two separate crashes in Indiana between Friday night and Saturday afternoon left two people dead, and more freezing conditions were expected Saturday night, state police said. Overall state police responded to 380 crashes and 150 slide offs by 2 p.m., police said. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan said \"road conditions in many areas of the state are still extremely dangerous, and all those who can avoid travel should stay off the roads until conditions have improved.\" Parts of Baltimore County and the city one-fifth of an inch of ice was recorded, the National Weather Service said, and near-freezing temperatures were expected in Maryland, extreme northern Virginia and eastern West Virginia Saturday night. Trucks and vehicles are shown in a pile-up involving a fuel tanker which skidded off the an icey 1-95 highway in Baltimore on Dec. 17. Sage Hiller / via Reuters In New Mexico, state police also reported a pileup that included \"approximately 40 vehicles\" on Interstate 40 Saturday morning. According to law enforcement, the roadway is covered in snow and ice, but they have not confirmed that the accident was caused by the inclement conditions and have not reported any deaths or injuries. In St. Louis, the fire department reported more than 50 vehicle accidents and 40 falls. A firefighter was also struck by a vehicle and remains in serious but stable conditions. Two to five inches of snow were reported to have accumulated across the Northeast and a second bout of cold was expected to create icy conditions. The wintry precipitation is expected to taper off, ending by late Sunday after leaving treacherous conditions in the Mid-Atlantic region, forecasters said. \"It's pretty much winding down especially in the Northeast,\" said Senior Weather Channel Meteorologist Dave Houtz. \"There's still a little bit of freezing rain in parts of New England. Most of it is either rain or snow at this point. It's just foggy and drizzly in New York City, otherwise most of the precipitation is pretty light.\" A vehicle involved in a crash sits on the fast lane of Highway Interstate 80 after an accident during a snowfall, Saturday, Dec. 17, 2016, in Lodi, N.J. Julio Cortez / AP There will be some severe weather in parts of the South Saturday night, from Louisiana through Mississippi and up into Tennessee, forecasters said. It will likely consist of wind, hail and thunderstorms, but tornadoes are possible. \"It is snowing from Colorado to Iowa and Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and northern New York and most of New England north of Boston,\" said Houtz.

    "text": "Dr. Henry Heimlich has died in Ohio at age 96. He's seen here in 2014, holding a copy of his memoir at his home in Cincinnati. Al Behrman/AP hide caption toggle caption Al Behrman/AP Dr. Henry Heimlich has died in Ohio at age 96. He's seen here in 2014, holding a copy of his memoir at his home in Cincinnati. Al Behrman/AP He's credited with saving thousands of people from choking to death, thanks to the method he popularized in 1974. Now comes word that Dr. Henry Heimlich has died at age 96. Heimlich died early Saturday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, according to Bryan Reynolds, spokesman for Episcopal Retirement Services, which operates the retirement home where the physician lived for years. Dr. Heimlich Uses His Maneuver At Retirement Home, Saves 87-Year-Old Woman According to Reynolds, Heimlich was experiencing complications from a massive heart attack he suffered in his home Monday. Since its invention, the Heimlich Maneuver has become both a life-saving tool and a part of modern culture. It's uncertain how popular it would be if the move was still known by its original term: subdiaphragmatic pressure. As Heimlich told NPR back in 1999, that's the name he assigned the method when he described it in a medical journal in June of 1974. That original name didn't last long. As Heimlich said, \"the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association called me, and they said, 'We have found that so many lives have been saved in less than two months, we would like to name this after you.'\" By 1980, he said, the Heimlich maneuver had gained enough prominence to be an entry in foreign-language dictionaries. The thoracic surgeon famously used his own maneuver earlier this year to help a fellow resident at his retirement home \u2014 an 87-year-old woman who began choking on a hamburger during dinner. In a statement, Heimlich's family said they were saddened by the death of a man who's seen by a hero by many. And they said the physician's legacy extends beyond his famous life-saving method: \"As a young surgeon, Dad was the first American to devise and perform a total organ replacement. Later, he came up with a device that saved thousands of soldiers' lives during the Vietnam War. The Heimlich Chest Drain Valve is still used worldwide for patients undergoing chest surgery. \"Dad was firm in his convictions and passionate for his causes. He didn't play politics well. Instead, he was single-minded in his quest to find better ways to save lives. Dad dreamed that anything was possible in the field of medicine, even when critics said otherwise.\" Article continues after sponsorship Some of those critics focused on Heimlich's theory of malariotherapy , in which malaria is induced in people suffering from HIV, Lyme disease and other conditions with the goal of using malaria's high fevers to help patients. Heimlich has acknowledged performing such research on HIV patients in China, telling Boston.com in 2014 that he feels the idea deserves to be researched. Other disagreements have centered on the use of the doctor's eponymous maneuver. The Red Cross says it should be used only after slapping a choking victim's back, for instance, and the Red Cross and other organizations have also said drowning victims should get mouth-to-mouth resuscitation rather than the Heimlich maneuver. The Heimlich Maneuver is relatively simple to perform; it's also been deployed to rescue people from Carrie Fisher and Halle Berry to President Ronald Reagan and New York Mayor Ed Koch, as Radiolab has reported . Here's how Heimlich himself described the maneuver to NPR: \"There are several positions. Now everybody knows where you stand behind the person, put your thumb inside of your fist just above the bellybutton \u2014 remember, below the chest. And you grasp your fist with your other hand and you press inward and upward. Now you repeat that until the object comes out. \"But it also can be done with a person lying down on their back. You kneel astride their thighs and put one of your hands on top of the other, and the heel of the bottom hand just above the bellybutton, and press your weight in. And that's how children have saved their parents. In addition, its widest use now is to save drowning victims.\" You can also see examples of the maneuver in videos from the physician's Heimlich Heroes website . ",

    "text": "> Barrels shipped in 2015:\u00a05.2 million > Owner:\u00a0Anheuser-Busch InBev Michelob Ultra is bucking the trend of sales decline among major domestic beer brands. While shipments of industry titans beers like Budweiser, Bud Light, and Coors Light have declined dramatically in the last half decade, Michelob Ultra is gaining popularity faster than nearly any other brew. Americans consumed 5.2 million barrels of Michelob Ultra last year, a 54.8% increase from five years prior. What sets Michelob Ultra apart may be marketing. Introduced to beer drinkers in 2002, Michelob Ultra initially marketed itself as a beer for the diet conscious drinker, containing far fewer carbs than the typical beer. Now the brand\u2019s marketing has shifted focus from the dieter to the fitness fanatic. This year, AB InBev paid between $4.6 million and $5 million for a 30 second Super Bowl spot to run an ad that more closely resembled a sports drink ad than a beer commercial. See the rest of the Top 10: America's Fastest Growing Beer Brands More on the fastest-growing beer brands Sales of once unassailable beers such as Budweiser and Miller High Life have declined by more than 25% from 2010 through 2015. Meanwhile, sales of such beers as Modelo Especial and Stella Artois \u2014 once more marginal brands in the United States \u2014 have more than doubled. Based on five-year increases in U.S. sales, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 fastest growing beers in America. Premium brands such as Michelob Ultra and Coors Banquet, as well as imports, especially from Mexico, dominate the list of beer brands with increasing shipments. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Eric Shepard, executive editor with industry news organization Beer Marketer\u2019s Insights, said, \u201cThere has been significant trade up in the U.S. beer industry.\u201d Drinkers have increasingly chosen craft beers, higher-priced premium brands, wine, or spirits over the traditionally dominant mainstream domestic beer brands. \u201cConsumers trade up for various reasons, whether it\u2019s something that they perceive as being more prestigious, more flavorful, [or] whatever the image issues may be,\u201d Shepard said. Despite their popularity, many of the nation\u2019s fastest growing beer brands would be difficult to distinguish from one another in a blind taste test. Beer critics also generally rate these brands very poorly. As a result, advertising in the mainstream beer industry is essential. A beer like Stella Artois can go from being associated with binge-drinkers and abusive alcoholics (as it was in the early 2000s) to a high-end, classy beverage \u2014 all from advertising and despite an unchanging formula. Of the 10 fastest growing beers in America, four are Mexican imports. Shepard noted changing U.S. demographics as one factor that could explain Mexican beers\u2019 massive growth. Hispanics made up 17.3% of the U.S. population in 2014, much more than their 3.5% share in 1960. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

(Photo: Gabe Hernandez/Caller-Times) CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas \u2014 City officials confirmed Saturday that there are four cases of people who have skin and intestinal issues consistent with exposure to contaminated water . The Caller-Times also has confirmed that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's initial report shows a backflow issue at a mixing tank Dec. 7. However, it's not clear whether that was the first potential contamination or if there were even earlier backflows. Corpus Christi is in the third day of the chemical contamination scare afflicting the city's water system. At a news conference Saturday afternoon at City Hall, Mayor Dan McQueen said 30 water samples are being tested in Houston. It's expected those results will be ready sometime Sunday. He was reluctant to give a timeline for when the water system might be cleared of the chemical contaminant because it's possible the chemical breached the system as early as Dec. 1. Don't drink the water: Chemical identified in Texas city water supply Assistant City Manager Mark Van Vleck said the city has finished flushing about half of the city's dead-end water mains. The Associated Press reported that an internal email sent Wednesday by Susan Clewis, a regional director for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, contained an incident report that described the leak as a \"backflow incident from a chemical tank impacting the public water system.\" It was reported Dec. 7 at a plant run by Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions. The email doesn't say who initially reported the leak on Dec. 7 or to whom. It says the state environmental agency was notified around 3 p.m. on Wednesday. City officials notified the public that evening. \"Obviously we are concerned about that initial report, that this may have been known for seven days and it may have been going on for that long. And why did it take so long for TCEQ to get notified?\" asked Luis Moreno, chief of staff for state Sen. Juan Hinojosa, whose district includes Corpus Christi. \"Those are all things that I think are starting to be figured out right now.\" McQueen, the mayor of the Gulf Coast city of about 300,000 people, has said local officials also only learned of the leak on Wednesday. Class-action lawsuit filed over Corpus Christi water system woes Neither Clewis nor city officials responded to requests from the AP for comment on Friday, when many schools remained closed for a second day. The TCEQ report indicates that a combination of Indulin AA-86 and hydrochloric acid leaked into the water supply. Indulin is an asphalt emulsifying agent that's corrosive and can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. The amber liquid is considered a hazardous material by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and could cause damage to internal organs. \"You don't expect to see it in water,\" said Terry Clawson, a spokesman with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Up to 24 gallons of it may have seeped into a pipeline carrying water, allowing it to move to other areas of the city, Kim Womack, a spokeswoman for the city, said Thursday. Ergon has said in a statement that it has been in contact with the TCEQ and was \"working cooperatively to provide all information to ensure state officials can remedy the situation as quickly as possible.\" Bill Miller, a company spokesman, declined to explain Friday how a hazardous chemical may have entered the water supply. Meanwhile, Hilliard Munoz Gonzalez LLP, a Corpus Christi law firm, announced early Saturday that a lawsuit filed against Valero and its subsidiaries and Ergon Aspha & Emulsifiers Inc. by attorney Bob Hilliard has been expanded to a class action suit. A news release from the firm said that hundreds of Corpus Christi businesses that have had to stay closed because of the water ban have asked to be added to the suit, originally filed on behalf of Coiffures of Country Club Inc., Anthony\u2019s Aveda Concept Salon and Paula Porter.

    "text": "The Robot Revolution Will Be the Quietest One By LIU CIXIN Photo Credit Renaud Vigourt via The New York Times This is an article from Turning Points , a magazine that explores what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. Turning Point: Though the first fatal crash involving an autonomous car took place in July 2016, self-driving vehicles have been adopted around the world. In 2016, self-driving cars made inroads in several countries, many of which rewrote their laws to accommodate the new technology. As a science-fiction writer, it\u2019s my duty to warn the human race that the robot revolution has begun \u2014 even if no one has noticed yet. When a few autonomous test cars appeared on the roads over the last few years, we didn\u2019t think of them as robots because they didn\u2019t have the humanoid shape that science-fiction movies taught us to expect. In 2016, they were adopted widely: as buses in the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, taxis in Singapore and private cars in the United States and China. There was a fatal accident in Florida involving an autonomous car, which caused some concerns, but this did not significantly affect our embrace of this technology. Continue reading the main story Instead of arming ourselves against this alien presence, as some of my fellow science-fiction writers have fearfully suggested, we gawked as the vehicles pulled up to the curb. The driverless vehicles, some of which had no steering wheels or gas pedals, merged into traffic and stopped at stop signs, smoothly taking us to our destinations. We lounged in comfort, occasionally taking selfies. Photo Uber\u2019s driverless system navigating the streets of Pittsburgh. Self-driving taxis, buses and cars operated in several countries in 2016. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times Machine learning has been an important tool for autonomous car companies as they develop the systems that pilot their vehicles. Instead of rigidly following programming as an app on your phone does, an A.I. system can try to learn to do a task itself, using techniques borrowed from human learning, like pattern recognition and trial and error, and may use hardware modeled on the architecture of a human brain. Currently, the responsibilities of artificial intelligence are mostly limited to tasks like translating texts, helping with medical diagnoses and writing simple articles for media companies. But we can expect to see unimaginable progress in this field in future \u2014 and the widespread use of the autonomous car is going to accelerate that process as automobile and technology companies invest ever more resources in its development. Let\u2019s try to envision that future. As during every other technological revolution, the robots will first transform our economy. People who drive for a living will lose their jobs \u2014 around 3 million in the United States alone. E-commerce may experience further booms because of automation, and car ownership is likely to become nearly obsolete as more targeted car sharing and public transportation systems are developed. Eventually, the robot cars could be integrated with other transportation systems. Say that you live in New York City and want to go to China\u2019s Henan Province: You will enter the address into an app, a car will take you to your plane at the airport, and after you land, another will take you directly to your destination. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Robots will begin to creep into other areas of our lives \u2014 serving as busboys or waiters, for example \u2014 as our investments in robotic transport improve their prowess in areas such as environmental detection and modeling, hyper-complex problem solving and fuzzy-logic applications. With every advance, the use of A.I.-powered robots will expand into other fields: health care, policing, national defense and education. There will be scandals when things go wrong and backlash movements from the new Luddites. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll protest very much. The A.I. systems that drive our cars will teach us to trust machine intelligence over the human variety \u2014 car accidents will become very rare, for example \u2014 and when given an opportunity to delegate a job to a robot, we will placidly do so without giving it much thought. In all previous technological revolutions, people who lost their jobs mostly moved to new ones, but that will be less likely when the robots take over. A.I. that can learn from experience will replace many accountants, lawyers, bankers, insurance adjusters, doctors, scientific researchers and some creative professionals. Intelligence and advanced training will no longer mean job stability. Gradually the A.I. era will transform the essence of human culture. When we\u2019re no longer more intelligent than our machines, when they can easily outthink and outperform us, making the sort of intuitive leaps in research and other areas that we currently associate with genius, a sort of learned helplessness is likely to set in for us, and the idea of work itself may cease to hold meaning. Photo Liu Cixin. Credit The New York Times As A.I. takes over, the remaining jobs may dwindle to a fraction of what they were, employing perhaps 10 percent or even less of the total population. These may be highly creative or complex jobs that robots can\u2019t do, such as senior management, directing scientific research or nursing and child care. In the dystopian scenario, as jobless numbers rise across the globe, our societies sink into prolonged turmoil. The world could be engulfed by endless conflicts between those who control the A.I. and the rest of us. The technocratic 10 percent could end up living in a gated community with armed robot guards. There is a second, utopian scenario, where we\u2019ve anticipated these changes and come up with solutions beforehand. Those in political power have planned a smoother, gentler transition, perhaps using A.I. to help them anticipate and modulate the strife. At the end of it, almost all of us live on social welfare. How we will spend our time is hard to predict. \u201cHe who does not work, neither shall he eat\u201d has been the cornerstone of civilizations through the ages, but that will have vanished. History shows that those who haven\u2019t had to work \u2014 aristocrats, say \u2014 have often spent their time entertaining and developing their artistic and sporting talents while scrupulously observing elaborate rituals of dress and manners. In this future, creativity is highly valued. We sport ever more fantastic makeup, hairstyles and clothing. The labor of past ages seems barbaric. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the aristocrats ruled nations; in the A.I. era, machines are doing all the thinking. Because, over the decades, we\u2019ve gradually given up our autonomy, step by step, allowing ourselves to be transformed into A.I.\u2019s docile, fabulously pampered pets. As A.I. whisks us from place to place \u2014 visits to family members, art galleries and musical events \u2014 we will look out the windows, as unaware of its plans for us as a poodle on its way to the groomer\u2019s.

    "text": "US report says China adds weapons to South China Sea islands China's seizure is being considered by some observers as one of the most significant disputes in years between the world super powers and follows Trump\u2019s post-election victory call with the president of Taiwan. The call alarmed old guard foreign policy experts who said it undermined the United States\u2019 decades-long \u201cOne China\u201d policy that recognizes mainland China over Taiwan. Before the Pentagon announcement, China had indicated that efforts were underway to resolve the issue, saying it was in contact with American counterparts regarding the \"appropriately handling\" of the unmanned underwater glider. However, the one-sentence comment by the country\u2019s foreign ministry offered no details on what discussions were underway or why China on seized the drone, which the Pentagon says was being operated by civilian contractors for oceanic research. The U.S. said it issued a formal diplomatic complaint over the seizure and demanded the drone's return. \"According to (our) understanding, the U.S. and Chinese sides are working on appropriately handling this matter through channels between the two militaries,\" the foreign ministry said in its statement, which was faxed to The Associated Press. China's defense ministry did not immediately respond to questions on the issue. The drone was seized while collecting unclassified scientific data about 57 miles northwest of Subic Bay, near the Philippines in the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, the U.S. Navy said Friday. \"It is ours,\u201d a Navy spokesman said. \u201cIt's clearly marked as ours. We would like it back, and we would like this not to happen again,\" The spokesman also said the drone costs about $150,000 and is largely commercial, off-the-shelf technology. The most recent, significant dispute between the countries\u2019 militaries was perhaps in April 2001 when a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter jet nearly collided about 70 miles from China's Hainan island, which led to the death of a Chinese pilot. Whatever the outcome of the drone incident, the incident is likely to fray the already tense relations between U.S. and China. Beijing was angered by Trump's decision to talk Dec. 2 by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and by his later comments that he did not feel \"bound\u201d by the One China policy, unless the U.S. could gain trade or other benefits from China. China considers the self-governing island its own territory to be recovered by force if it deems necessary. There also have been increased tensions over Beijing's ongoing military buildup in the South China Sea, mainly the development and militarization of man-made shoals and islands aimed at extending China's reach in the strategically vital area through which about $5 trillion in global trade passes annually. In one of the few reports in state media about the drone's seizure, a newspaper published by China's ruling Communist Party cited an unidentified military official as saying that a \"smooth resolution\" to the matter is expected. A Chinese navy ship discovered an \"unidentified device\" Thursday and was checking on it for the sake of maritime safety, the Global Times quoted the official as saying. \"China has received the U.S. request to return the device, communication is open between the relevant departments of the two sides and I believe this matter will obtain a smooth resolution,\" the officer was quoted as saying. In a separate report, the paper quoted retired Chinese admiral Yang Yi as saying China considered itself well within its rights to seize the drone. \"If China needs to take it, we'll take it. (America) can't block us,\" Yang was quoted as saying. Yang said he was unsure of the purpose of seizing the drone, but didn't think the matter qualified as a \"military conflict.\" However, he added that the chances of a confrontation had risen following Trump's recent comments, which were seen as testing China's bottom line on Taiwan and other sensitive issues. \"It's natural for us to take possession of and research for a bit these types of things that America sends to our doorstep,\" Yang said. \"The louder they shout, the more their protests ring hollow.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

County targeted in phishing cyberattack; private information of 750,000 people compromised la\u0096me\u0096adv\u0096fairey\u0096mural Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times A mural at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center. The L.A. County Department of Health Services was one of more than a dozen county departments targeted in a May 2016 cyberattack disclosed this week. A mural at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center. The L.A. County Department of Health Services was one of more than a dozen county departments targeted in a May 2016 cyberattack disclosed this week. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Tony Barboza Contact Reporter Confidential health\u00a0data or personal information of more than 750,000 people may have been accessed in\u00a0a cyberattack on Los Angeles County employees in May that led to charges this week against a Nigerian national, officials have disclosed. The May 13 attack targeted 1,000 county employees from several departments\u00a0with a phishing email. The message\u00a0tricked 108\u00a0employees\u00a0into providing usernames and passwords to their accounts,\u00a0some of which contained\u00a0confidential patient or client information, officials said. Most of the 756,000 people whose information may have been accessed had\u00a0contact with the Department of Health Services, according to the county. A smaller amount of confidential information\u00a0from more than a dozen other county departments also was compromised. Among the data potentially accessed\u00a0were names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, financial information and medical records\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including diagnoses and treatment history \u2014\u00a0of clients, patients or others who received services from county departments. Officials said there is no evidence that confidential information has been circulated, sold or released. The county learned of the attack the day after it happened, and officials said they responded with security measures and a criminal investigation. But the county waited more than seven months to inform the public , citing an exemption under state law that allows delayed notification to protect ongoing investigations. Cyber investigators with the L.A. County district attorney\u2019s office traced the attack to Nigeria. Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant Thursday, accusing Austin Kelvin Onaghinor, 37,\u00a0of launching the attack and charged him with nine felony counts, including unauthorized computer access and identity theft. Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey said in a statement, \u201cMy office will work aggressively to bring this criminal hacker and others to Los Angeles County where they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d These kinds of phishing attacks are on the rise throughout society \u2014 and the County has not been immune from that trend. \u2014 Joel Sappell, L.A. County spokesman Once charges were filed, county officials began mailing notices Thursday to people whose information may have been accessed. The county\u2019s Chief Executive Office said it delayed public notification of the attack at the request of the district attorney\u2019s office \u201cto protect the confidentiality of the sensitive, ongoing investigation and prevent broader public harm.\u201d Notifying the public of the\u00a0attack earlier \u201cmay have hindered\u201d the investigation, the county said in a notice about the data breach Friday. In response to the attack, officials said they have strengthened security measures on county\u00a0email accounts and enhanced employee training to guard against a growing number of cyber intrusions. \u201cThese kinds of phishing attacks are on the rise throughout society \u2014 and the county has not \u00a0been immune from that trend,\u201d county spokesman Joel Sappell said in a statement. In February, officials disclosed that the\u00a0Department of Health Services had been targeted in a smaller-scale\u00a0\u201cransomware\u201d attack , a type of malware that\u00a0cuts off users\u2019\u00a0access to files or threatens to destroy them unless a ransom is paid. The district attorney\u2019s office said in a news release Friday that its cyber investigation team has protected the county from prior attacks, \u201chas investigated 85 cases, involving hundreds of thousands of potential victims\u00a0and has resulted in several successful prosecutions and restitution totaling nearly $4 million.\u201d The county is offering a year of\u00a0free credit and identity-theft monitoring for people\u00a0affected by the May phishing attack and has set up a website and call center for those seeking information: (855) 330-6368.

(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police gather outside a home in the 100 block of West 105th Street, where four people were found dead at the scene and another person was taken to the hospital in critical condition on Dec. 17, 2016. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Deanese Williams-Harris and William Lee Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Four people were shot dead on the scene of an apparent domestic related attack and three other people including a 9-year-old were wounded during Saturday shootings on the South and West sides. The quadruple fatal shooting happened about 12:40 p.m. in the 100 block of West 105th Street at a home in the Fernwood neighborhood, said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. At least five ambulances were sent to the scene after officers were alerted by an anonymous call that several people were shot there, police said. Three men and a woman were pronounced dead at the scene, and a woman in her 20s was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, officials said. Chicago police gather outside a home in the 100 block of West 105th Street, where four people were found dead at the scene and another person was taken to the hospital in critical condition Dec. 17, 2016. Earlier information stated a 2-year-old toddler was wounded but that information was incorrect. Officials later said the child was taken to Roseland Community Hospital for observation, said Jeff Lyle, a Chicago Fire Department spokesman. Lyle said all of the shooting victims were in their 20s. At a news conference about a half block from the scene of the shootings and with more than a dozen relatives looking on, First Deputy Police Supt. Kevin Navarro said authorities received an anonymous 911 call of five people shot at the home. Once they arrived they found two female victims outside of the home -- one dead, the other critically injured. Inside, police found three male victims dead, Navarro said. The two female victims were found on the front porch. Police did not provide ages or relationships for any of the victims, but said the shooting appeared domestic-related. Police also found a two-year-old child who was unharmed. The child was taken to a hospital for observation. \"At this point the case is still unfolding,\" Navarro said. \"We have more questions than answers.\" Family says at least four people lived in the house but they're tight lipped about who the shooter is, but confirmed he escaped in a red truck.\u00a0\u00a0 Navarro said a weapon was not recovered at the scene. Police were expected to be at the scene for much the night as forensic specialist comb through the home for details. Police were also expected to check for any past incidences of trouble at the home, Navarro said. After the news conference, relatives of the suspected dead struggled with the tragedy, saying they still didn't know which of their family members were killed as authorities hadn't yet released the identities of the dead. They suspected that one of their cousins was among the dead because he had not answered the phone all day. \"(Why would) somebody do something like this? Just another senseless act of violence,\" said Melvin Jackson. \"This is a massacre, man. Who would do something like this?\" Police offered no information about the gunman. As word of the deaths spread, family members began to arrive at the crime scene, some in thin jackets, waiting behind the crime scene tape waiting for news about their loved ones. Relatives said neighbors told them that they didn't hear gunshots but did see a red truck speed backwards up the one way street just before the child fled the home. About 10 minutes before the Fernwood\u00a0attack, a 21-year-old man was seriously wounded outside of a funeral home on the West Side. Two people were in police custody in that attack, officials said.\u00a0The shootings were not related. Most recently, a 9-year-old boy was shot and seriously hurt on the West Side about 4:25 p.m. Paramedics were called to the 5900 block of West Rice Street in the Austin\u00a0neighborhood for the boy who had been shot. Police said the shooting was accidental and self-inflicted. The boy was taken to Loyola\u00a0University Medical Center in Maywood where he was listed in serious condition. No one was in custody for the 105th Street slayings, and police were investigating.

He also claimed to have invented a technique for replacing a damaged esophagus, but later acknowledged that a Romanian surgeon had been using it for years. A professor of clinical sciences at Xavier University in Cincinnati and president of the Heimlich Institute, which he founded to research and promote his ideas, Dr. Heimlich was a media-savvy showman who entered the pantheon of medical history with his maneuver but in later years often found himself at odds with a medical establishment skeptical of his claims and theories. Even the Heimlich maneuver, when he first proposed it, was suspect \u2014 an unscientific and possibly unsafe stunt that might be too difficult for laymen to perform and might even cause internal injuries or broken bones in a choking victim. But the stakes were high. In the 1970s, choking on food or foreign objects like toys was the sixth-leading cause of accidental death in America: some 4,000 fatalities annually, many of them children. A blocked windpipe often left a victim unable to breathe or talk, gesturing wildly to communicate distress that mimicked a heart attack. In four minutes, an oxygen-starved brain begins to suffer irreversible damage. Death follows shortly thereafter. Standard first aid for choking victims, advocated by the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association, was a couple of hard slaps on the back or a finger down the throat. But Dr. Heimlich believed those pushed an obstruction farther down in the windpipe, wedging it more tightly. He knew there was a reserve of air in the lungs, and reasoned that sharp upward thrusts on the diaphragm would compress the lungs, push air back up the windpipe and send the obstruction flying out. His solution \u2014 wrapping arms around a victim from behind, making a fist just over the victim\u2019s navel and thrusting up sharply \u2014 worked on dogs. His ideas, published in The Journal of Emergency Medicine in an informal article headlined \u201cPop Goes the Cafe Coronary,\u201d were met with skepticism. Anticipating resistance from his peers, Dr. Heimlich sent copies to major newspapers around the country. Days later, a Washington State man who had read about it used the maneuver to save a neighbor. There were other cases and more headlines. A 5-year-old Massachusetts boy saved a playmate after seeing the maneuver demonstrated on television. Testimonials flooded in. Dr. Heimlich was on his way to celebrity. In a profession that frowned on self-promotion, he was regarded as a publicity-seeking eccentric, if not a crackpot. But as saved lives accumulated into a mountain of evidence, skeptics were mollified, state and federal health authorities endorsed the technique, and its popularity spread. Today it is known to millions from the internet, television, films, pamphlets, books, newspapers and magazines, talked up in families and taught in schools, often with videos provided by the Heimlich Institute. Advertisement Continue reading the main story No one knows how many lives have been saved by the procedure, although reported choking deaths declined after its popularization. The Heimlich Institute claims 50,000 lives saved in the United States alone. A 2009 Op-Ed article in The New York Times estimated that 100,000 people had been rescued from choking. The American Medical Association, which endorsed the technique in 1975 and gave it the name Heimlich maneuver, says it saves unknown thousands annually. Some medical authorities have been wary, partly because it can cause injuries. From 1976 to 1985, the Red Cross and the heart association told rescuers to give back slaps first, and only then go to abdominal thrusts. From 1986 to 2005, both recommended Heimlich thrusts exclusively. But in 2006 the guidelines essentially reverted to pre-1986 recommendations, dropped references to the Heimlich maneuver, and replaced it with the phrase \u201cabdominal thrust.\u201d In 1984 Dr. Heimlich, the recipient of many honors, won the Albert Lasker Public Service Award, one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious medical science prizes, for a \u201csimple, practical, cost-free solution to a life-threatening emergency, requiring neither great strength, special equipment or elaborate training.\u201d Henry Judah Heimlich was born in Wilmington, Del., on Feb. 3, 1920, to Philip and Mary Epstein Heimlich. The family soon moved to New Rochelle, N.Y., where he attended public schools. His father was a prison social worker, and Henry sometimes went along on his rounds. At Cornell University, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1941 and a medical degree from Cornell Medical College in New York City in 1943. He interrupted an internship at Boston City Hospital to join the Navy in World War II. He served with Chinese guerrillas in the Gobi Desert and Inner Mongolia. After the war he was a resident at several hospitals in New York City, and in 1950 he joined Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. In 1951 he married Jane Murray, the daughter of the dance studio entrepreneur Arthur Murray. They had twin daughters, Janet and Elisabeth, and two sons, Philip and Peter. A full list of Dr. Heimlich\u2019s survivors was not immediately available. Jane Heimlich, who co-wrote a book on homeopathy and wrote \u201cWhat Your Doctor Won\u2019t Tell You\u201d (1990), about alternative medicine, died in 2012. In 1955, Dr. Heimlich proposed a method of restoring a patient\u2019s lost ability to swallow, a condition called dysphagia, by reconstructing a damaged or diseased esophagus, using a section of the patient\u2019s stomach. While the condition condemned victims to a lifetime of drooling and taking nourishment through an implanted tube into the stomach, his paper in the journal Surgery was virtually ignored in America. But a Romanian surgeon, Dr. Dan Gavriliu, wrote to Dr. Heimlich and said he had been using the procedure for four years. At the invitation of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, Dr. Heimlich visited Bucharest in 1956 to review the procedure. He returned to New York, successfully tried the operation, and it became a standard procedure in America. \u201cWithout question, Dr. Dan Gavriliu deserves credit for being the first surgeon to discover and perform the procedure that would come to be known as the Heimlich-Gavriliu Reversed Gastric Tube operation,\u201d Dr. Heimlich wrote in a memoir. In the early 1960s Dr. Heimlich invented a device to drain fluid from an open chest wound. Operating on battlefields in World War II, he had seen a need for something better than a standard drainage bottle with suction to pump air and fluid from an open chest. The key was a valve that would control air and prevent fluids from flowing back into the wound. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a dime store, he found a Japanese-made toy noisemaker with a flutter valve. It worked in his device, and he took out a patent on what he called the Heimlich Chest Drain Valve. Widely used by medics on Vietnam battlefields, it also became common in civilian chest operations. By 1989, manufacturers reported annual sales of 250,000 worldwide. In 1969 Dr. Heimlich became director of surgery at the Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, and in 1977 he became professor of advanced clinical sciences at Xavier University. A longtime Cincinnati colleague, Dr. Edward A. Patrick, claimed in 2003 that he had codeveloped the Heimlich maneuver but had never been properly credited. He never took legal action to challenge Dr. Heimlich, however, and in 2008 he lost a libel suit against a Cleveland weekly newspaper that reported in an article, \u201cPlaying Doctor,\u201d that he had misrepresented the extent of his medical training and his professional experience. Dr. Patrick died in 2009. Since the 1980s, Dr. Heimlich had been widely denounced for advocating so-called malariotherapy, the deliberate infection of a person with malaria to treat cancer, Lyme disease and H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. He argued that malarial fevers could stimulate the immune system to fight more serious ailments. But health experts and government agencies have said such treatments are useless and dangerous. Human rights groups criticized experimental trials in Africa and China, calling them primitive. Similarly, his promotion of the Heimlich maneuver to clear water from the lungs of drowning victims, and to treat asthma, cystic fibrosis and even heart attacks, was vehemently disputed. The heart association warned especially against it in drowning rescues, saying it endangered lives. Among his fiercest critics was his son, Peter, who campaigned extensively against what he called his father\u2019s \u201cwide-ranging, 50-year history of fraud.\u201d In blogs, interviews with newspapers, television networks and other forums, he alleged that his father\u2019s institute had conducted abusive medical experiments on AIDS, cancer and Lyme disease patients in the United States and third-world countries, and endangered people with maneuvers to rescue choking and drowning victims. Undeterred, Dr. Heimlich advanced his ideas in articles and books, notably \u201cDr. Heimlich\u2019s Home Guide to Emergency Medical Situations\u201d (1980), and a memoir, \u201cHeimlich\u2019s Maneuvers: My Seventy Years of Lifesaving Innovations\u201d (2014), and in speeches and television appearances. His animated series for children, \u201cDr. Henry\u2019s Emergency Lessons for People,\u201d won an Emmy in 1980. \u201cI can do more toward saving lives in three minutes on television,\u201d he told Omni magazine in 1983, \u201cthan I could do all my life in the operating room.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 18, 2016, on Page A29 of the New York edition with the headline: Henry J. Heimlich, of Famed Maneuver, Dies at 96. Order Reprints | Today's Paper | Subscribe ",

    "text": "With Ivanka Trump, the Role of First Daughter May Evolve By catherine lucey, associated press DES MOINES, Iowa \u0097 Dec 17, 2016, 1:28 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Nov. 7, 2016 file photo, Ivanka Trump speaks beside her father, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, and vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence during a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H. Ivanka Trump is poised to give the typically minor role of first daughter a major makeover. After playing an outsize role on the campaign trail for President-elect Donald Trump, the 35-year-old\u2019s next moves are being closely watched. She\u2019s been attending transition meetings with high profile figures like Japanese prime minister and Kanye West, has started calling congress members about issues she advocated on the campaign trail and recently made a scouting trip to Washington. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) 0 Shares Email With Ivanka Trump , the typically minor role of a first daughter could get a major makeover. She was a key player in her father's winning campaign, and people are closely watching the next moves by President-elect Donald Trump's 35-year-old daughter. She's attended her father's transition meetings with high-profile figures, including the Japanese prime minister and technology leaders, and has indicated her interest in working on policy issues such as child care. The Trump Organization executive vice president also owns her own company that sells clothes and jewelry. While three of Donald Trump's adult children are viewed as close advisers, he often highlights Ivanka and has made clear that he'd love to have her with him when he moves into the White House . It's not clear whether that would be in a formal position. But Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested this past week that there may be an exception to anti-nepotism laws for Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who runs a real estate and construction business. Previous first daughters have played a social role in the White House. During Harry Truman's presidency, when his wife, Bess, was home in Missouri, their daughter Margaret would play hostess. But it would be \"unprecedented\" for Ivanka Trump to serve as a close adviser, said Katherine Jellison, who heads the history department at Ohio University. \"If there was ever a first daughter who played such a close advisory role to her dad, she really kept it under cover,\" Jellison said. What we know so far about Ivanka Trump: THE BUSINESS With the Trump family, everything comes back to the vast family business empire. Ivanka Trump, one of Donald Trump's three children with his first wife, Ivana, is an executive vice president of the business along with brothers Donald Jr., 38, and Eric, 32. Just how the president-elect will handle his business interests remains unclear. Trump has said he will turn management over to his sons and executives. Ivanka Trump has her own business to consider as well. She recently drew criticism after her company promoted a $10,800 bracelet she wore during a \"60 Minutes\" interview on CBS. The spokeswoman for the company later apologized. Since then, Ivanka Trump has sought to put some distance between herself and her fashion business. A letter posted on her website said that she would separate her social media accounts from her company's. But questions continue to come up. Earlier this month, a \"Coffee with Ivanka Trump\" was listed on a charity fundraising website. Offered by the Eric Trump Foundation, it was to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The auction \u2014 reported on by The New York Times \u2014 drew high bids, but also raised ethics questions. The auction appeared to have been removed from the website Friday. Asked about the change, the Trump team provided a statement from Eric Trump: \"The only people who lost are the children of St. Jude,\" he said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 THE WHITE HOUSE Trump's team says no official decision has been made about Ivanka Trump's role, and she was not made available for an interview for this story. But the president-elect has made his wishes known. \"I think we'll have to see how the laws read. I would love to be able to have them involved,\" Trump said on Fox News of Ivanka Trump and her husband. Congress passed an anti-nepotism law in 1967 that prohibits the president from appointing a family member to work in an office or agency the president oversees. But Conway said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that the law has \"an exception if you want to work in the West Wing, because the president is able to appoint his own staff.\" Still, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said: \"I don't believe that this statue exempts the White House.\" He said Conway's interpretation would be reasonable policy because it would bring family members under conflict of interest rules, but added \"I'm just not convinced that's what the statute says.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 POLICY PLATFORM While much about Ivanka Trump's future role is murky, her policy interests are quite clear. Throughout the campaign she highlighted her interest in issues like child care, pay equity and maternity leave. Her father mentioned those issues rarely. Ivanka Trump met with a group of Republican congresswomen on these issues in September. Since the election, she has reached out to members of Congress to continue the conversation, according to Sarah Chamberlain, the president and CEO of Republican Main Street Partnership, who said she has not heard from the future first daughter. Republican consultant Katie Packer, who opposed Donald Trump, said she was welcoming \"the spotlight that Ivanka Trump is going to put on these issues.\" But Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director MomsRising, an advocacy group for women and families, said she was concerned that the president-elect's conservative Cabinet picks don't share those interests. \"Ivanka Trump is right that child care and paid family leave are national emergencies, but she was not elected to be president of the United States of America and her dad, who was, has taken the opposite approach,\" Rowe-Finkbeiner said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 WHITE HOUSE HOSTESS Throughout the campaign, Ivanka Trump played a more prominent role than Trump's third wife, Melania, who has focused her attention on 10-year-old son Barron. Donald Trump said last month that Melania and Barron Trump would not move from New York to the White House until the end of the school year. She could still come in for major events, but there is historical precedent for a daughter or sister to step in and shoulder some of the social responsibilities. Since the election, Melania Trump has kept a low profile while Ivanka Trump has been a regular fixture at Trump Tower in New York. This past week she appeared in a photo with Kanye West . \u2014\u2014\u2014 On Twitter, follow Catherine Lucey at: http://twitter.com/catherine\u2014lucey 0 Shares ",

Time_Sports Donnel Pumphrey runs past Houston safety Khalil Williams during the second quarter at Sam Boyd Stadium. (Photo: Joshua Dahl,USA TODAY Sports) San Diego State running back Donnel Pumphrey\u2019s 15-yard run in the fourth quarter of the Las Vegas Bowl made him the all-time leading rusher in Football Bowl Subdivision history, pushing him past former Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne. With little acclaim, he charged at the record with consistency: Pumphrey rushed for at least 1,650 yards in each of his final three seasons, capped by a rare 2,000-yard season as a senior. In 2016, Pumphrey paced the Aztecs to a 10-win regular season and the Mountain West Conference championship. He entered the postseason needing 108 yards to break the record held for 17 years by Dayne, who won the Heisman and the Maxwell Award as the nation\u2019s best player for the Badgers in 1999. At the time of Dayne\u2019s four-year career, the NCAA did not count postseason performances in overall statistics. Dayne rushed for 728 yards in four bowl appearances. The amazing thing about Pumphrey is that he's the all-time record holder despite weighing 170 dripping wet. Incredible drive and toughness. ",

FedEx David Goldman / Associated Press Workers sort packages on a conveyor belt before loading them onto trucks for delivery at a FedEx facility in Marietta, Ga., in 2014. Workers sort packages on a conveyor belt before loading them onto trucks for delivery at a FedEx facility in Marietta, Ga., in 2014. (David Goldman / Associated Press) Sarah Halzack Between 10 and 11:30 p.m., as most of Memphis is winding down for the night, the FedEx Express World Hub is revving up for its busiest hours of the day. Some 10,000 workers pour into the campus, ready to begin a mind-bogglingly complex ritual of steering packages to customers' doorsteps on time. Hundreds of equipment operators zoom around the 880-acre site on warehouse tugs, pulling trains of silver shipping containers shaped like half-igloos. In an earsplitting operation dubbed \"the matrix,\" package sorters corral boxes into a single-file line for a trip down a tangle of conveyor belts. On this particular night at FedEx's largest global facility, workers will sort some 1.3 million express packages. That number only swelled when holiday shopping kicked into high gear. This logistical symphony has been decades in the making, the product of billions of dollars in investment in automated sortation systems and Boeing 767 cargo jets. On this night alone, air traffic controllers in the Tennessee city will usher in about 150 flights, an average of one every 40 seconds. Analysts say infrastructure such as this makes FedEx and its rival, UPS , extremely difficult to dislodge from their thrones atop the U.S. shipping industry. Yet as dominant as they are, the stalwarts are also vulnerable, facing a fresh wave of potential disruption. In the last year, Amazon.com has put 4,000 of its own truck trailers on the road and has leased 40 planes from an airfreight company, raising the specter of the e-commerce giant possibly becoming a competitor of the major shippers instead of one of their biggest customers. (Natalie Kitroeff) Uber, meanwhile, has built a fast-growing business out of ferrying people around cities, leading some analysts to wonder whether its network might also be effective at moving goods. Silicon Valley upstarts such as Deliv and Postmates also are making a play for local deliveries. And then, looking to the not-so-distant future, a host of companies pitch drones and driverless vehicles as options that could reshuffle the economics of the delivery business. Amazon announced this month that it had made its first customer delivery via drone. Together, these developments amount to a gathering storm for FedEx's shipping empire. \"The last time the logistics industry has had a change this big was the introduction of the ocean shipping container in the 1960s,\" said Ryan Petersen, chief executive of Flexport, a freight forwarding company. It's a transformation that will test whether sprawling, sophisticated facilities such as the World Hub are a bulwark that protects the company or an expensive anchor that makes it hard to reposition for the future. The central challenge To understand the business environment that FedEx is dealing with, consider the world's changing shopping habits. With every purchase that shoppers make online instead of at a store, they are contributing to a fire-hose gush of new demand for FedEx's services. But the e-commerce beast has a soft underbelly. Delivering those kinds of orders is hard to do profitably. Think about it: The labor and fuel costs required to drop off 50 sweaters at 50 homes is significantly higher than it would be to deliver those same 50 sweaters to a single store. As supply chain geeks like to put it: Density equals profitability. For years now, FedEx and UPS have been working to address this situation by squeezing costs out of their systems. They have introduced software to build more-efficient delivery routes, invested in automation and bought more fuel-efficient vehicles. In some ways, FedEx and UPS are almost impossibly good at what they do: In non-peak season, each of their on-time rates is 98% or greater, according to Shipmatrix, a logistics software firm. (During this holiday season and previous ones, that performance has slipped slightly.) Yet none of this erases their central challenge in the e-commerce era. It is hard to deliver small packages to individual households cheaply and quickly. And newcomers are plotting ways to attack that problem. Their efforts aimed at various points in the logistics chain could collectively eat into the big shippers' business. Change is sweeping in FedEx's scale is, by any measure, enormous. It has 650 aircraft, a fleet bigger than most commercial airlines\u2019. It has more than 150,000 vehicles, employs about 400,000 people and moves about 12 million packages a day. (UPS moves about 18.3 million a day.) The express business relies heavily on the planes to provide overnight shipping around the world. Parcels that aren't quite so urgent might be moved via trucks in the less pricey FedEx Ground service. For e-commerce packages, the company has options for the \"last mile\" of delivery. Via Smartpost, they can hand off packages to the U.S. Postal Service, which will drop off them off during regular delivery hours. Or uniformed FedEx drivers \u2014 often independent contractors, not employees \u2014 can bring them to your home. \u00a0 But change is sweeping in from all directions. In addition to potential moves by Amazon and Uber, regional and local delivery networks are springing up or expanding. And then there's the new, futuristic technology. \"Drone delivery will be the future of what we experience as consumers,\" said Russell Walker, a clinical professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who has studied the concept. Sure, FedEx is perfectly capable of ramping up on drone technology as that becomes a reality. But doing so introduces a host of uncertainties. Drones theoretically could cut costs by reducing trips for human drivers. Yet they can't carry many items, and they can't carry especially big items. Remember the industry's \"density equals profitability\" mantra? Drones don't necessarily fit that bill. And autonomous vehicles raise difficult questions about big shippers' massive workforces. Some workers may\u00a0have to be retrained for more tech-centric jobs such as repairing those driverless trucks, and some workers may\u00a0no longer be needed. Again, Amazon or some other newcomer would not have to deal with these emotional legacy issues. ( Jeffrey P. Bezos , chief executive of Amazon, owns the Washington Post.) Still, FedEx has already proved, to some extent, that it can adjust to dramatic change. For some perspective: Back in 2008, FedEx thought that it hit a major milestone when, on a single day during the holiday rush, it delivered 10 million packages. Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx's senior vice president of marketing and communications, remembers that it felt like a herculean effort \u2014 a big win. Now, FedEx moves more packages than that every day. Last Christmas season, on three separate Mondays, it moved 25 million packages. But this cycle of change could end up being of a different magnitude. Consider this: In September, Mercedes-Benz announced a concept car it calls the Vision Van. As the vehicle zips through urban neighborhoods, automated drones could fly out of it, delivering parcels to homes. Essentially, the van becomes a cargo-storage facility on wheels. Sure, this kind of system is not yet a reality on U.S. streets. But it is exemplary of a future that big companies are already imagining. Potential rivals? You can tell from the tone in FedEx officials' voices that they are tired of being asked whether they are worried about Amazon's latest moves. In some ways, you can't blame them. Amazon has stated repeatedly that its new planes and truck trailers are meant to supplement, not replace, its business with big shippers. The retailer is using those vehicles to transport goods from one Amazon facility to another, not to make deliveries to customers. Despite that publicly proffered explanation for its logistic investments, Amazon is reportedly exploring building out something much more robust, an end-to-end shipping network that would enable it to take its delivery efforts in-house. In theory, that's where things could get worrisome for FedEx, because it could mean losing one of its biggest customers. But actually, if Amazon did wean itself from the shipping giants, the blow wouldn't necessarily be devastating. FedEx says no customer accounts for more than 3% of its revenue. Plus, there are reasons to question whether Amazon would even want to build an internal equivalent of FedEx or UPS. For starters, the capital expenditures to get there would be massive. \"When you have more than 500 aircraft and more than 100,000 vehicles and state-of-the-art automation and sortation ... that scale took a lot of time and investment,\" said Fitzgerald, the FedEx executive. \u00a0 Still, Amazon \u2014 the company that got its start selling books and now makes tablets and TV shows, and provides cloud computing storage \u2014 has a way of barreling into new industries. \"Amazon is the likes of which we've never seen,\" said Dick Metzler, a former FedEx executive who now oversees marketing at UShip, an online freight marketplace. \"So there's no way you can rule it out.\" And with Amazon Flex, a nascent network of on-demand delivery drivers, it is showing at least some interest in creating its own pipeline for getting packages to consumers. The Flex network functions similarly to Uber, the San Francisco\u00a0company that has reportedly risen to a $68-billion valuation as its ride-hailing app has transformed taxi service in America's urban hubs. So couldn't Uber become a FedEx competitor, using its drivers to deliver online purchases to your front door? Potentially, experts say, but there are reasons it might not offer serious competition to the big shippers. Uber was built for connecting riders and drivers for a single trip from Point A to Point B. It is not optimal for efficiently taking a bundle of packages from Point A to many different destinations in a single trip. Its drivers often hit the road in small sedans or compact cars \u2014 not exactly efficient for cramming in lots of boxes. However, Uber did announce in August that it had bought Otto, a start-up focusing on self-driving trucks.\u00a0 There are other challenges\u00a0too. \"If I'm using Uber [for a ride], they don't need to know my height and weight. They don't need to carry me up to the 28th floor,\" Metzler said. \"All those things come into play with parcel delivery.\" The industry\u2019s efforts Even as FedEx is skeptical of would-be challengers, it is working on ways to address the challenges that e-commerce presents. Some of that is through investment in such things as more-advanced sortation capabilities. But the top shippers are also aiming some of these efforts squarely at the shopper. Both FedEx and UPS are eager to trumpet their expansion of \"access points,\" in which customers can opt to have a shipment routed to a designated convenience store, supermarket or other location. This enables online shoppers to pick up packages whenever they want, instead of having them left on a doorstep where they might be vulnerable to thieves or weather. But make no mistake: This is also an effort to help shippers achieve greater profitability. It is better for the bottom line if drivers use just one access point in a given neighborhood instead of zigzagging to a dozen individual houses. Analysts aren't convinced that access points will be a game changer. After all, didn't many people shop online in the first place because they didn't want to make a trip to the store? \"On the margin, in certain markets, it helps, but it doesn't really move the needle,\" said Dave Ross, a transportation and logistics analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. And when people shop online, retailers usually don't let them select a preferred shipper. If you couldn't choose FedEx for your shipment in the first place, what good is it if the company has an ultraconvenient access point right next to your home? FedEx says that kind of choice and control will probably become available over the next 10 years or so,\u00a0but the industry is not there yet.\u00a0 In other words, these kinds of small measures might not be enough. FedEx might still have to make bigger gambles to stay relevant.

Nelson Dollar, right, talks to Rep. David Lewis during a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly at the Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C. on Friday. North Carolina Republicans stripped the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority on Friday and they were on the cusp of an even greater power grab, an extraordinary move that critics said flies in the face of voters. (Photo: Ethan Hyman, AP) North Carolina's outgoing Republican\u00a0governor, Pat McCrory, has signed into law a bill passed by the\u00a0GOP-dominated legislature\u00a0that would strip the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority\u00a0and\u00a0water down his party's control over election\u00a0boards. Democratic lawmakers,\u00a0backed by noisy protesters who\u00a0flooded state house galleries over two days, blasted the quick passage of the new measures as a \"coup\" and \"power grab\" aimed at hobbling Roy Cooper, the current attorney general, who takes office as governor on Jan. 1. McCrory, who lost his re-election bid to Cooper, a Democrat, by 10,000 votes,\u00a0signed the elections board bill Friday afternoon, according to the Associated Press, citing documents from the General Assembly. The new law\u00a0merges the State Board of Elections and State Ethics Commission into one board made up\u00a0equally of Democrats and Republicans. The old\u00a0law would have allowed Cooper to put a majority of Democrats on the elections panel. The law also makes elections for appellate court judgeships officially partisan again. In a\u00a0final twist, the elections bill gives the Court of Appeals, which is dominated by Republicans, a role in constitutional challenges to laws, such as those just passed in the session. Rev.

The bill would also block\u00a0the governor from appointing members of the boards of trustees for University of North Carolina schools. The measures were passed by the\u00a0legislature at a special session called immediately after the close of another two-day special session convened to deal with Hurricane Matthew disaster relief. Democrats said it was an attempt by the GOP to cling to power a week after the Republican incumbent conceded. \"I really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\" said Rep. Billy Richardson, a Democrat.

Gov. Dan Forest told crowds in the gallery to be quiet. The uproar\u00a0came\u00a0one day after some 200 demonstrators \u2014 some shouting \"You work for us\" \u2014\u00a0interrupted a special session of the state's General Assembly, leading to the arrests of 17 people,\u00a0including civic leaders, university staff and faculty\u00a0and clergy. Cooper\u00a0has threatened to sue to challenge the new measures.\u00a0\"What's happening now may look like partisan political games but the result could hurt North Carolinians,\" Cooper said Thursday. Rachel Jordan protests outside the House gallery during a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly at the Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C., on Friday. North Carolina Republicans stripped the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority on Friday and they were on the cusp of an even greater power grab, an extraordinary move that critics said flies in the face of voters. \u00a0(Photo: Ethan Hyman, AP) Cooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans' agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights. \"Once more, the courts will have to clean up the mess the legislature made, but it won't stop us from moving North Carolina forward,\" Cooper said in a statement late Friday. Republicans rejected the Democrat's complaints, saying some of those measures had been discussed for years. Rep. Nelson Dollar, a Republican, said\u00a0that all the steps were legal and noted that Democrats, for decades, used every tactic they could to keep the minority party under their thumb, the Observer reports. \u201cThis isn\u2019t mob rule,\u201d Dollar said. \u201cIt\u2019s majority rule. ... This is no coup. Every member was elected in a constitutional way.\u201d Republicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities, holding 108 of 170 seats even though the state has been more closely divided in recent statewide and federal elections. GOP legislators have been able to expand their majorities thanks to approving redistricting maps in 2011. But nearly 30 of those legislative districts were struck down last summer. A federal court has directed updated maps be approved by March 15. North Carolina is a presidential battleground state that Barack Obama won in 2008 by just over 14,000 votes. Four years later, Mitt Romney edged Obama by about 92,000 votes. Donald Trump won in November.

Tax records show the family of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave thousands of dollars to this and other settlements.

Tax records show the family of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave thousands of dollars to this and other settlements. (Nasser Nasser / AP) Tracy Wilkinson and Joshua Mitnick Contact Reporter Here in the desert hills of the\u00a0West Bank, near\u00a0the Palestinians\u2019 principal city of\u00a0Ramallah, a group of Orthodox Jews has\u00a0built the town of Beit El, a place\u00a0that most of the world considers an illegal\u00a0settlement constructed on\u00a0occupied Palestinian land. For decades, U.S. policy has opposed such settlements as harmful to the peace process. But the\u00a0Israeli\u00a0settlers now have some well-placed American supporters. Funds\u00a0to help construct Beit El came\u00a0partly from a U.S.-based foundation run by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the Kushner\u00a0family. And David Friedman, Trump\u2019s long-time real estate lawyer who was named Thursday as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel, served as the president of the American Friends of Beit El foundation. His name is on a girls\u2019 school in the settlement in tribute to his support. The amounts given by the Kushners were small; $5,000 here, $10,000 there, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. But they constitute another piece in the puzzle of how\u00a0the\u00a0Trump administration will approach one of the Middle East\u2019s most\u00a0intractable conflicts. There are growing signs that\u00a0Trump is poised to upend\u00a0decades of U.S. foreign policy on dealing with Israelis and Palestinians,\u00a0giving Israel a freer hand to build settlements\u00a0and relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Several of Trump\u2019s advisers have said they do not regard settlements as illegitimate or obstacles to peace. Unlike President Obama, who pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to temporarily freeze some settlement construction on land seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, known to many as the Six-Day War, Trump appears less likely to pressure Israel to constrain its building. Israeli settlers Jim Hollander / EPA Israeli settlers hold morning prayers in the Jewish settlement called Amona, in the West Bank on Dec. 16, 2016. Israel's high court has ruled the \"illegal outpost settlement\" must be evacuated and demolished before Dec. 25, 2016. Israeli settlers hold morning prayers in the Jewish settlement called Amona, in the West Bank on Dec. 16, 2016. Israel's high court has ruled the \"illegal outpost settlement\" must be evacuated and demolished before Dec. 25, 2016. (Jim Hollander / EPA) \u201cI think it is safe to say that we will see diminished American efforts to promote traditional diplomacy, traditional critique of Israeli settlement activity or the need to resume some peace process with the Palestinians,\u201d said Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. At the same time, Trump said in an interview with the New York Times that he would \u201clove\u201d to be the president who finally made peace between Israel and the Palestinians; he has said it would be the \u201cultimate deal.\u201d Trump even went so far as to say Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, might serve as a special envoy to the Middle East to work on Israeli-Palestinian issues \u2014 a prospect many consider preposterous given the younger Kushner\u2019s absolute lack of diplomatic experience and because he would be seen as biased in favor of Israel. Trump has also said he would move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something almost no country in the world has done because Jerusalem is disputed. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians claim it, or part of it, as their capital, and the U.S. position for decades has been that its status must be resolved through negotiations. Past U.S. presidents\u00a0made similar pledges about relocating the U.S. embassy. But upon taking office, all concluded such a step would not only provoke Palestinians, but also unsettle Arab allies throughout the region. After his appointment was announced,\u00a0Friedman stated he looked forward to forging the U.S. bond with Israel \"from the U.S. embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem.\u201d Friedman also has voiced opposition to\u00a0the so-called two-state solution, the existence of an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side by side in peace, which has been\u00a0the basis of U.S. policy since the 1950s\u00a0and the framework for peace negotiations in that part of the world.\u00a0At a Jerusalem election rally shortly before the U.S. election, he vowed that a Trump administration would never pressure Israel to accept a Palestinian state. Such assertions explain why several U.S. Jewish groups reacted negatively to Friedman\u2019s selection.\u00a0Friedman\u2019s positions on the two-state solution \"foreclose on the possibility of advancing,\" Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, said in an interview. By abandoning the two-state solution, \u201cthey\u2019re saying they are not bound by the last 25 years\u201d of history,\u00a0said Michael Koplow, policy director of the Israel\u00a0Policy Forum, a liberal think tank that focuses on Israel. Dennis Ross, veteran diplomat who served as Middle East envoy in Republican and Democratic administrations, cautioned that Trump will not be able to write\u00a0off\u00a0the Palestinians altogether if a real resolution is to come about. \u201cThe first thing is you have to restore a sense of possibility,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThere is no sense of possibility on either side now.\u201d ",

Jake Arrieta finally paid off his debt to Cubs teammate Tommy La Stella , though the consequences are permanent. Six months ago, the two made a wager on the College World Series in which Arrieta\u2019s alma mater, TCU, faced La Stella\u2019s alma mater, Coastal Carolina, in a semifinal. The loser was to get a tattoo of the winner\u2019s school logo after the game. Coastal Carolina won and went on to win the title but Arrieta opted to wait until after the Cubs won the franchise\u2019s first World Series since 1908 to pay up. Arrieta, the 2015 National League Cy Young winner, revealed via Twitter on Friday a photo of his newest tattoo, proof he made good on his word with La Stella, an infielder. \u201cNot ideal but a bet is a bet,\u201d the tweet said. Under Arrieta\u2019s words were three more words: \u201cCCU \u201916 champs.\u201d The location and size of the tattoo isn\u2019t clear. Arrieta\u2019s wife, Brittany, tweeted a plea for her husband to make no more bets with such consequences.\u00a0 \u201cMan of his word,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could refrain from any more bets like this please.\u201d Shortly after he won the wager, La Stella left a Coast Carolina placard at Arrieta\u2019s locker in the clubhouse in Miami before leaving for a minor-league rehab assignment. Arrieta joked in June that he would get a tattoo that could be seen only under a black light. ",

Police said Saturday the 27-year-old, whose name was not given, was detained at the city's long-distance bus station while he was still on a bus. Police wouldn't elaborate but said the city's prosecutor's office would comment Sunday. Local media say the man is originally from Bulgaria . The attack occurred in October but police only released the video last week in an appeal to help identify the suspect. The video went viral and led to a massive outcry over its casual brutality, with some people offering rewards for the man's arrest. The victim had to be hospitalized after the attack. 0 Shares ",

But the ministry warned Saturday that the apparent \"hyping up\" of the issue by the U.S. was only making matters worse. In a tweet early Saturday morning, President-elect Donald Trump took aim at the Chinese, accusing them of stealing the unmanned underwater vehicle. He tweeted the same message again a few hours later to correct an earlier misspelling. \"China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act,\" he said in the corrected version. China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 17, 2016 The drone was grabbed Thursday \u2014 the first seizure of its kind in recent memory \u2014 about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay off the Philippines, just as the USNS Bowditch was about to retrieve the device, U.S. officials said. USNS Bowditch U.S. Navy The Defense Ministry said a Chinese naval vessel discovered a piece of \"unidentified equipment\" and checked it to prevent any navigational safety issues, before discovering it was a U.S. drone. \"China decided to return it to the U.S. side in an appropriate manner, and China and the U.S. have all along been in communication about it,\" the ministry said on its website. \"During this process, the U.S. side's unilateral and open hyping up is inappropriate, and is not beneficial to the smooth resolution of this issue. We express regret at this,\" it added. Without directly saying whether the drone was operating in waters China considers its own, the ministry said U.S. ships and aircraft have for a long period been carrying out surveillance and surveys in \"the presence\" of Chinese waters. Related: Pentagon: Chinese Navy Stole U.S. Underwater Drone Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook confirmed that the Chinese agreed to hand the drone back after the U.S. \"registered our objection to China's unlawful seizure\" of the underwater vehicle. The U.S. had previously said the device was operating lawfully and was collecting oceanic data as part of a routine survey overseen by civilian contractors. The Pentagon confirmed the incident at a news briefing Friday and viewed China's seizure as serious since it had effectively taken U.S. military property. \"It is ours, and it is clearly marked as ours and we would like it back. And we would like this not to happen again,\" Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said. Defense officials told NBC News the drone's seizure does not likely qualify as an act of war. \"No one here is freaking out about this, but it was unprofessional,\" the official said. The incident follows a series of strained exchanges with China, including over that nation's sharp rebuke of Trump's recent phone call with Taiwan's president \u2014 a departure from a decades-long \"one China\" policy.

That is the attention-grabbing idea behind a project that aims to promote cultural understanding and dialogue by offering face-to-face encounters with Jews living in Germany. A postcard publicizing the \"Rent A Jew\" project. Rent A Jew via European Janusz Korczak Academy \"We wanted to loosen things up a bit and remove reservations right from the start,\" said 32-year old Alexander Rasumny, one of the initiative's organizers. Amid the rise of far-right political parties and anti-Semitism across Europe, organizers believe the seminars provide an important chance to overcome prejudice and could serve \"as a long-term prevention project.\" The \"rented\" Jews are not professional speakers but volunteers of different ages and backgrounds who visit schools, universities and churches free of charge. \"With the direct encounters between Jews and non-Jewish citizens in Germany, far beyond the clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, we are allowing people to speak with each other rather than about each other,\" Rasumny said. Germany is home to more than 200,000 Jews but most people in the country \"have never met a Jew,\" Rasumny said. While the Holocaust and anti-Semitism are \"important discussion points,\" they are not at the center of the the project, Rasumny told NBC News. \"We want to talk about modern Jewish life in Germany in a relaxed atmosphere,\" he explained. In Germany alone, reports of anti-Semitic crimes have risen threefold in one year. A Jewish man in Berlin, Germany. Rent A Jew via European Janusz Korczak Academy A spokeswoman for Germany's Justice Ministry said the department registered 2,083 cases of attacks on Jews or Jewish property and hate speech against Jews in 2015 \u2014 compared with 691 the previous year. The number of violent offences motivated by right-wing extremism also rose significantly in 2015, with more than 1,400 registered crimes. According to Germany's domestic intelligence agency, BfV, this \"clearly illustrates the threat posed by this spectrum.\" The \"Rent-a-Jew\" initiative was launched last year by a group of volunteers and now hosts sessions every two-to-three weeks across the country. More than 50 people have signed up as contributors, most of them aged between 20 and 40. \"We have had nothing but positive feedback from our sessions,\" Rasumny added. Andy Eckardt ",

While those players remain suspended, the team said they agreed on other conditions in order for the rest of them to return. In making their decision, the team also acknowledged the issue of sexual assault \u2014 the reason that led to the players' suspension this week \u2014 and said finishing out the year was important. Related: University of Minnesota Football Players Boycott Activities \"So many before us have given so much to this University and this football team; so many coaches, staff, administrators, professors, alumni, fans, and our community have invested heavily in the success of our program,\" the team said in a prepared statement. \"We recognize that we must not let these people down.\" On Thursday, the uniformed Gophers players stood shoulder-to-shoulder during a news conference to say all 99 teammates would boycott practices before the Dec. 27 bowl \u2014 and would skip the sporting spectacle against Washington State University altogether \u2014 if the school did not lift the suspensions of the 10 players. But the team said Saturday they recognized they were in a losing position. \"After many hours of discussion within our team, and after speaking with President (Eric) Kaler, it became clear that our original request of having the 10 suspensions overturned was not going to happen,\" their statement said. The Minnesota Golden Gophers look to the sideline for instructions in the second quarter against the Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium on Nov.26, 2016, in Madison, Wisconsin. Dylan Buell / Getty Images During a meeting Friday night with Kaler and university athletic director Mark Coyle, the students said they came to a different agreement: Allow the suspended players to get a \"fair hearing\" on the issue with a \"diverse review panel\" and have the school show greater support for the overall team. In addition, the team said, the players would \"use our status as public figures to bring more exposure to the issue of sexual harassment and violence against women.\" Details of the agreements would be forthcoming, the team added. Kaler told reporters Saturday that the school does stand behind its football team. \"I think the statement by the students today around support for victims of sexual assault is important,\" he said. \"I will continue to amplify the fact that the football team's action in support of their teammates was not in support of sexual violence.\" The suspension of the 10 players stems from a Sept. 2 incident in which a female student had sexual contact with players. In a redacted police report, a police investigator said the sexual encounter with one player appeared to be consensual based on videos taken at the time and shown to police by the player, according to the Star-Tribune newspaper. However, the Star-Tribune reported, the woman told police that sexual contact with three other players was not consensual. During the course of the night, she said, she had been drinking and had sex with one player. But she was forced to have sex with others against her will, she said in court testimony in order to obtain a restraining order against five of the players. University of Minnesota football team members talk to reporters in Minneapolis on Dec. 15, 2016. Jeff Wheeler / AP While six players were involved in the incident itself, police said, it's unclear why the others have been implicated. In the end, no players were ever arrested, and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office on Oct. 3 said it declined to press charges because of \"insufficient\" evidence. An attorney for the 10 players said he will appeal the suspensions. Students opposed to the team's decision to have a boycott gathered to protest on the university's campus Saturday. The demonstration asked for the community to \"#standwithsurvivors.\" \u2014 regan (@thatsoregan) December 17, 2016 Nevertheless, in addressing the boycott Saturday, the team said while they still have questions about why certain players were suspended, the players don't condone violence against women. \"There is only one acceptable way to treat all women and all men, and that is with the utmost of respect at all times,\" the team said.

The video originally did not have audio -- the state's attorney's office added audio. Warning: Video contains graphic images. It has not been altered by the Chicago Tribune. Police dash-cam video of the October 2014 fatal shooting of Ronald Johnson by a Chicago police officer. The video originally did not have audio -- the state's attorney's office added audio. Warning: Video contains graphic images. It has not been altered by the Chicago Tribune. The Independent Police Review Authority has determined that a Chicago police officer was justified in fatally shooting 25-year-old Ronald Johnson III in the back in October 2014. In a ruling released Friday evening, the agency that investigates shootings by police stated that Officer George Hernandez was justified in shooting the African-American man as he ran from police because evidence supports officers' contention that he had a gun. Attorneys for Johnson's family have alleged that officers planted the gun and conspired to cover up the truth about Johnson's shooting on the South Side. Ronald Johnson Ronald Johnson III, 25, was fatally shot Oct. 12, 2014, by Chicago police. Ronald Johnson III, 25, was fatally shot Oct. 12, 2014, by Chicago police. (Family photo) IPRA ruled that the preponderance of the evidence indicated that Johnson was armed and Hernandez reasonably believed he was a threat. Witnesses gave conflicting statements, IPRA wrote, but investigators recovered a Browning 9 mm pistol with grass and Johnson's blood on it beneath his hand. The IPRA report states that agency officials do not believe that all shootings of people fleeing with guns would be justified. \"In this case, there are specific and numerous circumstances that make such use of force reasonable,\" the report said. \"It's the same old incompetent IPRA. Nothing has changed,\" said attorney Michael Oppenheimer, who represents Johnson's mother in her wrongful death lawsuit in federal court. \"Their investigation was jaded and didn't take into account much of the evidence against Hernandez. Their ruling is a sham.\" Johnson's shooting generated controversy as grainy video of the shooting was released late last year just after the city was forced to release footage of Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teen Laquan McDonald 16 times. The McDonald video led to sustained protests fueled by long-standing grievances about police conduct, particularly among African-Americans, and the U.S. Justice Department is continuing to investigate whether Chicago police have systematically violated citizens' rights. Mayor Rahm Emanuel , meanwhile, has tried to stay ahead of federal authorities by announcing a series of reforms. Protests broke out in December 2015 in response to Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's announcement that she would not charge a Chicago police officer in the 2014 shooting of Ronald Johnson III. Before the McDonald video was released, IPRA had almost never ruled a shooting by police unjustified, and Tribune investigations have shown the agency to be slow and prone to clearing police, even when evidence suggested misconduct. After the scandal erupted, however, Emanuel replaced the agency's leader with former federal prosecutor Sharon Fairley, who has acknowledged shortcomings in IPRA's past work and ruled several shootings unjustified. Fairley will be the first head of the Civilian Office on Police Accountability, the agency that city officials are building to replace the beleaguered IPRA. In the McDonald case, Van Dyke is charged with murder, but Cook County prosecutors declined to press charges in Johnson's shooting. According to prosecutors, early on Oct. 12, 2014, Johnson and others left a party near 53rd Street and King Drive before a gunman shot out the rear window of their vehicle. Later, police responding to calls of shots fired saw Johnson running east on 53rd with a gun in his right hand, and officers pursued him, prosecutors said. He was confronted by an officer who tried to arrest him, but a scuffle ensued, and Johnson broke free as the officer fell to the ground, according to prosecutors. Then Hernandez arrived, and video showed he opened fire about two seconds after exiting his car as Johnson ran toward a park with his back to officers. Two of the five shots struck Johnson, one in the back of his shoulder and the other in the back of the leg, autopsy reports show. dhinkel@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "CBS/AP December 17, 2016, 4:29 PM Corpus Christi had 3 reports of dirty water before ban, official says Email CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas -- There were three reports of dirty water before the 300,000 residents of Corpus Christi were told not to drink the city\u2019s water due to a chemical leak at an asphalt plant, a top Corpus Christi official said Saturday, adding that the city has not found evidence of water contamination.\u00a0 More than 300,000 people in Corpus Christi, Texas, are being warned not to drink their tap water, or use it for anything else. Officials discover... Water use was resuming for some parts of the city - some fully, others for washing purposes only, city spokeswoman DeAnna McQueen said Saturday. CBS Corpus Christi affiliate KZTV reported recommended levels of water use in different districts were broken down by three zones.\u00a0 In zone one, water could once again be used for all activities. Zone two was cleared for partial use and people were allowed to do limited activities such as bathing and showering. \u201cHowever, due to the potential for contaminated water, infants and young children should not bathe using water since they may swallow some of it and additional water testing is needed,\u201d the city said in a statement posted online on Friday.\u00a0 Others including individuals undergoing chemotherapy and those with HIV/AIDS should also avoid consuming the water, and the zone should not use the water for drinking or food preparation, the city said. The third zone still had a total ban by early Saturday afternoon. Assistant City Manager Mark Van Vleck said the first \u201cdirty-water report\u201d came Dec. 1 from the Valero-owned administration building at the asphalt plant that\u2019s leased to Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions. City workers flushed the pipe. A second report came from the same building Dec. 7, he said, and the main was flushed again. \u201cWe get dirty water reports all the time,\u201d Van Vleck said of the first two, saying old cast-iron pipes are usually the reason. But Monday, Valero workers told the public works department \u201csomething white and sudsy\u201d was in water at the administration building. City workers determined there was a leak in a chemical tank at the asphalt plant and on Tuesday determined there was a backflow problem. The city told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality about it Wednesday, Van Vleck said, and hours later, the state banned use of public drinking water . Mayor Dan McQueen has said local officials only learned of the leak Wednesday. TCEQ officials did not respond to a request for comment Saturday. Van Vleck cautioned that the investigation is ongoing, \u201cso we don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not know (if there was contamination) because we can\u2019t prove it.\u201d A TCEQ report obtained Friday indicates that a combination of Indulin AA-86 and hydrochloric acid leaked into the water supply. Indulin is an asphalt-emulsifying agent that\u2019s corrosive and can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. The amber liquid is considered a hazardous material by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to see it in water,\u201d Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman Terry Clawson said Friday. Ergon has said it has been in contact with the TCEQ and was \u201cworking cooperatively to provide all information to ensure state officials can remedy the situation as quickly as possible.\u201d On Saturday, company spokesman Bill Miller said the Ergon is pushing the TCEQ for answers on whether there was actually contamination. \u201cInaction is bad for people in our position. The longer we sit here, the worse it looks,\u201d he said. More than a half-dozen lawsuits have been filed against oil refiner Valero and the privately held Flowood, Mississippi-based Ergon subsidiary, which makes paving and pavement preservation products. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported that several businesses and a class-action lawsuit representing all of the city\u2019s residents allege the companies recklessly exposed business owners and residents to toxic chemicals. Van Vleck said the city made the Ergon plant install new valves, but has not restored water service to the plant. It\u2019s the latest in a string of water scares for the Gulf Coast city. In May, the city issued its third boil-water advisory in a year as a precaution after nitrogen-rich runoff from rain flowed into the water system, resulting in low chlorine disinfectant levels in the water supply. State and federal environmental records list no problems at the plant over the past five years. A TCEQ record lists an emergency response March 24 as having been closed. Clawson said he had no details, and Van Vleck said he was unaware of any incident. Nationwide, the Environmental Protection Agency reports no current \u201csignificant violations\u201d at Ergon facilities but shows seven receiving fines since 2010, the highest $17,200 at a Vicksburg, Mississippi, refinery. Officials have said plenty of bottled water has been donated to help residents, and no one has turned up at hospitals with symptoms that might indicate they were sickened or burned by the chemical.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "WATCH Escaped Tennessee Inmates Caught After 150-Mile Crime Spree 0 Shares Email Two inmates who escaped from a jailhouse in rural Tennessee were captured in northern Georgia hours later Friday night following a high-speed chase, authorities said. The inmates, identified as Adam Lethco, 24, and Matthew Porter, 27, had been on the run since escaping from a Jefferson County jail with two other inmates early Friday morning. The escape occurred when deputies were treating Lethco for a hand injury at the Jefferson County Work House in Dandridge. As the deputies left the prison cell, four inmates assaulted them and stole the keys to a deputy's vehicle before fleeing the jailhouse at around 12:15 a.m., according to the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The stolen vehicle, a black Chevy, was spotted by a volunteer firefighter on Highway 411 and later found abandoned on a road in Sevierville. Soon after, Sevier County deputies took one of the escaped inmates -- identified as 22-year-old Jimmy Moore -- into custody. Then at around 3:45 a.m., deputies from Sevier and Jefferson counties took another escaped inmate into custody, 26-year-old Richard Lorenz, deputies said. 4 Inmates Escape Tennessee Jail in Deputy's Vehicle; 2 Still at Large Moore and Lorenz were transported back to Jefferson County jail and charged with aggravated assault on an officer and escape. Meanwhile, Lethco and Porter stole a flatbed truck and led authorities on a high-speed chase, Jefferson County Sheriff G. W. \"Bud\" McCoig said. Lethco is serving an eight-year sentence for aggravated burglary, theft and vehicle theft. Porter is in the first year of a six-year sentence for reckless endangerment and evading arrest. He is also wanted in Alabama for violating probation and is to serve 12 years in prison there, according to deputies. Georgia authorities took over when the two men crossed the state line on Interstate 75. The hours-long chase ended just south of Dalton, where state troopers used stop sticks to blow out the tires of the stolen vehicle, according to a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Safety. Lethco and Porter were taken into custody and transported to the Whitfield County Jail. Georgia State Patrol will only be handling any traffic charges related to the pursuit, authorities said.

    "text": "Dec 17 2016, 9:41 am ET Robert Durst Said Giving Details About Missing Wife Would Be 'Pleading Guilty' by Andrew Blankstein, Hannah Rappleye and Tracy Connor Share advertisement Los Angeles prosecutors have released a transcript of a 2015 interrogation of millionaire murder suspect Robert Durst in which he says he can't provide details about the disappearance of his first wife and the murder of a close friend because it would amount to \"pleading guilty.\" Durst, 73, then mused aloud about what would be in it for him to give information about the two women to investigators. \"As I see it, all you could for me is tell me that 'this is the best prison in California and that I will recommend you go there,\" the real-estate heir said, according to the transcript. Real estate heir Robert Durst, right, sits with his Attorney Dick De Guerin during a long-awaited appearance in a courtroom in Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 7, 2016. Kevork Djansezian / Pool Photo via AP The conversation with Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin took place shortly after Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a warrant out of Los Angeles. Authorities in LA have since charged him with the 2000 murder of confidante Susan Berman, allegedly killed because she knew too much about the 1982 vanishing of Kathie Durst, who is presumed dead. Durst danced around questions about both women in the interview, sometimes saying he was going to \"stay away\" from talking about certain aspects, according to the transcript. \"You'd like some details from me about if I knew where Kathie's body is,\" Durst said to the prosecutor at one point. \"And about what happened with Susan.\" When Lewin said that's what he wanted, Durst said, \"If I tell you those things, I'm pleading guilty.\" Durst has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers said the interview with their client, outside the presence of his attorneys, was an \"improper interrogation.\" The transcript, which was released as part of a motion ahead of a hearing next Wednesday, also contained the following revelations: \u2022 Durst says he was on methamphetamines when he films the HBO documentary series \"The Jinx,\" which examined his ties to Kathie Durst's disappearance, Berman's slaying and the 2003 dismemberment of a neighbor in Texas. The series ended with Durst muttering into a hot mic that he \"killed them all.\" \"The whole time I was on meth,\" Durst told the prosecutor, according to the transcript. \"I think the reason I did it had to be because I was swooped, speeding.\" He also said that he smoked pot every day for as long as he could remember. \u2022 Durst said he only had five years left to live after losing his esophagus to cancer and struggling with hydrocephalous, or fluid on the brain. \"So there's not much I could agree with anybody that somebody could offer me, unless they could offer me more life,\" he said when Lewin asked him about his hopes for the future. \u2022 Durst said he didn't flee right after \"The Jinx\" wrapped, when he was confronted with a damning piece of newly unearthed evidence, because of \"inertia.\" Durst, who was allegedly on his way to Cuba when he was caught in New Orleans, also said that he really doesn't like life on the run. \"Being a fugitive was not something I did well,\" he said. \"I was the worst fugitive the world has ever met.\" \u2022 Durst seemed unsure of whether he has Asperger's syndrome, which is on the spectrum of autism disorders, as his lawyers have claimed. \"I never thought that amounted to anything,\" he told Lewin. But then he added, \"The thing with Asperger's syndrome is intelligent people don't get along or don't enjoy communicating with other people. And that is certainly me.\" Durst denies killing Berman. He has not been charged in connection with Kathie Durst's apparent death but denies killing her in the interview with Lewin. \"If you had killed Susan, would you tell me?\" Lewin asked him. \"No,\" Durst said. Durst was acquitted of the murder of Texas neighbor Morris Black after he argued he killed him in self-defense and dismembered his body in a panic. He is currently serving a seven-year sentence for gun possession. Andrew Blankstein ",

    "text": "E.U. Faces Its Next Big Test as France\u2019s Election Looms By STEVEN ERLANGER and KIMIKO DE FREYTAS-TAMURA DEC. 17, 2016 Continue reading the main story Photo Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front and a serious contender in France\u2019s 2017 presidential election, is a fierce opponent of membership in the European Union. Credit Martin Bureau/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images LE LUC, France \u2014 When the French put a draft Constitution for a newly enlarged European Union to a referendum in 2005, Pascal Verrelle voted passionately against it \u2014 hoping it would stop the European Union in its tracks. He rejoiced when the effort failed, yet was dismayed when the bloc kept gathering more members and powers, anyway. At the time, Mr. Verrelle, a former soldier, was a prison director, but he eventually felt compelled to enter politics and joined the far-right National Front. When he was elected mayor of this small town in Provence eight months ago, the first thing he did was to take down the European Union flag from City Hall. \u201cIn 2005, a majority voted against Europe, and we still find ourselves in Europe, by magic,\u201d he said, \u201cand I find it inadmissible.\u201d Today the European Union is wobbling under the weight of problems encouraged in part by that unchecked expansion \u2014 stagnant economies, the euro crisis, new pressures from Russia and deep strains over migration, especially from newer members in Central and Eastern Europe. Continue reading the main story But a visit to Le Luc and other villages in southern France is a reminder that the European Union faces yet another serious problem long in the making \u2014 a crisis of legitimacy \u2014 that is fueling right-wing, nationalist politics even in the traditional core of the bloc. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Mr. Verrelle, 2005 was a watershed. Since then, opposition to a much-enlarged, poorer and vastly more diverse European Union has only increased. So has support for the National Front and its leader, Marine Le Pen, who has emerged as a serious contender in France\u2019s presidential race. Having already suffered a \u201cBrexit\u201d vote this year in Britain, Europe faces a series of critical elections in the year ahead. But none is more important than the vote in France, a founding European Union member. The British decision to quit the European Union was a major blow, but a victory by Ms. Le Pen could be the death knell. And with the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States, that prospect has taken on new weight. \u201cDonald Trump makes Marine Le Pen sound reasonable,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a special adviser to the Foundation for Strategic Research in France and chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cHis victory gives her respectability. Everyone knows she\u2019s not Trump \u2014 she knows how to use a noun and a verb and is intellectually coherent about what she wants and doesn\u2019t want.\u201d What Ms. Le Pen wants is to lead France out of the euro currency and out of the bloc. She has said she would hold a popular referendum, \u00e0 la Britain, on French membership in the European Union \u2014 a test of public will that mainstream French politicians, she says, are afraid to have. Photo \u201cIn 2005, a majority voted against Europe, and we still find ourselves in Europe, by magic, and I find it inadmissible\u201d said Pascal Verrelle, the mayor of Le Luc and a member of the National Front. Credit Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times From the mood here in southern France, a \u201cFrexit\u201d push would probably prevail in a referendum, just as 55 percent voted in 2005 against the Constitution that a former French president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, had drafted. The French \u201cnon\u201d killed the treaty, intended to create new federal institutions for a bloc enlarged the year before by 10 countries, mostly former Soviet-bloc countries like Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. \u201cIn a way, Frexit already happened,\u201d said a prominent regional Socialist member of Parliament, Jean-David Ciot. \u201cEurope did not keep its promises, to create a world of wealth and full employment.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cPeople feel peace has been attained but fear that the rest of the world has come to undermine this wealth,\u201d Mr. Ciot added. \u201cThey fear Europe is not protecting them from these migrants who come to pillage and steal their wealth.\u201d Brexit, he said, is \u201cjust a symptom of the rest \u2014 the feeling that we no longer share a common destiny.\u201d Since 2005, said Mr. Verrelle, southern France has been shifting steadily toward the National Front and its opposition to the European Union. In the last three elections, he said, \u201csupport has been growing systematically.\u201d The former prison director is scathing about the radicalization of young French Muslims and the dangers he says he believes that uncontrolled immigration poses to France. \u201cWhen I saw the prayers in the corridors of the prison, and others hiding their crosses, I knew we were lost,\u201d Mr. Verrelle said. \u201cWhat\u2019s most dangerous about Europe is the loss of borders, and today we see the result,\u201d he added, speaking of terrorist attacks and migrant flows. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Daesh,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing in a Trojan horse times 1,000.\u201d As for the European Union, it has no clear political direction, Mr. Verrelle said, adding that it is too diverse economically for a single currency and too weak to allow freedom of travel.

It\u2019s not a solution that will last.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story About 90 minutes away, in La Tour d\u2019Aigues, overlooked by the ruins of a Renaissance castle demolished during the French Revolution, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front organized a protest against plans to bring about 30 teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan to the nearby town of Grambois. The protesters, fewer than 200, were met by about 300 counterdemonstrators holding up banners showing solidarity with the refugees, while 90 riot police officers, dressed in black protective clothing, ringed the two groups to keep them apart. Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, a niece of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s and a rising star of the National Front, addressed the crowd from a makeshift podium, tossing her blond hair behind her. \u201cIt is not the hate of others, it is love for Provence, love for France,\u201d Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, 27, shouted into the microphone, as counterprotesters whistled and booed to try to drown her out. She railed against a \u201cdictatorial\u201d European Commission that \u201cworks to undermine national sovereignty.\u201d Asylum seekers coming to France receive generous payouts, she said, while the Vaucluse region, the home of La Tour d\u2019Aigues, is the sixth poorest in France, where one in five people are without jobs. \u201cWe are against this completely crazy plan to redistribute migrants,\u201d Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen said in a brief interview after her speech. The European project \u201cis a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to build another Europe.\u201d The wave of anger and identity politics is washing over France, with the ready-made instrument of a modernized National Front under Ms. Le Pen, 48. She has now become both a symbol and an agent of a kind of defensive French nationalism that is proving very popular, especially in the southwest and north, near the Belgian border. Advertisement As the European Union struggles with fundamental issues of coherence, policy and solidarity, she has also become a plausible, if unlikely, president of France \u2014 almost sure to make the two-candidate runoff for the post in May. Photo Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, a rising star of the National Front, addressed a protest against plans to bring teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan to southern France, in October. Credit Bertrand Langlois/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Brussels is an easy target, especially for politicians like her seeking to blame domestic ills on some supranational agency. \u201cThere is huge disappointment with Europe,\u201d said Sylvie Goulard, a French member of the European Parliament for this region. \u201cBut a tendency to blame Europe for national competencies \u2014 hospitals and nurses, malaise of the police, housing \u2014 these are all Franco-French failures, nothing to do with Europe.\u201d The mood is worse in the south, Ms. Goulard said. \u201cI\u2019m from the south, and people are angry and frustrated,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you realize that lack of transportation or the failure to integrate foreigners are not the fault of Europe, but Le Pen is exploiting these issues.\u201d But even Ms. Goulard, who has announced her candidacy to become speaker of the European Parliament, acknowledges Brussels\u2019s many failures. It has not created functioning external borders, and its response to the migrant issue has caused severe strains among member countries and undermined solidarity. \u201cIt would be stupid to be too optimistic,\u201d Ms. Goulard said. \u201cBut we have tried to do something never done on earth, to get so many people to live and trade together in peace.\u201d There are some strong proponents of Europe, too. Alain-Pierre Merger, president of the Maison de l\u2019Europe de Provence, the regional chapter of an association that supports the European Union and promotes European citizenship, said that it would be a tragedy to break up the union, and that young people now feel a European identity that must be strengthened. \u201cEurope is an idea, but it must be seen to be working,\u201d he said. One of the members of the chapter, Caroline Brun, 23, said: \u201cThis has been a tough year for our hopes.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many blame Europe for the migrants, she said, adding: \u201cBut it\u2019s not Europe. It\u2019s the fault of the politicians of European states who use Europe as a scapegoat.\u201d At La Tour d\u2019Aigues, even the town\u2019s Socialist mayor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lovisolo, expressed disenchantment. Europe has \u201cfailed to fight for a European identity,\u201d he said. The monetary and economic union that underpins Europe did not translate into a closer political and social union, he said, \u201cand Europe is not working.\u201d Ms. Le Pen\u2019s supporters could not agree more. \u00c9douard, a former colonel who served in Kosovo who declined to give his surname, said at the rally that \u201cwe have not seen the benefits\u201d of Europe. \u201cMy generation was told, \u2018You are European,\u2019 and there was great hope and excitement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that translated into a recession. It has been a terrible disappointment.\u201d ",

She'd spent half of her 12 years in prison trying to get her wish. \"Don't give up hope,\" Martinson recalled telling them. \"There is always hope.\" But there is less of it. As Obama's second term draws to a close, so does his two-year-old clemency initiative, which gives relief to drug offenders serving terms that would have been shorter if they'd been prosecuted under current sentencing laws. He has given out more than 1,000 commutations, more than the last 11 presidents combined. But the total is just a tiny fraction of the 31,800 petitions he received, with 13,000 applicants still waiting for a decision. And time is running out. The initiative is expected to halt under Donald Trump, who has disparaged Obama's early releases. \"I feel like I got in right under the wire,\" Martinson said after returning to her childhood home in northern Iowa Dec. 2. \"I think that wherever my petition was on the humongous stack of petitions that are still pending, mine was, thank God, in the right place at the right time.\" Now, at 39, she is a symbol of the human potential clemency aims to unlock \u2014 and is shouldering the hopes of drug-war prisoners still waiting for the president's golden-stamped letter. 'A second chance at life' News travels fast in prison. When the White House releases a new batch of commutations, inmates with pending petitions scrutinize it, comparing the recipients to their own cases and looking for reasons they'll make the next list. \"It gives you something to look forward to,\" said Trenton Copeland, who is serving a life sentence for cocaine distribution at the federal prison in Terra Haute, Indiana. \"When a judge says life, it gives you a feeling like you're buried alive and basically waiting to die. But when I heard about the clemency initiative, it gave me a new perspective: that it wasn't over yet.\" \"It's a second chance at life,\" Copeland, 33, said. \"That's everything.\" Trump's election has increased the sense of urgency. Many on the waiting list see Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 as the moment their wishes will expire. \"We just don't see no daylight after Obama is gone,\" said Bernard Gary Smith, serving a 22-year sentence for his part in a crack and marijuana conspiracy. \"I think this is my last shot.\" Related: With Trump in White House, Criminal Justice Reformers Will Look Elsewhere Smith, 44, recalled hearing news in August that Obama had ended the life sentence of a fellow inmate at the federal prison in Glenville, West Virginia. The inmate had been convicted of dealing cocaine while in possession of a gun, a crime that seemed to Smith as more serious than his own. But it is difficult to discern trends, because the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney does not provide any explanations. \"Sometimes you wish any decision would come down just so you know how you'll live the next few months \u2014 and next few years,\" Smith said. A step toward reform The power of clemency is enshrined in the Constitution, although presidents typically use it sparingly. Obama was no different, until 2014, when he put out a call for nonviolent offenders who were sentenced to prison before the easing of notoriously harsh mandatory minimum laws in 2010. Related: As Drug Sentencing Debate Rages, 'Ridiculous' Sentences Persist The Justice Department enlisted the nation's bar and civil rights groups to identify the most promising candidates. But bureaucratic tangles contributed to a growing backlog. Advocates and clemency recipients are now pressing Obama to take more drastic action, such as blanket commutations for prisoners who've already been deemed low-risk. But clemency does not change the system. Mandatory minimum laws are still used to put thousands of nonviolent drug offenders into the federal prison system every year. There is a bill that seeks to give judges more discretion, but Congress has balked at it . Some believe Obama's clemency initiative could help the cause by raising public awareness of unfairly stiff sentences. \"It sets the stage for real reform,\" said James Felman, a Florida defense lawyer who has filed petitions for dozens of inmates. \"That is the most important legacy.\" From addiction to prison Martinson during a trip to California in 2001. Courtesy Mandy Martinson Martinson's brief history with drugs, and her lengthy incarceration, shows how mandatory minimum sentences have been twisted to punish low-level offenders, which was not Congress' intent when it created them 30 years ago at the height of a drug panic. Her clemency can be seen as a correction to that, and a rebuke to critics who warn that Obama is giving second chances to people who don't deserve it. \"Mandy is a good reminder that these are our friends and neighbors and children and sisters that we're talking about. These are real people,\" said Molly Gill, director of federal legislative affairs at Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which helped Martinson file for commutation. \"They're not people who are saying they're innocent. They're not people who said they shouldn't be punished. They're people who just want what we'd want for our friends and neighbors and daughters and sisters, which is a fair shake.\" Senior U.S. District Court Judge James Gritzner, who sits in Des Moines, Iowa, found that to be the case with Martinson, who he was obligated to send to prison for 15 years. \"We all did our duty,\" Gritzner said. \"But there are times when your duty, while well performed, doesn't make you feel very good.\" Martinson's addiction spanned several months in 2003 and 2004, upending a life that seemed charted for success. She went to college, earned her dental hygiene license, and bought a home in the small farming community where she grew up. She was a people-pleaser, motivated by the approval of her parents and neighbors. But that masked a low self-esteem that drew her to needy men, including one who sold meth and marijuana. Martinson in a photo taken circa 2000. Courtesy Mandy Martinson He moved in with her, and she joined him on drug runs, helping him count money and keep track of his product. She also let him store everything in her house, which was raided in January 2004, five weeks after they met. Among the items seized were several pounds of meth and the boyfriend's handgun. The boyfriend faced a mandatory minimum of 20 years in federal prison, which he got shortened by sharing the details of his operation with authorities. He also testified against Martinson, who as a bit player had little valuable information to bargain for her own benefit. She went to trial in September 2004. She knew she was guilty of the drugs, but didn't think she'd get convicted for possessing her boyfriend's gun. On that, she was wrong. By the time she was sentenced the following January, Martinson had kicked her meth habit. But Gritzner said he had no choice but to impose the mandatory minimum of 15 years. From the bench, he pointed out that Martinson's boyfriend had been sentenced to less than 13 years, even though she had been \"largely subject to his direction and control.\" Martinson went to prison at 27, unable to comprehend the term in front of her. A surprise gift Her case weighed on Gritzner, who in 2010 agreed to support Martinson's petition for commutation. He wrote a letter to Obama, asking the president \"to provide the justice in this case that I could not.\" That petition was denied. So was a second, in 2014, after Obama had launched his clemency initiative \u2014 and not long after Martinson's mother, Cindy, died of bone cancer. \"After that, I really thought there wasn't any hope,\" Martinson said. Mandy Martinson at a surprise welcome party in Mason City, Iowa on the day she was released from a halfway house. Brock Stoneham / NBC News But with encouragement from Families Against Mandatory Minimums and the Clemency Project 2014, a coalition of lawyers helping the Obama administration identify the strongest cases, Martinson submitted a third petition in March 2016. She didn't give herself good odds, because she was approaching her projected release date of October 2017, which factored in good-time credit. \"I was really not expecting it because I figured I'm almost done,\" she recalled. \"Why would they waste it on me when there are so many other people with so much time left?\" The surprise news came in a call from her lawyer on Nov. 4. Not long after, she received Obama's letter. \"Remember that you have the capacity to make good choices,\" he wrote. \"By doing so, you will affect not only your own life, but those close to you. You will also influence, through your example, the possibility that others in your circumstances get their own second chance in the future.\" After celebrating, Martinson thought of the others she knew who were still waiting. They were good people. What made them any less deserving? She owed it to them to put her clemency to good use. Home, free Before dawn on Dec. 2, Martinson stood at the exit of a Mason City halfway house with a new bob haircut and bags slung over her narrow shoulders. It was her last day in U.S. Bureau of Prisons custody, and through a window she could see her father, Bill, who'd visited her every weekend, first with her mom, and then alone. The door opened, and Martinson stepped through, dropping her bags and throwing her arms around him. They'd always been affectionate, but in prison visits, the hugs had been strictly limited. She felt lighter, as if coming up for air after a long underwater swim. \"I love you,\" she said. \"Let's go,\" he replied. Mandy Martinson and her father, Bill, who visited her every week while she was in federal prison for a methamphetamine offense. Brock Stoneham / NBC News On the drive home, she told him she'd dreamed her mother was still alive. She asked about her cat, who had survived her entire incarceration. Moving through the dark streets of her hometown felt unreal. That changed at her father's house, where, as the sun rose, a gaggle of aunts and friends stopped by with coffee and donuts. Over the fireplace was an urn containing her mother's ashes. Someone asked what she was going to do on her first day out. \"I'm free all day,\" she responded, stroking her cat's back. \"Oh, that sounds nice: I'm free.\" In the hours and days ahead, there would be more to savor: private showers, sleeping without layers of clothes to keep warm, meals and exercise any time she liked. There would be two jobs, one at a local Hardee's, another at a grocery store. She'd soon go back to class for her dental hygiene license; her old boss had told her he'd take her back. She knew the stigma of prison would not fade easily. \"But when I can say the president believes in me, maybe you could take a chance on me too, it helps put a little bit of strength in my back pocket,\" Martinson said. \"When somebody believes in you that much, you don't want to let them down.\" Jon Schuppe ",

But this year that tradition came to an abrupt end.\u00a0 Parents told local reporters the play was canceled because two parents complained about a line in the Charles Dickens holiday classic. Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd\u2019s Newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! The unnamed parents took offense at the words uttered by Tiny Tim, \u201cGod bless us, everyone,\" television station WHTM reported. \u201cI was very surprised because it\u2019s going on for decades and it\u2019s a tradition at the school that everyone looks forward to,\u201d resident Jane Burkhart told the television station.\u00a0 Like many in this deeply religious community, she was saddened by the cancelation.\u00a0 Click here to join America\u2019s favorite Conservative Facebook Community!\u00a0 \u201cOne little line shouldn\u2019t ruin it for every kid,\u201d Burkhart said. \u201cCharles Dickens is a class author, not a religious author.\u201d Principal Tom Kramer addressed the controversy in a message posted on the elementary school\u2019s website. You can read the entire message by clicking here. \u201cWe understand that some parents are upset that the play was cancelled, but we have heard from families on both ends of the spectrum, including those who expressed appreciation that the play, as it had traditionally been prepared and delivered, was cancelled,\u201d he wrote. Related Image Kramer went on to reject reports that their decision was based on one or two families. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He did not specifically address the parents\u2019 allegations that the play was cancelled because of the line, \u201cGod bless us everyone.\u201d But he did seem to hint at some sort of issue. \u201cOur decision is rooted in the desire to be respectful of the many cultural and religious backgrounds represented by the students attending Centerville Elementary,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0 That\u2019s a mighty big clue, folks. In order to be tolerant and diverse, public schools have to eradicate any mention of God.\u00a0 But to be fair \u2013 the school administration says their decision was mostly because of the amount of time it took to produce the show (about 20 hours). \u201cGiven the changes in state standards in recent years, we could not defend the commitment of this kind of instructional time to something not part of the fifth-grade curriculum,\u201d he wrote. Heaven forbid the teachers try to introduce the children to the world of the performing arts. The principal also pointed out that \u201cproducing and performing a play is not part of the written curriculum for fifth grade.\u201d So, after more than 40 years of Christmas productions featuring Tiny Tim and Ebenezer Scrooge, he\u2019s just now figuring that out? Randy Wenger is the chief counsel for the Independence Law Center in Harrisburg. He\u2019s also a longtime resident of Lancaster County. \u201cAs a constitutional attorney I hate to see traditions taken away in my own community,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat does this communicate to our kids? It says that anything religious is really not appropriate in public life. It\u2019s something you\u2019re supposed to keep to yourself.\u201d Wenger said Lancaster County is a conservative area and has a rich history of religious liberty.\u00a0 \u201cIt seems like people are trying to take aware our traditions left and right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to do something to push back.\u201d But this year, I\u2019m afraid Tiny Tim\u2019s goose has been cooked by the Ghost of Christmas Intolerance.\u00a0 Bah, humbug indeed.\u00a0 \u00a0 Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Two attorneys face federal fraud charges after authorities say they used copyright lawsuits to extort money from hundreds who allegedly downloaded pornographic movies, prosecutors announced Friday. Paul Hansmeier, of Woodbury, Minn., was arrested Friday in Minnesota, and John Steele, a Chicago attorney, was arrested in Florida. Federal prosecutors said the pair used sham entities to purchase copyrights to pornographic movies, then sued people who allegedly downloaded the movies \u2014 collecting about $6 million in settlements from 2011 through 2014. According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune , the two are former classmates at the University of Minnesota Law School. Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said the men's conduct was outrageous and cast doubt on the integrity of the legal profession. The men were charged Wednesday in an 18-count indictment that was unsealed Friday. Neither man had an attorney officially listed in the court docket. A phone call to a number listed for Hansmeier went unanswered and no message could be left. A number for Steele was not immediately available Friday. Hansmeier has been suspended from practicing law in Minnesota. Steele was charged in 2015 before by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission for his role in the scheme. The board's complaint alleged Steele and his partner sent \"shakedown\" letters to those suspected of illegally downloading pornographic movies. According to the Minnesota indictment, the men used several sham entities to obtain copyrights to pornographic movies \u2014 including some they filmed themselves \u2014 then uploaded those movies to file-sharing websites to lure others to download them. When the movies were allegedly downloaded, the men filed bogus copyright-infringement lawsuits, then extorted the supposed downloaders and threatened them with huge financial penalties and public exposure unless they agreed to a settlement. Judges nationwide have criticized the two men for their copyright-infringement lawsuits. Associated Press ",

By Abby Phillip December 17 at 9:46 AM Follow @abbydphillip Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), center, leaves Trump Tower earlier this month. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) President-elect Donald Trump has named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget, signaling his intent to slash spending and address the deficit as president. Mulvaney, 49, was elected to Congress in 2010 in the wave that brought a cohort of younger, staunchly conservative members into the House.\u00a0Mulvaney quickly staked out ground as one of Congress\u2019s most outspoken fiscal hawks \u2014 playing a\u00a0key role in the 2011 showdown between President Obama and House Republicans that ended in the passage of strict budget caps. He has been an advocate for spending cuts, often taking on his own party to push for more aggressive curbs to government spending. \u201cWe are going to do great things for the American people with Mick Mulvaney leading the Office of Management and Budget,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cRight now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation\u2019s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink. \u201cWith Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America\u2019s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer\u2019s trust in how their money is spent,\u201d he added. President-elect Donald Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget. Here's what you need to know about the conservative Congressman. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) Trump has announced plans for increased defense spending in a massive infrastructure bill. Adding Mulvaney to his administration could help ease concerns from\u00a0fiscal conservatives about the cost of such plans and their effect on the deficit. A\u00a0founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen\u00a0conservative hard-liners that has used its leverage to push Republican leaders to the right, Mulvaney was among the group of lawmakers widely credited with pushing\u00a0House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) out of power in 2015. He has broken with members of his own party at times, particularly around defense spending issues. Mulvaney\u00a0has been a fierce critic of the use of a separate\u00a0war funding stream known as overseas contingency operations, a budgetary\u00a0maneuver used to skirt spending caps to fund military and anti-terror operations abroad. Mulvaney has allied himself\u00a0with Democrats at times to try to force defense spending cuts. Mulvaney is also an advocate of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Mulvaney has had largely friendly relations with Boehner\u2019s successor, Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). He was among three members who offered nominating speeches for Ryan in a closed-door House GOP\u00a0leadership election last month. In a statement Ryan praised Mulvaney\u2019s appointment to head OMB. \u201cMick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIn Congress, he has been a conservative reformer from day one, proposing solutions to fix the budget process and our regulatory system.\u201d \u201cAt OMB, he will lead the work he has started to improve the way government does the people\u2019s business,\u201d he added. Among Mulvaney\u2019s chief duties will be overseeing the most dramatic overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax code since President Ronald Reagan. Trump has pledged to streamline the process for individual households and slash the rate for corporations from 35 percent to 15 percent. The changes are a central component of the administration\u2019s promise\u00a0to boost economic growth to 4 percent or higher, a message that resonated with voters still bruised by the Great Recession but that many economists say\u00a0is unsustainable. In addition, Trump has said\u00a0that stronger growth would mean\u00a0his tax proposal would not contribute to the national debt, and he has vowed not to cut expensive but popular\u00a0entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\u00a0But experts have been skeptical of those claims, and Mulvaney would be responsible for reconciling the numbers. One analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump\u2019s tax plan would cost more than $5.3 trillion over the next decade. Even after factoring in faster economic growth,\u00a0Trump\u2019s proposals are expected to\u00a0add at least $2.6 trillion to the debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Trump has also called for as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, an investment long sought by Democrats even though GOP leaders, including House\u00a0Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate\u00a0Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), remain opposed. It is not clear how Trump intends to pay for rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads and bridges. Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross, and economic adviser Peter Navarro have proposed tax credits intended to spur $1 trillion in private spending. But Trump\u2019s website suggests that fulfilling his pledge will require at least some public money, although it does not detail where the funding will come from. Mulvaney has spent the past few years learning Spanish and has been one of just a handful of GOP lawmakers able to appear on Spanish-language television programs to explain and defend Republican policies. Ylan Q. Mui, Mike DeBonis and Ed O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report. powerpost ",

Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend. Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you. \"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\" Related: Why Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever Anymore The goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\" But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could. \"Imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased.\" Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public. The natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy. Long-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too. Related: Is Perfecting Artificial Intelligence This Generations Space Race? She imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone. \"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\" While the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy \u2014 edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory \u2014 experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved. Heather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one. Stocktrek Images / Getty Images Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones .) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead. AfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave. If people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back? Both Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave. Related: Could One Person Take Down the Internet? \"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says. Beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones. \"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way? Digital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death.

They let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data \u2014 the texts and tweets and \"Likes\" and photos \u2014 and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were.

Turan Bulut/Ihlas News Agency via Reuters Email Last Updated Dec 17, 2016 8:11 AM EST ISTANBUL -- A suicide car bomb targeting military personnel exploded at the entrance gate to a university in the central province of Kayseri on Saturday, killing 13 Turkish troops and wounding at least 55 other people, authorities said. The blast comes a week after a car bomb attack claimed by Kurdish militants killed 44 people, mainly riot police posted outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul. Attacks in Istanbul and Cairo killed dozens over the weekend. A soccer stadium and a church were the targets. Holly Williams reports. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Turkish authorities have detained seven people linked to the attack and were searching for five more, the Reuters news agency reports. The army said 48 troops were wounded among the wounded in Saturday\u2019s \u201ctreacherous attack.\u201d The state-run Anadolu Agency said the explosion was at the entrance gate of Erciyes University, hitting a public transportation bus that included soldiers among its passengers. Earlier, Soylu, speaking in Kayseri, said six of the wounded were in critical condition. Images taken moments after the explosion showed a smoking public bus, still in flames, with its windows blown open and its interior blackened. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the statements of top officials suggested suspicion was focused on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which Ankara and the West consider a terrorist organization. Kurdish militants have claimed multiple attacks against soldiers and police across Turkey this year in violence that has also caused casualties among civilians. ",

    "text": "Mysterious ghost shark captured on camera for the first time Amy B WangThe Washington Post Like its Greek mythological namesake, the chimaera - or \"ghost shark\" - is a mysterious, rarely seen creature with a patchwork of bizarre features. Dwelling in the depths of the ocean, its eyes are pale and seemingly dead. Where teeth should be, the ghost shark uses tooth plates instead to grind food. Their heads are lined with cryptic dots, like the remnant scars of ancient stitches. Male chimaeras have retractable sex organs - on their foreheads. Its other nicknames - ratfish, rabbitfish, spookfish - hint at how bizarre chimaeras are in appearance. And now, scientists believe they have captured on video a species of ghost shark that had never before been filmed live: the pointy-nosed blue chimaera. The actual video was taken in 2009 but was only recently released by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, along with a paper by researcher Lonny Lundsten and his colleagues at the institute. Six years ago, researchers from the nonprofit sent an ROV, or remotely operated vehicle, on several dives off the waters of central California and Hawaii. (Rachel Feltman) The ROVs captured footage from depths of up to 6,700 feet. What they returned with surprised researchers: On film was what appeared to be a species of ghost shark previously only caught in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. According to his paper, Lundsten consulted with three chimaera experts who watched the video from the diving expeditions. All believed the fish was, in fact, a pointy-nosed blue chimaera. Still, Lundsten and others from the Monterey Bay Aquarium institute can't be 100 percent certain that the fish captured on video is a pointy-nosed blue chimaera, despite their similar physical characteristics. Because of that, the paper refers to the fish they recorded as Hydrolagus cf.trolli, rather than its scientific name, Hydrolagus trolli. To be absolutely sure, researchers would have to capture the ghost shark and bring it back to the surface, the institute said. \"This is much easier said than done, because these fish are generally too large, fast, and agile to be caught,\" the institute notes. \"If and when the researchers can get their hands on one of these fish, they will be able to make detailed measurements of its fins and other body parts and perform DNA analysis on its tissue.\" Doing so would either allow them to remove the \"cf.\" from the species description - or lead to perhaps an even more exciting alternative: that they discovered a new species of ghost shark. \"If these animals turn out to be the same species as the ghost sharks recently identified off California, it will be further evidence that, like many deep-sea animals, the pointy-nosed blue chimaera can really get around,\" the institute said. The pointy-nosed blue chimaera was first discovered by researcher Dominique Didier Dagit in 2002, in the deep waters around Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. Dagit, then an assistant curator of ichthyology at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, told the Associated Press in 2002 that she named her discovery Hydrolagus trolli after Alaskan artist Ray Troll because they shared a love for ratfish. ''It's kind of nice to be able to name a species for someone,'' Dagit told the AP. ''I thought, 'Here's my chance to name a fish for someone who's really interested.' . . . It kind of looks like him, [but with] less facial hair.\" ",

Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., speaks during the bipartisan news conference outside of the Capitol on May 20, 2014. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Images Email Last Updated Dec 17, 2016 9:59 AM EST ORLANDO, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump has settled on a White House budget director. It\u2019s Mick Mulvaney, a conservative Republican congressman from South Carolina who\u2019s viewed as a budget hawk. Mr. Trump calls Mulvaney, 49,\u00a0 a \u201cvery high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation\u2019s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink.\u201d Mulvaney was first elected to Congress as part of the tea party wave in 2010. President-elect Donald Trump continued to brush off reports that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. presidential election in order t... He\u2019s a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus - a group of Republican members of Congress who edged John Boehner out of the House speaker\u2019s role .\u00a0 If confirmed by the Senate, Mulvaney would be charged with pushing Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposals through Congress and overseeing the final issuance of major regulations. As the director of the Office of Management and Budget, he will likely be responsible for helping fulfill some of the president-elect\u2019s campaign promises, including the repeal of the Affordable Care Act , a boost in infrastructure investment, and a reworking of the tax code.\u00a0 Mr. Trump says that with Mulvaney as his budget director, his administration will make \u201csmart choices\u201d and \u201crenew the American taxpayer\u2019s trust in how their money is spent.\u201d Mulvaney has taken a hard line on budget matters, routinely voting against increasing the government\u2019s borrowing cap and pressing for major cuts to benefit programs as the path to balancing the budget. He has also advocated a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.\u00a0 Actually balancing the federal budget requires deeper spending cuts than the GOP-controlled Congress can probably deliver on, especially if Trump prevails on revenue-losing tax cuts and a big infrastructure package next year. Mulvaney is pledging to help restore what he\u2019s calling \u201cbudgetary and fiscal sanity ... after eight years of an out-of-control, tax and spend financial agenda\u201d under President Obama. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

I honestly believe she meant that statement differently than the way it came out.\u201d Alabama Supreme Court Justice Tom Parker said before Trump spoke at the rally: \"Yes, Michelle, we have hope again.\"\u00a0 Obama said in an excerpt of her final White House interview, conducted by Oprah Winfrey: \u201cWe feel the difference now. ... Now we\u2019re feeling like what not having hope feels like. \u2026 What do you do if you don\u2019t have hope, Oprah?\u201d The full interview is scheduled to air Monday on CBS-TV. President Obama was a first-term Illinois Democratic senator when he won the White House race in 2008 with a captivating message of hope and change and became the country\u2019s first black president. \u201cBarack didn\u2019t just talk about hope because he thought it was a nice slogan to get votes,\u201d the first lady said in the CBS interview. \u201cHe and I and so many believe: What else do you have if you don\u2019t have hope?\u201d \u00a0 The first lady during her time in the White House made top priorities of empowering young women and promoting healthy eating habits. She argued in the interview that children are the ones who most need hope. And to try to explain how her husband gave Americans hope, she said he was like the soothing parent who didn\u2019t overreact when a child bumps his or her head on a table. \u201cBarack has been that for the nation,\u201d the first lady said. \u00a0 ",

In a statement to the press on Saturday, the team said it had a discussion with university President Eric Kaler and athletic director Mark Coyle on Friday. It said all parties agreed that the teammates would receive a fair hearing by a diverse review panel, and that the team would also use its status as public figures \u201cto bring more exposure to the issue of sexual harassment and violence against women.\u201d The school declined the players\u2019 request to reinstate the suspended players. \u201cWe now ask that you, the members of the media, our fans, and the general public hold all of us accountable for ensuring that our teammates are treated fairly, along with any and all victims of sexual assault,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe look forward to representing the University of Minnesota and the state of Minnesota in the Holiday Bowl in a way that makes all of you proud.\u201d \u00a0 Meanwhile on Saturdya night, University of Minnesota students and community members joined together in response to the suspension of 10 Gopher football players, CBS Minnesota reports .\u00a0 They held a rally outside of TCF Bank Stadium, chanting \u201cshe is not alone, she is not alone\u201d to show their support for survivors of sexual assault. The University of Minnesota community held a rally in support of sexual assault survivors on Dec. 17, 2016.\u00a0 Close CBS Minnesota They also stood with signs in solidarity with victims. Those who organized the rally say it\u2019s important for survivors to know there are people out there who believe them. \u201cI think one of the most powerful ways that people learn that they are not alone is when other people tell their stories and identify themselves as survivors,\u201d Break the Silence founder Sarah Super said. Organizers also say the rally is an effort to break the silence that surrounds sexual violence. The Holiday Bowl will take place in San Diego on Dec. 27 against Washington State. Kaler said on Saturday that teammates were supporting their players, not sexual violence.\u00a0 CBS Sports: Full coverage of college football After the university\u2019s first football game of the season, four players were accused of sexual assault by a 22-year-old female student. The victim said she had been drinking but remembers \u201ca line of people, like they were waiting for their turn.\u201d No charges were filed against the players. The victim filed a restraining order against them. A university investigation included additional players. All 10 were then suspended from the football team.\u00a0 The players\u2019 attorney, Lee Hutton, says he doesn\u2019t understand how, with no new evidence, his clients can be suspended. But the university has stood firm, insisting on a due process hearing next week that would entail a final decision on status.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP December 17, 2016, 2:56 PM Slick roads cause crashes as harsh weather pounds East Email Last Updated Dec 17, 2016 3:22 PM EST A blast of cold air caused rain and wet roads to freeze across the Eastern U.S., triggering airport delays in the nation\u2019s capital and major traffic pileups in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina. Two people were killed in a chain-reaction accident in Baltimore involving a tanker carrying gasoline that skidded off a highway and exploded, authorities said. Baltimore City Fire Chief Roman Clark said at least 15 were injured in the 55-vehicle accident and tanker explosion, which happened on Interstate 95.\u00a0 Clark said it\u2019s too early to say whether the crash was caused by slick roads, although scores of traffic accidents were reported across the region due to icy conditions. \u201cThe roads were very icy,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe have nothing but sheets of ice throughout the city, sidewalks,\u201d he said. Traffic was at a standstill for hours while crews assessed the situation, CBS Baltimore reported . Clark asked travelers to avoid I-95 \u201cat all costs.\u201d Line of tow trucks on 95 exit ramp, waiting to help clear cars. #WJZ @cbsbaltimore pic.twitter.com/1c4Ri6Zrs7 \u2014 Devin Bartolotta (@WJZDevin) December 17, 2016 Officials have not released the names of the two people killed in the crash. Clark said it\u2019s unclear whether the pileup started before the tanker crash or was caused by the incident. As of 1 p.m., preliminary figures indicated that Maryland state troopers had responded to 330 crashes across the state in 24 hours, the Maryland State Police said in a statement. Between 15 and 20 vehicles were involved in a crash on I-695 near Rosedale, Baltimore County said on Twitter. Six people were taken to the hospital. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he and his wife sent their \u201cdeepest condolences and prayers\u201d to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives due to accidents. \u201cI strongly urge all Marylanders to use common sense and put their safety first by heeding all travel warnings from state and local authorities,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cRoad conditions in many areas of the state are still extremely dangerous, and all those who can avoid travel should stay off the roads until conditions have improved.\u201d\u00a0 The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory for the Baltimore area, meaning that periods of sleet and freezing rain through noon will lead to slippery roads and limited visibility. Other parts of the U.S. were hit hard by wintry weather: Indiana Indiana authorities say there have been dozens of crashes - two of them involving fatalities - due to freezing rain and ice that\u2019s made the roadways treacherous. Conditions are so dangerous that the\u00a0 Indianapolis Star reports that the city\u2019s police department is urging motorists to stay off the roadways unless it is \u201cabsolutely\u201d necessary to drive somewhere. Central Indiana will remain under a winter weather advisory until 7 a.m. Sunday,\u00a0 CBS Indianapolis affiliate WTTV reports . A window was expected in the afternoon in which streets would be wet, but temperatures were expected to fall below freezing into the evening. The state police says it has responded to at least 180 crashes since late Friday night, including two with fatalities. The number of deaths was not available. Virginia State Police in Virginia said 41 traffic crashes were reported in the northern part of the state. It was unclear how many were due to slick roads. One fatality was reported. Two airports serving the nation\u2019s capital were experiencing delays or cancellations on Saturday. Washington Dulles International airport reopened two runways as of 10 a.m. on Saturday after halting all flights and having to close all runways for more than three hours due to icy weather. The airport says travelers should expect residual cancellations and delays. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority says Reagan Washington National Airport is operating normally, but some flights may be delayed or canceled due to bad weather along the East Coast. North Carolina Light freezing rain caused scores of traffic accidents, adding to the road mayhem scattered throughout the Eastern U.S. Police and emergency workers reported more than 100 crashes overnight Saturday in Raleigh and Charlotte as the drizzle combined with temperatures below freezing for approaching 40 hours combined to create dangerous icy patches. Charlotte police reported two people dead in separate fatal crashes early Saturday, although investigators are still trying to figure out if ice caused the wrecks. Ohio In Ohio, snow and freezing rain created treacherous driving conditions. A Columbus, Ohio, woman died Saturday after her car went off a slick road, became stuck, and then was hit by another vehicle, authorities said. The woman, 20-year-old Savana Carrier, was standing outside her car when she and her vehicle were hit. New York New York City slowed to a crawl as snow blanketed nearly empty streets on Saturday morning. Up to about 4 inches came down in the city and suburban Long Island after days of bitter cold. By 8 a.m., vehicles were forced to move at a snail\u2019s pace in the heart of Manhattan - or else spin out of control. It took one driver about 10 minutes to get from Madison Avenue near the east side of Central Park to the west side. There were some reports of minor accidents. \u00a0 Temperatures were in the 20s in the early morning when the snowfall started. But by late morning, the snow turned to freezing rain, creating even more hazardous, slippery conditions. The temperatures were in the 30s. The storm was expected to end around 1-2 p.m., and temperatures would slowly rise to a high of 45 on Saturday night, before hitting almost 60 on Sunday afternoon, CBS New York reported. Rain is expected in the afternoon as temperatures rise into the 40s. Minnesota Residents are bracing for the coldest wind chills they\u2019ve seen in two years. On Saturday night, temperatures in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were expected to drop to 20 degrees below zero. The National Weather Service said the wind chill will make it feel as cold as minus-35. Forecasters say that in parts of greater Minnesota, temperatures could drop to 45 degrees below zero. Motorists across the state have been advised to stay indoors for the weekend because\u00a0blowing snow is creating problems in some areas and frostbite could set in within minutes if a driver gets stranded. Meanwhile, much of Wisconsin is under a winter storm warning, as another round of snow sweeps through the state and temperatures plummet to dangerous levels. Weather forecasters say the same for Chicago, which experienced light freezing drizzle and fog on Saturday. The low temperature was expected to plummet to 4 degrees.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

More than 1,700 homes were damaged or destroyed, impacting the vacation towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, which would normally be bustling with tourists during the holiday season. The flames reached the edge of one of the area's most popular attractions, Dolly Parton's Dollywood theme park. Last week, two juveniles were arrested on aggravated arson charges, but have not been identified because they are minors. Related: Two Juveniles Charged With Arson in Tennessee Wildfires Reed wrote on Facebook that he sat in silence when he learned of their capture. \"You may be too young to understand this, but even through this tragedy I can feel God with me and my son. I have felt my wife and daughters touch me from Heaven. I have seen them give me signs that they are looking down on us,\" the grieving father said. \"They are happy. They are at peace. They are together.\" He said that while others might hold a grudge, he cannot \u2014 and would rather exhibit forgiveness to the young suspects and their families. \"We will pray for your peace. We will show you grace,\" he wrote. \"Why? Because that's what Jesus would do.\" Erik Ortiz ",

    "text": "An unmanned underwater vehicle, or UUV, was deployed by the oceanographic and survey ship USNS Bowditch (seen here in a U.S. Navy file photo) \u2014 but it was retrieved by a Chinese navy ship. U.S. Navy hide caption toggle caption U.S. Navy An unmanned underwater vehicle, or UUV, was deployed by the oceanographic and survey ship USNS Bowditch (seen here in a U.S. Navy file photo) \u2014 but it was retrieved by a Chinese navy ship. U.S. Navy China's Defense Ministry is pledging to \"hand over the U.S. underwater drone it captured in its waters to the United States in an appropriate manner,\" providing its own narrative to describe a situation that American officials say has no recent precedent . Saturday's statement by ministry spokesperson Yang Yujun constitutes Beijing's most extensive remarks on the issue, one day after the Pentagon announced that the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey ship, had watched as a Chinese warship deployed a small boat to snatch an \"ocean glider\" \u2014 an unmanned underwater vehicle, or UUVs \u2014 from international waters in the South China Sea. \"In order to prevent the device from causing harm to the safety of navigation and personnel of passing vessels, the Chinese naval lifeboat verified and examined the device in a professional and responsible manner,\" Yang said, according to a translation from state-run Xinhua News . Chastising the U.S. for choosing to \"dramatize\" the matter, the Chinese spokesperson continued, \"The Chinese side has decided to hand over it to the U.S. in an appropriate manner. Both sides have been maintaining communication on the issue. The U.S. side's unilateral move to dramatize the issue in the process is inappropriate, and not conductive to its settlement. We regret that.\" Article continues after sponsorship The Chinese version of events is markedly different from the Pentagon's \u2014 U.S. officials say the Chinese ship was following the American vessel, and that the drone's origin wasn't in doubt. As Camila wrote for NPR Friday: \"The Bowditch was retrieving one vehicle when a Chinese warship pulled up, put a small boat in the water and retrieved the second UUV, officials told reporters. \"The U.S. sent radio messages requesting that the drone be returned, the Pentagon statement said, but the Chinese ship merely acknowledged the messages and ignored the request. \"No shots were fired by either vehicle, officials said, and the Chinese ship left with a final message that it was returning to normal operations \u2014 and with the drone.\" The unusual situation was the subject of a pair of tweets from President-elect Donald Trump Saturday. One of those was deleted because of a typo; in the other, the incoming commander-in-chief wrote, \"China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.\" The incident took place shortly after an American think tank released detailed satellite images that showed China's increasing military buildup on artificial reefs in the Spratly Islands. Those pictures were highlighted by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative \u2014 a group whose director, Greg Poling, spoke to NPR's Scott Simon Saturday.

Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Ivanka Trump, daughter and part of the executive committee of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, arrives at New York City's Trump Tower for meetings last month. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Update at 10:55 a.m. ET: As this post was publishing, the auction for coffee with Ivanka Trump was pulled from the Charitybuzz website. The link now redirects to its home page, with no explanation. Our previous post continues: On the auction site Charitybuzz, you could bid $3,500 to have tea with Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York . If you plunk down $5,000, you might be the top bidder for lunch with actress Julianna Margulies of The Good Wife. Coffee with one Ivanka Trump, on the other hand, will cost you $77,888 \u2014 at least. The auction for coffee with President-elect Donald Trump's oldest daughter is a fundraiser for the Eric Trump Foundation, which says the proceeds will benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Trump Adviser Dismisses Potential Business Conflicts, Defends Children's Roles The New York Times has reported on the auction and raised questions about the ethical implications of selling off face time with the future first family \u2014 especially given Ivanka Trump's perceived influence over her father. The Times spoke with one of the bidders in the auction, investment manager Ozan Ozkural. He told the newspaper he wanted coffee with Ivanka in order to learn about what the president-elect might do in the future \u2014 especially in countries where Ozkural invests. The Times reports: \"Mr. Ozkural is one of several high-profile bidders in a feverish competition to win time with one of Mr. Trump's children. Other bidders include the owner of a Tex-Mex restaurant chain from Houston who wants to press Mr. Trump, through his daughter, about immigration policy, and a real estate executive and fringe presidential candidate from Florida who wants to send a message to Mr. Trump about election fraud. \"Now they may not get a chance to \"Enjoy Coffee with Ivanka Trump in NYC or DC\" ... Eric Trump told The New York Times on Thursday that he was considering shutting down the bidding \u2014 10 days after it started \u2014 about an hour after The Times raised questions about the auction.\" Article continues after sponsorship Eric Trump told the Times that his foundation auctions off a meal with one of the Trump family members every year, and that it's \"nothing more than an effort to raise a lot of money\" to help children. Journalist On Trump's Potential Conflicts Of Interest: 'They're Everywhere' The Charitybuzz site includes several now-closed lots for face time with the Trump family that, based on the source code of each page, appear to have been auctioned off during the presidential campaign. They include an \" internship \" featuring 15-minute meetings with Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric in the summer of 2016, and the opportunity to \"pitch your idea\" to both Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump sometime during 2017. The listings do not include any information about winning bids. (Updated at 2 p.m. with details on prior lots.) As NPR has reported, observers and analysts have repeatedly raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest related to the influence President-elect Trump's children might have in his administration \u2014 especially given his stated plans to leave his companies under family control, rather than putting them in a blind trust. Ivanka has been seen as playing a particularly key, and controversial, role as Donald Trump transitions to the White House. NPR's Jessica Taylor reported on one eyebrow-raising moment last month: \"Trump's daughter, Ivanka, sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, raising questions about the mixing of the family's business and politics. There were initial reports that Trump had inquired about security clearance for his children, but the president-elect has denied that . Still, it's clear his children have influence with their father when it comes to politics, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, figures to play a potentially prominent role in a Trump White House, formally or informally.\" ",

Authorities declined to press criminal charges, and the woman later agreed not to seek any civil action. But the University said it was considering discipline on its own. \"Players announced a boycott because of the suspensions.

McCoig, CBS affiliate WVLT reports .\u00a0 They were captured in north Georgia late Friday after leading Tennessee troopers on a chase in a stolen flatbed 18-wheeler. WSB-TV reports. Georgia State Patrol took over the pursuit when it crossed the state line on Interstate 75 in Whitfield County. It ended south of Dalton where troopers used stop sticks to blow out the tires.\u00a0 Twenty-seven-year-old Matthew Robert Porter, 24-year-old Adam Quinn Lethco and two others escaped from a Jefferson County jail earlier Friday.\u00a0 According to McCoig, deputies were treating Adam Lethco who hurt his hand while on work detail at the Jefferson County Work House in Dandridge just after midnight. After officials iced and wrapped Lethco\u2019s hand and left the cell, Lethco and three other inmates assaulted the deputies, took their keys, and escaped in a black 1982 Chevy owned by one of the deputies. A volunteer fireman later spotted the vehicle, abandoned, on Walnut Grove Road in Sevierville. Sevier County deputies were able to arrest Jimmy Moore, 22. Around 3:45 a.m., deputies from both counties arrested Richard Lorenz, 26; he and Moore were taken back to the jail and charged with aggravated assault on an officer and escape. Lethco is serving an eight-year sentence for aggravated burglary, theft, and vehicle theft. Porter is serving one year of a six-year sentence for reckless endangerment and evading arrest, and is also wanted in Alabama on a 12-year sentence for violation of probation. The Sevierville Police Department believes that two white male suspects involved in an attempted armed robbery at EZ Stop on 851 Dolly Parton Parkway could be connected to the escaped inmates. Officers responded to the robbery call at 5 a.m. Friday morning.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Evan Vucci / Associated Press) President-elect Donald Trump used the final stop on his \u201cthank you\u201d tour to tell an enthusiastic crowd in Alabama that he will bring jobs and hope to \u201cthe forgotten men and women of this country.\u201d But he also took issue with a recent comment made by first lady Michelle Obama, who suggested in an interview that some Americans had lost hope. The incoming president said he had \u201ctremendous hope\u201d for the years ahead. \u201cThis is truly an exciting time to be alive\u2026. The script is not yet written,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the pages will be authored by you,\u201d he said, pointing out to the huge cheering crowd. Trump\u00a0said the main goal of his administration will be to bring jobs and prosperity to the areas of the country that\u00a0have struggled. He said he will promote \u201ctwo simple rules: buy American and hire American.\u201d He said he had returned to Mobile, Ala., because he had one of his first large rallies there in August 2015. Alabama is also the home state of\u00a0Sen. Jeff Sessions, the first senator\u00a0to endorse Trump and his choice to be the next U.S. attorney general. Earlier in the day, Trump said he had selected South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney , a conservative Republican and a budget hawk, to run the Office of Management and Budget. Latest updates ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy A 1992 profile of Ms. Sawyer in Vanity Fair, for example, subtitled, \u201cHow she finally beat the glamour rap.\u201d Ms. Kelly, who appeared on the magazine\u2019s cover last February, only the second female newscaster to do so, has no problem with the glamour rap. In part because she doesn\u2019t ignore it. Describing the haircut she got before the second Republican debate, for example, when she was deep in her Trump war and decided to lop her beach-babe waves into a slicked-back crop, Ms. Kelly quite cheerfully took a four-letter invitation and turned it into a taunt \u2014 thus owning the vulgarity and weaponizing what might otherwise have seemed a mere beauty decision. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In her book she writes that when she went to meet Mr. Trump for the first time since their public tussle to discuss having him do an interview with her, she wore her favorite black sheath Gucci dress. \u201cI feel strong in it,\u201d she said. By acknowledging the role clothes play in her own life and psyche, she is contravening one of the last taboos: If women want to be taken seriously, they are not supposed to take fashion seriously. A patently idiotic idea. (If you want to be taken seriously, you had better think seriously about every message you are sending, including the ones in your outfits.) In this she is part of a handful of women in the public eye who are breaking that rule, including Michelle \u201cno sleeves\u201d Obama and Sheryl \u201cno hoodies\u201d Sandberg. \u201cWe talk about it a lot: What is the world we are trying to create for our daughters \u2014 she has one, I have two \u2014 and how we can move things forward?\u201d said Debra Netschert, a managing director of Jennison Associates, an asset management firm, who has been friends with Ms. Kelly for about four years. It is not a coincidence that in 2010, when Ms. Kelly moved from the morning show \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d to become co-host of the afternoon show \u201cAmerica Live,\u201d she hired her own stylist. Generally, the Fox anchors use the Fox stylist, just as they use the Fox hair and makeup people, which is why there is what is generally known as a \u201cFox Look\u201d: for women, clingy brightly colored poly-rayon dresses that \u201cpop\u201d on TV, tousled hair and a lot of eye makeup, lip gloss and base. But, she said, that means \u201cwe all sort of look the same.\u201d When she started in TV after a nine-year career as a lawyer, she wore mostly navy, black and gray suits, and pinstripes \u2014 a \u201clot of Ann Taylor and Theory\u201d \u2014 but then Fox put her in its wardrobe, \u201cwhich was weird, because I had never really worn color before,\u201d she said. So when she got her own show, she said she decided \u201cI wanted to define myself differently.\u201d Which is to say, \u201cas myself,\u201d rather than as the network\u2019s product. She enlisted the help of her neighbor, Dana Perriello, whom she knew first as a mom, but who had a sideline as a personal stylist. Because they were friends before they worked together, \u201cShe knew who I was,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, and Ms. Perriello had an idea about how Ms. Kelly could express herself. They began to define a \u201cMegyn look,\u201d which had to do with clothes that were \u201cstrong, stylish, sleek, tailored, feminine, but not frilly,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cI don\u2019t like frills.\u201d Photo Ms. Kelly at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Gala in May, to celebrate \u201cManus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.\u201d Credit Larry Busacca/Getty Images \u201cShe wanted to be fashionable not just in the news world, but in any world,\u201d said Ms. Perriello, who puts outfits together for Ms. Kelly \u2014 dress, shoes, jewelry \u2014 and sends her look books of everything pre-assembled. Now Ms. Kelly wears mostly dresses by Victoria Beckham, Stella McCartney, Roland Mouret and Narciso Rodriguez, though Ms. Perriello is increasingly adding separates (and sleeves). The spaghetti-strap dress was by Ralph Lauren. In the photograph for this article, Ms. Kelly wore a black Fendi stretch jersey dress and silver Jimmy Choo nail-heeled stilettos. Her color palette is once again dominated by black and white, with the occasional red and blue thrown in. She likes a cutout and a high spiked heel. She also likes leather and, Ms. Perriello said, \u201chardware.\u201d She has recently been wearing a lot of asymmetrical cuts, \u201cwhich is not very common in news,\u201d Ms. Perriello said. What she does not wear is florals or anything too lacy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also, \u201cYou will never catch me in a dress without a pair of Spanx and a bra,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, and she is happy to explain why. In fact, she thinks it is good to explain why: \u201cAfter three children, it all came back together, but it didn\u2019t come back together they way it used to be.\u201d Though earlier this year she said that she, along with many of her female colleagues, was sexually harassed by the former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, and though she writes about it in her book, all of that happened during her \u201cfrumpy law-firm suit period,\u201d not during her later, more fashion-forward period. A fact she pointed out to underscore that such harassment was really about power and not self-presentation. No woman is \u201casking for it\u201d because of what she wears, and no woman should be judged for it, though judging \u2014 in a dismissive and derogatory way \u2014 is exactly what Ms. Kelly experienced earlier this year when Mr. Trump and assorted others resurfaced a 2010 GQ shoot of Ms. Kelly in a black slip and stilettos, draped over a chair. In January, @gene70 tweeted the photo with the message, \u201cAnd this is the bimbo that\u2019s asking presidential questions?\u201d Mr. Trump retweeted it. Ms. Kelly was having none of it. \u201cThey tried to slut-shame me!\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think I looked great. I had just turned 40, and I was pregnant. Some people at Fox still think it was a mistake, but I refuse to have to dismiss these options because of other people\u2019s prejudices, and my willingness to engage just proves they are wrong.\u201d In other words, it was appropriate because Megyn Kelly said it was appropriate. Rhetorically, this is not unlike the argument Gloria Steinem used when someone told her at her 40th birthday that she didn\u2019t look 40. Ms. Steinem responded: \u201cThis is what 40 looks like.\u201d Ms. Kelly, however, may not like the comparison. She has regularly refused to categorize herself as a feminist, because she thinks it is nichifying. She also rejects descriptions such as \u201cpioneer\u201d and \u201ctrailblazer,\u201d and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get drunk on your own wine,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be authentic.\u201d The irony is, insisting on her femininity while also insisting on her due \u2014 that she can have her career and her family, too, and in your face with a spaghetti strap it you don\u2019t like that \u2014 may be the most authentically feminist act of all.

    "text": "Email There were three reports of dirty water before the 300,000 residents of Corpus Christi were told not to drink the city's water due to a chemical leak at an asphalt plant, city officials said Saturday, adding that the city hasn't found evidence of water contamination. Mayor Dan McQueen said he won't know until Sunday whether a ban on drinking, cooking or bathing with tap water will be lifted for the 113,000 people still under the restriction. McQueen, who took office Tuesday after defeating an incumbent who came under fire for her handling of previous water crises, said there's no indication the chemical leak contaminated the Gulf Coast city's water supply. Officials are hoping the answer will come Sunday with the release of the first results of 30 samples taken by the Environmental Protection Agency and being tested in Houston. McQueen said the city would seek to recoup its losses from the polluter. The EPA said there were four \"unconfirmed reports\" of symptoms possibly related to prohibited water use. McQueen called the reports \"rumors.\" Assistant City Manager Mark Van Vleck said earlier that the first dirty-water report came Dec. 1 from the administration building at the asphalt plant that oil refiner Valero leased to Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions. City workers flushed the pipe. A second report came from the building Dec. 7, he said, and the main was flushed again. \"We get dirty-water reports all the time,\" Van Vleck said of the first two, saying old cast-iron pipes are usually the reason. But Monday, Valero workers told the public works department \"something white and sudsy\" was in water at the administration building. City workers determined there was a leak in a chemical tank at the asphalt plant, and on Tuesday they determined there was a backflow problem. The city told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality about it Wednesday, Van Vleck said, and hours later the state banned use of public drinking water. TCEQ spokesman Terry Clawson said the full city ban was justified. \"We did not have enough info to lift any bans or modify any bans until we did so,\" he said. Neither the city nor the state had information on the chemical composition of the spilled substance until Thursday. Van Vleck cautioned that the investigation is ongoing, \"so we don't know what happened.\" The ordeal was unnerving for Corpus Christi residents, especially those who live near the asphalt plant. \"Have we been exposed?\" Carol Gonzalez asked. \"We just don't know.\" Her family lives less than a mile away and her husband, Anthony Gonzalez, had made spaghetti for their 9- and 10-year-old daughters the night the water use ban was announced. The couple, interviewed while picking up a free case of bottled water at a city-run senior center, had already spent $150 on water, not to mention eating out. And they've been driving out of the city to fill buckets of water they use to bathe their children, who include a 6-month-old girl. \"It's gotten very expensive, and there's not going to be any reimbursement,\" Carol Gonzalez said. A TCEQ report obtained Friday indicates a combination of Indulin AA-86 and hydrochloric acid leaked into the water supply. Indulin is an asphalt-emulsifying agent that's corrosive and can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. The amber liquid is considered a hazardous material by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Ergon on Saturday acknowledged the \"soap solution\" had backflowed into a pipe through which it receives water. It said that pipe isn't directly connected to the city water main but rather is interconnected. It didn't offer additional details but said it has cooperated fully with the city, TCEQ and EPA and would continue to do so. Ergon spokesman Bill Miller said earlier the company was pushing the TCEQ for answers on whether there was actually contamination. Valero suggested Ergon was sluggish to acknowledge responsibility for the leak. It said its employees alerted Ergon three times after they encountered the dirty and contaminated water, on Dec. 2, 8 and 12, to ask if it could be related to Ergon operations. Hill, the Ergon spokesman, had no immediate response to Valero's statement. More than a half-dozen lawsuits have been filed against Valero and the privately held Flowood, Mississippi-based Ergon subsidiary, which makes paving and pavement preservation products. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported that several businesses and a class action lawsuit representing all of the city's residents allege the companies recklessly exposed business owners and residents to toxic chemicals. City public works employees couldn't find backflow valves on the chemical tank of the water intake pipes connected to the city water main, Van Vleck said. \"They thought it was there, but they could not show it to us,\" he said. The city estimated that up to 24 gallons of Indulin leaked because Ergon officials told them that was the amount of the chemical used to mix a batch of the asphalt emulsifier; 10 gallons of hydrochloric acid is used per batch. It's the latest in a string of water scares for the city. In May, the city issued its third boil-water advisory in a year as a precaution after nitrogen-rich runoff from rain flowed into the water system, resulting in low chlorine disinfectant levels in the water supply. According to a TCEQ report, the asphalt plant reported a spill of about 350 gallons of asphalt emulsion into the soil on March 25. The company cleaned up the spill, which it classified as nonhazardous waste, and disposed of it at a nearby landfill. The state agency did not issue a violation. A city manager said 23,000 cases of bottled water have been distributed, much of it donated, to help residents. The mayor said no one has turned up at a hospital with symptoms that might indicate he or she was sickened or burned by the chemical. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Emily Schmall in Fort Worth and Paul J.

    "text": "Donald Trump's Pick for US Ambassador to Israel Signals Changes in US Policy By Elizabeth McLaughlin Dec 17, 2016, 3:44 AM ET 0 Shares Star Bloomberg via Getty Images Billionaire real estate developer Donald J. Trump, center, his daughter Ivanka Trump, right, and attorney David Friedman exit U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, Feb. 25, 2010. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pick for the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel is drawing wide-ranging reactions from jubilant praise to heated criticism. Trump\u2019s choice, David Friedman, holds distinctly conservative views in direct opposition to long-standing U.S. policy positions. Friedman opposes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, actively supports Israeli settlements and advocates for Israel\u2019s annexation of the West Bank , maintaining that the occupied Palestinian Territories are not occupied. Most notably, he also wants to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, thus recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a disputed city of which both Israelis and Palestinians claim ownership. Jerusalem is home to the Israeli legislature, the Knesset, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office. Friedman, who has no career experience with either policy or diplomacy, is an Orthodox Jewish lawyer who advised Trump during the campaign. A close friend and confidant of Trump, he specialized in bankruptcy law and represented Trump in his investments in Atlantic City casinos. He serves as one of the co-chairmen of the Israel Advisory Committee to Trump, alongside Jason Greenblatt, another Orthodox Jewish lawyer from New York City. In an op-ed Friday in Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper, its U.S. editor Chemi Shalev argued that Friedman \u201cmakes Netanyahu seem like a left-wing defeatist.\u201d (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019s office had yet to comment on Trump\u2019s pick.) Netanyahu's main political rival, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, wished Friedman good luck Friday, describing him as \"a great friend of Israel.\" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely \"welcomed\" the nomination of Friedman on her Facebook page Friday, describing it as \"good news for Israel.\" Among those who have also congratulated Friedman is the Zionist Organization of America, whose president, Morton Klein, said Friedman has \u201cthe potential to be the greatest U.S. ambassador to Israel ever.\u201d Matt Brooks, executive director of the lobbying group Republican Jewish Coalition, tweeted \u201cgreat choice!\u201d \u201cDavid is someone who understands the President\u2019s vision and will strengthen the US-Israel relationship,\u201d Brooks wrote. How a Trump Administration Could Reshape the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict But not everyone is thrilled with Trump\u2019s choice, which requires Senate confirmation. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal advocacy group J Street, said Friedman was \u201canathema to values that underlie U.S.-Israel relationship\u201d and promised to fight his confirmation. Friedman has previously called J Street \u201cfar worse than kapos,\u201d referring to Jews who assisted Nazis during the Holocaust . Joining the chorus of discontent is the lobbying organization National Jewish Democratic Council, which tweeted that there \u201chasn\u2019t ever been a less experienced pick for US [ambassador] to Israel.\" Lara Friedman, the director of policy and government relations for Americans for Peace Now, a nonprofit that seeks a political settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about the Palestinians, but I know Jews who truly care about Israel\u2019s security, democracy & place in the world are outraged.\u201d Responding to the news, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters Friday, \"who Donald Trump appoints ... is his business. What is not Trump's business is to determine capitals of other nations.\" Erekat added, \"I look David Friedman and Trump in the eye and tell them -- if you were to take these steps of moving the embassy and annexing settlements in the West Bank, you are sending this region down the path of something that I call chaos, lawlessness and extremism.\" These moves, Erekat said, would \"destroy\" the peace process. Israeli Settlements International law, the United Nations and the United States consider Jewish settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace. In October, the Obama administration said it \"strongly condemned\" new Israeli plans to build a new Jewish settlement in the West Bank and that such actions undermine the ability to achieve a two-state solution. Friedman, as the president of the American Friends of Bet El Institutions, associated with the Jewish settlement of Bet El, has consistently and actively supported the construction of new settlements. Friedman, already a frequent visitor, also owns property in Jerusalem. Charles Dharapak/AP Photo President Barack Obama meets with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, May 20, 2011. \u201cI think the West Bank was captured from Jordan in a defensive war,\u201d he told ABC News at an October Trump rally in Israel. \u201cThe Jordanians haven\u2019t sought to repatriate that land so I think; I\u2019m a lawyer, under international law I don\u2019t think these settlements are illegal.\u201d Trump\u2019s take: In an interview with Israel's Army Radio, Jason Greenblatt, co-chairman of the Trump campaign\u2019s Israel Advisory Committee, said, \u201cIt is certainly not Mr. Trump\u2019s view that settlement activities should be condemned and that it is an obstacle for peace, because it is not an obstacle for peace.\u201d In the same ABC News interview from October, Friedman echoed Greenblatt\u2019s view, saying he believed Trump saw the settlements as legal, a major break in U.S. policy. Jerusalem U.S. administrations from both parties have long recognized Jerusalem as the thorniest issue in any peace process, maintaining that the final status of the city should be resolved in negotiations between the two. Most foreign nations keep their embassies in nearby Tel Aviv, including the U.S. Embassy since 1966. Friedman is a staunch proponent of moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In the Trump transition team statement announcing Freidman\u2019s nomination, Friedman said he looked forward to representing the United States from \u201cthe U.S. Embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem.\u201d He told ABC News that if State Department employees refused to move the embassy, they'd be fired. Trump\u2019s take: The president-elect said he would move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, which he has also called \"the eternal capital of the Jewish people.\" In a call with reporters Friday morning, Trump spokesman Jason Miller affirmed Trump's commitment to do so, pointing out that Trump made that promise \"numerous\" times during the campaign. Miller did not speculate on a timeline for that move or potential sites for the embassy. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney also pledged to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Two-State Solution Friedman has been pessimistic about the idea of a two-state solution, a framework that envisions independent Israeli and Palestinian states on either side of the Jordan River. The United States does not currently recognize a Palestinian state, but since 2012 it has enjoyed non-member observer status at the United Nations. \u201cA two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians appears impossible as long as the Palestinians are unwilling to renounce violence against Israel or recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state,\u201d Friedman wrote in a post for Medium , along with Greenblatt. \u201cThe U.S. cannot support the creation of a new state where terrorism is financially incentivized, terrorists are celebrated by political parties and government institutions, and the corrupt diversion of foreign aid is rampant,\u201d the pair added. \u201cThe U.S. should not support the creation of a state that forbids the presence of Christian or Jewish citizens, or that discriminates against people on the basis of religion.\u201d Friedman views that the United States doesn't necessarily have to pursue that solution, but America should support Israel's own decision. \"He\u2019s not going to adopt the view that George Bush took in 2004, that it\u2019s an American imperative for there to be a two-state solution. It\u2019s not,\" Friedman has said. Trump\u2019s take: He has said he would veto any resolution aimed at an agreement between Israel and Palestine proposed by the United Nations Security Council and said the entire U.N. is \"not a friend of democracy\" and \"surely is not a friend to Israel.\u201d We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2011 But that doesn\u2019t mean a U.S.-brokered agreement is off the table. Trump has called the Israeli-Palestinian solution \u201cthe ultimate deal.\u201d \u201cAs a deal maker, I\u2019d like to do \u2026 the deal that can\u2019t be made. And do it for humanity\u2019s sake,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal. Friedman has said that a Trump administration would not advocate any particular solution between the Israelis and Palestinians. \u201cThe view is that the Israeli electorate is a peace-loving electorate, a very informed electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey choose their leaders very carefully. It\u2019s a very robust democracy and ultimately they have to live with the consequences. And so the position of the Trump Administration will be to support the decision of the Israeli people to achieve peace as they see fit.\u201d Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP/AP Photo David Friedman is seen in this undated file photo. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything [Trump] would propose that would be acceptable to Palestinians,\u201d University of Michigan Professor Victor Lieberman told ABC News. Lieberman, who teaches a history class on the 100-plus-year conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, said moving the embassy to Jerusalem, allowing additional Israeli settlements and annexing territory in the West Bank would be seen as unilateral actions by Israel, not steps toward a peaceful solution. With Trump\u2019s choice of Friedman, his administration seems poised to alter the U.S. position in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Lieberman posits that perhaps with the support of a Trump administration, Israel could \u201cchange the rules of the game and hope they become permanent.\u201d If this occurs, Palestinians\u2019 resentment is bound to continue, he said. But Israelis are scared of a potential \u201chostile state\u201d on its border, too, Lieberman continued. Therein lies the most basic elements of this historic conflict that U.S. presidential administrations have consistently tried to solve. Lieberman doesn\u2019t see another international actor that could step in to effectively mediate the two sides. A Trump White House doesn\u2019t appear now, at least, to be a step toward reconciliation. \u201cThe era of Palestinian State is over,\u201d right-wing politician Naftali Bennett declared after the election. He may be right. ABC News\u2019 Justin Fishel and Ben Siegel contributed to this reporting. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "advertisement Some residents of Corpus Christi, Texas, resumed turning on the tap after an industrial chemical leak at an an asphalt plant sparked fears of widespread contamination. Officials said Saturday that there has been no evidence of water contamination, although testing of water samples was still being done in Houston and could be made available Sunday. As a precaution, pallets of bottled water were trucked in to alleviate the situation following a ban that was put into place Wednesday night. City water towers have also been flushed out to ensure the water is safe. An EPA laboratory in Houston is conducting analytical testing of Indulin AA-86 and drinking water from Corpus Christi, Texas. EPA Region 6 A ban remains in place in some portions of the Gulf Coast city of nearly 320,000, and officials are left grappling with closings of schools and day cares, and moving dozens of animals in a local shelter to San Antonio out of concern. \"We know the citizens are suffering. We're suffering too,\" Corpus Christi Councilman Greg Smith said at a news conference Saturday. Here's what you need to know about the ban. What is the chemical that supposedly contaminated the water? An incident report described the leak as a \"backflow incident from a chemical tank impacting the public water system.\" The chemical is a combination of Indulin AA-86 and hydrochloric acid. Indulin is an asphalt emulsifying agent that's corrosive and can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. The amber liquid is considered a hazardous material by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and could cause damage to internal organs. \"You don't expect to see it in water,\" said Terry Clawson, a spokesman with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Up to 24 gallons of it may have seeped into a pipeline carrying water, allowing it to move to other areas of the city, Kim Womack, a spokeswoman for the city, said Thursday. How did the contamination start? City workers determined there was a leak in the asphalt plant's chemical tank and on Tuesday determined there was a backflow problem. The city told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) about it Wednesday, Van Vleck said, and hours later, the state banned the use of public drinking water. Mayor Dan McQueen has said local officials only learned of the leak Wednesday. TCEQ officials did not respond to a request for comment Saturday. Van Vleck cautioned that the investigation is ongoing, \"so we don't know what happened.\" He added: \"We do not know (there was contamination) because we can't prove it.\" How long have officials know about the leak? Assistant City Manager Mark Van Vleck said the first \"dirty water report\" came Dec. 1 from an asphalt plant in the city that's leased to Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions. City workers flushed the pipe. A second report came from the same building Dec. 7, he told The Associated Press, and the main was flushed again. But Monday, Valero workers told the public works department there was a \"white, sudsy liquid\" in the administration building; Van Vleck didn't specify where the liquid was coming from. How widespread is the ban? Initially, the use of tap water was banned throughout all of Corpus Christi when officials said they learned Wednesday of a leak that contaminated a water distribution system. The city has since been divided into three zones allowing water to be used depending on location. See a Map of the Zones Here For instance, those living in Zone 1 have been allowed to use tap water for drinking, cooking, bathing and all regular uses. Those in Zone 2 have limited water use, while those in Zone 3 are banned from using the water completely as a precaution. That involves about 113,000 people still under the restrictions. What does the company say happened? Bill Miller, a spokesman for Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions, said the company is also looking for answers from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to know whether any water was actually contaminated. \"Inaction is bad for people in our position. The longer we sit here, the worse it looks,\" Miller said, according to the AP. Has anyone been sickened? Federal and state agencies say there have been four unconfirmed reports of people suffering symptoms that would be associated from using contaminated water. Details of those symptoms were not provided by the agencies. Corpus Christi Mayor Dan McQueen also said at Saturday's news conference he heard about people falling ill. City Councilman Michael Hunter told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that it was unlikely the leaked chemical was concentrated enough to do harm, but that every precaution must be taken. What is the response from residents? More than a half-dozen lawsuits have already been filed against the oil refiner Valero, of which Ergon is a subsidiary. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported that several businesses and a class-action lawsuit representing all of the city's residents allege the companies recklessly exposed business owners and residents to toxic chemicals. Van Vleck said the city made the Ergon plant install new valves because of the leak, but has not restored water service to the plant. Erik Ortiz ",

    "text": "DEC. 17, 2016 By The New York Times The action came two weeks after Mr. Trump angered Beijing by speaking by phone to the leader of Taiwan, and almost a week after he criticized China for building military bastions in the South China Sea. American officials were trying to determine whether the seizure was a response to Mr. Trump or whether it was just one more escalatory step in China\u2019s long-term plan to try to push the United States Navy out of the South China Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest commercial and military waterways. The Pentagon formally protested the capture of the drone , saying it was stolen American military property. The Pentagon said the drone had been carrying out scientific research, and asked China to return it. American experts, however, said the drone might have been designed to help follow China\u2019s submarine buildup, a critical part of the country\u2019s growing naval strength as it seeks unfettered control of the South China Sea and unimpeded access to the Pacific and Indian oceans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A retired Chinese rear admiral, Yang Yi, speaking earlier at a conference sponsored by a state-run newspaper, The Global Times, said the Americans had invited the Chinese sailors to take the drone by sailing in the waters close to the Scarborough Shoal, fishing grounds that are claimed by China and the Philippines . The Americans \u201cdeliver these things to our home,\u201d and it would be more than natural for Chinese sailors to seize the drone and examine it, Admiral Yang said. \u201cIf Trump and the American government dare to take actions to challenge the bottom line of China\u2019s policy and core interests,\u201d he said, \u201cwe must drop any expectations about him and give him a bloody nose.\u201d Reached by telephone, the president of a state-affiliated think tank, Wu Shicun, said the United States had most likely been conducting intelligence reconnaissance to detect Chinese submarine routes in the South China Sea. Mr. Wu, who heads the National Institute for South China Sea Studies and advises the government on maritime matters, described the drone \u201cas a new way for the United States to conduct intelligence gathering.\u201d \u201cPreviously the United States conducted surveillance with warships in the nearby waters of China, or by aircraft,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the unmanned underwater vehicle is a new approach.\u201d The Chinese were justified in taking the unmanned underwater vehicle, he said. The episode occurred in seas about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay, a major port of the Philippines and a former United States Navy base, the Pentagon said. That means the Bowditch was within 200 miles of Scarborough Shoal, American analysts said. The American vessel appeared to be outside the perimeter of the \u201cnine-dash line,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. China drew the line in the late 1940s as it laid claim to about 90 percent of the South China Sea. \u201cChina has no legal basis to take actions like these on the high seas, but doing so outside Beijing\u2019s ambiguous claim line is particularly egregious and will make the incident especially hard to justify,\u201d Ms. Rapp-Hooper said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who is nurturing warm ties with China and has warned he may break longstanding military relations with the United States, took a conciliatory approach over the Chinese action. \u201cI will not impose anything on China,\u201d he said at a news conference in Manila on Saturday. \u201cWhy? Because politics in Southeast Asia is changing.\u201d This was a reference to his tilt away from the United States, a treaty ally, since taking office in June. He referred to China as \u201cthe kindest soul of all.\u201d Photo The drone was seized by Chinese sailors off the Philippines. Credit Cmdr Santiago Carrizosa/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The Philippines also took a forgiving attitude after the release of satellite images on Wednesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies that appeared to show that China has installed weapons on the seven artificial islands it has built in the Spratly archipelago, not far from the Philippines in the South China Sea. \u201cThere is nothing that we can do about that now, whether or not it is being done for purposes of further militarizing these facilities that they have put up,\u201d the foreign secretary, Perfecto Yasay Jr., said, reflecting the weak state of the Philippines military. \u201cWe cannot stop China at this point in time and say, \u2018Do not put that up.\u2019 \u201d By seizing the drone so close to the Philippines, China may have been trying to further weaken the already frayed United States alliance with Manila, American experts said. The conciliatory reaction by the Philippines, even as the United States was making stern demands on Beijing, would complicate Washington\u2019s efforts to convince China that its actions were unacceptable, a senior American military official said on Saturday. In an important ruling in July, an international tribunal in The Hague decided against China, saying that the Scarborough Shoal was entitled only to a 12-mile territorial zone, not 200 miles as the Chinese assert. China has refused to recognize the ruling. Mr. Duterte on Saturday said he was ignoring the Hague ruling even though the case had been brought by the previous Philippines government. \u201cIn the play of politics now, I will set aside the arbitral ruling,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The drone incident, according to a Pentagon account, began when a Chinese Navy vessel that was shadowing the Bowditch \u2014 a common practice in the South China Sea \u2014 pulled up not far from the ship. It then dispatched a small boat to seize the drone as the American crew was recovering it from the water. The Pentagon described the vehicle as an unclassified \u201cocean glider\u201d system used to gather military oceanographic data such as salinity, water temperature and sound speed. An American naval expert did not disagree with Mr. Wu\u2019s notion of what the Americans were probably doing. \u201cWarfare and surveillance in the age of drones has not yet developed an agreed-upon set of rules,\u201d said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the United States Naval War College, in Rhode Island. \u201cThis is increasingly a major problem as both China and the U.S. are deploying ever more air and naval drones into the contested waters and airspace of the Western Pacific,\u201d he said. The seizure may have been just another way for Beijing to provoke the United States in a gray zone, just under the threshold of actual hostilities, Mr. Goldstein said. He said it was a time for \u201ccooler heads to prevail,\u201d to halt a cycle of escalation that \u201ccannot end well for either side.\u201d In some respects, the seizure was not a surprise but just another step in China\u2019s increased harassment of the American Navy in the South China Sea, several American naval experts said. In March 2009, soon after President Obama took office, five Chinese ships swarmed an American surveillance vessel, the Impeccable, 75 miles off Hainan island, the southernmost province of China. The Impeccable was towing sonar equipment designed for anti-submarine warfare, and the Chinese ships got as close as 25 feet from the ship in what the Pentagon called \u201cillegal and dangerous\u201d maneuvers. Jane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington. Felipe Villamor contributed reporting from Manila. Yufan Huang contributed research.

    "text": "By Philip Rucker and John Wagner December 17 at 7:13 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @WPJohnWagner MOBILE, Ala. \u2014 He strode out on a catwalk at a football stadium here to Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d A 50-foot cedar tree, which aides installed behind his stage with a crane, was decorated in Christmas ornaments larger than a human head. His crowd, thousands deep, held up familiar signs (\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d) and reprised signature chants (\u201cLock her up!\u201d). \u201cThis is where it all began,\u201d President-elect Donald Trump exhorted, basking in the adulation of the Alabamans who had come to see him Saturday afternoon in the same stadium where 16 months earlier he staged the first electric mega-rally of his improbable campaign. This city in the nation\u2019s Bible Belt was the symbolic last stop in Trump\u2019s journey to the White House \u2014 the conclusion of a nine-city, pre-inaugural road show. Rather than projecting inclusivity and striving to heal the wounds from the bitter election, as past presidents-elect have done, Trump has traveled on his \u201cUSA Thank You Tour\u201d only to states he turned red on election night. He has whipped up his massive crowds, and they in turn have displayed their allegiance \u2014 a powerful reminder to members of Congress that it would be politically dangerous to cross him. \u201cIt\u2019s a movement,\u201d Trump declared in Mobile. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, they didn\u2019t know you existed until Election Day \u2014 and then they said, \u2018Where the hell did all those people come from?\u2019 \u201d People cheer after a prayer before President-elect Donald Trump addresses a rally Saturday at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Ala. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) As Trump assembles his administration and prepares to govern, Trump has continued the divisive rhetoric and showmanship of his campaign. He has mocked his opponents, sneered at the media and trumpeted his electoral feats. To the nearly 54 percent of voters who cast ballots for someone else, Trump\u2019s message has been, in short: get on board or get left behind. Trump\u2019s tone in the run-up to his Jan. 20 inauguration poses a challenge as he seeks to govern a deeply divided nation and build popular support for his policies. And as he tries to pivot from a rollicking campaign, Trump is struggling to tame the army of passionate followers he has playfully called \u201cwild beasts.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d rallies have been an extension of those he held as a candidate \u2014 from the soundtrack (Elton John and Rolling Stones classics) to the vows from the lectern (\u201cWe will build a great wall!\u201d). Lately, Trump\u2019s stages have been set with Christmas trees \u2014 16 of them at the Orlando stop \u2014 as a sparkling reminder that as president he would say \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d and not simply \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d He has made no mention of Hanukkah or acknowledged other faiths. And in Mobile, he was introduced by evangelist Franklin Graham, who said Trump was elected by a spiritual force: \u201cI believe it was God.\u201d When Trump swooped into Orlando for a Friday night rally, it had been 38 days since he had had to worry about Hillary Clinton. But his crowd was fixated on her. They chanted, \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d To them, this was still a campaign, and Clinton was the enemy. Trump told them that in the run-up to the election, \u201cYou people were vicious, violent, screaming, \u2018Where\u2019s the wall?\u2019 \u2018We want the wall!\u2019 Screaming, \u2018Prison!\u2019 \u2018Prison!\u2019 \u2018Lock her up!\u2019 I mean, you were going crazy. You were nasty and mean and vicious.\u201d [ Trump tries to calm his \u2018vicious, violent, screaming\u2019 supporters ] (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) But the campaign is now over, he said. Victory is in hand. The inauguration is a month away. And Trump tried to imagine for his fans how they ought to behave: \u201cNow you\u2019re laid back, you\u2019re cool, you\u2019re mellow, right?\u201d Wrong. Trump himself has hardly been a model of mellowness. He has used his tour stops to settle scores \u2014 with Evan McMullin, the Republican who waged an independent campaign against him in Utah; Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who resisted Trump\u2019s candidacy; CNN\u2019s John King, who in nightly pre-election analyses on the \u201cmagic wall\u201d predicted that Trump would not reach 270 electoral votes; and the media generally, which he faulted for \u201cdishonest\u201d polls. Even as Trump\u2019s supporters have delighted in the president-elect\u2019s stump routine, they have confessed in interviews that they wish he would adopt a more serious demeanor as he readies to enter the White House. \u201cSometimes, during this campaign, he was a little lippy on the mouth. I think it would be better if he toned it down, and I think he will,\u201d said Craig Harrison, 45, a construction worker who showed up at Trump\u2019s first tour stop in Cincinnati with a flag draped around his shoulders that was emblazoned with Trump\u2019s slogan. Harrison said his friends called him \u201cSuper Trump.\u201d [ Welcome to Washington\u2019s new normal: One Trump drama after another ] Trump\u2019s pre-inaugural posture is unlike any previous president-elect, historians said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a president that continues to campaign instead of reaching out to voters that didn\u2019t like him,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. \u201cHe\u2019s shunning Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters and almost acting like they don\u2019t matter. . . . I think he sees himself as a revolutionary figure, and you\u2019re either going to join the Trump revolution or you\u2019re not.\u201d Trump\u2019s foot soldiers hope he continues campaign-style rallies as president. \u201cHe has to keep an open line to the people,\u201d said Sue Anne Balch, 61, an immigration lawyer in Alabama. \u201cI know how it is. You catch Potomac fever and forget everything.\u201d Trump agrees. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018As president, he shouldn\u2019t be doing rallies.\u2019 But I think we should, right? We\u2019ve done everything else the opposite. This is the way you get an honest word out,\u201d he said in Mobile. Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks have tilted heavily conservative, and so far he has eschewed a tradition of tapping a member of the opposing party for a key post. He continues to use Twitter to whip up his base, with tweets opposing flag burning and suggesting, without evidence, that Clinton benefited from illegal votes. All nine of the stops on Trump\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d tour have been in states he won \u2014 some of them unexpectedly. The crowds have been overwhelmingly white and, by all accounts, mostly people who voted for him. Folks have come wearing Trump hats and T-shirts. Women have been given pink \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d signs to wave. And when speakers have asked for a show of hands of who had been to a Trump rally before, it has seemed as if every hand were in the air. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who ran unsuccessfully for president this year as a Democrat, said, \u201cMr. Trump has every right in the world to thank his supporters in those states in which he won but, as the president-elect, he also has the responsibility to assure all Americans that he is listening to their concerns.\u201d To be sure, Trump is making other moves to reach out to non-supporters. The eclectic group of people who have paraded through Trump Tower in New York to meet with the president-elect have included some prominent Democrats, including former vice president Al Gore, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. A group of technology company executives met with Trump and his top advisers last week, even though Silicon Valley was considered especially hostile to his candidacy. [ The biggest names in tech just made nice with Trump ] Trump\u2019s approach, different as it may be from his predecessors, appears to be no less strategic. Republicans have the majority in both chambers of Congress, and by keeping his base of supporters aroused, Trump is reminding them that there are risks should they vote against his nominees or his agenda. \u201cHe wants these voters to be heard loud and clear by Congress,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant. \u201cThis is less of a thank-you tour and more of a be-ready-to-fight tour.\u201d Seeking to build momentum for Trump\u2019s agenda, the president-elect and his advisers boast of a historic electoral college landslide. But Trump ranks just 46th out of 58 electoral college results, and a shift of some 40,000 votes in three states would have cost him the presidency. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by more than 2.8 million. Although Trump\u2019s favorability ratings have improved since last month\u2019s election, he has not yet experienced the honeymoon of popularity enjoyed by other presidents-elect. Americans are evenly split on Trump\u2019s transition so far, with 48 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving, according to a Gallup poll last week. That compares to overwhelming positive attitudes from the public for the presidential transitions of Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as recorded in past Gallup surveys. At a time when Trump is holding no press conferences, the rallies have allowed him to communicate directly with the public, bypassing the media \u2014 something many of his supporters say is important. \u201cI know they lie,\u201d said Freddie Killian, 60, an administrative assistant, who cheered on Trump in Alabama. \u201cYou want to hear the truth? Come out here and listen to him.\u201d Don Huyvaert, a retired federal government financial analyst, said he showed up at the Wisconsin stop to let Trump knows he has his back. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have his hands full draining the swamp, but this tells him there are a lot of people out here behind him,\u201d said Huyvaert, 66, a resident of nearby Mount Pleasant. At the end of his speeches \u2014 after the teasing and taunting, after the Christmas greetings, after the cries in the crowd to jail Clinton \u2014 Trump has looked ahead to life as the president and tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. His crowds may have been the white voters of red America, but the president-elect has declared, as he did Thursday night in Hershey, Pa., that his message is for Americans \u201cfrom all parties, all beliefs, all walks of life.\u201d \u201cWhether you are African American, Hispanic American or Asian American or whatever the hell you are, remember that we are all Americans and we are all united by one shared destiny,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I\u2019m asking everyone to join this incredible movement.\u201d Rucker reported from Mobile and Orlando; Wagner reported from Cincinnati, West Allis, Wis., and Hershey, Pa. Scott Clement in Washington contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Last Updated Dec 17, 2016 2:35 PM EST CINCINNATI -- The surgeon who created the life-saving Heimlich maneuver for choking victims has died, CBS News confirmed. Dr. Henry Heimlich died early Saturday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati at the age of 96 after complications from a heart attack, his family said in a statement. His family called him \u201ca hero to many people around the world for one simple reason: He helped save untold numbers of lives through the innovation of common-sense procedures and devices.\u201d \u201cMy father was a great man who saved many lives,\u201d said Phil Heimlich, an attorney and former Hamilton County commissioner. \u201cHe will be missed not only by his family but by all of humanity.\u201d Heimlich was director of surgery at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati in 1974 when he devised the treatment for choking victims that made his name a household word. Rescuers using the procedure abruptly squeeze a victim\u2019s abdomen, pushing in and above the navel with the fist to create a flow of air from the lungs. That flow of air then can push objects out of the windpipe and prevent suffocation. Much of Heimlich\u2019s 2014 autobiography focuses on the maneuver, which involves thrusts to the abdomen that apply upward pressure on the diaphragm to create an air flow that forces food or other objects out of the windpipe. The Cincinnati chest surgeon told The Associated Press in a February 2014 interview that thousands of deaths reported annually from choking prompted him in 1972 to seek a solution. During the next two years, he led a team of researchers at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. He successfully tested the technique by putting a tube with a balloon at one end down an anesthetized dog\u2019s airway until it choked. He then used the maneuver to force the dog to expel the obstruction. The Wilmington, Delaware, native estimated the maneuver has saved the lives of thousands of choking victims in the United States alone. It earned him several awards and worldwide recognition. His name became a household word. The maneuver was adopted by public health authorities, airlines and restaurant associations, and Heimlich appeared on shows including the \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d and \u201cThe Today Show.\u201d His views on how the maneuver should be used and on other innovations he created or proposed put him at odds with some in the health field. He said his memoir was an effort to preserve his technique. \u201cI know the maneuver saves lives, and I want it to be used and remembered,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI felt I had to have it down in print so the public will have the correct information.\u201d The maneuver has continued to make headlines. Clint Eastwood was attending a golf event in Monterey, California, in 2014 when the then-83-year-old actor saw the tournament director choking on a piece of cheese and successfully performed the technique. \u201cThe best thing about it is that it allows anyone to save a life,\u201d Heimlich told the AP. In 2016, Heimlich himself was the hero, saving a woman choking on food at his senior living center. Heimlich said the maneuver is very effective when used correctly, but he did not approve of American Red Cross guidelines calling for back blows followed by abdominal thrusts in choking cases that don\u2019t involve infants or unconscious victims. Red Cross officials said evidence shows using multiple methods can be more effective, but Heimlich said blows can drive obstructions deeper into a windpipe. The American Heart Association backs abdominal thrusts. Neither organization supports Heimlich\u2019s view that using the maneuver to remove water from the lungs could save drowning victims. They recommend CPR. Heimlich was proud of some of his other innovations, such as a chest drain valve credited by some with saving soldiers and civilians during the Vietnam War. But he drew sharp criticism for his theory that injecting patients with a curable form of malaria could trigger immunity in patients with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Medical experts have said injecting patients with malaria would be dangerous and have criticized Heimlich for conducting studies involving malariotherapy on HIV patients in China. Heimlich mostly brushed off critics. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit that a number of my ideas are controversial and in some ways unorthodox,\u201d Heimlich told the AP. \u201cBut I have enough guts to know that when I am right, it will come about as the thing to do, even if others do the wrong thing for a time.\u201d One of his most vocal critics has been his son, Peter Heimlich. The younger Heimlich split with his father years ago over a personal rift. He initially circulated anonymous criticisms of his father before openly speaking out against him online and in media interviews. Peter Heimlich has called many of his father\u2019s theories dangerous and spent years challenging many of his claims and trying to discredit them. The elder Heimlich maintained that his relationship with his son was a family matter and refused to comment on it to the media. The elder Heimlich attended Cornell University undergraduate and medical schools and interned at Boston City Hospital. During World War II, the U.S. Navy sent him to northwest China in 1942 to treat Chinese and American forces behind Japanese lines in the Gobi Desert. Beginning in the 1950s, Heimlich held staff surgeon positions at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Hospital and Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center. He later was an attending surgeon on the staffs at Jewish and Deaconess hospitals in Cincinnati and a researcher at his nonprofit Heimlich Institute. Heimlich\u2019s wife Jane, daughter of the late dance teacher Arthur Murray, died in November 2012. He is survived by two sons and two daughters. Phil Heimlich said a private family service and burial is planned soon. The family hopes to arrange a public memorial, he added, that will give his father\u2019s friends and admirers a chance to pay their respects. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Northern Illinois players take the field for a game against Toledo in Chicago on Nov. 9, 2016. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) As news about a football player boycott at Minnesota broke, Northern Illinois athletic director Sean Frazier quickly realized his Huskies might have a chance to play in the Holiday Bowl . One problem: NIU was already on winter break. But in less than 24 hours of frantic work, Frazier and NIU coaches knew they had what they needed most to accept a postseason bid on short notice: a motivated team. With the Huskies having played in San Diego bowl games two of the last three seasons Frazier knew the logistics would fall into place for a game against Washington State on Dec. 27. Easy? No. But far from impossible. \"Because we've had a relationship with (Holiday Bowl organizers), we felt this was necessary to support the bowl and support our student athletes,\" Frazier told The Associated Press on Saturday in a phone interview. \"That was a major part of this. This bowl committee, which had been so nice to us, friends to us, that we would get ourselves together and mobilize.\" Minnesota football team's boycott started with a bold demand for apologies and a threat to skip a bowl game if 10 teammates suspended after a sexual assault investigation weren't reinstated. It ended less than 36 hours later, the university leadership never blinking, and the players... The University of Minnesota football team's boycott started with a bold demand for apologies and a threat to skip a bowl game if 10 teammates suspended after a sexual assault investigation weren't reinstated. It ended less than 36 hours later, the university leadership never blinking, and the players... (Tribune news services) Earlier Saturday, Minnesota players announced they would end the boycott over the university suspension of 10 players accused of sexual assault. The Golden Gophers say they will make the trip to San Diego. Not even two days ago, that was in serious doubt. Frazier began getting text messages and email about what was happening at Minnesota on Thursday evening and immediately knew what that meant. It was time to start making calls. He informed his president and board of regents. Then he had to get his staff moving. Eight straight bowl appearances by NIU made Frazier's staff \"seasoned veterans\" when it came to bowl preparation. Most of all Frazier had to talk to coach Rod Carey to determine if NIU had a team that could play in 12 days \u2014 in a top second-tier bowl, nonetheless. \"Picture me calling him up at 9, 10 o'clock at night saying, 'Rod, this is the scenario. Talk to me.'\" Frazier said, \"He took a deep breath and said, 'Sean, I've got to get my guys back and some of them are training for the pros. Some of them are now on vacation. Some of them are here.' As you could imagine he did a fantastic job. I definitely have to take him out to dinner.\" NIU finished its season the Saturday after Thanksgiving at 5-7, but having won four of five as it got healthy after early season injuries. NCAA rules allow bowls to select 5-7 to fill spots if there are not enough six-win teams. The teams are selected in order of their latest Academic Progress Rate scores. NIU was next on the list, but the team hadn't even met since Nov. 27. Fall commencement was Dec. 11. The players had dispersed. ",

    "text": "By Missy Ryan December 17 at 5:04 PM Follow @missy_ryan The Chinese government will return a U.S. naval drone seized this week in the South China Sea, the Pentagon said Saturday, in a move that promises to defuse heightened maritime tensions between the two Pacific powers. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that Beijing had agreed to transfer the \u201cocean glider,\u201d a small unmanned vessel used to assess water conditions, back to the United States, but said details on how and when that would occur had not been decided. The latest spike in U.S.-Chinese maritime tensions occurred Thursday, when a Chinese submarine rescue ship close to the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey vessel operating about 50\u00a0nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines, took possession of the U.S. drone. The incident occurred within sight of the Bowditch, which tracks the drone as it collects unclassified data on water temperature, salinity and other factors that may affect U.S. naval operations. According to U.S. officials, the Chinese ship refused initial requests from the Bowditch to return the drone. \u201cWe have registered our objection to China\u2019s unlawful seizure of a U.S. unmanned underwater vehicle operating in international waters in the South China Sea,\u201d Cook said in a statement. (Jason Aldag,Julie Vitkovskaya/The Washington Post / Satellite photos courtesy of CSIS) \u201cThrough direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the [drone] to the United States,\u201d he said. [ Pentagon: Chinese naval ship seized a U.S. underwater drone in South China Sea ] While the seizure drew criticism from some U.S. lawmakers, statements from Washington and Beijing suggest that both sides are eager to avoid further intensifying tensions at a moment of deep uncertainty in U.S.-Chinese relations after the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Even as China asserts a right to areas of the South and East China seas also claimed by some of its neighbors, it has embarked on an ambitious program of constructing artificial islands, some of which appear to be intended as military outposts . The U.S. military has conducted repeated shows of force, sailing ships or conducting surveillance flights near disputed areas, while at the same time seeking to avoid any serious military escalation with a key commercial partner. Speaking after the Pentagon announced that the drone would be returned, a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment freely, said that the Obama administration was \u201cglad to get it back and put this behind us.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat reassuring that senior leadership in Beijing agreed that this was something that should be returned, regardless of the individual actions of their people at sea,\u201d the official said. It is not yet clear who exactly authorized the seizure of the drone. [ Photos: China\u2019s rapid island-building continues ] Those comments came after the Chinese Defense Ministry issued a statement saying the marine device had been taken in the interest of \u201csafe navigation\u201d in the area, according to a report from the Associated Press. The ministry also said the U.S. vessel would be returned \u201cthrough appropriate means,\u201d the AP reported. The flap over the drone comes as Trump\u2019s election generates concern for Chinese authorities, as the president-elect questions long-standing U.S. policy on China and continues his sharp criticism of Beijing\u2019s trade and monetary policies. Trump angered Chinese officials when he spoke by phone with the president of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province. While it is not clear how the Trump administration will handle efforts by China to assert itself in the South China Sea, his stance toward Beijing suggests a hard line. On Saturday morning, Trump issued a tweet that said: \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act.\u201d He later replaced the tweet with one correcting the spelling of \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story \u201cDonald Trump ran to make the governing people uncomfortable,\u201d said Andrew H. Card Jr., who served as chief of staff to former President George W. Bush and as transportation secretary for his father. \u201cHe clearly picked people to lead some of these departments who will be challenging to the insiders.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As Mr. Trump finishes announcing his choices for cabinet and senior White House aides, a picture is emerging of an administration with little ideological cohesion and no single animating purpose. They are neither all hard-right conservatives, nor all mainstream conservatives. They are not all insiders or outsiders. Some have known Mr. Trump for years. Others met him in the weeks since he was elected. Instead, Mr. Trump has recruited people to lead his government who can be roughly grouped into categories that appeal to the different parts of his psyche. In addition to the disrupters, there are the dealmakers, the loyalists, the establishment and the generals. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration so far reflects the people who worked for and advised him during the campaign. It is mostly men, and mostly white. Many of his picks are extraordinarily rich, though not all. Loyalty is at a premium \u2014 except when it isn\u2019t. (Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, was an early supporter who was rewarded. Todd Ricketts, who may become deputy commerce secretary, was a leader of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement.) There is \u201cno overarching theory,\u201d said Pete Wehner, who was deputy director of speechwriting for Mr. Bush and a fierce critic of Mr. Trump during the campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s not being driven by the usual impulses, which would be policy or ideology or political philosophy.\u201d Here is a look at the groups: The Disrupters Photo Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma state attorney general and a climate change denier, is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the E.P.A. Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Time Few things made Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign supporters roar with approval more than when he hammered the \u201cpolitical class in Washington,\u201d telling people at his rallies that the government had betrayed them, and vowing that change was coming. At many agencies, it may soon arrive. In addition to Ms. DeVos, Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Perry and Mr. Mulvaney, the disrupters include Ben Carson, chosen to lead the Housing Department; Andrew Puzder as labor secretary; Representative Tom Price of Georgia to oversee the Health and Human Services Department; and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general. The disrupters appear to have been picked in part for their singular ability to shake up the normal course of business at their agencies. Mr. Sessions, whose 1986 nomination as a federal judge was rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate because of testimony from colleagues that he was a racist , is likely to push for wholesale changes at the Justice Department by imposing conservative positions on immigration, terrorism, crime, drugs and guns. He is almost certain to reverse Obama-era efforts to confront civil rights violations, sentencing disparities and police abuses. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Carson, a surgeon who has no experience in housing or running a large government agency, has already put housing advocates on notice that he does not think much of current programs for the poor . Mr. Puzder, who owns fast-food chains and is opposed to raising the minimum wage , is a longtime critic of his department\u2019s approach. Mr. Price, who waged a crusade against the Affordable Care Act in Congress, could soon be in a position at H.H.S. to lead the drive to repeal and replace it. Mr. Trump demonstrated his desire for a disruptive force when he named Mr. Pruitt to head the nation\u2019s top environmental agency. While saying that his administration \u201cstrongly believes in environmental protection,\u201d he previewed the kind of change he is looking for. \u201cFor too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Pruitt \u201cwill reverse this trend.\u201d The Dealmakers Photo Steve Mnuchin, left, is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for Treasury secretary. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times As he creates an administration in his own image, perhaps no category is more natural for the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d than the dealmakers. Mr. Trump, who puts a premium on the ability to negotiate in business and finance, has chosen Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, to lead the Commerce Department; Steven Mnuchin of Goldman Sachs to lead the Treasury Department; and Rex W. Tillerson , the chairman of Exxon Mobil, who has a longtime relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, to be secretary of state. \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week during an interview about Mr. Tillerson on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company \u2014 not for himself \u2014 for the company.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin made a fortune through financial deals and now becomes the nation\u2019s top financial official. Mr. Ross, a \u201cvulture\u201d investor on Wall Street, bought nearly dead companies and made huge profits when his turnaround strategies worked. The Loyalists Photo Reince Priebus, left, and Stephen K. Bannon, center, at a rally this past week. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Like most future presidents, Mr. Trump has also positioned loyal, trusted aides to be close to him at the White House. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Four of the loyalists \u2014 Reince Priebus, who will be White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, chief strategist; Donald F. McGahn II, White House counsel; and Mr. Flynn, national security adviser \u2014 will occupy the most coveted real estate in the West Wing. The president has also tapped Linda McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, to oversee the Small Business Administration. Ms. McMahon has known Mr. Trump for years, long before he considered running for president. In 2007 on W.W.E., Mr. Trump took down Vince McMahon, Ms. McMahon\u2019s husband and the chairman of the organization, in what was billed as the \u201cBattle of the Billionaires.\u201d All five loyalists stuck by Mr. Trump during the toughest of times in the campaign. Mr. Priebus, the departing chairman of the Republican Party, came late to joining the Trump team, but refused to waver publicly when the Washington establishment was rushing to condemn Mr. Trump during various scandals, particularly a leaked \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording that captured Mr. Trump boasting about grabbing women by their genitals . Mr. Bannon, who has been accused of embracing white nationalist views as the head of Breitbart News, was always there, whispering advice to Mr. Trump in the background, if not officially in charge of campaign strategy. Mr. Flynn and Mr. McGahn are veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign world, having secured their posts in the administration through longevity. Loyalty goes only so far, however. Four of Mr. Trump\u2019s most avid supporters so far have no role in the new administration: Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey; Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker; Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas; and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City. The Establishment Photo Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for envoy to the United Nations. Credit Sean Rayford/Getty Images If there was one group Mr. Trump repeatedly derided on the campaign trail, it was the establishment. It was filled with the \u201cstupid\u201d people who ran the government poorly, Mr. Trump said. It represented the Washington swamp that he pledged to drain. When it looked like he might not win, he blamed them. But Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t shunned the establishment as he sets up his government. He has chosen Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, as his envoy to the United Nations; Representative Michael Pompeo of Kansas for C.I.A. director; and Elaine Chao as his secretary of transportation. Ms. Haley, a rising star in the Republican establishment, endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the primaries.

Despite saying during the campaign that he knew more about the Islamic State than generals did, Mr. Trump is now embracing the retired leaders of America\u2019s military. That explains Gen. James N. Mattis, who was responsible for American military operations in the Middle East as head of United States Central Command, or Centcom, and is now Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary. It also explains Gen. John F. Kelly, who oversaw American military operations in Central and South America as head of United States Southern Command and is now Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for homeland security secretary. It also may help frame his choice of Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former Navy SEAL commander, to be interior secretary. While not a general, Mr. Zinke served in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and the Pacific. His autobiography, \u201cAmerican Commander,\u201d was published recently. Mr. Trump particularly likes \u201cMad Dog Mattis,\u201d the former Centcom commander\u2019s nickname. \u201cMad Dog Mattis!\u201d Mr. Trump said to a roar of applause at a recent rally in Fayetteville, N.C. \u201cMad Dog plays no games, right?\u201d Mr. Trump called General Mattis, who led a Marine division to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, one of \u201cthe most effective generals that we\u2019ve had in many, many decades.\u201d Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.
