    "text": "Lower payout rates for most instant ticket games In lottery instant games, a percentage of ticket sales is returned to players in the form of prizes. That's known as the payout rate. While a game's final result is not entirely predictable, a game is designed to pay a specific rate if all tickets... (Cecilia Reyes) Other times, he questioned whether the advertisements fairly described the value of the grand prizes. For example, he advocated changing the fine print for \"Cash for Life\" games, in part because he questioned whether the lottery could legally or logistically guarantee anyone lifetime payments. As for how many tickets were printed for games, Jones said the state assumed Northstar was printing an appropriate number of tickets so games could be expected to award all the grand prizes. Northstar said it acted only with the state's approval. \"The Illinois Lottery was aware and involved in almost all aspects of a game launch,\" IGT said in a response to questions. Scientific Games added: \"The Illinois Lottery made final decisions with regards to prize structure, prize payout percent and the number of tickets printed.\" Ending games Scientific Games said the industry benchmark is for games to sell through 80 to 90 percent of their tickets. Birthday Surprise sold 64 percent of its tickets before it was ended with one of two grand prizes unawarded. Other big-prize instant games were ended after selling 49 percent of tickets, 37 percent of tickets, 22 percent, even 15 percent. In those four games, only one of 10 available grand prizes was awarded. Each week, the state publishes an online list showing all games and the number of big prizes each has left to award \u2014 information the state could have used to flag games pulled from shelves with unclaimed grand prizes. Yet there is no record that any lottery employee questioned at the time why the games were being ended with grand prizes left to be claimed. And in each case, the state did not veto the ending of a game. Players have up to a year after a game's sales have ended to claim winning tickets, at which point the lottery can determine exactly how many prizes that game awarded. There is no record that any lottery staff raised questions at that stage, either. A Tribune investigation found the Illinois Lottery collected hundreds of millions of dollars from selling tickets to the biggest-prize instant games in which it did not hand out all of the grand prizes in some of the games. (Illinois Lottery) Jones said that delay made it difficult to discover the practice. And even if the practice had been discovered, Jones said, a flawed contract with Northstar left state officials with few practical options for requiring changes, short of trying to dismiss Northstar. Under the deal, any request to change Northstar's day-to-day operations allowed Northstar to make demands of its own: lowering the revenue targets for the state. By the time Jones arrived, Northstar had demanded about $250 million in lowered profit targets; it received about $20 million. And, Jones said, by the time the lottery could have discovered the practice, he and his staff were focusing on severing ties with Northstar. \"Indeed, almost all of the Tribune's findings on the 17 examined games became evident after the lottery had already recommended, in the fall of 2013, that the Northstar contract be terminated. A termination that would make the practice moot,\" Jones said in a statement. Still, Jones' predecessor, Winnett, said the lottery under state management had tracked at least one metric \u2014 payout rates for sets of similarly priced games \u2014 in an effort to ensure games generally paid out as designed. \"That was our promise to the players,\" she said. Returning more Even if the state didn't study the performance of individual games, there was another metric that could have prompted questions about Northstar's management of instant games. In its winning bid, Northstar outlined an ambitious goal to help the state lottery compete in an increasingly crowded gambling environment. Northstar planned to manage a portfolio of games that, collectively, gave a greater percentage of sales overall back to players in the form of prizes. \"Payout optimization is an optimal way to provide greater excitement to players while maintaining an appropriate balance of responsible gaming,\" Northstar said in its proposal to the state. To achieve the goal, Northstar planned to improve Illinois' annual aggregate payout rate \u2014 at the time below 69 percent \u2014 to 73 percent by the fiscal year ending in June 2016. It was careful to caution that the projected payout rate was only an estimate and would most likely change as market conditions change. Northstar soon fell short. ",

    "text": "'Turbocharged' Storm Clobbers Northern New England With Snow By david sharp, associated press PORTLAND, Maine \u0097 Dec 30, 2016, 5:39 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Winter Storm Expected for the New Year 0 Shares Email The most powerful nor'easter in nearly two years brought heavy snow, powerful winds and even thunder and lightning to northern New England, leaving tens of thousands of people in the dark Friday and burying some towns under 2 feet of snow. More than 100,000 homes and businesses in Maine were without electricity at the storm's peak, and residents were warned that it could take days to restore service. The National Weather Service received reports of snow falling at up to 6 inches per hour. \"It went from just a garden-variety, low-pressure system to a turbocharged storm,\" meteorologist Eric Schwibs said. In Brunswick, resident Jason Weymouth went to bed with a sense of dread as powerful thunderclaps accompanied the falling snow. \"It hit over the house, and it was pretty loud and very strong and very unusual. That set me a little bit on edge,\" he said. By Friday morning, he was among the thousands of Maine residents without power. Compounding his misery: His snowblower was unable to cope with the heavy snow and his wood-carving shop was knocked offline for the day. The storm's fury walloped some places and skipped others as powerful bands of snow buried some communities while others just miles away received mostly rain. Hundreds of cars slid off roads from the beginning of the storm on Thursday through Friday morning, when the sun appeared. In Vermont , a 69-year-old man was killed in Cornwall when his car went off the road in slippery conditions Thursday and crashed into a tree, state police said. In Maine, the storm was believed to have contributed to a fatal fire in the town of Pownal. The victim's power had gone out, and investigators suspect he was using an alternative heat source when he died early Friday. The heavy snow knocked down power lines and tree limbs. In Orono, the domed structure used by student-athletes at the University of Maine athletic complex collapsed under the weight. Southern and western Maine turned out to be in the storm's bull's-eye, but the storm played a game of hopscotch, pummeling some communities with snow while leaving others just miles away drenched in rain. In Cumberland County, Portland received 7.7 inches of snow while Standish was buried under 27 inches of snow, Schwibs said. Other big snow totals in Maine included 27 inches in Naples, 25 inches in Parsonsfield and 22.7 inches in Hollis. Snow in New Hampshire peaked at around 17 inches in several towns near the Maine border. New Hampshire and Vermont were largely spared significant damage and power outages. The power company Eversource said about 11,000 New Hampshire homes lost power, but most was restored by Friday morning. The nor'easter's barometric pressure reading was expected to close in on readings from a crippling storm on Valentine's Day 2014, a storm that canceled flights, knocked out power and claimed more than two dozen lives on the East Coast. Because of the power outage Friday, the National Weather Service couldn't immediately provide a comparison of the two storms. More snow was forecast for New Year's Eve, providing incentive for people to get busy cleaning up before more snow began falling. Portland resident Richard Haynes found out the hard way that the icy conditions were hazardous. He slipped Thursday night and ended up in the emergency room. But that didn't keep him from digging out Friday. \"It caught us off-guard,\" he said Friday as he shoveled snow. \"I almost broke my back, had to get it checked at the hospital before I started shoveling.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Kathleen Ronayne in Concord, New Hampshire, and Marina Villeneuve in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Most recently, one person was shot dead and a 23-year old wounded at about 1:55 p.m. in the 8200 block of South Ingleside Avenue in the city's East Chatham neighborhood, according to police and fire officials. The 23-year-old man was on foot when someone walked up to him, brandished a gun and demanded his property, police said. They started fighting and shots rang out, which hit the 23-year-old in the hip and the robber in the head, police said. The robber, a male of an unknown age, was pronounced dead and the 23-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital where his condition has stabilized. One gun was recovered and no one is in custody, police said. Another fatal shooting occurred shortly before 12:30 p.m. in the 4800 block of West Ferdinand Street in the Austin neighborhood, police said. The victim, whose exact age was not available, suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The third slaying claimed a 64-year-old man who was fatally shot in the Garfield Ridge community on the Southwest Side. According to preliminary reports, the shooting happened about 9:20 a.m. in the 4200 block of South Keating Avenue, police said. The man suffered two gunshot wounds to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. About 10:30 a.m., a 23-year-old man was shot in the West Pullman neighborhood on the Far South Side. Police said the man was walking in the 200 block of West 117th Street when he was struck in the lower left leg. The bullet exited at his hip. He was taken in fair condition to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, police said. ",

    "text": "The Kennedy clan struggles with fame, success State prosecutors appealed, and in February argued before the state Supreme Court that Michael Skakel -- the nephew of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s widow, Ethel -- had a \u201cwell-planned, well thought-out, professional defense.\u201d Prosecutor Susann Gill told the justices that Sherman did a competent job investigating and trying the case and that Skakel\u2019s appellate lawyers had not met the high burden under case law to prove ineffective counsel. She also stood by the state\u2019s position that there was \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence that Michael Skakel killed Martha Moxley. But Santos told the justices, \u201cThis defendant did not get a fair shake. The weight of the evidence is that Tommy Skakel killed Martha Moxley.\u201d Santos also said Michael Skakel had an alibi on the night of the killing at 10 p.m., the time that he said evidence shows Moxley was killed. He cited testimony that Michael Skakel and some relatives left the neighborhood at about 9:30 p.m. to go to his cousin\u2019s house 20 minutes away to watch a Monty Python movie. Santos also said there was no forensic or physical evidence linking Skakel to the killing. In their ruling Friday, the Connecticut Supreme Court sided with prosecutors that Skakel received a fair defense, reports the Hartford Courant. \u201cBecause we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel rendered constitutionally adequate representation, we reverse the judgment\u201d of the lower court, the ruling said. Michael Skakel has maintained his innocence. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get a fair trial and he\u2019s not guilty,\u201d Robert Kennedy Jr., Skakel\u2019s cousin and one of his biggest defenders, told CBS News in February. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Michael Skakel will be sent back to prison or allowed to remain free if he appeals or asks the high court to reconsider.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Del. Robert G. Marshall of Prince William County proposed the bill, which says pornography leads to problems including the hypersexualization of teenagers and the normalization of abuse of women and children. While not calling for a ban on porn, the proposed bill says a \u201cpornography epidemic\u201d needs to be addressed, and that there is a need for research, education and policy change regarding what it calls a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Marshall said such a declaration could help pave the way for future limits, similar to how a 1964 federal government report linking cigarettes to disease spurred future restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to say, \u2018This is a problem,\u2019\u201d Marshall said, The Washington Post reported. \u201cBefore smoking was identified as a problem, at least the recognition that it led to certain pathologies was a starting point to put restrictions on it. . . . If you recognize it as a problem, then you\u2019re going to try to find ways to solve it within the framework of the statutes we can pass and the institutions we have.\u201d The legislation will be considered in 2017.

Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual speech to the Federal Assembly at Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow in early December. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U.S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin's decision not to expel U.S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country \u2014 admiring the Russian leader's strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump's ongoing praise of Putin. Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise \u2014 a stark break from decades of U.S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U.S. also retweeted Trump's post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram . Article continues after sponsorship Obama Announces Sanctions Against Russia In Response To Alleged Hacking On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U.S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said \"all Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions.\" President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump's praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama's actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions \"overdue\" but \"appropriate\" and said that \"Russia does not share America's interests.\" \"The Russians are not our friends,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a \"good initial step.\" Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U.S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia's economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, \"It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\" He said he would meet with U.S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Putin Says Russia Won't Expel Diplomats In Response To U.S. Sanctions Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. \"He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country,\" Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as \"talented.\" Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. \"I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said, 'Thank you very much' to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,\" Trump said. Trump Tweets Give A Glimpse Into Foreign Policy Approach But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn't going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as \"a leader far more than our president has been\" at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump's debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a \"puppet\" of Russia. Trump shot back: \"No puppet. No puppet. You're the puppet.\" He often criticizes the so-called \"reset\" with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. Bloomberg Politics YouTube With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy \u2014 violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump's staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won't end once he's in the Oval Office. So far, he's outlined his opposition to the United States' abstention from the U.N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U.S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he's often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U.S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia \u2014 perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama's.

He ended the year in another dramatic flourish \u2014 strutting into Trump Tower as perhaps the most unlikely ally of the president-elect. And through all the antics, the year for Yeezy was at times as beautiful, dark and twisted a fantasy as ever. That's because the \"Famous\" rapper managed to remain remarkably relevant, if not for his music or his fashion line, than for a string of public and erratic outbursts that propelled him into the national conversation in unprecedented ways. Next year, West turns 40, but don't expect anything to change. The controversial rapper remains poised to keep people guessing and just as engaged as they were in 2016. A Year Defined by Politics West, who never said which political party, if any, he'd be affiliated with should he ever run for president, projected the utmost confidence that he is up to the task despite never having held public office. LIFESTYLE | A Political Kanye depicted by Barry Blitt | @NewYorker pic.twitter.com/vANn6sfbFE \u2014 THE CORNER\u00ae (@gettothecorner) September 4, 2015 A HuffPost/YouGov poll from last year suggested that only 6 percent of Americans would even consider voting for West. Related: Analysis: Kanye and Trump Benefiting From Confident, 'Crazy' Brand Although West donated to Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign and appeared to take shots at Trump, he retroactively endorsed the president-elect during an erratic concert in Sacramento, California, in November. He also criticized frequent collaborator Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and President Barack Obama \u2014 then stormed off the stage after declaring, \"I'm on my Trump sh*t tonight.\" Play Is Trump's meeting with Kanye West important or a distraction? 2:26 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161231014524if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/832527939998\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> West went on to have an unexpected face-to-face meeting with Trump at Trump Tower earlier this month to discuss \"bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums and violence in Chicago.\" He left with a handshake and a signed copy of Trump's TIME Person of the Year cover. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) Trump has insisted that he and West are \"great friends.\" \"Kanye West hugging President-elect Trump is not how most of us expected 2016 to end,\" said Zack O'Malley Greenburg , a Forbes entertainment writer and author of the Jay Z biography \" Empire State of Mind .\" \"Yeah, I think it'll lose him some fans, but will it kill his career? I don't think so. Kanye has made a brand out of making people uncomfortable, for better or worse.\" Meanwhile, West walked away from their conversation with an apparently different perspective on his political future, simply tweeting: \"#2024.\" A Year Defined by Scandals The Chicago rapper's embrace of Trump, who has been dogged by criticism for racially charged and anti-Muslim rhetoric during the 2016 campaign, amused and alienated many of his fans and peers in the music business . But it was just one of several controversial episodes from 2016. \"I think this was supposed to be the year that Kanye got his affairs in order. But what kind of ended up happening was something very different,\" Greenburg said. In the end, 2016 ended up being a year of missed opportunities for him.\" Rapper Kanye West performs on June 3, 2016 in Anaheim, California. Scott Dudelson / FilmMagic In February alone, Kanye said that embattled comedian Bill Cosby was innocent of the numerous allegations of sexual assault lodged against him (Cosby has also denied the charges), and he asked Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to help him pay off a purported $53 million debt. In a video leaked from a \"Saturday Night Live\" rehearsal, the rapper boasted that he was \"50 percent\" more influential than any other artist living or dead, including Pablo Picasso, drug kingpin Pablo Escobar and filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Speaking of Picasso, West named his latest critically acclaimed album , \"The Life of Pablo,\" after the iconic painter. But that LP's botched rollout \u2014 it was initially supposed to be released exclusively on Jay Z's music streaming platform Tidal, but was undermined by leaks and eventually found its way onto iTunes \u2014 somewhat overshadowed its content. On that album, West resurrected his years-long feud with singer Taylor Swift, rapping that he made her famous and that, despite being a married father of two, he \"might still have sex\" with the singer. West and his reality star wife, Kim Kardashian, would later provide audio of a phone conversation with Swift as proof that she signed off on the lyrics , an assertion the Grammy-winning pop star has called into question . A Year Defined by Health Concerns Public feuds aside, there have been legitimate worries from fans about West's well-being. His November concert rant in Sacramento preceded an extended hospital stay for exhaustion , according to his representatives. The rest of West's ongoing \"Life of Pablo\" tour (21 arena dates) was canceled indefinitely, but that doesn't mean he will be slowing down. \"Trying to predict what Kanye will do next is kind of a fool's errand,\" Greenburg added. \"I think the only thing you can predict is that he is going to be unpredictable.\" In other words, the road to #2024 could be the start of a whole new West \u2014 and not just a White House run.

Trump. He would\u2019ve been one of those people Hillary Clinton called a \"deplorable.\" I\u2019ve lived in New York City for more than a decade now \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen firsthand the contempt for country folks like my father \u2013 people from rural America. Click here to pre-order Todd\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Deplorables\u2019 Guide to Making America Great Again\u201d! As I write in my new book, \u201cThe Deplorables\u2019 Guide to Making America Great Again,\u201d \u00a0I feel like a \"Duck Dynasty\" guy living in a \"Modern Family\" world \u2013 where right is wrong, wrong is right \u2013 it\u2019s as if our values have been turned upside down. President Obama called us \"bitter.\" He said we were the kinds of people who cling to guns and religion. Time and time again he stood on foreign soil and apologized for our nation. And to this day it remains unclear whether he believes the United States is the most exceptional nation on Earth. And how can we forget what Miss Hillary said? \"To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables. Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.\" The only thing deplorable was Hillary Clinton's basket of grossly generalistic comments. \"And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up,\" she went on to say. \"He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric.\" Her campaign portrayed conservative Catholicism as a \u201cbastardization of the faith\u201d and seemed to imply that Evangelicals are a bunch of impoverished country bumpkins. We were mocked by Hollywood and dismissed by academics. We were marginalized by the media \u2013 bullied and belittled by sex and gender revolutionaries. But all that changed on Election Day \u2013 when Donald Trump became a champion for the Silent Majority. He gave us a voice.\u00a0 And now the Silent Majority is silent no more. We the People have decided that it\u2019s time to drain the swamp. It\u2019s time to restore traditional values. It\u2019s time to protect the Constitution. It\u2019s time to defend our sovereignty. It\u2019s time to save unborn babies. It\u2019s time to stand up for the American working man (and woman) and bring jobs back from China and Mexico. It\u2019s time to eradicate the scourge of ObamaCare. And that, my friends, is the top story of 2016. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

In this Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016 file photo, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence wave as they visit to Carrier factory, in Indianapolis, Ind. (Evan Vucci / AP) Danielle PaquetteThe Washington Post A month after President-elect Donald Trump announced a deal with air conditioning company Carrier to save hundreds of U.S. factory jobs that were slated for Mexico, officials say the agreement has yet to be finalized, and they have released few details about its terms. The state of Indiana, where the affected jobs are located, agreed to give Carrier up to $7 million in tax credits over 10 years to keep the facility open. Trump and Mike Pence - Indiana's Republican governor and the vice president-elect - have touted the deal as a victory for their incoming administration and an example of how they'll jump-start the economy. However, specifics have been elusive. Trump and the leader of the union that represents the Carrier workers have clashed over the number of jobs saved. It is also unclear whether the company received any federal concessions. In response to an open-records request from The Washington Post seeking any written communications about the agreement, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, a state agency chaired by Pence, said Indiana law allows it to withhold information until a contract is settled. The truth about Trump's Carrier deal The deal the president-elect made with United Technologies, Carrier's parent company, involves outsourcing almost as many jobs as it saves. The deal the president-elect made with United Technologies, Carrier's parent company, involves outsourcing almost as many jobs as it saves. See more videos The agency has taken this route \"to enable effective negotiations on behalf of Hoosiers,\" wrote Chris Cotterill, the agency's general counsel, saying it will take up to three months to finalize the terms of the pact. Jonathan Bruno, a legal scholar at Harvard University, said the law does not stop the state from providing such records prior to a final deal, but it does give the option. \"It's hard to defend the continued secrecy of the deal,\" Bruno wrote in an email. \"Pence et al. are trying to have it both ways - they're suggesting that the deal is ready for public consumption by taking credit for one aspect (some indeterminate number of jobs saved), while simultaneously asserting its confidentiality by withholding every other aspect of the terms.\" ",

(Photo: Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports) 7407 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Ten suspended Minnesota football players will not face charges in connection with an alleged sexual assault near campus, prosecutors announced Friday after taking a second look at the case. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman had previously declined to charge the players in connection with the September incident that triggered suspensions, possible expulsions, talk of a bowl game boycott and questions of whether head coach Tracy Claeys should continue with the Gopher football program. But the school\u2019s own investigation unearthed the troubling details of the female victim\u2019s sexual assault by 10 to 20 men on the team after their season-opening victory. After reviewing that report, Freeman stood by his November decision, saying the school\u2019s investigation didn\u2019t add sufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges. \u201cThat report shined a light on what can only be described as deplorable behavior,\u201d Freeman said in a statement. He said he would have no further comment because the university\u2019s appeal process was continuing. Minnesota emerges from turmoil to upset Washington State in Holiday Bowl Lee Hutton, the players\u2019 attorney, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone message or email seeking comment. The university said in a statement it respects Freeman\u2019s decision, but noted their own suspensions of the players stem from different standards and policies than the criminal process Freeman worked through. The school suspended the 10 players after completing its own investigation, the results of which it kept private, citing federal privacy laws. But a local TV station published a redacted copy of the 82-page report which quoted the woman as saying she believed 10 to 20 men had sex with her, though she was not certain. She told university investigators she was too traumatized to clearly remember events. The report concluded that the victim\u2019s account of that night was more credible than the players it interviewed, and said some players tried to impede the university\u2019s investigation into the incident. Soon after the report was leaked, remaining members of the football roster \u2014 who had vowed to boycott Tuesday\u2019s Holiday Bowl unless their teammates were reinstated \u2014 relented , going on to beat Washington State 17-12. The case dates to the start of the season. Five players \u2014 Carlton Djam, Dior Johnson, KiAnte Hardin, Ray Buford Jr. and Tamarion Johnson \u2014 told police they had consensual sex with the woman at an off-campus dorm. Four of them were suspended for three games early in the season, but later reinstated in October. After the school\u2019s investigation, which has a lower standard of proof than criminal charges, the school announced on Dec. 13 that those five players were suspended and Antoine Winfield Jr., Seth Green, Mark Williams, Kobe McCrary and Antonio Shenault were out for the bowl game as well. All 10 players are awaiting a university hearing to appeal their suspensions. Several players face permanent expulsion from the university, while others could be suspended for a year. Meanwhile, a decision regarding Claeys\u2019 future is up in the air. Claeys has two years remaining on his contract, shorter than the norm for coaches to sell program stability to potential recruits. Amid calls for his firing, athletic director Mark Coyle has said he plans to meet with the football coach in the near future. The charging decision on Friday is just the latest twist for an athletics program that\u2019s no stranger to turmoil. A cheating scandal involving the Gophers\u2019 basketball team enveloped the university in 1999, leading to hefty punishment from the NCAA after it concluded an office manager had completed hundreds of assignments for players. More recently, a former athletic director resigned in disgrace last year after admitting to groping several female employees and sending lewd texts during a university function. Just this year, heralded Gopher wrestling coach J. Robinson was fired amid an investigation into the team\u2019s alleged sale and use of illicit drugs, which university officials said Robinson failed to disclose.

(Photo: MAST IRHAM, epa) JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 An Indonesian budget airline has fired a pilot suspected of trying to fly a plane while he was drunk, and two of its executives are resigning. Citilink President Director Albert Burhan announced Friday that he and the airline\u2019s production director would resign over the impropriety. Citilink is a subsidiary of national flag carrier\u00a0Garuda Indonesia. Passengers became suspicious when they heard slurred words and unclear announcements from the cockpit. Some of them left the plane and asked for a replacement of the pilot they believed to be either drunk or under drug influence. Citilink assigned a new pilot to fly the Airbus A320 about an hour behind schedule. The flight had 154 passengers but a number reportedly decided to cancel. The flight on Wednesday was heading from Surabaya, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest city, to the capital, Jakarta. Aviation is a main mode of travel in the sprawling nation of 17,000 islands, and the incident has raised safety concerns. YouTube footage showed the pilot appeared to stagger through a metal detector at a security checkpoint and security guards picked up his belongings that were falling on the floor as he seemed out of control. \u201cThe pilot had committed serious violation of standard operation procedure that endangered passengers,\u201d Burhan said. \u201cWe apologize for the discomfort. I have to be responsible for that and therefore I and my production director resign.\u201d The airline previously had dismissed reports that the 32-year-old pilot Tekad Purna was drunk, saying initial tests of drug and alcohol were negative. Director General of Air Transportation Suprasetyo has asked Citilink to make sure the pilot underwent a medical check. Purna is under investigation for possible drunkenness or drug use. Minister of Transportation Budi Karya has banned him from flying pending the outcome of the investigation. If proven, his license would be revoked. In December last year, three crew members \u2014 a pilot and two flight attendants were arrested for allegedly consuming crystal methamphetamine, known locally as shabu-shabu, at a hotel. 4762 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iNq27r NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

The bad odor first emerged Wednesday, sending local authorities scurrying \u2013 including a visit by fire trucks to the luxury Fairmont hotel following complaints. The odor, variously described as the smell of sulfur or rotten eggs, was reported around midnight Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0It is not considered a health hazard. A Chevron spokesman confirmed to the San Francisco Chronicle that there had been a flaring incident \u2014\u00a0a routine activity in which excess gas is burned off \u2014\u00a0but that its\u00a0investigation at the Richmond facility showed it was not the source of the odor.

Investigators,\u00a0who are also analyzing\u00a0wind and weather reports for the period, say they\u00a0are checking landfills, wastewater treatment plants and even ships. Initial reports of the smell poured into the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. for two days, but its officials have\u00a0ruled out a gas leak as a source of the bad odor. \"Even though we're saying this is not us, you should do the safest thing possible and make that call,\" PG&E spokesperson Teresa Jimenez said, ABC7 reports .

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Emma Brown and Mandy McLaren December 26 Follow @emmersbrown Indiana lawmakers originally promoted the state\u2019s school voucher program as a way to make good on America\u2019s promise of equal opportunity, offering children from poor and lower-middle-class families an escape from public schools that failed to meet their needs. But five years after the program was established, more than half of the state\u2019s voucher recipients have never attended Indiana public schools, meaning that taxpayers are now covering private and religious school tuition for children whose parents had previously footed that bill. Many vouchers also are going to wealthier families, those earning up to $90,000 for a household of four. The voucher program, one of the nation\u2019s largest and fastest-growing, serves more than 32,000 children and provides an early glimpse of what education policy could look like in Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump has signaled that he intends to pour billions of federal dollars into efforts to expand vouchers and charter schools nationwide. Betsy DeVos, his nominee for education secretary, played an important role in lobbying for the establishment of Indiana\u2019s voucher program in 2011. And Vice President-elect Mike Pence led the charge as the state\u2019s governor to loosen eligibility requirements and greatly expand the program\u2019s reach. The idea of sending taxpayer funds to private and parochial schools is one of the most polarizing propositions in education. To proponents, the rapid expansion of Indiana\u2019s program is a model for giving more families better educational options. But Indiana\u2019s voucher program is seen by many public school advocates as a cautionary tale. Most recipients are not leaving the state\u2019s worst schools: Just 3\u00a0percent of new recipients of vouchers in 2015 qualified for them because they lived in the boundaries of F-rated public schools. And while overall private school enrollment grew by 12,000 students over the past five years, the number of voucher recipients grew by 29,000, according to state data, meaning that taxpayer money is potentially helping thousands of families pay for a choice they were already making. Most recipients qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, according to state data, but a growing proportion \u2014 now 31\u00a0percent \u2014 do not.

(Joshua Lott/For The Washington Post) [ Trump picks billionaire Betsy DeVos, school voucher advocate, to be education secretary ] \u201cThe political strategy that voucher supporters have used is to start off small and targeted \u2014 low-income families and special-education students \u2014 then gradually expand it to more groups,\u201d said Douglas Harris, a Tulane University professor of economics who favors choice but has been critical of DeVos\u2019s free-market approach. \u201cThat\u2019s also something the Trump-DeVos team will likely try. The term \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 comes to mind.\u201d Indiana\u2019s program offers vouchers to low-income families, giving them an amount equal to 90\u00a0percent of the state funds that otherwise would have gone to their assigned public schools to educate their children. That figure ranges from $4,700 to $6,500 per child, depending on the school district. Children from more-affluent families get half that amount in vouchers. Indiana\u2019s program has succeeded in reaching children who otherwise would not have the chance to attend private schools. Stephanie Schaefer of Newburgh, Ind., is a stay-at-home mother of six children, four of whom have used vouchers. For her 13-year-old daughter, Eliana, the opportunity to attend a private school was transformative: After struggling with learning disabilities and falling behind at her highly regarded public school, Eliana was able to catch up, thanks to more-personalized attention at Evansville Christian School. Her progress was a relief for her and her parents. Schaefer said she and her husband, an engineer, own their home and consider themselves middle-class. \u201cWe have a comfortable living, but we struggle when it comes to extra,\u201d she said, and they never could have afforded private school without help from the voucher program. \u201cI don\u2019t think public education works for every kid,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cParents should have the right to be able to find out where their child can fit, where their child can get the best education.\u201d [ For Indiana special-education students, choice comes at a cost ] Pence\u2019s support Indiana\u2019s legislature first approved a limited voucher program in 2011, capping it at 7,500 students in the first year and restricting it to children who had attended public schools for at least a year. \u201cPublic schools will get first shot at every child,\u201d then-Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) said at the time. \u201cIf the public school delivers and succeeds, no one will seek to exercise this choice.\u201d DeVos, who had lobbied for the program as chairwoman of the American Federation for Children, hailed its passage and proposed that other states follow Indiana\u2019s lead . Two years later, Pence entered the governor\u2019s office with a pledge to extend vouchers to more children. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that ails our schools that can\u2019t be fixed by giving parents more choices and teachers more freedom to teach,\u201d Pence said during his inaugural address in 2013. [ Trump could reverse Obama\u2019s actions on college sexual assault, transgender rights ] Within months, Indiana lawmakers eliminated the requirement that children attend public school before receiving vouchers and lifted the cap on the number of recipients. The income cutoff was raised, and more middle-class families became eligible. When those changes took effect, an estimated 60\u00a0percent of all Indiana children were eligible for vouchers, and the number of recipients jumped from 9,000 to more than 19,000 in one year. The proportion of children who had never previously attended Indiana public schools also rose quickly: By 2016, more than half of voucher recipients \u2014 52\u00a0percent \u2014 had never been in the state\u2019s public school system. \u201cGovernor Pence supports the rights of parents to exercise choice and select the best school for their children,\u201d Kara Brooks, Pence\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement to The Washington Post. The state Education Department says taxpayers are taking on $53\u00a0million in tuition costs that they were not bearing before, although it is unclear how many of those students would otherwise attend public schools \u2014 with state funding \u2014 if there were no vouchers. Voucher proponents dismiss the estimate as inflated by a Democratic state education chief. Mychal Thom, head of Concordia Lutheran High School in Fort Wayne, estimated that at least half of his school\u2019s 366\u00a0voucher recipients last year would have enrolled at Concordia even if the voucher program did not exist. \u201cIt\u2019s just reduced some of the financial burden on families to attend,\u201d he said. Janelle Ruba, principal of Adventist Christian Elementary in Bloomington, said the same of her small school: \u201cMost of the students were already in our school, so the vouchers have just helped with their payment.\u201d According to state data, more than 300\u00a0Indiana private schools accepted vouchers last year. Voucher recipients composed more than 75\u00a0percent of students at 44\u00a0of those schools, most of which identify themselves as Catholic, Lutheran or Christian. Students pass \u201cThe Road to Success\u201d sign displayed in the hallway at Horizon Christian Academy in Fort Wayne, Ind. (Joshua Lott/For The Washington Post) Opponents skeptical Opponents argue that vouchers are not reaching the children most in need of better schools. They also assert that voucher programs violate the constitutional separation of church and state by funneling public dollars into religious schools, including those that teach creationism instead of the theory of evolution. Indiana\u2019s program survived a legal challenge in 2013, when a judge ruled that the primary beneficiaries of the vouchers were families, not religious institutions. Indiana has no financial reporting requirements for private schools that receive public funds, leaving taxpayers with less oversight and accountability than with the state\u2019s public schools. And although the state\u2019s voucher program has more stringent academic expectations than many others \u2014 private schools must give the same state tests as public schools, are graded on the same A-to-F scale and can be prohibited from accepting new voucher students if they perform poorly \u2014 there are loopholes. Small schools do not get letter grades, for example, and thus are immune to the consequences for poor performance, according to state education officials. Even schools deemed failing sometimes continue receiving voucher money, according to state records. [ Quality controls lacking for D.C. private schools receiving vouchers ] Horizon Christian Academy, for example, had three campuses at which 85\u00a0percent of students received vouchers in 2015-2016, bringing in a total of $2.8\u00a0million in state funds. Horizon has not fared well on the state\u2019s grading system, and one of its campuses received two F\u2019s in a row, a performance so poor that the school should have faced consequences this year, according to state law. Horizon consolidated its three schools into one, which was then allowed to continue accepting new voucher students this fall \u2014 though Tammy Henline, a Horizon co-founder and its superintendent, said the consolidation had nothing to do with avoiding accountability: \u201cHaving everyone in the same building makes things a little simpler.\u201d Robert Enlow, president and chief executive of EdChoice, an Indianapolis-based organization that advocates for vouchers nationwide, said he wondered why voucher opponents are not as skeptical of persistently terrible public schools as they are of private schools. \u201cWe have schools that have been dropout factories in this state forever,\u201d he said. Effect on public schools Even as vouchers have shored up many parochial schools, public schools have been squeezed: State education spending has not kept up with inflation, and still is not as high, in real dollars, as it was in 2011, according to Lawrence DeBoer, an economist at Purdue University. But it is not clear how the vouchers have affected public school finances. Indiana state tax money follows children to whatever schools they attend, so public schools that lose students also lose revenue. But spending on vouchers has not affected the rate of growth in overall state aid to local districts, DeBoer said, noting that the $132\u00a0million price tag for vouchers in 2016 was a tiny fraction of the $6.9\u00a0billion that local districts received from the state. It is also not clear that vouchers are an effective way to boost student achievement. Some research has found that after using vouchers to transfer from public to private schools, Indianapolis students experienced no change in language arts performance and saw a decline in their math performance. Studies of other statewide voucher programs have made similar findings. Glenda Ritz, the state\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, said Indiana has spent nearly $375\u00a0million to date on a voucher program that has yet to be evaluated. \u201cBefore replicating this program on a national level, Hoosier taxpayers deserve a full accounting of the impact this program is having on student academic achievement and diversity as well as the fiscal impact on public school funding,\u201d she said. Other studies have found that voucher programs boost college enrollment and completion rates, especially among minority and low-income students. To some Hoosiers, worries about school funding and student achievement are secondary to questions about the effect that vouchers might have on public education\u2019s role as a civic institution. Private schools set their own admissions standards and can reject students for any reason, leading to concerns about segregation not just by race and class, but also by faith, ability and disability. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to expand vouchers further, folks have to grapple with: Are we going to distribute public funds to private entities that can practice discriminatory or exclusionary practices?\u201d said David B. Smith, superintendent of public schools in Evansville, Ind.

By Will Hobson December 30 at 8:47 AM Follow @TheWillHobson Dagny Knutson at Moon Valley Country Club in Phoenix, Ariz. (Caitlin O'Hara/for The Washington Post) PHOENIX, Ariz. \u2014 This was supposed to be the year Dagny Knutson became a household name by thrashing the competition in the pool in Rio de Janeiro. In 2010, Knutson was widely considered the next breakout American swimming star. At the urging of USA Swimming officials, she said, Knutson turned down a college scholarship and entrusted her career to the Olympic national governing body for the sport. And then it all went awry. In six years, Knutson has gone from odds-on Olympic star to cautionary tale through a series of twists and turns including a fired coach, an eating disorder and an unresolved fraud lawsuit against an Olympic sports insider who Knutson claims betrayed her to maintain friendships with USA Swimming officials. Knutson\u2019s story, according to her and her lawyers, evinces the massive power imbalance in Olympic sports, where management enjoys monopoly control and athletes have little leverage. \u201cAs athletes, we have to trust USA Swimming has our best interests at heart. And when they take advantage of that, we can\u2019t do anything about it . . . Because they have all the power,\u201d Knutson said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other explanation for why they did what they did, other than they don\u2019t care.\u201d USA Swimming declined to comment for this story. In a deposition, USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus blamed Knutson\u2019s situation on a former coach who made promises he wasn\u2019t authorized to make. \u201cUSA Swimming likes to do the right thing. We hang our hat on that,\u201d Wielgus said. Today, Knutson is a 24-year-old counselor for college students in Phoenix, living in a one-bedroom apartment with no trace of her former life as a world-class swimmer. The medals and Team USA garb are packed in boxes in her mother\u2019s North Dakota home. \u201cShe was just a thoroughbred that they wanted to put out to pasture, or get rid of,\u201d said her mother, Ronda Knutson. \u201cI\u2019m just sickened by it.\u201d Knutson turned down college scholarship offers to turn professional and train with USA Swimming. (Caitlin O'Hara/for The Washington Post) Not \u2018the typical path\u2019 Born in 1992, Knutson grew up in Minot, N.D., a town of about 35,000 people where neighbors leave garage doors open and front doors unlocked. Inspired by watching the 2000 Sydney Olympics with her father, Knutson started swimming competitively at age 9. When she was 12, Knutson set four state records, earning a mention in Sports Illustrated. When she was 16, Knutson broke the American record in the 400-yard individual medley and won six gold medals at a junior international swimming event, posting times that would have made her competitive at the Beijing Olympics the year before. Her performances brought visits from USA Swimming officials to northern North Dakota, a region not known for producing elite swimmers. The only Olympic-sized pool in the area was outdoors and lacked lights. Jim Knutson, an Army veteran and nurse, struck a deal for Dagny to swim there at night in the summers. Jim provided the lights by parking his Jeep near the pool. \u201cIt\u2019s just so different than the typical path,\u201d Mark Schubert, the venerated, longtime Olympic swimming coach, told The Washington Post in 2009 about Knutson. \u201cIt kind of gives everybody hope.\u201d [ This body is supposed to help Olympic athletes make ends meet. It doesn\u2019t. ] In early 2010, Schubert flew to Minot with a proposition for Knutson and her parents. Knutson had accepted a full athletic scholarship from Auburn University, but had just learned the coach who recruited her was leaving. Dozens of other colleges were interested in her, but Schubert recommended another option, according to Knutson: She could turn professional and train at one of USA Swimming\u2019s \u201cCenters of Excellence,\u201d training facilities Schubert developed. Knutson would get more individualized attention, Schubert told her, and USA Swimming would offer the equivalent of a full scholarship, covering her tuition, room and living costs through the 2016 Olympics. Her parents had doubts, but after Dagny visited the Center for Excellence in Fullerton, Calif., she was convinced. She moved there in the summer of 2010 and enrolled in community college. The Knutsons never asked Schubert to put the offer in writing, a decision they would later regret. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you want to call us naive or what, but we just had no reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Ronda Knutson said. Knutson, Katie Hoff, Allison Schmitt and MIssy Franklin show their gold medals for the s 4x200m relay at 2011 world championships. (Michael Sohn/AP) A deal gone bad In November 2010, USA Swimming abruptly fired Schubert. No reason was given publicly, but Schubert and Wielgus\u2019s relationship reportedly had soured. With Schubert gone, Knutson reached out to USA Swimming officials about her rent and tuition. It quickly became apparent they had no idea what Schubert had promised her. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colo., USA Swimming oversees nearly every level of the sport domestically and manages Team USA at the Olympics and other international events. In 2010, USA Swimming reported $26.4 million in revenue and paid Wielgus $781,000 and Schubert $368,000. Team USA swimmers, though, made stipends of $1,750 per month. Almost immediately, court records show, Wielgus expressed concern about the cost of the deal Knutson said she\u2019d been promised. On Nov. 11, 2010, Wielgus emailed several other USA Swimming officials. \u201cMark apparently made promises . . . to Dagny that: (a) he did not make me or others aware of; and (b) he did not have the authority to make,\u201d he wrote. Schubert denied guaranteeing Knutson tuition support after the 2012 Olympics, but both Knutson\u2019s parents and two other witnesses to the meeting supported Dagny\u2019s claims. Knutson\u2019s agent connected her with Richard Foster, a lawyer well-known in Olympic circles. Foster has never won a medal or made an Olympic team, but he\u2019s one of many members of the \u201cOlympic movement\u201d who has parlayed his relationships into income over the years. A collegiate water polo player, Foster has served in various capacities for USA Water Polo, the United States Olympic Committee, and FINA, the global organization that oversees international swimming. He wrote a book for Olympic legend Mark Spitz, secured a consulting position with a pool manufacturer and gained clients including several Olympic swimmers and Schubert, the famed coach. From the beginning of his negotiations on Knutson\u2019s behalf, records show, Foster made clear to USA Swimming officials they did not need to worry about a lawsuit from Knutson. \u201cChuck: As you know, I represent a lot of athletes, including a fairly large group of swimmers,\u201d Foster wrote Wielgus on Nov. 16, 2010. \u201cIf an issue comes up, I will discuss it with you in hopes of resolving the issue. I won\u2019t however get involved with litigation against USA Swimming. I have too many friends in the organization, including you.\u201d [ USA Track and Field CEO has alarmed some insiders with his spending and style ] The next day, Foster emailed Wielgus to let him know an Associated Press reporter had contacted him. Word of Knutson\u2019s situation had started to circulate. \u201cI told the reporter I couldn\u2019t comment,\u201d Foster wrote. After months of negotiations, Foster emailed Knutson what he termed the \u201cfinal offer\u201d: USA Swimming would cover Knutson\u2019s college costs through 2016, but only if she maintained a spot in either the top 25 of the world or top three in the U.S. in one Olympic event. Before signing, Knutson balked at the performance requirement. She didn\u2019t like the idea that if she had a bad year, or got hurt, she\u2019d lose her college money. As her lawyer, Foster replied, \u201cA performance marker is not unreasonable.\u201d A few days later, he sent over the contract. \u201cDagny: We wanted to get a little more up front, but this is a good deal,\u201d he wrote. She signed it. At first, things went well. Knutson moved to Gainesville, Fla., attended community college and trained under University of Florida Coach Gregg Troy. In 2011, she won a gold medal at the FINA World Championships as part of the 800-meter freestyle relay team that included Missy Franklin. In 2012, a private struggle Knutson had been dealing with burst into public view. She had an eating disorder \u2014 bulimia \u2014 marked by periods of binging followed by purging, or making herself throw up. Studies have shown eating disorder rates are higher among athletes, particularly women, than the general population. While Franklin won four gold medals at the London Olympics, Knutson cycled through inpatient and outpatient therapy. By the fall of 2012, her condition stabilized, Knutson asked USA Swimming to start her tuition assistance at a college in North Dakota, closer to home. Lindsay Mintenko, USA Swimming\u2019s national team director, told Knutson her tuition support was over, because she\u2019d fallen from the world rankings while in treatment. Without financial assistance, Knutson\u2019s parents struggled to pay tuition and her travel and training costs as she tried to regain a national team spot . Knutson petitioned the NCAA to restore her amateur status, so she could get another scholarship, but her appeal was denied. She eventually retired from competitive swimming. In 2014, a friend connected Knutson with Bob Allard, a San Jose attorney well-known in Olympic circles for his outspoken criticism of USA Swimming for how it\u2019s handled sex-abuse prevention. Allard felt that Knutson had viable fraud lawsuits against USA Swimming and Schubert, but as part of the deal Foster negotiated, Knutson had agreed not to sue either. There was one person she could still sue, though: Foster. \u201cUntil I hired Bob, I knew I had gotten screwed over, but I didn\u2019t know how,\u201d Knutson said. \u201cI thought it was all my fault.\u201d Knutson had been reluctant to add performance benchmarks to her agreement with USA Swimming. (Caitlin O'Hara/for The Washington Post) \u2018A dangerous outcome\u2019 Last June, as Knutson\u2019s former teammates and other Olympic hopefuls prepared for U.S. trials , Knutson sat in a California courtroom, looking on as Allard made his opening argument. \u201cThis is a case about a well-connected lawyer in the aquatics industry who takes on, as a client, a young and vulnerable potential Olympic champion, but places her interests well behind those of his friends, his political allies and his business associates,\u201d Allard told the jury. \u201cThat\u2019s what this case is all about: a lawyer selling out his client.\u201d Foster pointed out the deal he got Knutson was the most lucrative USA Swimming had ever given a swimmer. When asked about his email assuring Wielgus he would never sue, Foster said his friendships help him and his clients. \u201cI can achieve good results negotiating with USA Swimming or any sport because of my involvement in the Olympic movement . . . They will take my calls,\u201d Foster testified. \u201cMy personal relationship with them allows me access and to negotiate those deals. So if I file a lawsuit against them, I think that access is going to be gone.\u201d When asked why he didn\u2019t comment to the AP reporter or ask the Knutsons if they wanted to take their story public, Foster explained that \u201cthrowing Mr. Wielgus under the bus with the press . . . could have resulted in a very dangerous outcome for Dagny.\u201d Allard hired a malpractice law expert, Alison Buchanan, who concluded Foster violated ethical guidelines by not listing to Knutson all his conflicts of interest in writing. Foster also violated his duty to be a \u201czealous advocate\u201d for Knutson, Buchanan testified. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t really working within her best interest,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any communications between Mr. Foster and USA Swimming where he took a hard stance or threatened litigation. Instead he said, \u2018I would never sue you\u2019 . . . That, to me, is the opposite of zealous advocacy.\u201d The jurors found Foster committed a breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and they awarded Knutson $617,800. In October, however, the judge threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial. The judge ruled that Knutson failed to prove a different lawyer could have gotten her a better deal. Allard is appealing. In a recent phone interview, Foster said Knutson\u2019s anger at him is misguided. \u201cI worked for her, for free, out of the goodness of my heart,\u201d Foster said. \u201cShe\u2019d been treated badly by USA Swimming. And I got her a good deal.\u201d In Olympic sports, Foster pointed out, national governing bodies rarely pay athletes much, and multi-year contracts are almost nonexistent. \u201cUSA Swimming would not back down. They said, \u2018We\u2019re putting up a lot of money for an athlete that hasn\u2019t even medaled yet,\u2019 \u201d Foster said. \u201cThose performance markers for her were not unreasonable . . . She was one of the best swimmers in the world.\u201d Knutson no longer swims competitively: \u2018It feels like another human swam.\u2019 (Caitlin O'Hara/for The Washington Post) A new life In April, Knutson graduated from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, with a degree in sports management. She works at the school as a counselor, helping students apply for financial aid and pick majors. On weekends, she volunteers as a coach for the new swim team at a small Christian college nearby. It\u2019s a small team of mostly novice swimmers, and Knutson thinks they don\u2019t know her background. She doesn\u2019t swim anymore; she prefers running. \u201cIt feels like another human swam. It doesn\u2019t feel like it was me. I used to have this self-confidence and this pride . . . I felt unstoppable,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way anymore.\u201d During the Olympics this summer, Knutson was busy at work, so she missed most of it. She kept track online, to see how her former teammates fared. One night, she watched highlights on her phone as she walked to her car after a long day at the office. In Rio that day, 23-year-old Maya DiRado won an upset gold medal in the 200 backstroke. DiRado also silvered in two of Knutson\u2019s old events, the 200 and 400 individual medley. Knutson was thrilled for DiRado, her former teammate from the junior national team. As Knutson drove home that night, she wept. sports Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 ",

Memoli After President Obama on Thursday announced retaliatory measures against the Russian government for what the U.S. has concluded were efforts to interfere in the election, President-elect Donald Trump's response was terse and dismissive, saying it was time to \"move on to bigger and better things.\" But after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that he would not respond in kind to the U.S. actions \u2014\u00a0preferring to wait until the new administration takes office \u2014\u00a0Trump weighed in with high praise. Trump's tweet did not appear to be off the cuff.\u00a0As if to underscore his sentiment, Trump affixed the tweet to the top of his Twitter feed. And he posted an Instagram photo shortly after, quoting himself. Trump's effusive words were particularly striking given the bipartisan view of Putin as more adversary than ally. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said they supported the Obama administration's move to expel Russian diplomats and block access to two properties owned by its government. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) is expected to call a hearing on Russia's cyber activities when the new Congress convenes next week. A Trump transition spokesman was asked earlier Friday whether Trump had spoken or planned to speak with Putin before his inauguration. \"The priority right now is for the president[-elect] to get an update next week from the intelligence community,\" Sean Spicer said. Trump's praise\u00a0did get tacit approval from some quarters. The Russian embassy in Washington retweeted it. Latest updates ",

Coming 10 days before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as Democrats cede the White House to Republicans , Obama's hometown address is expected to serve as his closing words to the nation as president. The appearance will be open to the public and followed by a \"family reunion\" for alumni of Obama's former campaigns, according to a save-the-date notice sent to Obama alumni and obtained by the Associated Press. The White House has not confirmed Obama's speech or trip to Chicago. Ahead of the speech, Obama and Democratic lawmakers next week will meet to try to forge a common strategy to prevent Republicans from destroying the president's signature health-care law. On Wednesday morning, Obama travels to the Capitol for the meeting with House and Senate Democrats, according to an invitation sent to lawmakers. The White House is casting it as an effort to unite Democrats behind a plan to protect the law, known as the Affordable Care Act , before Republicans have a chance to settle on their own plan for repealing it. Democrats are on edge over the future of the ACA, given the GOP's disdain for \"Obamacare\" and Trump's vows to gut it. Though Republicans are united behind the notion of repealing the law, they're split over how best to replace it. Some want to strip out unpopular provisions while leaving others intact, while other Republicans prefer a start-from-scratch approach. It's that lack of unanimity among Republicans that Obama and Democrats hope can be exploited, if they can lay the groundwork before Trump takes office. To that end, Obama also planned to answer questions about the future of the health-care law next Friday during a livestreamed event at Blair House, just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Initially stunned by the defeat of Hillary Clinton, Democrats are now trying to organize a counterattack to preserve the ACA, among the most significant expansions of the social safety net since Medicare and Medicaid were created 50 years ago. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has urged her lawmakers to make health care their focus at the start of the year. Since the ACA passed, about 20 million people have gained coverage and the uninsured rate has dropped to a historic low of around 9 percent. Some of the coverage gains are due to employers offering jobs with health care in a stronger economy, but most experts mainly credit Obama's law. President Barack Obama visits Chicago on Oct. 27, 2015. He spoke about\u00a0guns and violence and took in a Bulls game. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) ",

Roads are glistening in morning rain and umbrellas are out in downtown Los Angeles as the first of two storms hits the Southland. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Laura J. Nelson, Ben Poston Southern California\u2019s wet winter will continue Friday and into Saturday, as storms move through the region carrying rain, thunder and up to two inches of snow in the mountains, according to weather officials.\u00a0 The rain that fell across Los Angeles County on Friday will taper off by the afternoon, except for scattered showers in some areas,\u00a0said National Weather Service\u00a0forecaster Ryan Kittell. The storm should bring up to 0.7 inch of rain across the region.\u00a0 A second storm bearing down from the north on Saturday afternoon will bring rain and a slight chance of thunderstorms to L.A., and some snowfall in mountainous regions to the north and east.\u00a0 The Grapevine on Interstate 5 and the Cajon Pass on Interstate 15 could both see up to two inches of snow and ice, which could cause \u201csignificant travel delays\u201d for travelers heading to Las Vegas and into Los Angeles for Near Year\u2019s Eve, a weather service alert said. The agency urged drivers to leave early and travel through the passes before the storm begins in earnest.\u00a0 \u201cHopefully people will be out before the night begins,\u201d Kittell said. \u201cIf they\u2019re still on the road at night on New Year\u2019s Eve, there may be some bad driving conditions.\u201d Parts of the Antelope Valley could see a dusting of snow, Kittell said, which happens once every year or two. \u00a0 Friday morning\u2019s soggy commute saw the usual road congestion and collisions.\u00a0 A fatal crash occurred at 5:48 a.m. Friday in Diamond Bar at the 60 Freeway ramp to the southbound 57 Freeway. One person was killed in the accident, which blocked the carpool lane for more than two hours,\u00a0according to the California Highway Patrol . Just after 7 a.m.,\u00a0 a big rig struck a concrete pillar on the ramp from the 60 Freeway to the northbound 605 Freeway in Avocado Heights, forcing officials to close the ramp,\u00a0said CHP public information officer Juan Galvan. And at 9 a.m., three southbound lanes of the 5 Freeway in Santa Clarita were blocked due to a collision south of Gavin Canyon involving a jackknifed big rig, officials said.\u00a0 So far this month, the Los Angeles area has received nearly four inches of rain, nearly double the historical average for December.\u00a0 Some areas of L.A. saw more than two inches of rain last week, which contributed to nightmarish conditions at Los Angeles International Airport . Bad weather, crowded airspace, security scares and construction caused some flights to be delayed or\u00a0rerouted. The wetter winter\u00a0has been a welcome change for a region hit by five years of severe drought.\u00a0 Gentle, moderate levels of rain over several months pulled 15% of the state \u2014\u00a0all in the north \u2014\u00a0out of the drought , according to the weather service and the U.S. Drought Report. The rain has helped recharge reservoirs that feed the two massive systems that move water from the northern Sierra to the state\u2019s cities and farmlands.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

But the school\u2019s own investigation, which resulted in an 80-page report, unearthed the troubling details of the female victim\u2019s sexual assault by 10 to 20 men on the team after their season-opening victory. The school investigation resulted in the\u00a0 suspensions of ten University of Minnesota football players , and a brief boycott of all team activities by their teammates.\u00a0 When the university\u2019s report was leaked to the press, Freeman\u2019s office decided to review it because some accounts that players gave to Minneapolis police differed from their accounts to school investigators. After reviewing that report, Freeman stood by his November decision, saying the school\u2019s investigation didn\u2019t add sufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges. In his statement, Freeman said the report \u201cshined a light on what can only be described as deplorable behavior,\u201d but added that his office\u2019s investigation did not yield much more than Minneapolis police\u2019s initial investigation. Drew Wolitarsky, a University of Minnesota wide receiver, speaks to reporters on Dec. 15, 2016. Close CBS Minnesota \u201cReviewing the full report and comparing it to the criminal investigation file shows no new significant evidence that would enable prosecutors to bring charges against any individuals that could be sustained under our much higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cAs a result, our decision not to bring charges remains unchanged.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 Lee Hutton, the players\u2019 attorney, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone message or email from the Associated Press seeking comment. The university said in a statement it respects Freeman\u2019s decision, but noted their own suspensions of the players stem from different standards and policies than the criminal process Freeman worked through.\u00a0 The school suspended the 10 players after completing its own investigation, the results of which it kept private, citing federal privacy laws. But a local TV station published a redacted copy of the 82-page report which quoted the woman as saying she believed 10 to 20 men had sex with her, though she was not certain. She told university investigators she was too traumatized to clearly remember events. The report concluded that the victim\u2019s account of that night was more credible than the players it interviewed, and said some players tried to impede the university\u2019s investigation into the incident. Soon after the report was leaked, remaining members of the football roster - who had vowed to boycott Tuesday\u2019s Holiday Bowl unless their teammates were reinstated - relented , going on to beat Washington State 17-12. The case dates to the start of the season. Five players - Carlton Djam, Dior Johnson, KiAnte Hardin, Ray Buford Jr. and Tamarion Johnson - told police they had consensual sex with the woman at an off-campus dorm. Four of them were suspended for three games early in the season, but later reinstated in October. After the school\u2019s investigation, which has a lower standard of proof than criminal charges, the school announced on Dec. 13 that those five players were suspended and Antoine Winfield Jr., Seth Green, Mark Williams, Kobe McCrary and Antonio Shenault were out for the bowl game as well. All 10 players are awaiting a university hearing to appeal their suspensions. Several players face permanent expulsion from the university, while others could be suspended for a year. Meanwhile, a decision regarding Claeys\u2019 future is up in the air. Claeys has two years remaining on his contract, shorter than the norm for coaches to sell program stability to potential recruits. Claeys became the target of an online petition to have him fired. The petition had more than 3,100 signatures as of Friday afternoon. \u00a0 Amid calls for his firing, athletic director Mark Coyle has said he plans to meet with the football coach in the near future. The charging decision on Friday is just the latest twist for an athletics program that\u2019s no stranger to turmoil. A cheating scandal involving the Gophers\u2019 basketball team enveloped the university in 1999, leading to hefty punishment from the NCAA after it concluded an office manager had completed hundreds of assignments for players. More recently, a former athletic director resigned in disgrace last year after admitting to groping several female employees and sending lewd texts during a university function. Just this year, heralded Gopher wrestling coach J. Robinson was fired amid an investigation into the team\u2019s alleged sale and use of illicit drugs, which university officials said Robinson failed to disclose.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Andrew Roth December 30 at 11:09 AM Follow arothwp MOSCOW \u2014 On a day when everyone expected him to go low, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the high road, bowing out of a growing diplomatic showdown with the administration of President Obama in a gambit to woo his successor, Donald Trump. In a rare, and calculated, break from the diplomatic tradition of reciprocal punishment, Putin opted to do nothing after the United States said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats and close a pair of Russian-owned properties in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin said he would wait to see how U.S.-Russian relations develop under the new Trump administration before planning \u201cany further steps\u201d on the issue.\u00a0 \u00a0Until Putin\u2019s surprise decision Friday, all signs pointed toward the familiar, hard-nosed Kremlin response of years past. In 2012, when Russia was slapped with U.S. sanctions over the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, Putin shot back by signing a ban on all foreign adoptions of Russian children, just days after Christmas, sparking outrage. But this time, with the Kremlin bidding farewell to Obama and betting that a friendly Trump administration will bring fresh opportunities to escape sanctions and make a grab for greater power status, Putin waxed magnanimous.\u00a0 (The Washington Post) \u201cWe will not create any problems for U.S. diplomats,\u201d Putin said in a statement late Friday afternoon. \u201cWe will not expel anyone. We will not prevent their families and children from using their traditional leisure sites during the New Year\u2019s holidays.\u201d Instead of sending the U.S. diplomats home, Putin invited their kids over for \u201cthe New Year and Christmas children\u2019s parties in the Kremlin.\u201d Then he wished the Obamas a happy new year and bid season\u2019s greetings to \u201cDonald Trump and the American people.\u201d One person in particular appreciated that approach.\u00a0 \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) \u2014 I always knew he was very smart!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet Friday afternoon, his latest public expression of admiration for the Russian leader. Russia has denied and ridiculed accusations by Obama and the U.S. intelligence community that it sponsored hackers to steal and then leak sensitive information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to sway the election in favor of Trump. Putin on Friday accused the United States of engaging in\u00a0\u201cirresponsible \u2018kitchen\u2019 diplomacy\u201d and said Russia would retain its\u00a0\u201cright to retaliate.\u201d Trump\u2019s unorthodox views on Putin have sent shock waves through his own party, and the sanctions against Russia imposed by Obama on Thursday will present him with a new challenge. Should the Republican choose to remove some or all of the sanctions after his inauguration next month, he would be acting in opposition to public statements made by congressional GOP leaders \u2014 and forcing them to decide whether to accept or resist his efforts to remake U.S.-Russian relations. Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP) Still, Putin\u2019s decision not to escalate the situation may make it easier, if just marginally, for him to do that. Putin\u2019s theatrical turnabout came just hours before Russians set off for their snowbound dachas for a week of holiday festivities. The Russian Foreign Ministry pledged to send a plane to collect the departing Russian diplomats and complained that Washington had been inconsiderate by deporting embassy employees just before the winter break. In declining a \u201csymmetrical response,\u201d Putin disregarded a public proposal from his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who suggested the expulsion of 35 U.S. diplomats and the closure of two U.S.-owned properties in Moscow \u2014 a warehouse and a dacha used for receptions. That retreat was far humbler than the compound lost to the Russians, a luxurious 45-acre estate at Pioneer Point in Maryland, a site purchased by the Soviet government in 1972 that features tennis courts and bungalows and, during the Soviet period, played host to dinner parties of vodka and caviar. \u201cPutin\u2019s asymmetric response to Obama\u2019s new sanctions is an investment in the incoming Trump presidency,\u201d Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, wrote online shortly after Putin\u2019s announcement.\u00a0 Putin\u2019s decision followed a drumbeat of threats from Russian officials about coming countersanctions that focused their ire on the outgoing Obama administration. Until the last moment, it seemed likely that Moscow would follow Friday with its own mass expulsion of U.S. diplomats, similar to when Russia and the United States deported more than 100 diplomats combined in a 2001 spat sparked by the spying case of former FBI agent Robert Hanssen.\u00a0 Earlier Friday, Putin\u2019s spokesman had said that the Russian countersanctions would bring \u201cserious discomfort\u201d for an American diplomatic corps that has already complained about harassment, including slashed tires and aggressive surveillance. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called the Obama administration a \u201cgroup of \u00adforeign-policy losers, embittered and shortsighted.\u201d And Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was openly eulogizing the Obama administration on Twitter. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Obama administration, which started out by restoring our ties, is ending its term in an anti-Russia agony. RIP,\u201d he tweeted in English. The Kremlin will be looking to negotiate with the Trump White House over the role of NATO; the status of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine; the war in Syria; and a host of other thorny issues that have led U.S.-Russian relations to their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. Perhaps most of all, Putin wants Russia to be treated as a great power that will have a seat at the table when major world decisions are being hammered out.\u00a0 Seeing those opportunities, some Russian politicians called for a measured response to the U.S. sanctions before Putin\u2019s announcement Friday, arguing that an aggressive move could force a response from Trump and set the relationship off on the wrong foot. \u201cCountermeasures, which are typically mandatory, should be weighted in this case, considering the known circumstances of the transitional period and the possible response of the U.S. president-elect,\u201d said Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the foreign-affairs committee in Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament.\u00a0 Russian officials are largely positive about the incoming administration, but there are concerns among some policymakers about the new U.S. leader\u2019s unpredictable nature and lack of experience in politics. Kosachyov had previously said that a Trump presidency could open the door to a significant improvement in relations \u2014 or a severe decline. The nomination of Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, was seen as confirmation here that Trump will move forward with his stated plans to revitalize the U.S.-Russia relationship.\u00a0But his nomination hearings will probably serve as a stage to bring Russia to the fore of the national debate, with Senate Democrats likely to pepper him with questions about his time working closely with Putin and use that as a pivot to focus on Trump\u2019s relationship with the Russian leader as well.

Putin has condemned President Obama's move, which also included imposing sanctions on two suspected hackers and three companies that allegedly support the Russian GRU intelligence service's cyber operations. U.S. intelligence services have accused the Russians of launching cyber-attacks on the Democratic Party in the run up to the Nov. 8 election.

And when asked about the sanctions , he replied: \"I think we ought to get on with our lives.\" \"I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole, you know, age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on,\" Trump said Thursday outside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \"We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure you have the security that you need.\" Trump added that he had not yet spoken with the senators who have called for sanctions.

U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark/Handout via Reuters.  ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. EDITORIAL USE ONLY. TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY</p> Close REUTERS Democrats are continuing their criticism of new legislation proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, with several top members saying Friday that the proposed law -- which would fine lawmakers for taking photos or videos from the House floor -- is a \u201cmodern day and unconstitutional gag rule.\u201d In a joint statement, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (D-Michigan), Rules Committee ranking member Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution ranking member Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee), and Subcommittee on Intellectual Property ranking member Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said House Republican leadership is \u201cauthorizing \u2018speech police\u2019\u201d to keep Democrats from voicing their opposition. \u201cThis unprecedented rule change, which appears to violate several fundamental constitutional protections, clearly is intended to undermine the rights of Members in the Minority to freely express their views on the House floor, which is a critical means by which Members communicate to the American public,\u201d the statement said. Ryan is proposing the legislation in response to a Democratic \u201csit-in\u201d on the House floor last summer. Democratic House members staged an overnight, 25-hour protest on the House floor over Ryan\u2019s refusal to allow a vote on gun control legislation, streaming video of the protest live from their cell phones after GOP House leadership turned off the House cameras. House rules already prohibit taking photos or videos on the House floor, but Ryan\u2019s proposal would fine members up to $2,500 for doing it. The criticism from four Democratic House members comes two days after House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote to Democratic colleagues that the move is a \u201cpower grab\u201d by the GOP. \u201cWhile the American people worry for the financial security of their families, Republicans are opening the new Congress by turning their backs on the outside calls for help with an inside power grab in the House Rules,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues on Wednesday, according to Politico. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Kyriakos Amiridis went missing on Monday in the city of Nova Iguacu, 25 miles (41 kilometers) north of Rio de Janeiro. Greece's Embassy in Brasilia said the ambassador had been on vacation near Rio. The couple lived most of the time in Brasilia, the country's capital. Rio de Janeiro police investigator Giniton Lages told The Associated Press that blood spots believed to be those of the ambassador were found on a sofa inside the home of his Brazilian wife, Francoise Amiridis. Lages named the wife, along with another woman and two men, as suspects in the case. A news conference was scheduled for later in the day. The wife was being interrogated at a police station on Friday in connection with her husband's disappearance. Authorities believe she had been having an extramarital affair with a police officer. Another police investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn't want to be quoted giving details about the case before the news conference is held, said the ambassador and his wife fought three days before Christmas . A third investigator, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said that a police officer had acknowledged participating in the ambassador's killing. Lages said authorities believe the ambassador's body was taken from the house to a car that he had rented on Dec. 21. A burned vehicle matching the description of the rented car was found with a body inside it in Nova Iguacu, but forensics experts have not yet identified the dead person. The Greek Embassy website in Brazil says Amiridis started his career as diplomat in 1985 in Athens and became Greece's top diplomat in Brazil in 2016. He earlier was Greece's ambassador to Libya and worked as consul in Rio from 2001-2004. 0 Shares ",

But daylight and calmer waters made for better search conditions Friday, Captain Michael Mullen, chief of response for Coast Guard District 9, told reporters. Ohio beverage company Superior Beverage Group identified those aboard as its president and CEO John T. Fleming, his wife Sue, sons Jack and Andrew and two close friends. \"As we all await the results of the search and rescue efforts, our hearts are with John, his wife, their sons, and close friends on board, as well as with their loved ones and everyone in the Superior Beverage family,\" company Executive Vice President Joseph R. McHenry said in a statement. \"This is a difficult day for us, and we appreciate the concern and thoughtfulness extended by so many,\" McHenry said. The city council of Dublin, northwest of Columbus, said it was saddened by the news. A map showing the location Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland, Ohio. Google Maps No debris has been found, and no emergency beacon has been detected so far. The Coast Guard's search Friday was focused on an area about two miles offshore in Lake Erie, where water temperatures were frigid. \"With water temperatures, it comes down to a will to survive\" if the passengers are in the lake, Mullen said, adding that their aircraft is not designed to float. According to the Coast Guard, the aircraft was capable of carrying up to 11 people. By Friday evening boat operations were paused for the night but air operations continued, the Coast Guard said.

By Karoun Demirjian December 30 at 3:34 PM Follow @karoun President-Elect Donald Trump talks to members of the media after a meeting with military leadership at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. on Dec. 21. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump on Friday expressed\u00a0his appreciation to Vladimir Putin over the Russian president\u2019s announcement that he would not expel American diplomats in response to new U.S. hacking sanctions as a gesture to the incoming administration. \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin),\u201d Trump tweeted Friday afternoon. \u201cI always knew he was very smart!\u201d Great move on delay (by V. Putin) \u2013 I always knew he was very smart! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 The tweet is Trump\u2019s latest nod to Putin, whom he has praised as\u00a0a strong leader \u2014 inspiring considerable backlash from American politicians from both parties who call the Russian president\u00a0an authoritarian leader who poses a danger to U.S. interests. The Obama administration on Thursday announced it will expel 35 Russian \u201cintelligence operatives\u201d and shutter facilities in Maryland and New York believed to be used for the Kremlin\u2019s intelligence-gathering purposes, as a way to punish Moscow. U.S. intelligence agencies have alleged that Russian state-backed hackers leaked information about former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to sway the election in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia denies the charge. Putin\u2019s decision not to reciprocate is a sharp departure from the tit-for-tat policies Moscow pursued against the United States in response to Ukraine-related sanctions in 2014. [ Putin says he won\u2019t deport U.S. diplomats as he looks to cultivate relations with Trump ] Putin announced Friday he \u201cwon\u2019t create problems for American diplomats\u201d in retaliation while he waits for the new administration to take office, adding\u00a0he would \u201cplan further steps for restoring the Russian-American relationship based in the policies enacted by the administration of President Donald Trump.\u201d Trump remained relatively quiet about the substance of the sanctions announced Thursday, even as Republican lawmakers greeted them as a necessary, overdue action that should be expanded in the future. The president-elect said only that it was \u201ctime for our country to move on to bigger and better things\u201d and promised he would meet with intelligence leaders next week to get more details. powerpost ",

One conclusion observers are drawing is that authorities decided to placate law enforcement. \"I suppose they had complex considerations,\" Tong Zhiwei, a law scholar at the East China University of Politics and Law in Shanghai, said of the authorities, \"which may have included worry that they would hurt the policemen's enthusiasm in performing their duties.\" In addition to fighting crime, Chinese police are also responsible for suppressing political dissent, a task the government euphemistically calls, \"maintaining stability.\" \"As a legal scholar, my view is that the four or five police in this case, or at least some of them should be convicted.\" Tong says. \"I won't conceal my opinion.\" Another common perception here is that this incident generated seldom-seen animosity toward authorities among China's college-educated citizens. Tong Zhiwei says this is simply because, in Lei Yang, they see themselves. A Harrowing, Mountain-Scaling Commute For Chinese Schoolkids Contrasting cases Other commentators have contrasted the fate of Lei Yang with that of Jia Jinglong. Dissatisfied with government compensation for the demolition of his home, the 30-year-old farmer killed a village official with a nail gun. Jia was executed last month, despite a public outcry. In comparing the two cases, some believe that Chinese authorities can kill civilians virtually with impunity, but civilians who kill authorities \u2013 an act that suggestions violent revolution - will be put to death as a warning to others. However, China's leaders have insisted that they want justice to be apparent in every court case, and they want public trust in China's judiciary restored. Some observers have been heartened by the reversal of several miscarriages of justice. In the latest, China's Supreme Court exonerated a man who had been executed 21 years ago for a rape and murder to which another man later confessed. Police powers have steadily been growing. Spending on domestic security reportedly outstripped China's military budget in 2013. China's constitution specifies that police, prosecutors and courts are supposed to check and balance one another. But Chinese legal scholars describe the real power structure of China's law enforcement system with a restaurant metaphor: \"The police cook it; the prosecutors serve it, and the courts eat it.\" ",

President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Photo: AP) 9177 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 280 COMMENTEMAILMORE Donald Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday for holding off on retaliation for U.S. sanctions regarding Russian hacking during the presidential election. \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\" the president-elect tweeted mid-day. Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 The Russian embassy in the United States retweeted Trump's post. The praise\u00a0came\u00a0a day after President Obama, responding to Russian efforts to intervene in the 2016 election via cyber-espionage, announced economic sanctions on Russian intelligence officials and institutions, the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats suspected of being spies, and the shuttering of two Russian facilities in the United States. While Russian officials recommended expelling U.S. officials from their country, Putin announced Friday he would not do so,\u00a0partly in deference to the incoming Trump administration. Trump has questioned whether Russia was involved in hacking the emails of Democratic Party officials, and he brushed off the sanctions imposed by Obama. \u201cIt's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\" Trump said in a statement Thursday night. He added, \"nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\" That briefing will be scheduled for next week, Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said. Read more: Russia's Putin says American diplomats won't be expelled U.S. intelligence officials have accused the Russians of hacking Democratic emails in an effort to help Trump win the election. While Putin and Russia deny the allegations, the Obama administration is a preparing a report on the cyber attacks, and Congress is likely to conduct an investigation of its own. During the campaign, Democrats said Trump was too friendly with Putin; Trump said he only wants to improve U.S.-Russian relations. Trump tweeted about the Russian leader on a day in which he continued to hold meetings at his Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida about plans for his inauguration and administration. The president-elect has four Cabinet-level slots to fill: director of National Intelligence, secretary of Agriculture, U.S. trade representative\u00a0and secretary of Veterans Affairs. Trump is also planning a New Year's Eve reception at Mar-a-Lago, with guests including Sylvester Stallone and Quincy Jones. The president-elect is scheduled to return to New York City on New Year's Day. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Photo: Google Street View) DETROIT \u2014 A man interested in purchasing a property in the city about three blocks south of its border with Warren, Mich., discovered a car with a decomposed and mummified body inside the garage. Officers, who were called around 1 p.m. ET Thursday to the 19900 block of Spencer Avenue, said the body was inside a 1990 or 1991 Plymouth Acclaim, said Officer Dan Donakowski, a \u00a0Detroit police spokesman. Tenants who lived at a home on the property told police that the owner said they couldn\u2019t use the garage, so they never went inside, Donakowski said. One three-bedroom, one-bath house\u00a0on the block lined with Cape Code, bungalow and Tudor-inspired brick homes that were built in the early 1950s is listed for sale at $27,000. Many have detached garages. No one knew mummified woman was dead 5 years It\u2019s unclear how and when the person in the car died, but Donakowski said the body had been there \u201cfor quite some time.\u201d At this point, medical examiners don't know whether the body is male or female, said Lloyd Jackson,\u00a0Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s badly decomposed,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAnd it\u2019s mummified.\u201d Police: Woman left mom's body in bed since 2010 The body has been inspected, but an autopsy won\u2019t to be performed until next week when an anthropologist comes in, Jackson said. Earlier this year, a partially mummified body of a Donald Smith, 78, was discovered in July in his Hazel Park, Mich., home. And in 2014, a repairman found the mummified body of Pia Farrenkopf, 44, in her Pontiac, Mich., home when he was hired to do work after a bank foreclosed on it.

    "text": "Dec 30 2016, 6:23 pm ET Soprano Won't Sing For Trump, Quits Mormon Tabernacle Choir by Rima Abdelkader and Corky Siemaszko Share advertisement The Trump Inauguration hit a sour note Friday when a soprano for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir quit rather than perform for the President-elect. Jan Chamberlin wrote in a resignation letter to choir president Ron Jarrett \u2014 and her fellow singers \u2014 that she \"could never look myself in the mirror again with self-respect\" if she participated in the Jan. 20 ceremony. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir rehearses in full regalia before its Christmas show  Dec. 8, 2005, in Salt Lake City. Douglas C. Pizac / AP file And, in an interview with MSNBC, Chamberlin said she's not the only member of the choir who feels this way. \"There are a number of people who feel that going out to sing for this particular candidate expresses a conflicted message that might undermine the beautiful message that the choir for so many decades has worked so hard to cultivate with so many people,\" she said. \"It's not just America's choir, it's also the world's choir.\" Chamberlin, who has sung with the choir for five years, said the reaction from her fellow singers \"has been very loving.\" \"For me, this is a moral issue where I'm concerned about our freedoms being in danger as time goes by,\" she said. A veteran performer who runs a vocal studio out of her home in American Fork, Utah, Chamberlin spoke out after she posted a resignation letter on Facebook in which she wrote of the \"turmoil and agony\" that accompanied her decision. \"I have reflected carefully on both sides of the issue, prayed a lot, talked with family and friends, and searched my soul,\" she wrote. \"I've tried to tell myself that by not going to the inauguration, that I would be able to stay in Choir for all the other good reasons.\" \"But it's no use,\" wrote Chamberlin. \"I simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events.\" Citing Scripture and declaring that \"tyranny is now on our doorstep,\" Chamberlin likened Trump to Adolf Hitler and accused him of \"stirring up people with a combination of fanaticism, false promises, and fear.\" \"I only know I could never 'throw roses to Hitler',\" she wrote. \"And I certainly could never sing for him.\" In a statement, the chief spokesman of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said it is not mandatory that any of the singers perform at the inauguration. \"Participation in the choir, including the performance at the Inauguration, is voluntary,\" Eric Hawkins said. \"Only a limited number of choir members are participating (the number is limited by the inaugural committee), and none are required to participate.\" Chamberlin's defiance came on the heels of renegade Rockette Phoebe Pearl who also caused a stir by publicly refusing to perform for Trump. There was no immediate comment from the Trump team on the letter. Related: Celebrities Opting Out of Inauguration Criticized While Utah is a conservative state and Mormons who make up the majority regularly back Republicans for president, the decision by the choir to perform at Trump's inauguration was not widely applauded. Hawkins admitted as much when the choir announced before Christmas that it would be part of the inaugural extravaganza. Best known for its stirring renditions of religious and patriotic songs, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir previously sang at the swearing-in ceremonies for Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George H. W. Bush. It also performed at the inaugural parades for Ronald Reagan, and both Bushes. Rima Abdelkader ",

Trump, asked about Russian hacking of Democratic Party computers, said Wednesday that \"the whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on,\" but he conceded that there might be a need for more cybersecurity. By REUTERS on Publish Date December 29, 2016. Photo by Kevin Hagen for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump edged away on Thursday from his dismissive stance on American assessments of Russian hacking, saying he would meet with intelligence officials next week \u201cto be updated on the facts\u201d after the Obama administration announced sanctions against Moscow . In a brief written statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s first response to President Obama\u2019s sweeping action against Russia , the president-elect reiterated his call for \u201cour country to move on to bigger and better things.\u201d But he said that, \u201cin the interest of our country and its great people,\u201d he would get the briefing \u201cnevertheless.\u201d The statement to some extent echoed his remarks late Wednesday, when he was asked at his Mar-a-Lago estate about Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to take action against Russia. In otherwise opaque comments, Mr. Trump appeared to concede the need to make computers more secure. \u201cI think we ought to get on with our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I\u2019m not sure we have the kind, the security we need.\u201d Mr. Trump took questions Wednesday from a handful of reporters as Don King, the sports promoter and a longtime friend, stood next to him. He has not held a formal news conference since July, though he promised on Wednesday to hold one in early January. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The president-elect has bucked the consensus of his own party in Congress in repeatedly expressing skepticism that Russia was behind hacking during the election. His isolation was underscored by other Republicans\u2019 responses to the Obama administration\u2019s actions. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Thursday that the sanctions were \u201coverdue,\u201d but still blamed Mr. Obama for \u201ceight years of failed policy with Russia.\u201d The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. \u201cRussia does not share America\u2019s interests,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world.\u201d Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went further, saying they would push Congress for even stronger sanctions than Mr. Obama was seeking. That is a direct challenge to Mr. Trump and his advisers, who mocked intelligence agencies this month for their conclusion that Russia was responsible for the hacking. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Dec. 11. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He linked the intelligence assessments on Russia to Democrats\u2019 embarrassment over their loss to him. Mr. Trump has also voiced his doubts several times on Twitter. In one post, he asked, \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\u201d In another, he asserted that \u201cunless you catch \u2018hackers\u2019 in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.\u201d In the posts, Mr. Trump wrongly asserted that the United States government had waited until after the election to accuse Russia. In fact, the administration announced in October that it believed Russia had been involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of the organization\u2019s emails. Mr. Trump was asked on Wednesday about statements by Mr. Graham that the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin , should be personally penalized for the hacking. The president-elect said he was unaware of the comments by Mr. Graham, who was a Republican candidate for president before dropping out a year ago. Advertisement ",

The Washington State Department of Transportation said searchers found the single-engine Cessna and four bodies in a heavily wooded ravine in Jefferson County Friday morning. Crews used radar data and the plane's emergency locator transmitter to find the wreckage. Authorities say there were no survivors. The aircraft left Boeing Field in Seattle for Port Angeles just after 6 p.m. Thursday and lost contact with air traffic control about 45 minutes later. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were to arrive on scene Saturday to examine the aircraft. The names of those killed were not immediately released, pending positive identification and notification of families. 0 Shares ",

Workers building portions of the inaugural platform for the Presidential Inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump at the US Capitol in Washington, DC on Dec. 8, 2016. (SAUL LOEB / AFP/Getty Images) Katherine Skiba Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Tiger Marching Band from Olivet Nazarene University will perform in the inaugural parade Jan. 20 after President-elect Donald Trump takes office, it was announced Friday. The Illinois school was among 40 organizations on an initial list of parade participants named by the Presidential Inaugural Committee. Olivet Nazarene, located in Bourbonnais about 50 miles south of Chicago's Loop, is a Christian, liberal arts university theologically grounded in the Wesleyan tradition. Sports fans know its campus as the home of the Chicago Bears summer training camp \u2014 but the school's mascot is a tiger. The university's president, John Bowling, and his wife have purchased two pricey condos in the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago in recent years, Cook County records show. She has donated to Trump's campaign. (Sarah Larimer) John Bowling, responding to Tribune questions, said Friday by email that he has never met Trump or any of his relatives and that he \"made no contact regarding the invitation\" given to his university's band. \"I learned that we had been invited, after the fact, from the dean of our school of music,\" said Bowling, who declined to talk about the condo purchases. Matthew Stratton, university director of athletic bands, said Friday in a telephone interview about 140 band members will perform in the inauguration day parade. He said his musicians comprise one of the country's largest Christian marching bands. The band uses hashtags #family and #fortheLord in social media to reflect its values, Stratton said. \"God has been taking us places and so we're going and performing,\" he said. A year ago, the Tiger Marching Band was the leadoff musical group in the 2016 New Year's Day Parade in London, Stratton said. After watching President-elect Donald Trump 's successful Republican run for president and creating a firestorm with her bar's signs, Griffith Town Tap owner Michelle Creech said she has no regrets. In October, Creech changed the sign on her Main Street bar to reflect a quote with sexual overtones... After watching President-elect Donald Trump 's successful Republican run for president and creating a firestorm with her bar's signs, Griffith Town Tap owner Michelle Creech said she has no regrets. In October, Creech changed the sign on her Main Street bar to reflect a quote with sexual overtones... (Meredith Colias) Its signature parade tune is \"Chicago Tribune March,\" he said. In 2009, Bowling and his wife, Jill, purchased a Trump Tower condo for more than $1 million, according to the Cook County recorder of deeds, and put the property in a trust in 2015. In March 2015, the Bowlings bought a more expensive Trump Tower condo, a 46th floor unit purchased for $2 million, county records show. Jill Bowling gave $800 to Trump's campaign last September, Federal Election Commission records show. In 2015 and 2016 she gave a total of $2,100 to GOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson, now Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, records show. John Bowling gave $250 to Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, FEC records show. He said Friday in the email exchange that the university \"takes no political stand and does not endorse any candidate or party.\" \"Thus, from our point of view the inauguration is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power. I am pleased our students will have the opportunity to participate in a historic event,\" he said. ",

NASA/YouTube Email A comet streaking across the night sky on\u00a0 New Year\u2019s Eve will help welcome in 2017. The comet \u2014 called Comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdu\u0161\u00e1kov\u00e1 \u2014 only comes around about every five years. It won\u2019t be visible to the naked eye for skywatchers looking up at the stars on Saturday night, but it can be seen with the help of strong binoculars or a telescope if you know where to look. Comet 45P has already been in our cosmic neighborhood this month \u2014 it appeared low on the western horizon on Dec. 15 and again made an appearance on the 21st. On New Year\u2019s Eve, it will pass by the crescent moon as we say goodbye to 2016, according to NASA .\u00a0 The best chance to catch a glimpse is to look through a telescope towards the west just after sunset on Dec. 31.\u00a0 The astronomy site EarthSky.org notes that while the comet is passing relatively close to Earth in cosmic terms, it\u2019s still a very safe distance away \u2014 more than 7 million miles away, or about 30 times the distance from here to the moon.

Ball also noted that \"NSA headquarters at Fort Meade is 35 miles directly west; the large Navy communications station at Annapolis (used to communicate with nuclear submarines) is 20 miles west southwest; and the NSA's Propagation and Research Laboratory on Kent Island is 15 miles to the southwest.\" Officials say the Soviets and their Russian successors were brazen about the facility's mission. Starting in the late 1970s, antennas went up on the main building. Soon, the mansion and surrounding property was festooned with all manner of antenna for capturing communications and other signals. The Reagan administration began a major communications effort to secure the links and also cut down on the Soviets' access to U.S. communications technologies, thwarting plans to install a large satellite dish at Pioneer Point. Soviet diplomats said the dish was for reception of Soviet TV shows. The U.S. believed it was a way for the Soviets to downlink U.S. military communications. The Raskob Estate at Pioneer Point on Maryland's Eastern Shore, shown here in a 1940 aerial photo, was purchased by the the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The Obama administration is shutting access to a New York retreat and the Maryland waterfront compound where Russian diplomats played tennis, sailed and escaped the political bustle, saying those doubled for intelligence activities. The Baltimore Sun via AP After 2000, during the Bush administration, there were concerns within the intelligence community about how close Pioneer Point is to St. Michael's Maryland, where Vice President Richard Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had second homes. The homes were less than 20 miles south of Pioneer Point. May Day Parties and Summer Camp Less is known about the Upper Brookville, New York, property. In the past, U.S. intelligence saw it as an outpost of the Soviets larger recreational complex at Glen Cove, which rivaled Pioneer Point in its access to U.S. communications. The two New York properties are only five miles apart on Long Island's North Shore. The Upper Brookville location, like both Pioneer Point and Glen Cove, was a mansion in a choice location when the Soviets purchased it in 1954 . Adjacent to the Mill River Country Club, with 14 acres of secluded property, it too had great access to communications links and was close to several defense contracts facilities farther east on the island. The Russians added a second large building to the property, and real estate records put the value of the whole compound at close to $10 million. It is hidden by woods, and approached by a winding driveway off of Mill River Road. A former neighbor told NBC News that the Russians used to have big May Day parties at the estate during the Communist era, but that it was otherwise very quiet. More recently, said a current neighbor, the site seems to have been used by the Russians as a summer camp. During the summer, she said, \"school buses would go in and out filled with children.\" Otherwise, there was little activity visible to the neighbors. resident Barack Obama on Thursday ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two suspected hackers and three companies that allegedly provided support to cyber operations by the country's GRU intelligence service as well as the closure of two Russian compounds, including this estate at Pioneer Point in Maryland. NBC News Once she said, her dog got lost, and a voice with a Russian accent called her to come pick it up. The dog was outside the gate when she arrived, so she never saw inside the compound. Shevchenko, in his discussions with the U.S. government and the media, lumped Upper Brookville, Glen Cove and Russia's diplomatic missions in Manhattan together, telling one interviewer that combined, the New York properties gave the Soviets their most sophisticated equipment anywhere for electronic surveillance. The great value of Upper Brookville and Glen Cove was the Long Island Sound, just a few miles to the north of both. The geographic contours of the sound provided \"excellent microwave propagation characteristics,\" wrote Ball, \"commonly known as Microwave Alley.'\" He added that the FBI found that signals from as far as 100 miles away could be intercepted at either location. Moreover, the facilities had clear electronic views of several critical U.S. facilities across the Sound in Connecticut, including the U.S. Navy's submarine base in Groton, Connecticut, and the Naval Underwater Systems Center in nearby New London. The Russian compound in Upper Brookville on New York's Long Island. NBC News Ball added that Upper Brookville \"presumably coordinates SIGINT activities\" with those at Glen Cove. Since the Cold War, of course, things have changed. The U.S. has secured its vital communications \u2014 and communications technology has changed. Microwave is not as significant a carrier as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Fiber optics lines have replaced much of it. Cell towers are now more important than microwave towers. A senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News that the New York and Maryland facilities are under constant U.S. surveillance. They are not believed to have played any role in the election hack, said the official, and in 2016 have no intelligence gathering capabilities that the Russians don't have at other facilities. Jeffrey Richelson, the intelligence historian, agreed that the facilities were legacies of the Cold War, but wasn't so sure they were artifacts. \"Whether they're artifacts,\" he said, \"depends on the current use.\" According to the State Department, both the Centreville and Upper Brookville facilities were to be vacated by noon Friday. The Glen Cove, Long Island property, despite earlier media reports, was not affected by the president's executive order. Robert Windrem ",

U.S. Office of Government Ethics hide caption toggle caption U.S. Office of Government Ethics In November, the typically straitlaced Office of Government Ethics surprised observers with a series of tweets mimicking Donald Trump's bombastic style, exclamation points and all: \"Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, good for America!\" The controversy was two-fold: (1) The OGE doesn't typically air its positions publicly, advising White House transition teams behind the scenes. (2) Trump hadn't promised the total divestitures of business interests implied by the tweets. New records shared with NPR on Friday show that behind the curious tweets was the head of the OGE himself, Director Walter Shaub Jr. Not A Hack: U.S. Office Of Government Ethics Tweets At Trump In two emails, dated Nov. 30, just several minutes apart, Shaub sent to OGE Chief of Staff Shelley Finlayson the nine tweets that took the Internet by storm that day. He then followed up with a link to a legal document referenced in one of the tweets and writes: \"Get all of these tweets posted as soon as humanly possible.\" Article continues after sponsorship The OGE director appears to be behind the agency's bizarre tweetstorm in November. U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR The OGE director appears to be behind the agency's bizarre tweetstorm in November. U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR The emails were part of a 365-page document shared with NPR in response to disclosure requests under the Freedom of Information Act. OGE is generally tasked with overseeing ethics in the executive branch of the government, and so it's one of the agencies looking into Trump's wide-reaching business interests and the conflicts of interest they create for the president-elect as he takes over the reins of the country in January. As NPR's Jim Zarroli has reported : \"With his vast network of licensing deals, golf courses and commercial real estate, Trump and his family stand to profit from his presidency to an unprecedented degree. Virtually any decision Trump makes could affect part of his domestic or international business empire.\" Several OGE officials did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. It's still unclear why \u2014 if Shaub's tweets were deliberate \u2014 they were temporarily deleted on the day they were posted. At the time, an OGE spokesman said the agency was enthused by Trump's indicated interest (on Twitter) in avoiding conflicts of interest. Despite the stylistic peculiarity of OGE's tweets, Shaub's position on Trump's conflicts of interest is not secret. He appears to be on a campaign to get Trump to divest, as shown by his lengthy letter released earlier this month. \"I think that there's a uniform consensus among everybody who does government ethics for a living ... that Donald Trump must divest \u2014 he's got to sell his holdings or use a blind trust or the equivalent, as every president has done for 40 years,\" says Norm Eisen, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. Government Ethics Office Says Trump Should Divest Himself Of His Businesses \"So I took the tweets as an expression of that common-sensical view,\" says Eisen, who has served as special counsel for ethics and government reform in the Obama White House. \"This is an undebatable position in our profession.\" NPR had requested, under FOIA, that the agency share all emails related to the Twitter postings on Nov. 30 and related to Donald Trump. Only one exchange appeared to involve a member of the Trump team. On the day of the tweetstorm, Shaub emailed \"D. McGahn\" \u2014 presumably Donald McGahn , the former chief of the Federal Election Commission whom Trump picked to be White House counsel \u2014 to notify him of the press inquiries and the OGE's response.

There are dozens and dozens of emails, letters and even a postcard (of Alexander Hamilton with a black eye?), expressing concerns about Trump's business holdings and conflicts of interest. Many writers criticized OGE's tweetstorm; others welcomed its candid commentary. Most writers encouraged OGE to hold up the ethics law and standards. NPR's Jim Zarroli contributed to this report. ",

    "text": "As part of the punishment, the State Department said that it would close two waterfront estates \u2014 one in New York, the other in Maryland \u2014 that it said were used for Russian intelligence activities. The actions amounted to the strongest American response yet to a state-sponsored cyberattack. United States intelligence agencies have concluded that the G.R.U., with the approval of the Kremlin, ordered the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, and that the Russian government enabled the publication of the emails it obtained to benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In addition to giving the diplomats and their families 72 hours to leave the country, the measures announced by Mr. Obama imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s two main intelligence services. Washington described the diplomats as intelligence agents working under the cover of diplomacy. Previous sanctions by the United States and its Western allies were levied against broad sectors of the Russian economy and also blacklisted dozens of individuals, some of them close friends of Mr. Putin\u2019s who were considered crucial in the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and in destabilizing Ukraine. The economic sanctions covered three main areas, including blocking Russian access to international credit, cutting off cooperation in advanced oil field technology and stopping arms deals or the sale of dual-use technology. Much of their effect stemmed from the fact that they coincided with a sharp drop in global oil prices, hitting Russia with a double blow. Companies had trouble obtaining credit, driving up the short-term cost of borrowing and compounding a deep recession. Over the long run, the effect is likely to be strongest in the oil sector because it dried up most exploration in difficult areas like the Arctic. Russia responded with sanctions of its own, mostly banning agricultural products and certain foods imported from the West. Mr. Putin and other officials have repeatedly crowed that this resulted in a successful campaign of \u201cimport substitution.\u201d The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Russia also maintained a secret list of Western officials who were no longer allowed into the country. Most, like the former American ambassador Michael McFaul, discovered it only when they applied for visas to Russia. Advertisement Before Mr. Lavrov spoke, Maria Zakharova, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, took to Facebook to denounce the Obama administration, although she spared Mr. Kerry the bulk of her criticism. Ms. Zakharova called the administration \u201ca group of a foreign-policy losers, embittered and narrow-minded.\u201d \u201cToday, America, the American people, were humiliated by their own president,\u201d she wrote. There is a long history of reciprocal expulsions and other measures between the United States and Russia, even after the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. While Mr. Obama framed the new American measures as a response to Russian hacking during the election, the expulsion of Russian diplomats from Washington and San Francisco was described as a response to continued harassment of American diplomats in Russia. Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dimitry S. Peskov denied that any such harassment takes place, but American diplomats tell a different story. Many travel around Moscow in cars with red diplomatic license plates that start with 004 , denoting United States Embassy vehicles. That makes them easy targets for traffic stops. Embassy employees said they were followed as they moved around the city, and that sometimes, when they were not at home, agents would enter and move the furniture around, just to show that they had been there. Some find it unnerving, while others shrug it off as part of the job. One young father said he was just grateful that his children were too small to realize that the family was being followed.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, Mr. Tabler and other Syria specialists said the opportunity came with a number of important caveats. First, the cease-fire needs to hold so that a more enduring political solution to the Syria crisis can be pursued. That will require restraint on the part of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian opposition, the Iranians and the Russians. Second, unless a political settlement is achieved that eventually eases Mr. Assad out of power, Syria may continue to be a magnet for extremists and insurgency, perpetuating the very problem that Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump say they are trying to solve. While the Obama administration was not included in the cease-fire discussions, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, extended a hand to Mr. Trump, who has never objected to Moscow\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East. \u201cI would like to express my hope that after the administration of Donald Trump assumes its duties, it will also join the efforts in order to channel this work into one direction basing on friendly and collective cooperation,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said during a meeting Thursday with Mr. Putin. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More A Trump administration could become involved in future diplomatic talks, from which Secretary of State John Kerry was excluded in recent months. It could \u201ccoordinate\u201d with the Russians militarily, something Mr. Obama\u2019s defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, has resisted. Syria is just the beginning. The fragile Baltic members of NATO \u2014 Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania \u2014 are looking at large military buildups meant to intimidate them. The Ukrainians have seen their lights turn off mysteriously and tracked it to Russian hackers. The British and French report that Russian practice bomber runs and submarine missions just off their shores, something they have not seen since Soviet days. The French and the Germans say they already see signs of hacking and \u201cinfluence operations\u201d in their own elections, scheduled for next year. Each has political movements with echoes of the one that brought Mr. Trump to power and that could eat away at the European Union and the NATO alliance. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The most difficult problem may be what to do about the oldest form of post-World War II competition: nuclear weapons. Emerging from his briefings, Mr. Trump has expressed surprise in recent weeks about the size and abilities of Russia\u2019s arsenal and has largely blamed New START, the arms control treaty that Mr. Obama negotiated. Though modest, the treaty reduced deployed nuclear arsenals to 1,550 weapons on each side, down from tens of thousands at the height of the Cold War. But Mr. Trump declared last week that he was perfectly happy to renew the arms race if need be, a declaration that was jarringly out of tune with his calls for a friendlier relationship with Russia. It is not clear if Mr. Trump has been briefed on the \u201cnuclear modernization\u201d program on which the Obama administration and Congress have spent billions, or seen the Pentagon\u2019s proposals for the $1 trillion revamp of the delivery systems \u2014 submarines, missiles and bombers \u2014 to make them stealthier and more survivable.

Fogle was asked to leave Russia in 2013 after he was caught carrying two wigs, $130,000 in cash and a recruitment letter offering \u201cup to $1 million a year for long-term cooperation.\u201d Credit Russian Federal Security Service Since the end of the Cold War, a variety of leaked diplomatic cables , captured operatives and acts of espionage, like this summer\u2019s hack of the Democratic National Committee, have served as reminders that Russia and the United States continue to routinely spy on each other. On Thursday, the United States said it would expel 35 officials , the largest number of diplomats forced to leave since 2001, in retaliation for what American spy agencies said was Russian interference in the presidential election. A day later, Russian officials threatened to expel American diplomats in a tit-for-tat but President Vladimir V. Putin said American embassy staff would be permitted to stay. June 2013: An Embassy Row The United States expelled two Russian diplomats in retaliation for a bizarre episode outside the United States Embassy in Moscow, in which a Russian police officer attacked an American diplomat. Russian television broadcast a short clip of the scuffle and said the American was an undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative who had refused to show identification before entering the embassy. The State Department said the American was an \u201caccredited diplomat\u201d who had been assaulted as part of systematic harassment of American embassy staff by the Russian authorities. 2013: From Russia With Wigs In May 2013, the Russian government ordered an American Embassy official, identified as Ryan C. Fogle , to leave the country. His expulsion followed an almost comical arrest in which he was caught carrying two wigs \u2014 one blond and one brown \u2014 a Moscow street atlas, $130,000 in cash and a letter offering \u201cup to $1 million a year for long-term cooperation.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story 2010: A Sleeper Cell In 2010, 10 Russians accused of being members of a sleeper cell were deported after pleading guilty to conspiracy in a federal court in Manhattan. As part of a deal, the spies were swapped for four Russian prisoners, three of whom were serving sentences on treason convictions. The case, which was often compared to the plot of a spy novel, included evidence of letters written in invisible ink, buried cash and a red-haired beauty whose romantic exploits and risqu\u00e9 photographs made for tabloid fodder. 2001: An F.B.I. Turncoat In March 2001, the United States expelled 50 Russian diplomats in the wake of the arrest of Mr. Hanssen, who was a counterintelligence expert at the F.B.I. and had spied for Moscow for more than 15 years. American officials said Mr. Hanssen had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars after he volunteered to turn over United States secrets to Russia, and they blamed the Kremlin for not turning him down or turning him in. In response, Russian officials kicked out several American diplomats. 1994: A Mild Blowback In February 1994, shortly after the arrest of Aldrich H. Ames , a career C.I.A. officer who turned out to be a double agent, United States officials expelled a senior Russian diplomat , Aleksandr Lyskenko, whom they called a top officer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. According to the State Department, Mr. Lyskenko was \u201cin a position to be responsible\u201d for Mr. Ames\u2019s activities as a very productive mole. Although Mr. Ames\u2019s treachery was almost certainly the most damaging breach of American intelligence since World War II \u2014 Moscow executed several operatives whom he had betrayed \u2014 Washington\u2019s response was considerably less severe than it would have been in Soviet times, or now. In the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Clinton administration, eager to encourage friendly relations and reform, supported the new government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. Before Mr. Lyskenko was told to leave the country, the Americans even gave the Russians the option of voluntarily sending him back home. 1986: A Mass Expulsion Fifty-five Soviet diplomats were expelled by President Ronald Reagan in November 1986 in an effort to curb espionage activities. Similarly, the authorities in Moscow ordered 260 Soviet employees of the United States Embassy in Moscow to stop working. It was the largest number of diplomatic officials to be expelled by the United States at once. The conflict arose after a Soviet employee of the United Nations, Gennadi F. Zakharov, was arrested on espionage charges. The Russians responded by arresting Nicholas S. Daniloff, the Moscow correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, and accusing him of spying. Mr. Daniloff was released two weeks later. ",

Choir member Jan Chamberlin posted a resignation letter that she says she sent to choir leaders on her Facebook page Thursdaym Dec. 29, 2016. In it, she writes that by performing at the inaugural, the 360-member Choir will appear to be \u201cendorsing tyranny and facism\u201d and says she feels \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the choir\u2019s decision to take part. (AP Photo/George Frey, File) 0 Shares Email A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir said she has resigned from the famed group over its decision to perform at next month's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump . Jan Chamberlin posted her resignation letter to choir leaders on her Facebook page Thursday. In it, she writes that by performing at the Jan. 20 inaugural, the 360-member choir will appear to be \"endorsing tyranny and fascism.\" She says she feels betrayed by the choir's decision to take part. The choir is part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told The Salt Lake Tribune ( http://bit.ly/2ieSfXG ) that participation in the choir and the inaugural performance is voluntary. Hawkins said last week the choir's tradition of presidential performances isn't \"implied support of party affiliations or politics\" but a \"demonstration of our support for freedom, civility and the peaceful transition of power.\" Chamberlin's decision earned praise from one of the most powerful Mormons in the country: Nevada Sen. Harry Reid . The retiring Democrat said Friday in a statement to the Tribune that he admires people like Chamberlin who \"reject tyranny and fascism and do what they can to stand up for what is right.\" Reid applauded her for refusing to \"be part of the wave of hatred unleashed by Donald Trump.\" \"She should not be castigated or repudiated for acting on her sincere beliefs,\" Reid said. Chamberlin, who didn't respond to Tribune requests for interviews, wrote on Facebook that her decision was a moral one. \"I could never 'throw roses to Hitler,'\" she wrote. \"And I certainly could never sing for him.\" 0 Shares ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story American intelligence agencies say that a team of Russian hackers stole data from the Democratic National Committee during the presidential campaign. On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia for interfering in the election, the bedrock of the American political system. The sanctions take aim at Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies and specific individuals, striking at one part of a sprawling cyberespionage operation that also includes the military, military contractors and teams of civilian recruits. For more than three years, rather than rely on military officers working out of isolated bunkers, Russian government recruiters have scouted a wide range of programmers, placing prominent ads on social media sites, offering jobs to college students and professional coders, and even speaking openly about looking in Russia\u2019s criminal underworld for potential talent. Photo Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the first deputy defense minister of Russia, with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, right, in October. Mr. Gerasimov published the Gerasimov Doctrine, which said the lines between war and peace had blurred and that covert tactics like cyberwarfare would become most important. Credit Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Those recruits were intended to cycle through military contracting companies and newly formed units called science squadrons established on military bases around the country. As early as 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a \u201chead hunt in the positive meaning of the word\u201d for coders. The Defense Ministry bought advertising on Vkontakte , Russia\u2019s most popular social network. One video shows a man clanging a military rifle on a table beside a laptop computer, then starting to type. \u201cIf you graduated from college, if you are a technical specialist, if you are ready to use your knowledge, we give you an opportunity,\u201d the ad intoned. Members of the science squadrons, the video said, live in \u201ccomfortable accommodation,\u201d shown as an apartment furnished with a washing machine. University students subject to mandatory conscription in the nation\u2019s armed forces, but who wanted to avoid brutal stints as enlistees, could opt instead to join a science squadron. A government questionnaire asks draftees about their knowledge of programming languages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The ministry posted openings on job forums, according to an investigation by Meduza , a Russian news site based in Riga, Latvia, that first disclosed the recruitment effort. One post from 2014 advertised for a computer scientist with knowledge of \u201cpatches, vulnerabilities and exploits ,\u201d which refers to sabotage used to alter a computer. Given the size of Russia\u2019s cybercrime underworld, it was not long before the military considered recruiting those it described as \u201chackers who have problems with the law.\u201d In an article titled \u201cEnlisted Hacker\u201d in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the government newspaper, a deputy minister of defense, Gen. Oleg Ostapenko, said the science squadrons might include hackers with criminal histories. \u201cFrom the point of view of using scientific potential, this is a matter for discussion,\u201d he was quoted as saying in 2013. Photo Dmitry A. Artimovich, a physicist who designed a computer program that emailed male sexual enhancement spam, in Moscow. He decided not to volunteer for a cyberwarfare unit to avoid a prison term. Credit James Hill for The New York Times Experts say the strategy was more than just talk. \u201cThere have been cases where cybercriminals are arrested but never ended up in prison,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company that first identified the group known as Fancy Bear as the perpetrator of the Democratic National Committee hacking. Mr. Vyarya, the programmer who turned down the government\u2019s job offer, was an attractive recruit from the opposite end of the spectrum: someone with a career protecting people against hackers. Specifically, he had experience shielding websites from a maneuver called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack, in which the sites are overwhelmed and disabled by a torrent of fake traffic. Among his clients were Vedomosti, an independent newspaper; TV Rain, an opposition-leaning television station; and the website of Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader. Mr. Vyarya said that in 2015 he was invited to accompany Vasily Brovko, an executive at the military contracting company Rostec, on a trip to Sofia, Bulgaria. But he said it turned out to be a demonstration of a new software suite capable of staging DDoS attacks. The Bulgarian firm demonstrating the software briefly crashed the website of Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry and Slon.ru , a Russian news website, Mr. Vyarya said. Slon.ru has confirmed its site went down inexplicably for about two minutes that day, Feb. 5, 2015. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the demonstration, Mr. Vyarya said Mr. Brovko asked him how the program might be improved. Then, according to Mr. Vyarya, Mr. Brovko offered him a job running the DDoS software, which he said the Russians planned to buy from the Bulgarians for about $1 million. Mr. Vyarya said his problems began when he turned down the offer: He was surveilled, and an acquaintance in law enforcement advised him to flee the country. He left in August 2015 for Finland to seek asylum, he and his former employer said. The Finnish government, citing safety and privacy concerns, would not comment on the asylum application. \u201cAs soon as we saw what was on the table, Sasha was given direct instructions to return to his hotel and stop all contacts,\u201d said his former boss, Aleksandr V. Lyamin of Qrator, a cyberdefense company in Moscow, using Mr. Vyarya\u2019s Russian nickname. But the overtures from the military contractor persisted, Mr. Lyamin said, and Mr. Vyarya fled. Rostec strongly denied Mr. Vyarya\u2019s account. Mr. Brovko did travel to Bulgaria with Mr. Vyarya, the company said, but to evaluate software for defensive, not offensive, cybersystems. A spokeswoman for Mr. Brovko called the account of crashing sites in a product demonstration the imagination of a \u201cmentally unstable\u201d man. The military\u2019s push into cyberwarfare had intensified in 2012, with the appointment of a new minister of defense, Mr. Shoigu. The next year, a senior defense official, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov published what became known as the Gerasimov Doctrine. It posited that in the world today, the lines between war and peace had blurred and that covert tactics, such as working through proxies or otherwise in the shadows, would rise in importance. He called it \u201cnonlinear war.\u201d His critics called it \u201cguerrilla geopolitics.\u201d But Russia is certainly not alone. \u201cAlmost all developed countries in the world, unfortunately, are creating offensive capabilities, and many have confirmed this,\u201d said Anton M. Shingarev, a vice president at Kaspersky, a Russian antivirus company. Recruitment by Russia\u2019s military should be expected, he said. \u201cYou or I might be angry about it, but, unfortunately, it\u2019s just reality. Many countries are doing it. This is the reality.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story American intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, have for decades recruited on college campuses. In 2015, the N.S.A. offered a free summer camp to 1,400 high school and middle school students, where they were taught the basics of hacking, cracking and cyberdefense. In Russia, recruiters have looked well beyond the nation\u2019s school system. In 2013, as Russia\u2019s recruitment drive was picking up, Dmitry A. Artimovich , a soft-spoken physicist, was awaiting trial in a Moscow jail for designing a computer program that spammed email users with advertisements for male sexual enhancement products. One day a cellmate, who had been convicted of selling narcotics online, sidled up to him with some news. The cellmate said that people incarcerated for cybercrimes could get out before trial, in exchange for working for the government. Another inmate had already taken a deal, he said.

USA TODAY Sports More than 13 months later, it remains to be seen whether Ronda Rousey can shake off her stunning loss to Holly Holm in Australia. (Photo: Andy Brownbill, AP) LAS VEGAS \u2014\u00a0The narrative of the week is that Ronda Rousey is on a silent quest for redemption, fighting for her pride, for redemption and for her future as the face of women\u2019s mixed martial arts. Yet as UFC 207 looms the modern reality for the Ultimate Fighting Championship is that she is battling for a whole lot more than that when she takes on bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes at T-Mobile Arena on Friday. With the company in a new era following its $4.2 billion sale to entertainment group WME-IMG over the summer, it can safely be said that the UFC\u2019s immediate health can be read parallel to that of its biggest stars. Conor McGregor as a sole exception, they come no bigger than Rousey, whose combat skills and uncompromising personality made her one of the most recognizable faces in\u00a0sports before her looks (temporarily) and unbeaten record (permanently) were damaged by a November 2015 knockout by\u00a0Holly Holm. MORE UFC 207 COVERAGE: UFC champion Amanda Nunes credits relationship for making her better fighter Victory over Nunes, the Brazilian striker who defeated Holm\u2019s conqueror Miesha Tate to claim the title in July, and the UFC could bank on a couple more lucrative pay-per-view blockbusters to swell the coffers in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t care about anything except winning this fight,\u201d Rousey said, in a fleeting appearance in a UFC promo video. \u201cI am not spending energy on anything else.\u201d A defeat, and things get considerably trickier for UFC President Dana White, who counts Rousey as a close friend and makes little attempt to disguise the fact that he wants her to do well. The growing popularity of the UFC has allowed the likes of Rousey and McGregor to grow into household superstars, enjoying a level of fame few could have predicted for any combat sports exponent back in the early days of the company, when White and his entrepreneur friends the Fertitta brothers battled to gain mainstream acceptance. However, while the sport has a large and passionate following, the mega events that have the chance to surge well past a million pay-per-views\u00a0require a celebrity element to them. McGregor brings it. Rousey does too, as long as she gets back to winning ways and then carries on fighting. White himself admitted that though he could envision a busy slate of title defenses for the former Olympic judo bronze medalist if she defeats Nunes, he has little idea what would happen if she lost. It would leave a giant gap, especially with significant uncertainty over what happens next with McGregor \u2013 the Irishman flirting with boxing, offering conflicting messages on how long his girlfriend\u2019s pregnancy will keep him out of action and becoming increasingly tough to deal with.

Prince George's County police identified the man as Richard Cedric Taylor in a news release Thursday. The case involves a then-15-year-old girl who girl said she was talking with friends when a man she didn't know offered her a ride home. She said she got into the car and the man took her to a vacant Capitol Heights apartment, where she was assaulted and raped. The case went unsolved for years until a DNA hit in September linked Taylor to the crime . Taylor is now wanted on charges of second-degree rape and first- and second-degree assault.

Pat McCrory (R) rides an elevator at Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 7. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) With just one day to go before he leaves office, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) threw a legal Hail Mary to the U.S. Supreme Court in another apparent effort to undermine his Democratic successor's ability to govern. McCrory filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to pause court-ordered special elections for more than two dozen state legislative districts in 2017 \u2014 special elections in which Democrats could have an opportunity to pick up seats in North Carolina's GOP-dominated legislature. A federal court found in the summer that 28 state House and Senate districts were racially gerrymandered, but the three-judge panel made the unusual decision to let the election go forward in those districts because it decided it was too late to redraw the maps. After the election, the court ordered the legislature to redraw the lines by March and hold special elections later in 2017. Now, McCrory appears to be making one more, last-minute attempt to stop all that from going forward. \"On Election Day, millions of North Carolina voters went to the polls and selected the state legislators who would represent them in the general assembly for two-year terms in accordance with the North Carolina Constitution. Or so they thought,\" reads the petition, which was sent to Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals for the 4th Circuit but would likely refer it to the entire eight-member court. Even though they lost the governor's mansion, Republicans will start 2017 with a veto-proof supermajority in both North Carolina chambers. Democrats, who seized the governor's mansion this fall, were excited at the prospect of having a rare second chance\u00a0to pick up state House and Senate seats in 2017. If the Supreme Court grants McCrory's request for a stay, though, Democrats could have to wait until the 2018 midterm elections to try to win more seats\u00a0under a new electoral map. That would mean Gov.-elect Roy Cooper (D) would spend two years \u2014 instead of potentially far less time \u2014 working with a Republican-dominated legislature\u00a0that's already proved to be combative. After Cooper unseated McCrory this fall, Republicans convened a special session and passed legislation that would limit his power to appoint Cabinet positions and state and local elections boards. McCrory signed the legislation even though he described parts of it \"wrong and short-sighted.\" McCrory's government was already appealing the court's decision to require lawmakers to redraw the map, but the incoming Democratic governor could simply drop the appeal. The timing suggests McCrory's request for a stay is more about politics than anything else, says UNC Law professor Michael Gerhardt. \"I think Governor McCrory is determined to end his governorship as a hard-line partisan,\" he said. McCrory's request comes a day before he leaves office; Cooper will be sworn in shortly after the clock strikes midnight and Saturday turns to Sunday. It's not clear what chance McCrory's request to put a hold on the map-redrawing and special elections will have in the Supreme Court. Also on Friday,\u00a0McCrory appointed several of his top aides to key positions on state boards. North Carolina's Democratic governor-elect Roy Cooper says Republican lawmakers are trying to hinder his work by moving to strip powers from his office. (Reuters) On Friday, Cooper filed his own lawsuit against Republicans: To stop the recently passed law taking away his power to appoint people to the state elections board. On Friday evening, a county judge agreed to put a temporary hold on the law from going into effect on Jan. 1 until the lawsuit could go forward. Cooper's legal team said in court more challenges would be filed in the weeks to come, which means North Carolina will likely be awash in lawsuits in the new year. politics ",

The Warriors said Friday that the shoes Curry wore against the New York Knicks on Dec. 15 were auctioned off to an anonymous bidder for $30,101. The \"Oakland Strong\" shoes feature the words \"OAKLAND\" down the side of the left shoe and \"STRONG\" down the side of the right shoe in Golden State's yellow and blue colors. The pregame \"Ghost Ship\" shoes that feature the words \"GHOST SHIP\" in graffiti-style script down the side of each shoe went to an anonymous bidder for $15,100. Both have the initials of all 36 victims printed on them. Curry had posted on Twitter to advertise the eBay auction. The fire broke out Dec. 2 during a party at the Ghost Ship warehouse. 0 Shares ",

The 40-year-old woman\u2019s two daughters were also injured after falling about 20 feet with her on Thursday morning at Ski Granby Ranch about 90 miles west of Denver. Their names haven\u2019t been released, but police said they were visiting from San Antonio. The 12-year-old daughter was treated and released from the local hospital, but her 9-year-old sister was airlifted to Children\u2019s Hospital in suburban Denver. Her condition wasn\u2019t released. The Quick Draw Express lift, which brings skiers to beginner and intermediate terrain, will remain closed until state regulators can determine that it is safe for the public to use, said Lee Rasizer, a spokesman for the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board.\u00a0 There is no timeline for when the lift will reopen, CBS Denver reported . The most recent license for the lift was effective two weeks ago and lasts through 2017. One mother whose child witnessed the accident said they had been riding the lift for the past three days and were constantly getting stuck. Each stop caused the chair lift to bounce and sway.\u00a0 She said she was stopped on the lift for 10 minutes earlier on Thursday and said she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the investigation shows a mechanical issue with the lift, according to CBS Denver.\u00a0 Shelly Olson with Granby Fire said, \u201cThe lift was operating correctly for everyone to get off the lift safely.\u201d The ski industry expressed its condolences to the family. Chairlift deaths are rare, both in Colorado and across the country. People are five times more likely to die in an elevator accident and eight times more likely to die in a car accident than on a ski lift, said Chris Linsmayer, a spokesman for Colorado Ski Country USA, the trade group representing most of the state\u2019s ski resorts. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen very often,\u201d he said, referring to statistics from the National Ski Areas Association regarding deaths due to mechanical problems with chairlifts. Falls are also sometimes caused by mistakes made by riders or medical problems. According to a report from the association, there have been three deaths from falls not related to any mechanical problems since 2004 in the United States. The Ski Granby lift was equipped with a safety bar, but it\u2019s not clear if it was being used, Linsmayer said. The last fatal fall in Colorado, which accounts for more than a fifth of skier visits nationwide, happened in 2002 when the manager of Winter Park Ski Resort fell about 15 feet from a lift after suffering seizure-like symptoms. Colorado\u2019s worst accident happened in 1976, when four people were killed after cable wires became entangled in a gondola in Vail. In 1985, two people died at Keystone Resort after the welding on the large wheel used to pull the cable failed.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Trump praises Putin over response to US sanctions, calls him 'very smart' Published               December 30, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Friday to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against new penalties imposed by the Obama administration for Russia's alleged interference in the U.S. election \u2013 going so far as to call Putin \u201cvery smart.\u201d \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\u201d Trump tweeted. Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 The tweet comes after Putin announced earlier in the day that he would not kick out American diplomats despite President Obama\u2019s announcement Thursday that his administration will expel 35 Russian intelligence operatives and close down two Russian compounds in Maryland and New York, among other actions. Trump later sent another tweet that criticized two major networks while prasing Fox News. Russians are playing @CNN and @NBCNews for such fools - funny to watch, they don't have a clue! @FoxNews totally gets it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 While the Russian premier condemned the sanctions imposed on his country, calling them \u201cunfriendly,\u201d he said he would not retaliate and was instead looking to rebuild Russian-U.S. relations with the incoming Trump administration. \"We will not expel anyone. We will not prevent their families and children from using their traditional leisure sites during the New Year's holidays. Moreover, I invite all children of U.S. diplomats accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas children's parties in the Kremlin,\" Putin added. Trump has taken heat for not criticizing Putin, and for doubting U.S. intelligence suggesting the Russians interfered in the election to sway the vote Trump\u2019s way. Trump called for the U.S \u201dto move on to bigger and better things\u201d in a statement Thursday in response to the Obama sanctions. The restrained response from Putin was a marked contrast from noises from the Kremlin earlier Friday, when Putin\u2019s deputies pushed for a stronger response. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called for Russia to kick out a group of U.S. diplomats, and suggested blocking the Americans from using their summer retreat on the outskirts of Moscow and a warehouse south of Moscow. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev charged earlier in the day that the outgoing administration has become immersed in \"anti-Russian death throes.\" Trump has said he is keeping an open mind on the issue, and will meet with leaders in the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the issue. Obama also announced Thursday that the U.S. had sanctioned the GRU and the FSB -- two of Russia's intelligence services as well as other entities and individuals associated with the GRU.\u00a0The cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate the hack of its emails earlier this year concluded the hacking came from the Fancy Bear group, believed to be affiliated with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency.

Security Council Resolution condemning construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank (the U.S. abstained, allowing the resolution to pass). There have even been reports that the U.K. helped broker the deal , ensuring it addressed America's concerns. The spokesperson reportedly said May supports the UN resolution, but is concerned about John Kerry's language: \"We continue to believe that the construction of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal, which is why we supported UN security council resolution 2334 last week. But we are also clear that the settlements are far from the only problem in this conflict. In particular, the people of Israel deserve to live free from the threat of terrorism, with which they have had to cope for too long.\" Article continues after sponsorship Several news stories are suggesting that May is hoping to garner favor with the incoming Trump administration, as the president-elect has stated in his disapproval of the U.S. abstention in the UN vote.

Yes, you read that right,\" Assemblyman Travis Allen, whose district covers parts of Orange County, wrote Thursday in the conservative D.C. publication the Washington Examiner . Allen's attack on the \"terribly destructive legislation\" has lit up social media \u2014 but the intention of the law is not as alarming as he suggests, its supporters say. Senate Bill 1322, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in September, goes into effect on Sunday. \"So teenage girls (and boys) in California will soon be free to have sex in exchange for money without fear of arrest or prosecution,\" Allen wrote. Read my oped that ran in the Washington Examiner today discussing the many harmful California Democrat policies... https://t.co/eJVzKbPlDa \u2014 Travis Allen (@JoinTravisAllen) December 29, 2016 SB 1322 , he added, \"bars law enforcement from arresting sex workers who are under the age of 18 for soliciting or engaging in prostitution, or loitering with the intent to do so.\" And that's true \u2014 the law does state that minors won't be treated as criminals if they are caught under such circumstances. But state Democrats say that distinction was necessary so that the children aren't being blamed or punished for their situation. They are instead to be treated as victims who can be placed into a safe environment by the Department of Social Services, keeping them out of the criminal justice system and potentially off the streets again as sex workers, said state Sen. Holly Mitchell, who introduced SB 1322. In his op-ed, Allen acknowledged that Democrats are \"sincere in their belief that decriminalizing underage prostitution is good public policy that will help victims of sex trafficking.\" But he said SB 1322 is \"misguided\" because it would theoretically allow pimps who exploit children to continue doing so because the children aren't being adequately removed. \"Simply put, more time on the street and less time in jail means more money for pimps, and more victims for them to exploit,\" Allen wrote. Allen could not be reached Friday for further comment. The law's backers deny that children won't be helped, and say the alternative if they are arrested of juvenile hall again victimizes them. \"The law is supposed to protect vulnerable children from adult abuse, yet we brand kids enmeshed in sex-for-pay with a scarlet 'P' and leave them subject to shame and prosecution,\" Mitchell said in September. Thank you @JerryBrownGov for signing SB 1322 and showing that California loudly states that \"There is no such thing as a child prostitute!\" \u2014 Holly J Mitchell (@HollyJMitchell) September 26, 2016 She said in a statement Friday to NBC News that it is a \"factually incorrect assertion that my bill ... ties the hands of the police.\" Currently, anyone caught soliciting can be charged with a misdemeanor that might include probation, jail time or a fine. California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who as a prosecutor once specialized in child sexual assault cases, addresses the Domestic Human Trafficking symposium in Los Angeles on April 25, 2014. Damian Dovarganes / AP, file While minors will be exempt from criminal charges under the new law, anyone caught engaging in acts with them will still be subject to prosecution since sex with a minor is considered statutory rape. Various district attorneys' offices in the state have expressed a similar apprehension toward the law \u2014but some say it's because the state just isn't ready to provide adequate services. \"Right now, service groups are struggling with what they have in place \u2014 there [are] just not enough resources,\" Jane Creighton, coordinator of the human trafficking unit at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, told the Los Angeles Times in August. \"I am not saying these bills should never pass.

Michael Mullen said in a statement. \"I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those who lost loved ones during this tragedy.\" Columbus-based Superior Beverage Group identified those aboard as its president and CEO John T. Fleming, his wife Sue, sons Jack and Andrew and two close friends. The Cessna Citation jet left Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland at 10:57 p.m. Thursday after a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game and was headed for Columbus, but air traffic control officials lost contact with the aircraft a short time later, a spokesman for the airport said. The Coast Guard said it would suspend the search at 7:30 p.m., and that officials on Saturday would hold a briefing to discuss recovery efforts. The Coast Guard said the 20-hour search covered 128 square miles of Lake Erie, and involved a helicopter, a Coast Guard cutter based in Detroit and an HC-130 aircraft from the Coast Guard and another aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force. There were waves of up to 15 feet and 30-knot winds at the time of the incident, the Coast Guard said. Phil Helsel ",

    "text": "No US carrier at sea leaves gap in Middle East By Lucas Tomlinson Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 For the next week, not only will there be no U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the Middle East, but there will be no American aircraft carriers deployed at sea anywhere else in the world, despite a host of worldwide threats facing the United States. VIDEO: WHAT THE AIR FORCE NEEDS TO KEEP UP WITH GLOBAL DEMAND The carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her strike group returned to Norfolk, Va., Friday following a seven-month deployment. The Ike launched hundreds of airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria from both the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Two destroyers in the Ike\u2019s strike group also saw combat. The USS Nitze and USS Mason were attacked in the Red Sea when Iranian backed Houthi forces in Yemen launched cruise misisles, which\u00a0were intercepted by the Mason. A retaliatory strike by the Nitze destroyed the radar installations in Yemen in October. IRAN CONDUCTS 'WAR-GAME' EXERCISES, THREATENS TO SHOOT DOWN TRESPASSING AIRCRAFT The Eisenhower\u2019s replacement carrier, the USS George H.W. Bush, was delayed by more than six months in the shipyards and will not be able to replace the Ike until early next year, according to Navy officials. While there is no U.S. aircraft carrier in the\u00a0Middle East right now, there is a large deck U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship\u00a0with thousands of Marines on board as well as helicopters and some jets to\u00a0respond to a crisis, according to officials. In the meantime, the Navy tells Fox News the U.S. military has other jets available to make up for the aircraft carrier gap in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. The Navy can also \u201csurge\u201d a carrier now in port to deploy if necessary. But the absence of a deployed U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, long seen as a symbol of American power projection, is noteworthy.\u00a0It is believed to be the first time since World War II that at least one U.S.\u00a0aircraft carrier has not been deployed. \u201cWe are not going to discuss the timing of operational movements of carrier strike groups into and out of the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility,\u201d said Capt. Terry Shannon, a U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesman, in a statement to Fox News. Centcom is tasked with control over all U.S. forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan. It\u2019s not the first time there\u00a0was a carrier gap in the Middle East. Last fall, the U.S. Navy relied on a\u00a0French aircraft carrier to fill the void when the USS Theodore Roosevelt returned home.\u00a0At the time it was the first gap in carrier coverage in the Middle East since 2007. Other factors contribute to the U.S. Navy not having an aircraft carrier deployed anywhere in the world right now. From 2011 to 2013, the Navy maintained two carriers\u00a0in the Persian Gulf on the orders of Centcom's then-commander, Gen.\u00a0James Mattis, who is now President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary.\u00a0 The congressionally mandated budget cuts\u00a0known as sequestration have also been felt on the waterfront since 2011.\u00a0After billions of dollars were cut from the Navy\u2019s budget, ships such as the George H.W. Bush were forced to prolong their time in the shipyards, which had a ripple effect down the line. If the Bush had left the shipyard on time, she would have relieved the Ike in the Gulf or the Mediterranean, officials tell Fox News. Fox News recently flew out to the USS George H.W. Bush 40 miles off the coast of North Carolina to see the crew's final tuneup. With jets landing every 60\u00a0seconds, the flight deck crew worked on getting the time between \u201ctraps\u201d (landings) down to 40 seconds. Aboard the ship, 18- to 22-year-old men and women work 14 hour days on the flight deck, with little rest -- all this before deploying and potentially dropping live rounds on ISIS. \u201cThis is the military equivalent of spring training, because once we complete this at the end of December, then we'll be going forward and it'll be real forces that we'll be going flying with and against,\u201d said Rear Adm. Kenneth Whitesell, commander, Carrier\u00a0Strike 2, interviewed on his perch above the four-acre flight deck known as \u201cVulture's Row.\u201d In addition to fighting ISIS, the ship's commanding officer says his crew will be ready to deal with a resurgent Russia or China if necessary. \u201cWhile we don't have any emergent or pending conflicts with them, certainly, it is fair to say that we have divergent interests in many cases. and so we need to be prepared to understand how we will react to that if necessary,\u201d said Capt. Will Pennington. There is recent history with this ship. On Aug. 8, 2014, a pair of F-18s from the Bush launched the first airstrikes against ISIS in northern Iraq. Now, two and a half years later, the ship is headed back to the fight against the Islamic State terror group. \u201cThat doesn't mean that three months or six months from now, that will be the priority for our country. So we have to be ready to execute anywhere, anytime, any mission,\u201d said Capt. James McCall, commander of Air Wing 8, in charge of all of the aircraft on board.

Wake County Superior Court Judge Don Stephens ruled Friday that the risk to free and fair elections justified stopping the law from taking effect this weekend until it could be reviewed more closely. Stephens plans to review the law Thursday. North Carolina Governor-elect Roy Cooper speaks to supporters at a victory rally the day after his Republican opponent and incumbent Pat McCrory conceded in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S. on Dec. 6, 2016. JONATHAN DRAKE / Reuters Gov.-elect. Roy Cooper sued on Friday to block the law, passed two weeks ago. It ends the control governors exert over statewide and county election boards. The lawsuit says the Republican-led General Assembly's action is unconstitutional because it violates separation of powers by giving legislators too much control over how election laws are administered. Cooper takes office Sunday. The changes convert the state elections board from one that governors have controlled into a bipartisan body with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats. County election boards would have two members from each party, rather than the current three members with a majority from the governor's party. The Associated Press ",

ALBERT GEA / Reuters Share advertisement If the world feels like a colder, meaner place these days, virtual reality may come to the rescue. Researchers across the globe are using immersive digital worlds to place users in someone else's shoes and, at least temporarily, help them become kinder, more compassionate people. Virtual reality is better known for its potential in gaming, but scientists, as well as filmmakers, writers, artists, and designers, are using VR to reduce racial bias, promote environmentalism , encourage empathy for prisoners , humanize political enemies , or even help users make better financial choices. It's working, to some extent. \"We have spent the past fifteen years designing experiments to test the efficacy of VR to teach empathy. Across dozens of studies, a pattern emerges in that VR tends to be a more effective tool than other media and role-playing techniques,\" Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, says via email. Related: 11 Surprising Predictions From the Top Names in Science Though changes are often small, Bailenson adds, studies repeatedly show that virtual reality experiences can impact thoughts and behaviors in the real world. Sun Joo (Grace) Ahn has observed these behavioral changes first hand. In 2011, then a graduate student in Bailenson's lab, Ahn sent study participants a questionnaire to determine how likely they were to understand the perspective of others. Two days later, the participants were provided with basic information about red-green colorblindness \u2014 a visual disorder that causes difficulty distinguishing between certain hues \u2014 and asked to verbally guide a person they believed to be colorblind through a series of virtual reality color-matching exercises. A guest views Prabal Gurung's Samsung Gear 360 photographs on the Samsung Gear VR at Soho Beach House on November 30, 2016 in Miami Beach, Florida. Bryan Bedder / Getty Images Some participants viewed the exercises through a filter that simulated colorblindness, while others completed the exercises without the filter. Ahn found that after seeing the world through a colorblind lens, study subjects who originally weren't as likely to understand the perspective of others showed more favorable attitudes towards colorblind people a full day after the exercise had ended. That attitude also translated into action. A separate experiment that asked study subjects to help a student group attempting to build colorblind-friendly websites showed that participants who experienced virtual colorblindness themselves, even for just a few minutes, spent about twice as long helping, compared to participants in the control group. VR has been shown to drive behavioral changes across a wide array of scenarios. In Barcelona, light-skinned people who navigated a virtual world as a dark-skinned avatar showed lower subconscious racial bias than those who used an avatar with a closer skin tone to their own. To study if taking the perspective of non-human creatures could motivate people to care more about environmental issues, Stanford University created a time-lapse simulation that allows users to assume the avatar of a piece of coral and watch as ocean acidification corrodes their digital limbs. Researchers observed that those who completed the VR experience perceived acidification to be a more imminent environmental problem than people who watched the same images on video without a VR headset. Courtesy of Stanford University But it doesn't take a university-backed research team to create VR empathy initiatives. iAnimal \u2014 a project launched earlier this year by the advocacy group, Animal Equality \u2014 is a series of virtual reality films detailing life inside factory farms. The first installment shows viewers the lifecycle of a factory-farmed pig, from birth to slaughter, in part from the animal's perspective. Since its release, the film has racked up more than 40,000 views and can be experienced in VR at home with Google Cardboard through the organization's YouTube channel. \"We are sure that this is far more impactful than watching a video on a tablet,\" says Jose Valle, Animal Equality co-founder and director of investigations. \"Even if it's difficult and some people cry when they watch it, they think it's really important to show it to others.\" Related: How Computers Are Learning to Predict the Future Virtual reality doesn't just encourage empathy for external beings; it can also teach us to think differently about how we treat ourselves. A separate Stanford study placed research subjects in a virtual environment and had each of them interact with either an avatar that looked like them currently or an avatar designed to look like a future, elderly version of themselves. After exiting the VR environment, subjects who interacted with their elderly selves were significantly more willing to set aside money for retirement than those who interacted with avatars modeled after their current appearances. Ahn, lead author on the coral study and now director of the Games and Virtual Environments Lab at the University of Georgia, says that virtual reality makes an impact, in part because it fills in some of the perceptual blanks that prevent us from truly understanding another person's condition or circumstance. \"Perspective-taking\" \u2014 the process of imagining life from another person's point of view \u2014 often relies on a relatively small amount of information and a lot of imagination as the brain extrapolates all of the various ways that information affects another person's life, often based on assumptions from our own lives. iAnimal users. Courtesy of Animal Equality / Courtesy of Animal Equality With virtual reality, less extrapolation is required. Instead of imagining a world with distorted reds and greens, VR can ask users to search through a digital closet for the right color shirt, feeling all the emotions that go along with that action. Short VR experiences, when compared to traditional video of the same length, make more of an impact because, Ahn believes, VR's extra sensory input helps imprint the experience more in the brain. \"Virtual simulations tend to mimic what you might experience in the physical world so there's a lot more detail for you to create a mental schema, a memory of this experience as if it happened to you in the real world,\" she says. \"When you are trying to recall that experience later on, it's a lot more salient. You have a lot more details to recall. It's easier for you to build this mental map of what you experienced in your memory.\" Related: How the Tech Industry is Tackling the Cancer Moonshot There's a growing body of scientific literature, Ahn's included, dedicated to uncovering how this salience can be used to encourage positive behaviors, but the best ways to get long-lasting effects aren't yet set in stone, and Ahn says more research examining long-term repeated use of empathy-building VR programs is needed. Even with data showing VR's short-term impact, these projects still fight an uphill battle to change the psyche. Projects aimed at reducing racial bias, for example, may provide short exercises that challenge a user's subconscious prejudices, but those projects compete against a daily deluge of information from the real world that reinforces racial bias through experiences like living in segregated neighborhoods and absorbing media that promotes stereotypes. \"Putting people in contact situations, particularly cooperative ones, is the most likely thing to reduce racial prejudice, though it's no guarantee,\" says Jim Blascovich, director of the Research Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Virtual reality can be a tool to facilitate those meaningful experiences and potentially erode bias over time, but it can't magically solve racism, or any other systemic problem, on its own, Blascovich says. Related: This App is Revolutionizing Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Empathy isn't a cure-all either according to Erika Weisz, a graduate student in Stanford University's Social Neuroscience Laboratory who studies how different motivations drive people toward or away from using empathy. The ability to understand the feelings of others is \"morally neutral,\" Weisz says over e-mail, and \"exquisitely context sensitive.\" While empathy can motivate us to act kinder and become better people, it can also \"be hijacked, or used to promote different agendas regardless of their moral composition.\" Both Weisz and Blascovich believe virtual reality can be a valuable tool in helping us better understand others, a significant step to becoming nicer people and enacting positive change. \"It's not a panacea,\" Blascovich says, \"but it's probably as good or better than anything else we've ever tried.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

Michael Mullen of the U.S. Coast Guard answers questions during a news conference at Burke Lakefront Airport on Dec. 30, 2016, in Cleveland. (Tony Dejak / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The chief executive of a beverage distribution company was piloting a plane carrying his wife, two sons and two other people when it quickly lost altitude after takeoff from Cleveland's lakeshore airport and vanished from radar, according to his family and a flight-tracking service Friday. Superior Beverage Group executive John T. Fleming was piloting the Columbus-bound plane when it disappeared late Thursday about 2 miles over Lake Erie, his parents and company confirmed. The five other people on the plane were Fleming's wife, Sue, teenage sons Jack and Andrew, a neighbor and the neighbor's daughter, said John W. Fleming, the pilot's father, and Joseph McHenry, an executive vice president at Superior Beverage. The U.S. Coast Guard said Friday it was suspending search-and-rescue efforts and is no longer expecting to find anyone alive. Coast Guard Capt. Michael Mullen says deciding to end a search is never easy. He says the Coast Guard extends its condolences to \"the family and friends of those who lost loved ones during this tragedy.\" The Coast Guard had been using planes, helicopters and a 140-foot-long cutter in searching a 128-square-mile area in the lake after the plane lost radar contact late Thursday. Tracking service FlightAware logged only three location pings for the plane after takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport, and the last one indicated rapid altitude loss. Authorities have said there were no distress signals from the pilot. The aircraft took off westward from Burke, then turned north across the lake, according to the tracking service flightradar24.com. The departure procedure at Burke could take an aircraft north over the lake before turning south toward a destination, Mullen said. The plane, which had made the roughly half-hour trip from Columbus earlier in the day, is registered to a limited liability company under the same Columbus address as Superior Beverage. Authorities have detected \"faint hints\" but no strong pulse from an emergency locating transmitter, a beacon that could help find the plane, Mullen said. Searchers have found no sign of debris. The search overnight was made difficult by snow squalls, high seas and darkness, Mullen said. Weather prevented smaller Coast Guard boats in the Cleveland area from launching. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter and a Royal Canadian Air Force plane were used along with a Coast Guard ship from Detroit began the search overnight that has continued in the daylight hours Friday. It would have been the pilot's responsibility to determine whether it was safe to fly, Mullen said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the Cessna Citation 525 plane left Burke at 10:50 p.m., and the Coast Guard said it was notified about the missing plane by air traffic control at Burke about 30 minutes later. Investigators from the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board were expected to arrive in Cleveland on Friday. The aircraft was headed to Ohio State University Airport northwest of downtown Columbus. Associated Press ",

The dispute between NBCUniversal and Charter centers on proposed price hikes for the NBC channels, according to people familiar with the talks. Above, NBC \"Sunday Night Football\" commentators Mike Tirico, left, Cris Collinsworth and Bob Costas before a game in September. (Norm Hall / Getty Images) Meg James Contact Reporter With a Saturday night deadline looming, NBCUniversal and Charter Communications continued talks\u00a0to try to reach\u00a0a new carriage deal to\u00a0advert a blackout of NBC-owned television channels in nearly 16 million homes in the U.S. with Spectrum cable-TV service. NBCUniversal\u2019s current contract with Charter\u00a0expires Saturday at 9 p.m. Pacific time. If no agreement is in place by that time, Charter\u00a0would be forced to drop NBC owned channels. Spectrum customers in several markets, including Los Angeles,\u00a0New York and San Diego, also would lose coverage of their local NBC television stations. That means more than 1.6 million Spectrum homes in the Los Angeles region could\u00a0be without KNBC-TV Channel 4 on the eve of a high-profile NFL \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d game\u00a0between the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions . More than 100,000 Spectrum households in northern San Diego County\u00a0would be affected. NBC owns the local television affiliate, KNSD-TV Channel 7 in San Diego, which would be part of the blackout. \u00a0More than 1 million homes with Spectrum service in New York would be included, as\u00a0well as\u00a0400,000 Spectrum homes in Dallas. Spectrum customers also would lose access to the Spanish-language Telemundo network and 12 cable outlets, including USA Network, Bravo, Syfy, E!, NBC Sports, Golf Channel, CNBC and\u00a0MSNBC.\u00a0 NBCUniversal, however, could\u00a0grant a contract extension to allow Charter to continue to carry its channels while\u00a0the two companies\u00a0work\u00a0to iron\u00a0out a deal. The dispute centers on\u00a0proposed price hikes for the NBC channels, according to people familiar with the talks. \u00a0 NBC on Thursday declared an impasse in the negotiations,\u00a0but\u00a0discussions between the two sides resumed\u00a0Friday.\u00a0 NBC executives\u00a0have been laboring for five years to raise their\u00a0programming fees, which are well below industry averages.\u00a0When the previous round of deals were struck about\u00a0six years ago, NBC was owned by General Electric, and the NBC broadcast network was on the ropes \u2014 in fourth place among the big broadcast networks.\u00a0NBC\u00a0had considerably less bargaining power than\u00a0rivals such as Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC,\u00a0ESPN and Disney Channel. \u201cNBCUniversal is the No. 1 media company in America and we put a fair deal in front of Charter that is consistent with the rest of the industry,\u201d Matt Bond, chairman of NBCUniversal Content Distribution,\u00a0said Friday. \u201cWe hope they will agree to these terms.\u201d But Connecticut-based Charter Communications has\u00a0incentives to drive a hard bargain. Last year, the company swallowed the much larger\u00a0 Time Warner Cable , which gave Charter considerable heft in carriage negotiations \u2014\u00a0and the company is testing its clout as the nation\u2019s second-largest cable operator. In addition, Charter took on more than $25 billion in\u00a0debt to finance the Time Warner Cable acquisition, and Charter\u2019s executives have been under pressure to more efficiently manage operations and hold the line on programming costs. Pay-TV operators industrywide are struggling\u00a0to navigate an\u00a0increasingly fraught environment. They have been losing\u00a0customers who opt for cheaper alternatives for TV entertainment,\u00a0such as streaming services like including SlingTV, Netflix and Hulu. Traditional\u00a0operators\u00a0are worried about losing\u00a0more customers who have grown weary of paying higher cable bills for the same channels. NBCUniversal, meanwhile, is facing its own\u00a0delicate dance. Its parent company, Comcast Corp. , is the nation\u2019s largest cable television company, and Comcast is dealing\u00a0with similar concerns about rising programming costs. Comcast separately has been\u00a0trying to negotiate\u00a0a new carriage deal for 21st Century Fox \u2019s television channels, including the popular Fox News Channel and a dozen regional sports networks. CBS Corp., meanwhile, has been\u00a0engaged in negotiations\u00a0with AT&T\u2019s DirecTV unit, and\u00a0those talks appear to be progressing.\u00a0 Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Caption Natalie Portman on the importance of the infamous pink dress in 'Jackie' For her role as Jackie Kennedy, Natalie Portman says, \"It's not a fashion story,\" but the clothes do tell a story.

This may be a sign of the end of the post-Donald Trump rally, but trading volume was light and we'll have to wait until next year to get a good read on the markets.  Video provided by TheStreet Newslook A view of giant numbers covered in light bulbs that will be used to ring in 2016 during an event promoting New Year's Eve in Times Square in New York, on Dec. 15 2015. (EPA/JUSTIN LANE) (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) Despite Wall Street\u2019s worst start to a year ever, the U.S. stock market bounced back and posted solid gains in 2016, with small stocks leading the charge higher in a rally that gained steam after Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index, which is filled with America\u2019s largest companies, rose 9.5% to 2238.83 in 2016, despite a 0.5% drop on the final trading day of the year. The index rose for the fourth time in five years after kicking off the first week of 2016 with a 6% drop and sinking as much as 10.5% at its low for the year in mid-October. The big winner in 2016 was the small-company Russell 2000 stock index, which gained 19.5% to close out the year at 1357.13. The small-cap index got a huge lift after Election Day, surging nearly 14% as investors began to price in what they believe will be a better outlook for smaller, domestically focused U.S. companies under a Trump administration. So-called \u201cTrumponomics,\u201d which has an \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus and includes plans to cut corporate taxes, reduce costly business regulations and spend heavily on rebuilding aging U.S. infrastructure, is seen as a boon for small U.S. companies. Small-fry firms also do less business abroad, which reduces their risk in the event a global trade war breaks out due to potential Trump policies that could impede free trade across borders. Wall Street also cheered a 13.4% gain in 2016 for the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and an 7.5% advance for the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite. One highlight of 2016 was the Dow\u2019s late-year flirtation with the 20,000 milestone. Despite coming within 13 points of Dow 20,000 on Dec. 20, the 120-year-old stock gauge finished the year at 19,762.60, or 237\u00a0points shy of Dow 20K. The gains in 2016 followed full-year declines a year earlier for the Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 2000. Here are 2016\u2019s key market drivers: 1. Market avoids a major dive. The massive selloff to kick off the year totaled up to a loss of 10.5% for the S&P 500 at its low point in mid-February. And while that dive marked an official \u201ccorrection,\u201d or drop of 10% or more, it never snowballed into a dreaded bear market, or plunge of 20% or more, despite a rare call by RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland) on Jan. 11 to \u201csell everything\u201d and a Jan. 13 prediction from mega-bear Albert Edwards, global strategist at Societe Generale, that the S&P 500 could decline 75%. Holy anticipation! Dow 20,000, we have our bat-noculars on you https://t.co/ed4HPttEWl #2017MARKETOUTLOOK pic.twitter.com/fLxUvKuYW5 \u2014 USA TODAY Money (@USATODAYmoney) December 30, 2016 2. Fed dials back rate hikes. After the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates in December 2015 for the first time since the Great Recession, 2016 was supposed to be the year of Fed rate hikes. The Fed, itself, thought four hikes were possible in 2016, and Wall Street figured three rate increases were possible. However, due to international and market turbulence early in the year, coupled with slower-than-expected U.S. economic growth in the first half of 2016 and fears the June Brexit vote might upend markets, the Fed ended up hiking rates just once in 2016. And that lone rate hike did not come until its final meeting of the year on Dec. 14. The Fed\u2019s patience and a continuation of low borrowing costs, enabled both the economy and stock market to regain momentum. ",

After his arrival, about 150 protesters gathered. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Vice President-elect Mike Pence was in the Loop for an Illinois Republican fundraiser at The Chicago Club on Dec. 30, 2016. After his arrival, about 150 protesters gathered. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Vice President-elect Mike Pence appeared at a Chicago fundraiser Friday where the Illinois GOP hoped to raise as much as $1 million for the Republican National Committee. On the host committee for the $2,700-per-ticket fundraiser were some of Illinois' most prominent Republicans, including Gov. Bruce Rauner , seven of the eight Illinois GOP congressmen and Ron Gidwitz, a businessman who led President-elect Donald Trump 's Illinois campaign fundraising effort. The Indiana governor arrived in the Loop shortly before 11 a.m. and entered the Chicago Club through a back door not visible from the barricaded sidewalks in front of the building. Pence was not greeted by protesters, although they arrived later while he was inside. Illinois Republican Chairman Tim Schneider said a fractured state party during the primary season has since coalesced around Trump and Pence. Demonstrators protest Vice President-elect Mike Pence outside a Republican National Committee fundraiser in Chicago on Dec. 30, 2016.\u00a0 (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) \"Chicago is the hub of the Midwest and it's also very close to his roots in Indiana, so he can draw from those folks who are supporters from Indiana,\" said Schneider, a Cook County commissioner, of Pence's visit to the city. \"I think we have a great number of supporters here in Chicago who believe in this new Trump-Pence administration, and that's why they're here.\" Not listed as part of the host committee were U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk and U.S. Rep. Robert Dold of Kenilworth, who distanced themselves from Trump but ultimately lost their re-election bids last month. Rauner has been reluctant to even say Trump's name, which didn't stop Democrats from cobbling together a TV attack ad during the fall attempting to link the governor to the GOP standard bearer. Rauner confirmed that he has spoken to Trump since the election. Rauner did not attend the event, however, as he had traveled out West with his family. About 150 protesters gathered at Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street. Many of them waved signs that read \"We say no to racism, sexism & war!\" Among the chants they repeated: \"Our bodies, our lives, our right to decide!\" and \"Racist, sexist, anti-gay! Mike Pence go away!\" and \"No Trump, no Pence! No KKK! No fascist USA!\" There was, however, a Trump supporter who responded to the chants through a megaphone of his own. The man, who only would identify himself by the fake name of \"Alexander Hamilton,\" was approached by a handful of demonstrators who screamed and cursed at him as a Chicago police officer watched nearby. \"Donald Trump will make America great again!\" the man chanted over and over again. A Republican official indicated the fundraiser was expected to raise $500,000 to $1 million. Those making the maximum $33,400 contribution got a roundtable and photo with Pence, while those contributing $10,000 got a photo with him. bruthhart@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 30, 2016 7:50 PM EST CLEVELAND --\u00a0The chief executive of a beverage distribution company was piloting a plane carrying his wife, two sons and two other people when it quickly lost altitude after takeoff from Cleveland\u2019s lakeshore airport and vanished from radar, according to his family and a flight-tracking service Friday. Superior Beverage Group executive John T. Fleming was piloting the Columbus-bound plane when it disappeared late Thursday about 2 miles over Lake Erie, his parents and company confirmed. The five other people on the plane were Fleming\u2019s wife, Sue, teenage sons Jack and Andrew, a neighbor and the neighbor\u2019s daughter, said John W. Fleming, the pilot\u2019s father, and Joseph McHenry, an executive vice president at Superior Beverage. In a\u00a0 statement , McHenry said that while search and rescue operations were underway \u201cwe are focusing our efforts on supporting the families involved.\u201d \u201cAs we all await the results of the search and rescue efforts, our hearts are with John, his wife, their sons, and close friends on board, as well as with their loved ones and everyone in the Superior Beverage family,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is a difficult day for us, and we appreciate the concern and thoughtfulness extended by so many.\u201d The U.S. Coast Guard announced it was suspending its search for the plane on Friday at 7:30 p.m., pending further developments. The Coast Guard is no longer expecting to find anyone alive. The search will have covered more than 128 square miles of Lake Erie, and it spanned more than 20 hours, the Coast Guard said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to suspend a search is never easy,\u201d said Capt. Michael Mullen, chief of response for the Coast Guard 9th District. \u201cI extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those who lost loved ones during this tragedy.\u201d Crews combed Lake Erie for the plane on Friday. They were in search-and-rescue mode, not recovery mode, as they plied waters about 50 feet deep, said Mullen. Tracking service FlightAware logged only three location pings for the plane after takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport, and the last one indicated rapid altitude loss. Authorities have said there were no distress signals from the pilot. The aircraft took off westward from Burke, then turned north across the lake, according to the tracking service flightradar24.com. The departure procedure at Burke could take an aircraft north over the lake before turning south toward a destination, Mullen said. The plane, which had made the roughly half-hour trip from Columbus earlier in the day, is registered to a limited liability company under the same Columbus address as Superior Beverage. Authorities have detected \u201cfaint hints\u201d but no strong pulse from an emergency locating transmitter, a beacon that could help find the plane, Mullen said. Searchers have found no sign of debris. When asked about the possibility of the twin-engine jet landing safely on Lake Erie, Mullen said, \u201cAircraft are not designed to float, especially in 12-foot seas.\u201d It was also \u201cunlikely\u201d that the plane landed somewhere else, an experienced helicopter pilot said,\u00a0 CBS Cleveland affiliate WOIO-TV reported . The search overnight was made difficult by snow squalls, high seas and darkness, Mullen said. Weather prevented smaller Coast Guard boats in the Cleveland area from launching. Weather in the area included 12-15 feet seas with winds around 30 knots,\u00a0 WOIO reported . It would have been the pilot\u2019s responsibility to determine whether it was safe to fly, Mullen said. The search included Coast Guard crews aboard a helicopter, an HC-130 aircraft and the Coast Guard Cutter Bristol Bay. It also included aircrew aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force CC-130, the Coast Guard said. Searchers used night-vision goggles and some aircraft were able to search for heat signatures, Coast Guard petty officer Christopher Yaw said, WOIO reports.\u00a0 The Federal Aviation Administration said the Cessna Citation 525 plane left Burke at 10:50 p.m., and the Coast Guard said it was notified about the missing plane by air traffic control at Burke about 30 minutes later. Investigators from the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board were expected to arrive in Cleveland on Friday. The aircraft was headed to Ohio State University Airport northwest of downtown Columbus. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Yet amid the bad, the ugly and the end of Brangelina , there was still some good you might have missed while you were standing in your room crying to Joni Mitchell. Here is the year that was in good news. 1. Unemployment hits lowest level since the recession The unemployment rate in November fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest in nine years, the Labor Department said earlier this month. To compare: When President Obama took office in 2009, the unemployment rate was at 7.8 percent. 2. Simone Biles takes Rio by storm With 14 total world championship medals, 19-year-old Simon Biles arrived in Rio already a star. It was her near-perfect performance at the Olympics, however \u2014 which netted four golds and a bronze \u2014 that cemented her legacy as the greatest female gymnast who ever lived. Simone Biles competes in the beam event of the women's individual all-around final during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Aug. 11, 2016. Ben Stansall / AFP - Getty Images 3. The Cubs overcome their World Series curse No matter what team you root for, it was hard not celebrate alongside the Chicago Cubs after they won their first World Series in 108 years. As legend has it, the team was cursed in 1945 when tavern-owner William \"Billy Goat\" Sianis was kicked out of Game 4 of the Cubs' World Series game against the Detroit Tigers for bringing his smelly billy goat, Murphy. On his way out, Sianis is reputed to have declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,\" thus spawning the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat that lasted seven decades. Chicago Cubs celebrate after Game 7 of the World Series against the Cleveland Indians on Nov. 3, 2016, in Cleveland. Matt Slocum / AP 4. Women of color make history on Election Night Several women of color made political history last month when they were elected to prominent leadership positions within their respective states. California Attorney General Kamala Harris became the first black woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the Golden State; Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American lawmaker in the U.S. with her election to the Minnesota legislature; Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina senator in history when she won her U.S. Senate bid in Nevada; and Pramila Jayapal became the first Indian-American congresswoman with her victory in Washington state. 5. \"Lemonade\" and other musical triumphs Few albums in history have managed to be as simultaneously vulnerable and powerful as \"Lemonade\" \u2014 Beyonce's sixth solo record that laid bare an important slice of black womanhood . Indeed, \"Lemonade\" was an artistic feat so monumental, it helped ease the pain inflicted by the deaths of some of music's greatest legends. But it wasn't the only great album of 2016: Frank Ocean , A Tribe Called Quest and Beyonce's own sister, Solange , also created stunning music this year. Beyonce performs during the Formation World Tour at NRG Stadium on Sept. 22, 2016, in Houston.

In June, the hip-hip Broadway sensation took home 11 Tony Awards \u2014 including Best Musical, the biggest prize of all. But the most moving moment of the ceremony came when show creator Lin-Manuel Miranda delivered his emotional \"Love is love is love\" speech while accepting the award for Best Score. Hours earlier, a lone gunman had killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Actors Leslie Odom Jr., left, Phillipa Soo, and Christopher Jackson look on as actor and \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, right, takes his final performance curtain call at the Richard Rogers Theatre after a performance of \"Hamilton\" on July 9, 2016, in New York. Evan Agostini / Invision via AP 7. U.S.-Cuba relations thaw President Obama made history in March when he became the first U.S. leader to visit Cuba in 88 years, culminating 15 months' worth of effort to reestablish diplomatic relations between the two countries. In addition to Obama's trip, Cuba and the U.S. have both taken steps since 2014 to end decades of hostility by opening embassies, restoring commercial flights and negotiating agreements on a range of issues \u2014 including the environment, law enforcement and communications. There is looming uncertainty, however, as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will maintain warmer relations with the communist country once he takes office. 8. Giant panda is no longer endangered The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a leading environmental group, said in a report this fall that the giant panda is now classified as a \"vulnerable\" species, rather than \"endangered.\" According to the group, the wild panda population jumped to 1,864 in 2014 \u2014 up from 1,596 in 2004 \u2014 marking a significant achievement for Chinese agencies working to enforce poaching bans and expand forest reserves.

Three people were found shot to death inside a home in the Fernwood neighborhood, another 2 were found shot outside the home, one of those deceased. Chicago has had more than 750 murders in 2016. (Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images) CHICAGO \u2014 Just before Christmas, Tywone Lee dialed the Chicago Police Department detective charged with investigating the murder of her 18-year-old son, who was gunned down in July just blocks from their West Side home. She\u2019s called police more than 20 times since her child, Keyon Boyd, was fatally shot in the chest and two of his friends were wounded\u00a0July 26 as they walked to play basketball at a nearby court in the city\u2019s Austin neighborhood. Most of her attempts to get information about the unsolved case ended with her leaving messages that rarely were returned, she said. On this day, she catches the detective, but receives no substantive information about the status of the investigation. \u201cThere is just no accountability,\u201d said a frustrated Lee after ending the call. \u201cI understand they have a lot of cases, but this is what they are paid to do. They need to find and hold responsible whoever killed my son.\u201d Boyd was one of more than 750 murder victims killed in Chicago in 2016, which will end as the bloodiest year the city has seen since at least 1997, when 761 people were killed. The murder toll was up 58% as of Christmas Day, with the city tallying 275 more murders than the same time last year. Nearly as unnerving as the number who have been killed in Chicago this year is how few of the assailants have been arrested. The department\u2019s murder clearance rate \u2014 the calculation of cases that end with an arrest or identification of a suspect who can\u2019t be apprehended \u2014 has hovered at or below 30% for the past three years. The national clearance rate stood at 61.5% last year, while Chicago\u2019s clearance rate was 25.6% last year, according to data compiled by the Virginia-based Murder Accountability Project.\u00a0 More than 40 shot in Chicago over the weekend The dismal rate\u00a0is a blemish\u00a0Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has acknowledged and vowed to improve. More cases will be solved, he says, by repairing the department's tattered reputation in predominantly black neighborhoods like the one where Lee lives,\u00a0and by completing a plan to add\u00a0hundreds of more detectives to the force. \"The first thing we have to do is improve our trust with the community \u2014 especially the minority community and CPD \u2014 that will help raise the clearance rate, because those individuals will be more comfortable in coming to us and giving us the information we need to hold these individuals accountable,\" Johnson said at a recent\u00a0 forum .\u00a0 As Lee has clamored for answers in\u00a0the shooting of her son \u2014 who is among 57 people killed this year in a district with a population of about 59,000 people \u2014 she says police department officials have asked for her patience as detectives throughout the city are piled with more cases than they can handle. That excuse doesn\u2019t assuage her anger. \u201cA lot of these kids are dying for no \u2026 reason, and no one seems to care,\u201d said Lee, who was badly injured as a teenager when her brother accidentally shot her while cleaning a gun. \u201cOur children\u2019s lives matter, just like white children\u2019s lives matter.\u201d Chicago hits grim milestone of 700 murders for 2016 and the year's not over The murder rate \u00a0surged in several major U.S. metropolitans in 2016, including Houston, San Antonio and Las Vegas. In terms of murders per capita, smaller cities, such as St. Louis and New Orleans outpace the nation\u2019s third largest city. But the grim toll in Chicago, which has recorded more murders than New York and Los Angeles combined, has captured the most attention. President-elect Donald Trump on the stump even compared\u00a0the city to a war-torn country. Tywone Lee sits in her home in Chicago's Austin neighborhood. Her son Keyon Boyd was killed July 26, 2016 in a shooting blocks from their home. \u00a0(Photo: Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY) Police officials say the surge in murders here is being driven by gangs in a few pockets in predominantly low-income African-American and Latino neighborhoods on the city\u2019s South and West Sides. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Johnson have also complained that repeat gun offenders are getting out of jail too quickly and contributing to the bloodshed. About 40% of homicide suspects arrested in Chicago last year had previously been convicted of a weapons offense, Johnson said. The spike in violence comes as the Chicago Police Department has struggled through a tumultuous year following the court-ordered release in November 2015 of police video showing a white officer fatally shooting Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old black suspect who was fired upon 16 times as he appeared to be running away from police. The McDonald incident \u2014 which spurred a still-ongoing U.S. Justice Department civil rights investigation of the police department's\u00a0practices and was followed by some other high-profile\u00a0police-involved shooting incidents that further exacerbated tensions \u2014 was the \u201ctipping point for long-simmering community anger,\u201d according to an April\u00a0report from the city\u2019s police accountability task force. In the aftermath of public outrage, Emanuel vowed to restore public trust for the police department in the city\u2019s African-American community, which represents about a third of Chicago\u2019s population. But more than a year into Emanuel\u2019s relationship mending effort, the dismal murder clearance rate underscores how complicated the situation has become. In response to the rising violence, Emanuel announced in September that the city would hire nearly 1,000 more cops over the next two years, including creating 350 additional detective positions. At the end of the hiring spree, the department is expected to have 13,500 sworn officers. In the recruitment drive, the police department has put an emphasis on diversifying its force. Emanuel has also outlined plans to launch a universal mentoring program to help young men in some of Chicago\u2019s most violent neighborhoods. And in a nod to bolstering transparency, Emanuel and the police department also announced earlier this week they were speeding up a plan to equip every cop on the street with a body camera.\u00a0All officers interacting with the public will now be wearing one by the end of next year. Johnson says\u00a0the low clearance rate will\u00a0improve as the department expands its detective pool as part of the hiring surge. But ultimately, Johnson says, the ability of\u00a0the police department to increase that rate correlates with the level of trust and cooperation officers build in the community. \u201cThe police very seldom \u2026 witness a lot of the murders in front of them, so we need the community to give us the information, so we can hold these individuals accountable,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cGang members count on that. They count on the public being fearful of their retaliation.\u201d The hiring push has been dismissed by some of activists in the predominantly black communities most impacted by the violence as a shortsighted attempt to solve the problem. Rev. Ira Acree, a West Side minister who counseled more than a dozen families this year who lost loved ones to the gun violence, said that instead of hiring more cops he'd rather see the city investing in mitigating some of the ills that are leading young men to join gangs and engage in other criminal activity in areas most impacted by the violence. \u201cInstead of pouring resources into hiring cops to arrest the people who are responsible for the violence, it would be more effective to focus on stopping the violence before it happens in the first place,\u201d Acree said. \u201cWe are not going to arrest our way out of this problem. This is a problem that\u2019s been caused by a lack of investment and opportunity for jobs and education in these communities.\u201d Peter Scharf, a criminologist at LSU\u2019s School of Public Health, said it will take time for the addition of detectives to impact the clearance rates. He also was skeptical that more cops on the streets of Chicago \u2014 already one of the biggest departments in the country \u2014 will drive down the murder rate. \u201cHomicide detectives are like fine wines, they take a longtime to mature,\u201d Scharf said. \u201cTo solve murders, you need to develop networks, you need snitches, you need to hone techniques. It\u2019s a brave new world, and it could take years to catch up.\u201d Follow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent\u00a0Aamer Madhani on Twitter:\u00a0 @AamerISmad Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hB4FIE NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Three U.S. Republican senators - including Kansas\u2019 Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts - demanded this month that the Department of Homeland Security provide immigration records for 38-year-old Tomas Martinez-Maldonado, who is charged with a felony in the alleged Sept. 27 attack aboard a bus in Geary County. He is being held in the Geary County jail in Junction City, which is about 120 miles west of Kansas City. U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, from Iowa and chairman of the judiciary committee, co-signed a Dec. 9 letter with Moran and Roberts to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, calling it \u201can extremely disturbing case\u201d and questioning how Martinez-Maldonado was able to re-enter and remain in the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it has placed a detainer - a request to turn Martinez-Maldonado over to ICE custody before he is released - with Geary County. ICE declined to discuss his specific case beyond its October statement regarding the 10 deportations. Court filings show Martinez-Maldonado has two misdemeanor convictions for entering without legal permission in cases prosecuted in 2013 and 2015 in U.S. District Court of Arizona, where he was sentenced to serve 60 days and 165 days respectively. A status hearing in the rape case is scheduled for Jan. 10. Defense attorney Lisa Hamer declined to comment on the charge, but said, \u201ccriminal law and immigration definitely intersect and nowadays it should be the responsibility of every criminal defense attorney to know the possible ramifications in the immigration courts.\u201d Nationwide, 52 percent of all federal prosecutions in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were for entry or re-entry without legal permission and similar immigration violations, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. It\u2019s not unusual to see immigrants with multiple entries without legal permission, said David Trevino, a Topeka immigration attorney also representing Martinez-Maldonado. Most of Martinez-Maldonado\u2019s family lives in Mexico, but he also has family in the United States, and the family is \u201cdevastated,\u201d Trevino said. \u201c(President-elect Donald Trump) can build a wall 100 feet high and 50 feet deep, but it is not going to keep family members separated. So if someone is deported and they have family members here ... they will find a way back - whether it is through the air, under a wall, through the coast of the United States,\u201d Trevino said. He declined to comment on his client\u2019s criminal history and pending charge. Records obtained by AP show Martinez-Maldonado had eight voluntary removals before his first deportation in 2010, which was followed by another voluntary removal that same year. He was deported five more times between 2011 and 2013. In 2013, Martinez-Maldonado was charged with entering without legal permission, a misdemeanor, and subsequently deported in early 2014 after serving his sentence. He was deported again a few months later, as well as twice in 2015 - including the last one in October 2015 after he had served his second sentence, the records show. ICE said in an emailed statement when it encounters a person who\u2019s been deported multiple times or has a significant criminal history and was removed, it routinely presents those cases to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for possible criminal charges. Cosme Lopez, spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Arizona, declined comment on why prosecutors twice dismissed felony re-entry after deportation charges against Martinez-Maldonado in 2013 and 2015 in exchange for guilty pleas on misdemeanor entry charges. Arizona ranks third in the nation - behind only the Southern District of Texas and the Western District of Texas - for the number of immigration prosecutions among the nation\u2019s 94 federal judicial districts for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, TRAC records show. Moran told the AP in an emailed statement that the immigration system is \u201cbroken.\u201d \u201cThere must be serious legislative efforts to address U.S. immigration policy, and we must have the ability to identify, prosecute and deport illegal aliens who display violent tendencies before they have an opportunity to perpetrate these crimes in the United States,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Politics Following the Links From Russian Hackers to the U.S. Election The Obama administration announced sanctions on Thursday against Russia and released a report that stated that the Russian government deployed computer hackers to attack the Democratic Party\u2019s computers. UPDATED DEC. 29, 2016 American intelligence officials said they believed that the hackers were associated with two Russian intelligence agencies. STATE-SPONSORED HACKERS July 2015 Federal Security Service A hacking group possibly linked to the agency, the main successor to the K.G.B., entered Democratic National Committee servers undetected for nearly a year, security researchers said. The group was nicknamed Cozy Bear, the Dukes or A.P.T. 29 for \u201cadvanced persistent threat.\u201d March 2016 G.R.U.: Military Intelligence Investigators believe that the G.R.U., or a hacking group known as Fancy Bear or A.P.T. 28, was the second group to break into the D.N.C., but it has played a bigger role in releasing the committee\u2019s emails. LEAKERS Guccifer 2.0 A self-proclaimed hacker that investigators believe was a group acting as an agent of the G.R.U. It published documents itself and leaked a series of D.N.C. documents. DCLeaks Investigators say it is a front for the Russian hackers who have tried to disrupt the election this year. It appeared in June as the release of the stolen Democratic Party documents began. PUBLISHERS WikiLeaks The website released about 50,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers. It is unclear how WikiLeaks obtained the emails. But Russian intelligence agencies are prime suspects, researchers said. Media Dozens of newspapers, television stations, bloggers and radio stations around the United States \u2014 including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal \u2014 pursued reporting based on the hacked material, significantly increasing the effects of the cyberattack. In some cases, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks took requests from reporters, releasing documents to them directly. RESULTS RESULTS Obama announced sanctions on Russian officials President Obama sanctioned Russian individuals and entities and ordered 35 intelligence operatives to leave the United States. The Obama administration released a report by the F.B.I. and Homeland Security that detailed steps that the Russians took to attack the Democratic Party\u2019s computers. Mr. Obama warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in early September to stay out of the American elections. The leaks cast doubt on the electoral process According to intelligence officials, the Russians were as surprised as everyone else by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. But the leaks disrupted the campaign and undercut confidence in the integrity of the vote. House races in a dozen states were affected Tens of thousands of pages of hacked D.N.C. documents were selectively released by Guccifer 2.0 to political bloggers and newspaper reporters, causing a backlash against Democrats, like Annette Taddeo, pictured left, running for the House in highly competitive contests. The hacked Podesta emails dominated news Weeks before the election, about 60,000 hacked emails from the account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, were released, in small amounts, spread over many days. They sparked extensive news coverage about the campaign's internal dynamics (as well as fake news stories). The leaks fueled a rift in the Democratic Party The emails forced the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman of the D.N.C. and added to the divide between supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.

By Adam Taylor December 30 at 10:40 AM Follow @mradamtaylor A woman walks past the building of the Anglo-American School of Moscow on Dec. 30. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP) Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, has hit back at claims that authorities were planning to close an American school in Moscow in an act of retribution for wide-ranging U.S. measures against Russia, announced Thursday. \u201cUS officials \u2018anonymously informed\u2019 their media that Russia closed the Anglo-American School in Moscow as a retaliatory measure,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post , which was later translated by the\u00a0 Russian state news agency TASS . \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. Apparently, the White House has completely lost its senses and began inventing sanctions against its own children.\u201d CNN was one of the first news organizations to report the closure of the school, which is popular with the children of Western diplomats. The news was widely shared on social media. #BREAKING : A US official says Russian authorities ordered the Anglo-American School of Moscow to close as retaliation for US sanctions \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) December 29, 2016 Zakharova\u00a0specifically criticized CNN for spreading \u201cfalse information.\u201d \u201cYou should not write that \u2018Moscow denied\u2026.

This year, I'm asking him to get rid of someone,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova wrote. The exact future of the\u00a0Anglo-American School remains unclear. A statement on the school's Facebook page says only that it \u201cis planning to open as scheduled following the New Year break\u201d and that it will post updates through emails, postings on its website and, \u201cif it is urgent,\" via\u00a0text messages. Russian President Vladimir Putin broke with diplomatic tradition Friday by not engaging in a tit-for-tat response to U.S. sanctions for alleged hacking by Russia. While the Russian Foreign Ministry had initially recommended that Putin expel 35 U.S. diplomats and close two properties used by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow\u00a0\u2014 a near mirror image of the measures taken by the Obama administration against Russia in the United States \u2014 Putin said that he didn't plan to \u201ccreate problems for American diplomats.\u201d \u201cMoreover, I am inviting all children of U.S. diplomats accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas parties in the Kremlin,\u201d Putin said in a statement Friday.

(Photo: Fred Beckham, AP) HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 A divided Connecticut Supreme Court has reinstated Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel\u2019s murder conviction in the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley, rejecting a lower court ruling that his trial lawyer didn\u2019t adequately represent him. The state\u2019s highest court on Friday released its 4-3 ruling. Skakel\u2019s lawyer said he was reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment. Skakel was convicted in 2002 of killing Moxley in Greenwich, where they were teenage neighbors. He was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. But he was freed in 2013 after a judge granted him a new trial. The court found, in part, that Skakel\u2019s trial lawyer failed to argue that Skakel\u2019s brother could have been responsible for the crime and failed to present a key alibi witness for Skakel.

Advertisement \u201cThey are concerned about controlling retaliation,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More But John P. Carlin, who recently left the administration as the chief of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, where he assembled cases against North Korean, Chinese and Iranian hackers, called the administration\u2019s actions a \u201csignificant step that is consistent with a new model: When you violate norms of behavior in this space, we can figure out who did it and we can impose consequences.\u201d The Obama administration was riven for months by an internal debate about how much of its evidence to make public. In interviews for a New York Times investigation into the hack , several of Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides expressed regret that they had not made evidence public earlier, or reacted more strongly. None said they believed it would have affected the outcome of the election, however. The U.S. Complaint The Obama administration cited the Russians for trying to undermine the election, for theft and misappropriation, and for harassment of American personnel. In recent weeks, Mr. Obama decided that the authorities he created in April 2015 to retaliate against states or individuals that conduct hacking after the Sony attack did not go far enough. They made no provision issuing sanctions in response to an incursion on the electoral system \u2014 an attack few saw coming. So he ordered his lawyers to amend the executive order, specifically giving himself and his successor the authority to issue travel bans and asset freezes on those who \u201ctamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\u201d The administration has not publicly criticized how its own officials handled the case. But the Times investigation revealed that the F.B.I. first informed the Democratic National Committee that it saw evidence that the committee\u2019s email systems had been hacked in the fall of 2015. Months of fumbling and slow responses followed. Mr. Obama said at a news conference that he was first notified early this summer. But one of his top aides met Russian officials in Geneva to complain about activity in April. By the time the leadership of the committee woke up to what was happening, the G.R.U. had not only obtained emails through a hacking group that has been closely associated with it for years, but, investigators say, also allowed them to be published on a number of websites, including a newly created one called DC Leaks and the far more established WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, several states reported the \u201cscanning\u201d of their voter databases \u2014 which American intelligence agencies also attributed to Russian hackers. But there is no evidence, American officials said, that Russia sought to manipulate votes or voter rolls on Nov. 8. Mr. Obama decided not to issue sanctions earlier for fear of Russian retaliation ahead of Election Day. Some of his aides now believe that was a mistake. But the president made clear before leaving for Hawaii that he planned to respond.

(Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images) 4032 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Funeral and memorial arrangements for Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher are taking firmer shape, says Todd Fisher, as the Los Angeles County medical examiner delayed performing an autopsy of Fisher's body. As the New Year's holiday approached, Hollywood waited to learn if there will be some kind of industry commemoration ceremony for two of its iconic screen queens, a mother-daughter duo who died one day after another this week. Publicists for the two stars contacted by USA TODAY said in emails they have no information to release yet. Update: But\u00a0Todd Fisher, 58, Reynolds' son and Fisher's brother, talked to ABC News' 20/20 Friday in his first TV interview and said he's planning a joint funeral for his mother and sister, with burial side by side\u00a0\u201camong friends,\u201d including Liberace and Bette Davis, at famed Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles. \"From the family\u2019s perspective, this is Debbie\u2019s destiny,\" he said. \"She didn't want to leave Carrie and did not want to her to be alone.\" Todd Fisher and Billie Lourd, Carrie's daughter and Reynold's granddaughter, 24, are still organizing their plans, including choosing a date, but Todd said there will be a private ceremony for family and a public one for friends and fans. Carrie Fisher died Tuesday, at age 60, following a heart-related medical emergency on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday. Her death was followed almost immediately by Reynolds'\u00a0death from an apparent stroke on Wednesday\u00a0while she was meeting with Todd to plan Carrie's funeral. He said his mother didn't die of a broken heart;\u00a0she left to be with Carrie.\u00a0\u201cShe said she really wanted to be with Carrie,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cIn those precise words, and within 15 minutes from that conversation she faded out and within 30 minutes, she technically was gone.\u201d The latest: Why did they die?: Todd Fisher said the stress of her daughter's death may have been too much for his 84-year-old mother, who had already suffered and survived small strokes in recent years. Her known medical history, plus the fact she died in a hospital attended by doctors, are\u00a0reasons why no autopsy is being performed by the county coroner, confirmed Ed Winter, spokesman for the Medical Examiner's Office. But it's still not clear whether and when an autopsy will be performed on Fisher's body, Winters says. Fisher, who was stricken on an international flight and died in a hospital after four days on a ventilator, had no known history of heart disease but she did have a history of chronic substance abuse\u00a0which could have damaged her heart. Winter said the medical examiner's office has agreed to give the family more time, partly to gather Fisher's medical records and partly to cope with the shock of losing both women so suddenly. Fans of Carrie Fisher honor the star by pointing 'Star Wars' lightsabers to the sky at Downtown Disney in Anaheim. \u00a0(Photo: Mark Eades, AP) Star Wars\u00a0fans proceed with tributes:\u00a0Around the country, lightsaber vigils were planned or held, including at\u00a0some\u00a0 Alamo Drafthouse\u00a0 movie theaters. One of the first was held outside Austin on Wednesday night. \"There has been a disturbance in the Force,\" the theater announced on its website, inviting fans to gather in Star Wars costumes with \"lightsabers.\" \"No lightsaber? Flashlights and glow sticks are also encouraged as we attempt to brighten the sky and say thank you to a woman who inspired us on and off the screen.\" x Share Star Wars fans in Austin and San Antonio, Texas held their light sabers high, as they gathered to remember Carrie Fisher. The actress best known as Princess Leia died on Tuesday. (Dec. 29) AP Downtown Disney in Anaheim, Calif., also hosted a vigil, drawing about 100 people with lightsabers aimed at the night sky to honor the memory of Fisher. New Orleans fans planned a tribute parade for Friday evening through Baywater to honor Fisher, led by The Leijorettes, a group of more than 100 marchers costumed as Princess Leia, according to the Times-Picayune . \"We've lost one of our greatest heroes,\" the organizers said on Facebook. \"Princess Leia defined cool.\" Creative tributes: Another growing phenomenon on social media is the fan-penned \"obituaries\" of the character Princess Leia, complete with real details of Leia's life as depicted in the Star Wars movies. \"Resistance leaders have officially confirmed the death of Gen. Leia Organa, hero of the Galactic Civil War, who died of heart-related complications on Tuesday. She was 60 years old,\" was the opening graph of an obit on Duffleblog.com , under the headline, \"Obituary: Gen. Leia Organa, Veteran of the Rebel Alliance.\" Such creative output reflects\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0fans' emotional investment in the movies and the characters, and their willingness to take the mythic-style stories very seriously. It also shows the power of\u00a0social media to\u00a0act as an outlet for their passions. \"Because of (Leia), galactic civilization doesn\u2019t consist of thousands of starving worlds, whose inhabitants gaze into skies swarming with Death Stars built from their stolen productivity,\" concludes an analytical obit by Malcolm Sheppard on his blog \u00a0MobUnited. \"The ideology of the Dark Side never rests, and it might return to reap capital from oppressed planets, but for now, many worlds enjoy a certain amount of peace and freedom.\" Debbie Reynolds and third husband Richard Hamlett at the Oscars in March 1985. \u00a0(Photo: AP) Reynolds' ex-husband speaks: Her third and final husband,\u00a0Richard Hamlett, a real estate developer in Roanoke, Va., is the only ex who survives (Eddie Fisher died in 2010, Harry Karl died in 1982) Reynolds. They married in 1984 and split up 12 years later in a bitter divorce. Hamlett told Roanoke TV station WSLS \u00a0he called Reynolds Wednesday to offer his condolences about Fisher and left a message. Just hours later he got word his ex-wife was rushed to the hospital. \u201cI thought, well, damn, she\u2019s not going to make it,\u201d said Hamlett. \u201cI said she\u2019s got a broken heart.\u201d They hadn\u2019t spoken since she bought out his stake in the Las Vegas hotel they opened during their marriage, but Hamlett had nothing but kind words to describe Reynolds, whom he'd met in Reno after she headlined a show. \u201cI\u2019d been in love with Debbie ever since I was in high school,\u201d he said. Carrie Fisher, left with mother Debbie Reynolds and brother Todd Fisher are featured in HBO's documentary film 'Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. \u00a0(Photo: Fisher Family Archives/Courtesy of HBO) HBO documentary moved up: By coincidence, HBO had planned to air a new documentary, Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, in March. Now, following their deaths, the film has been moved up to Jan. 7 (8 p.m. ET/PT), HBO announced Friday. The film, which had been received warmly at Cannes Film Festival, Telluride Film Festival and the New York Film Festival, is described as a story of complicated family love and \"an intimate portrait of Hollywood royalty in all its eccentricity,\" featuring\u00a0vintage family films from the Old Hollywood era. The film was directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens. Meanwhile, another cable TV channel, Turner Classic Movies, announced Friday it will celebrate Reynolds with a\u00a024-hour film tribute on Friday, Jan.\u00a027, with a dozen films featuring Reynolds.

    "text": "Your story When city retirement pays better than the job One in four El Monte residents lives in poverty. Yet taxpayers pay a steep price to fund bonus pensions and other perks for city workers. By Jack Dolan Dec. 30, 2016 El Monte has one of the heaviest public pension burdens of any California city. More than half its 116,000 residents were born outside the U.S., and one in four live in poverty. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) James Mussenden doesn\u2019t bring up his pension in casual conversation. No point getting his golf partners\u2019 blood boiling. This series is a partnership of The retired city manager of El Monte collects more than $216,000 a year, plus cost-of-living increases and fully paid health insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me an opportunity to do a number of things I didn\u2019t get to do when I was younger, like travel to Europe, take some things off my bucket list,\u201d Mussenden, 66, said recently. He even flew to Scotland to play the famed Old Course at St. Andrews, a mecca for golf enthusiasts. Mussenden recognizes that few Americans have pensions anymore \u2014 least of all the El Monte taxpayers who are funding his retirement. So while he enjoys his monthly retirement check, he\u2019s discreet about it. \u201cThe guys I play golf with, they get very angry about my pension because they don\u2019t have anything like it,\u201d he said. Actually, Mussenden has two pensions. He\u2019s part of a coterie of former El Monte civil servants who receive one taxpayer-funded pension through the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) \u2014 and a second through a \u201csupplemental\u201d plan approved by the city council in 2000. The extra pensions, along with other sweeteners granted to El Monte employees over the years, have created one of the heaviest public pension burdens of any city in California, a Los Angeles Times investigation found. ADVERTISEMENT El Monte\u2019s retirement costs totaled $16.5 million this year. That\u2019s equal to 28% of the city\u2019s general fund. Among California\u2019s 10 largest cities, only San Jose paid as much toward retirement costs relative to its general fund. Los Angeles spends 20% of its general fund on retirement costs. El Monte\u2019s outsize pension bill weighs heavily on the San Gabriel Valley city of 116,000, where half the residents were born outside the United States and a quarter live below the poverty line. The idea for the supplemental plan arose in 2000, after the city council granted El Monte police officers the right to retire with up to 90% of their highest salary guaranteed for life. The state and many other cities had approved similar benefits for public safety officers, part of a wave of pension enhancements adopted when pension funds were flush with cash from a stock market boom. But it created a gap between El Monte police and the city\u2019s non-uniformed employees: Under CalPERS rules, civilian pensions were capped at two-thirds of final salary. Then-City Manager Harold O. Johanson and other top administrators thought that was unfair, since they supervised the police department. So they pitched the city council on the supplemental plan. Resolution No. 8017, adopted unanimously by the El Monte City Council, established a \u201csupplemental retirement plan\u201d for civilian employees, on top of their existing pensions. It would boost civilians\u2019 retirement checks by 50% and put their pensions nearly on a par with police. The city council approved the idea in May 2000, unanimously and without public debate. Johanson retired three years later, at 58. Today, he is the top beneficiary of the program he championed, collecting a combined pension of more than $250,000 per year, state and city records show. That puts him in the top one-hundredth of one percent of all public pension recipients in California. In El Monte, a city in the San Gabriel Valley, a bonus pension approved by the City Council in 2000 generates a big bill for taxpayers. Here's how it works. Mussenden, who was city manager from 2006 to 2009, is not far behind. He is among El Monte\u2019s top five recipients of public pensions and one of at least eight who receive $200,000 or more a year. The city closed the supplemental plan to new employees in 2008 because of its high cost, and the legislature later prohibited such plans. But more than 200 active and retired El Monte workers who got in before the cutoff will enjoy the plan\u2019s benefits for life. Between his regular and bonus pensions, Johanson, 72, has received approximately $3 million since retiring. Asked if his service to the city was worth that much, he said, \u201cProbably not.\u201d \u201cI have to admit that we made the mistake back then, and I have to admit that I make too much money now, but what can I do?\u201d Johanson said in an interview, adding that he contributes time and money to local charities. \u201c I have to admit that I make too much money now, but what can I do? \u201d \u2014 Former El Monte City Manager Harold O. Johanson Share this quote Bonnie Jimenez, a former El Monte city councilwoman who voted for the plan in 2000, said in a recent interview that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d to learn how much Johanson is collecting. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t explained to us that we would be paying so much in the future, or that some people would be making more in retirement than when they were working,\u201d Jimenez said. Then-City Manager Harold O. Johanson signed a trust agreement with Union Bank to manage the assets of El Monte\u2019s supplemental pension plan. The plan was overseen by Public Agency Retirement Services of Newport Beach. \u201cGolden handshakes\u201d To fund public pensions, government agencies and their employees both kick in a percentage of every paycheck. CalPERS invests that money, and the returns are supposed to ensure that there is sufficient cash available to pay employees\u2019 pensions when they retire. El Monte has a history of generous employee benefits \u2014 including a four-day work week for civil servants, who put in 10 hours a day and have Fridays off. Liberal pension provisions are another part of that tradition. Under state law, police are supposed to contribute 9% of their paychecks toward their pensions, and civilian workers 7%. But El Monte covers the employee contribution as well as the employer share, a legacy of collective bargaining agreements dating to the early 1980s. On top of that, retired El Monte employees receive annual cost of living increases at the high end of what CalPERS allows: up to 4% for police retirees and 5% for civilians, depending on inflation. Most CalPERS pension recipients receive increases of 2% annually. Benefits that lavish do not come cheap: For every $100 the city paid a police officer in 2016, it had to pay an additional $71 to CalPERS to fund payments to current and future retirees. For every $100 the city paid a police officer in 2016, it had to pay an additional $71 to CalPERS to fund payments to current and future retirees. Share this That is the highest employer contribution rate among the more than 3,000 counties, cities, and local authorities that participate in the state retirement system. The average rate for public safety agencies is 38% of officers\u2019 salaries, according to CalPERS. In 2000 and again in 2011, El Monte granted certain employees two years of extra service credit to encourage early retirements. The California legislature has since prohibited such incentives \u2014 sometimes called \u201cgolden handshakes\u201d \u2014 but past enhancements are baked into El Monte\u2019s pension costs for years to come. Because so many employees have been able to retire early on lucrative terms, El Monte has more than twice as many retirees drawing pensions as it does active employees, CalPERS documents show. Because so many employees have been able retire early on lucrative terms, El Monte has more than twice as many retirees drawing pensions as it does active employees. Share this \u201cThat is a huge disparity,\u201d said Randy Dziubek, senior actuary for CalPERS. \u201cMost agencies have many more active employees than retirees.\u201d Most of the taxpayers who are footing the bill for public pensions have no pensions themselves, and very little to fall back on. About a third of Americans between 55 and 64 have no retirement savings, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ADVERTISEMENT For those who work for private companies with 401k plans, the median employer contribution equals 3% of salary, according to Vanguard Investments. El Monte\u2019s pension sweeteners were approved over the years by the five-member city council, typically without debate or public controversy. Few residents of the working class city, which straddles the 10 Freeway, have the time or inclination to keep a close eye on city government. That means much of the public\u2019s business is \u201chidden in plain sight,\u201d said Mayor Andre Quintero, who was born and raised in El Monte by immigrant parents, attended UCLA law school and is now a prosecutor for the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cWe saw what corruption on steroids looked like in the City of Bell,\u201d Quintero said, referring to the L.A. County city that became a byword for excessive public salaries. \u201cBut it\u2019s not always as obvious as that. Sometimes it\u2019s more subtle. You don\u2019t pay people on the front end. You pay them on the back end.\u201d El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero says that pension sweeteners for public workers are a subtle form of corruption. \"You don\u2019t pay people on the front end,\" he said. \"You pay them on the back end.\" (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) \u201c We saw what corruption on steroids looked like in the City of Bell, but it\u2019s not always as obvious as that. Sometimes it\u2019s more subtle. You don\u2019t pay people on the front end. You pay them on the back end. \u201d \u2014 El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero Share this quote \u201cHe was outraged\u201d El Monte probably would have been driven into bankruptcy years ago by retirement costs, Quintero said, if not for a little-known facet of city finances: an extra levy on property taxes to pay for pensions. Approved in 1946, the line on the bill reads \u201cCity-El Monte,\u201d without further explanation. It\u2019s listed with other common property tax add-ons for schools and the municipal water district. It costs owners an extra 0.15% of the assessed value of their property. The owner of a $442,000 house \u2014 the median sales price in El Monte, according to zillow.com \u2014 pays $663 a year for city employees\u2019 pensions, on top of regular property taxes. The money goes into a special fund for pensions. Of 88 cities in Los Angeles County, El Monte is one of just 12 with pension surcharges. Former city manager Rene Bobadilla, who was born and raised in El Monte, said he hadn\u2019t noticed the surcharge on his tax bill until he went to work for the city in 2008. He remembers showing it to his father. \u201cWhen I told him it was for my pension, he was outraged,\u201d Bobadilla said. The levy generated $9.4 million last year, according to the city budget. That was not nearly enough to cover El Monte\u2019s pension costs. The city owed CalPERS $12.6 million, plus $2 million for the supplemental pensions and $1.9 million for retiree healthcare. What didn\u2019t come from the pension levy had to be paid from the city\u2019s general fund. The current city manager, Jesus Gomez, said the cost of retirement benefits is at \u201cthe top of the list of things that keep me up at night.\u201d Jesus Gomez, the current El Monte city manager, says the city's pension obligations are at \u201cthe top of the list of things that keep me up at night.\u201d (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) \u201cAn extreme benefit\u201d El Monte\u2019s pension problem stems in part from decisions made in Sacramento in 1999, at the end of a decade-long bull market that tripled the value of the state\u2019s massive public pension fund. The CalPERS board of directors, dominated by public employee union leaders and their political allies, voted to spend the surplus lowering retirement ages and raising pensions for all state employees. The Great Recession arrived a few years later, wiping out CalPERS\u2019 stock market gains \u2014 but not before more than 200,000 civil servants became eligible to retire at 55, many with more than half their salaries guaranteed for life. The Pension Gap: Read the story California Highway Patrol officers got an especially sweet deal. Their pensions had been 2% of their highest salaries, multiplied by the number of years they worked. The percentage of peak salary was raised to 3%. That meant officers with 30 years of service could collect up to 90% of their highest pay for life. And they would be eligible to retire at 50. Police unions across the state demanded equal treatment. El Monte adopted the new pension formula (known as \u201c3% at 50\u201d) in 2000, and the effect was dramatic. Officers who retired before 2000 with more than 25 years of service collect $82,000 a year on average, according to CalPERS data. Those who retired after 2000 collect an average of $120,000. That list includes four former chiefs and a former captain, who retired in their 50s and now receive more than $200,000 a year each. El Monte Police Sgt. Jimmie Pitts said he had a business washing big rig diesel trucks before joining the department two decades ago. He changed careers at least in part for the financial stability, he said, but not specifically for the pension. Few people in their mid-twenties think that far ahead. \u201cIs retirement good here? Yes. Did I know it when I came here? Not necessarily,\u201d Pitts said. Pension benefits for El Monte police officers were significantly improved in 2000, widening the gap with civilian employees. Then-City Manager Harold O. Johanson thought something should be done. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Art Saenz, president of El Monte\u2019s police union, admitted that he was a bit more calculating. When he was deciding where to apply for a job as a police officer 10 years ago, he compared departments and noticed that El Monte paid employees\u2019 share of the pension contribution, as well as the employer\u2019s. \u201cI always looked at it as an extreme benefit, and that\u2019s what drew me to actually work here,\u201d said Saenz, a detective. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the city managers were thinking.\u201d \u201cWe could afford it\u201d Johanson, who began working for El Monte as a planning intern in 1967, was city manager in 2000 when the council approved \u201c3% at 50\u201d for police officers. He and his fellow top administrators were eligible for 2% at 55 under CalPERS rules. They thought there shouldn\u2019t be \u201csuch a large gap between the people who supervise the police department and the officers,\u201d Johanson recalled in a recent interview. A private firm, Public Agency Retirement Services (PARS) in Newport Beach, was pitching supplemental pension plans that would allow local officials to augment their already generous CalPERS benefits.

Johanson said he\u2019s not sure whether he reached out to PARS or vice versa. But he recalled that the company, which designs and administers public pension plans, \u201chad some pretty good salesmen.\u201d Johanson brought the idea to city council members, who approved by a 5-0 vote. The plan covered most of the city\u2019s non-uniformed employees and provided bonus pensions equal to 1% of their final salaries, multiplied by their years of service. Combined with their CalPERS benefits, they receive \u201c3% at 55\u201d \u2014 not quite as generous as police pensions, which kick in as early as age 50, but close. The city makes regular contributions to the PARS plan, just as it does to CalPERS, and the money is invested. In return, the city pays PARS a monthly charge \u2014 now more than $6,000 \u2014 plus a fee equal to about 1% of the pension assets under its management every year. Employees make no contribution toward their bonus pensions; city taxpayers bear the entire burden. ",

A woman comforts the wife of a man who died in a shooting that left four dead and 12 others wounded at a home on 2900 block of South Rimpau Boulevard in West Adams. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Maya Lau and Maya Lau Contact Reporters Violent crime increased in Los Angeles for the third straight year as police tried to stem a rash of homicides and gang-related shootings while dealing with a growing homeless population. With more than 290 people killed in the city this year, homicides also rose for the third year in a row. Still, the city remains far safer than a decade ago, when 480 people were killed and there were 46% more robberies than this year. According to statistics from the Los Angeles Police Department , robberies were up by 13%, aggravated assaults were up by 10% and rapes were down by 4% through Dec. 17, compared with  last year. Homicides were up by 5%. Overall, violent crime was up by 10% over last year and 38% over two years ago. Property crime also went up for the third consecutive year, with a 4% rise that was driven by double-digit increases in car-related thefts. The upward trend of the last several years marks a reversal of a steady decline that began in the early 1990s , when crime was at all-time highs. In 1992, 1,094 people were killed\u00a0in Los Angeles. Similar trends were evident in the areas policed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, where violent crime was up by 9% and property crime was up by 6% through Nov. 30 . It was the second year in a row that crime increased in sheriff\u2019s department territory, which includes unincorporated parts of the county as well as cities such as Compton and Lancaster that contract for law enforcement services.\u00a0 Elsewhere in the state, crime decreased in some Bay Area cities. San Francisco saw an increase in homicides and rapes, but robberies were down 13% and crime was down 10% overall through the end of November. Through Dec. 18, Oakland had two homicides, compared with nine in 2015 and seven in 2014. Overall, crime in Oakland was down 6%. Early this year, in response to a spike in homicides and shootings, the LAPD sent extraelite Metropolitan Division officers to South Los Angeles and intensified its use of daily crime statistics to identify problem spots. By the time the emergency operation ended on Oct. 1, the rate of violent crime had stabilized in South L.A. But with resources concentrated there, some other parts of the city experienced upticks in crime. Recently, the situation in South L.A. worsened \u2014 October was the worst month of the year for homicides \u2014 and Metro has increased its presence there again, said\u00a0Asst. Chief Michel Moore, who oversees the LAPD\u2019s patrol operations. South Bureau, which includes much of South L.A. as well as the San Pedro area, finished the year with a 6% increase in homicides , 6% more rapes, 10% more robberies and 19% more aggravated assaults. Overall, violent crime in South Bureau was up 15% over last year and 34% over two years ago. The efforts of police officers on the streets have had an effect, but the root causes of crime \u2013 joblessness, homelessness, substance abuse \u2013 are deep and require the community\u2019s help to solve, Moore said. \u201cIt is like fighting fires \u2013 spot fires,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a finite number of resources, and at the end of the day, the LAPD isn\u2019t going to fix this.\u201d The number of shooting victims in Los Angeles \u2013 1,152 as of Dec. 17 -- was up 6% over last year and 23% over two years ago. \u201cAny one of those could have been a homicide by another inch or centimeter,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOur most pressing matter right now is shooting victims.\u201d Crime was up even in some parts of the city that are traditionally considered safe. In West Los Angeles , robberies were up by 16%, and motor vehicle theft was up by 31%. The LAPD\u2019s Topanga Division saw a 41% increase in robberies and a 21% increase in motor vehicle theft. Moore attributed the crime jump in Los Angeles to a combination of factors, including a resurgence in gang violence and the growth in homelessness. He also pointed to criminal justice reforms such as Proposition 47, which was approved by California voters in November 2014 and reduced some drug and property offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. In Los Angeles County, the jail population has decreased, from 18,500 inmates just before Prop. 47 passed to about 16,500 inmates this November. Narcotics arrests have dropped, as busy police officers decide that the time needed to process a case is not worth it. The result, some law enforcement officials say, is that more criminals are now on the streets instead of in jail and are not receiving the drug and mental health treatment the measure had promised. Without the threat of a felony prosecution, they say, defendants are less likely to choose treatment as an alternative to serving time. \u201cUnfortunately, we see that these programs are sold to the voters as having some positive impact, and so far in two years we haven\u2019t seen that positive impact,\u201d said Assistant Sheriff Jacques \u201cAnthony\u201d La Berge, who oversees patrol for the Sheriff\u2019s Department. But supporters of Prop. 47 dispute the theory that crime increases are connected to the measure. Misdemeanors can still result in sentences of up to a year in jail, and it is up to police officers and prosecutors to enforce those penalties, said Michael Romano, a lecturer at Stanford Law School. \u201cThe idea that Prop. 47 has been responsible for an increase in crime in California over the past year or two is fake news, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one shred of evidence supporting the idea that Prop. 47 has had any impact on crime one way or another.\u201d The recent crime increases have also coincided with steep increases in homelessness. The latest homeless survey shows an 11% rise in the city of Los Angeles between January 2016 and the previous year, with a 5.7% jump countywide. Homeless encampments can provide cover for chronic predators, and many homeless people are victims of crime, said Moore of the LAPD. This year in Los Angeles, 13 homicide victims were homeless \u2013 up from six the previous year \u2013 and there was a 23% increase in aggravated assaults in which transients were the victims, Moore said. The LAPD\u2019s Central Division , which includes parts of downtown, skid row and Chinatown, saw a 59% increase in violent crime in 2015. This year, violent crime was down by 5% in Central, which Moore attributed to inroads made by police officers and social workers in homeless camps. But crime statistics can sometimes obscure the realities of living in Los Angeles, where a single police station can serve dozens of square miles and hundreds of thousands of people. Brent Page said his neighborhood of early 20th century Spanish and English Tudor cottages near the Inglewood border defies the image of South L.A. as a dangerous place. At the neighborhood council meetings he leads, which are often attended by officers from the LAPD\u2019s 77th Division, residents typically complain about minor issues such as street vending and illegally parked cars. Page sees violent crime as largely confined to gang circles. \u201cA lot of people on these blocks know each other. They\u2019re like family,\u201d Page said of his neighborhood, Morningside Circle. \u201cI know what the crime stats might say, what the perception might say, but it\u2019s good to talk to people actually breathing and living in an area instead of going to the LAPD website and making generalizations.\u201d In Compton and nearby unincorporated areas, which are policed by the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, homicides were up by 61%, with 37 through the end of November this year compared with 23 last year. Most of the killings were gang-related, according to sheriff\u2019s officials, including that of a 1-year-old girl in her crib who was hit by a bullet likely meant for her father. The spike marks a return to the violence of years past: The Compton area had 32 homicides in 2014 and 40 homicides in 2013 . Capt. Michael Thatcher, who runs the Compton Sheriff\u2019s Station, said an increase in gang conflicts is a likely cause. \u201cI take it personally,\u201d Thatcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility. Every deputy that works in that station understands that that\u2019s something that\u2019s very troubling for us.\u201d \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

But while the number of deportations was greater than last year, it was a sharp decrease from 2014. Commenting on the statistics released Friday, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said his department remains focused on finding and deporting immigrants who pose a national security or public safety threat, those who have serious criminal records, and those who recently crossed the Mexican border. Of those deported, 58 percent had criminal convictions. This was little changed from the 59 percent recorded last year and 56 percent in 2014. President-elect Donald Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, promising to deport millions of people living in the country illegally. 0 Shares ",

State prosecutors had asked the state Supreme Court to reinstate the 2002 murder conviction against Skakel in the bludgeoning death of Martha Moxley when they were teenage neighbors in wealthy Greenwich. \u00a0It wasn't immediately clear if Skakel will be sent back to prison or allowed to remain free if he appeals or asks the high court to reconsider. His lawyer, Hubert Santos, said he was reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment. Connecticut's highest court heard arguments in February on whether Skakel should get a new trial or be sent back to prison for the murder, which took place in 1975. Skakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, was freed on $1.2 million bail in 2013 when a lower court judge ordered a new trial after finding that Skakel's trial attorney failed to adequately represent him. He had been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Skakel, 55, was seated in the gallery of the courtroom for the hearing, as was his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Judge Thomas Bishop ruled that Skakel likely would have been acquitted if his trial lawyer, Michael Sherman, had focused more on his brother Thomas Skakel. Sherman has defended his work on the case. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Assistant Chief Michael LaSalle of Boca Raton Fire Rescue tells local media the man was diving in about 100 feet of water when he was stung Thursday, felt tingling in his upper body and surfaced. He says the man in his mid 50s was brought dockside and flown to St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach because it has a hyperbaric chamber especially used to treat injured divers.

This time, it's for a national audience. And the former police superintendent again doesn't hold back, telling CBS's \"60 Minutes\" that the city's police are in a \"crisis.\" Due to be broadcast Sunday, the \"60 Minutes\" segment repeats a narrative that has been repeatedly told locally since Mayor Rahm Emanuel in October 2015 said cops had gone \"fetal\" in the face of protests about police violence. It focuses on the 80 percent decline in street stops by police and fall in arrests this year, even as the homicide rate soars to more than 750 people killed \u2014 a drum McCarthy has been banging for weeks in a series of speeches and interviews. \"When you have activity falling off the way it is and crime skyrocketing, that's a huge problem,\" McCarthy told reporter Bill Whitaker in a preview released by CBS. When Whittaker suggested that there was a policing crisis, McCarthy responded, \"When people are dying, yes, there's crisis. No two ways about it.\" \"The police activity is horrific. Honestly. And there, and there's not an excuse that could be made in my book,\" he said. \"The noncompliance of the law is becoming legitimized. And the police are on their heels. ... We're reaching a state of lawlessness,\" McCarthy said. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson , who may or may not be tiring of answering the barbs of his predecessor while facing an ongoing federal probe of his department, allowed that his officers have been more \"cautious.\" He also was interviewed for the \"60 Minutes\" piece. \"Well, you know, there may be some\" officers who are more reluctant to police aggressively, Johnson told Whitaker. But he disputed the link between the crime rate and the dropoff in stops and arrests, blaming stricter policies and increased paperwork for the decline in stops. \"It's not what the police officers are not doing,\" Johnson said. \"It's more about what these \u2026 criminal offenders are doing.\" ",

Cooper is seen here with his wife, Kristin, at an election night rally in Raleigh. Gerry Broome/AP A North Carolina judge is temporarily blocking a law that would have limited the power of the state's incoming governor. Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper defeated incumbent Republican Pat McCrory in November in a tight race. After the election, the Republican controlled Legislature passed two laws to limit the governor's power, in what Democrats called a \"power grab.\" The law put on hold Friday would, as we reported earlier this month , remove the State Board of Elections from the governor's control by reducing the number of members on the board from five \u2014 three of whom could be from the governor's party \u2014 to four members, evenly split between the parties. N.C. Republicans Move To Limit Powers Of Incoming Democratic Governor The Associated Press reports that law is now on hold: \"Wake County Superior Court Judge Don Stephens ruled Friday that the risk to free and fair elections justified stopping the law from taking effect this weekend until it could be reviewed more closely. Stephens plans to review the law Thursday.\" The AP reports that Cooper filed the lawsuit earlier on Friday \u2014 and got the temporary reprieve just days before he is set to take office. Cooper's term begins on Sunday. Meanwhile, a second law, passed two weeks ago, also puts a check on the incoming governor's power . It would require Cooper's Cabinet secretaries to receive Senate confirmation, significantly reduce the number of administrative positions in the executive branch, strip the governor of his right to appoint trustees to the University of North Carolina and take away some of the governor's power to oversee schools in the state. Republicans still hold large majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature. Article continues after sponsorship ",

Grace Hood/Colorado Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Grace Hood/Colorado Public Radio Beverly Kurtz and Tim Guenthner live near Gross Reservoir outside Boulder, Colo. They oppose a an expansion project that would raise the reservoir's dam by 131 feet. Grace Hood/Colorado Public Radio The Colorado River is like a giant bank account for seven different states. Now it's running short. For decades, the river has fed growing cities from Denver to Los Angeles. A lot of the produce in supermarkets across the country was grown with Colorado River water. But with climate change, and severe drought, the river is reaching a crisis point, and communities at each end of it are reacting very differently. Just outside Boulder, Colo., surrounded by an evergreen forest, is Gross Reservoir. Beverly Kurtz and Tim Guenthner live just out of eyesight from the giant man-made dam. And that's on purpose. \"I could have built a house that overlooked the reservoir,\" Kurtz says. But, she says, \"It's choking off a wild river, which in my opinion is never a good thing.\" Kurtz and Guenthner have a newfound job in retirement: fighting a proposed expansion to Gross Reservoir's dam. The utility that owns it, Denver Water, wants to raise the concrete dam 131 feet. \"It doesn't make any sense to build a multimillion-dollar dam and disrupt the environment here when down the line, that's not going to solve the problem,\" Kurtz says. Article continues after sponsorship In Colorado, Farmers and Cities Battle Over Water Rights The problem is that Colorado's population will nearly double by 2050. Future residents will need more water. Denver Water CEO Jim Lochhead says more storage is part of the solution. It's also an insurance policy against future drought. \"From Denver Water's perspective, if we can't provide clean, reliable, sustainable water 100 years from now to our customers, we're not doing our job,\" Lochhead says. Demand for Colorado River water is already stretched thin. So it may sound crazy that places like Colorado and Wyoming want to develop more water projects. Legally, that's something they are entitled to do. Wyoming is studying whether to store more water from a Colorado River tributary. \"We feel we have some room to grow, but we understand that growth comes with risk,\" says Pat Tyrrell, who oversees Wyoming's water rights. Risk because in 10 or 20 years there may not be enough water to fill up expanded reservoirs. A 16-year drought has dramatically decreased water supply even as demand keeps growing. And climate change could make this picture worse. Capturing The Complexities Of The Colorado River It makes Tyrrell's job feel impossible. \"You understand the reality today of a low water supply,\" he says. \"You also know that you're going to have permit applications coming in to develop more water. What do you do?\" Tyrrell says that as long as water is available, Wyoming will very likely keep finding new ways to store it. But a future with less water is coming. In California, that future of cutbacks has already arrived. The water that started in Colorado flows more than 1,000 miles to greater Los Angeles. So even in the sixth year of California's drought, some lawns are still green. California's Imperial Valley produces around two-thirds of the country's vegetables in the winter, with water from the Colorado River. Lauren Sommer/KQED hide caption toggle caption Lauren Sommer/KQED California's Imperial Valley produces around two-thirds of the country's vegetables in the winter, with water from the Colorado River. Lauren Sommer/KQED \"Slowly but surely, the entire supply on Colorado River has become less reliable,\" says Jeffrey Kightlinger, who manages the Metropolitan Water District in Southern California. He notes that the water level in Lake Mead, the biggest reservoir on the river, has been plummeting. An official shortage could be declared next winter. \"And that'll be a historic moment,\" Kightlinger says. It's never happened before. Arizona and Nevada would be forced to cut back on how much water they draw from the river. California would be spared that fate, because it has senior water rights. So you wouldn't expect to hear what Kightlinger says next. \"We are having voluntary discussions with Arizona and Nevada about what we would do proactively to help,\" he says. How A Historical Blunder Helped Create The Water Crisis In The West California could help by giving up water before it has to, between 5 percent and 8 percent of its supply. Kightlinger isn't offering this out of the goodness of his heart; if Lake Mead drops too low, the federal government could step in and reallocate all the water, including California's. \"We all realize if we model the future and we build in climate change, we could be in a world of hurt if we do nothing,\" Kightlinger says. This idea of cooperation is somewhat revolutionary after years of lawsuits and bad blood. Recently, farmer Steve Benson was checking on one of his alfalfa fields near the Mexican border. \"We know there's a target on our back in the Imperial Valley for the amount of water we use,\" he says. This valley produces two-thirds of the country's vegetables in the winter \u2014 with water from the Colorado River. In fact, for decades, California used more than its legal share of the river and had to cut back in 2003. This area, the Imperial Irrigation District, took the painful step of transferring some of its water to cities like San Diego. Why The Colorado River Stopped Flowing Bruce Kuhn voted on that water transfer as a board member of the district. \"It was the single hardest decision I have ever made in my life,\" he says. Kuhn ended up casting the deciding vote to share water, which meant some farmers have had to fallow their land. \"It cost me some friends,\" he says. \"I mean, we still talk but it isn't the same.\" Soon, Kuhn may have to make another painful decision about whether California should give up water to Arizona and Nevada. With an emergency shortage looming, Kuhn may have no choice. Grace Hood is a reporter with Colorado Public Radio. Lauren Sommer reports for KQED. ",

Russian President Vladimir Putin says he will not expel U.S. diplomats in response to Obama's sanctions on Russia over hacking during the campaig... Investigators say a hacking unit known as APT28 targeted Democratic Party officials by sending malicious emails last spring that tricked recipients into changing their passwords, CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports. U.S. intelligence officials believe that hack likely gave Russian operatives access to the information of senior Democratic Party officials, which was then leaked to the press and publicly disclosed. The U.S. said the two Cold War-era estates were being used for intelligence activities. President-elect Donald Trump says \"we ought to get on with our lives,\" rather than focus on Russian hacking and sanctions. This week he also had ... About a half-hour before the noon deadline, caravans of diplomatic vehicles, some carrying boxes, left both Russian compounds under the watch of U.S. State Department agents. The 45-acre Maryland retreat boasts a brick mansion along the Corsica River in the bucolic Eastern Shore region. Reports indicate it was bought by the Soviet Union in 1972 and served as a getaway for its diplomats in nearby Washington. In New York, Russian diplomatic staff members were evicted from a mansion on Long Island\u2019s Gold Coast. The estate, once called Elmcroft, is in the town of Oyster Bay and was purchased by the Soviets in 1952. A Russian compound, which was ordered to be closed and vacated, is seen in Upper Brookville, Long Island,  New York, on Dec. 30, 2016. Reuters/Rashid Umar Abbasi Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters at U.N. headquarters that the Obama administration was destroying holiday fun for the children of Russian diplomats. After President Obama imposed santions on Russia for hacking during the campaign, Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a \"provocation.\" New... \u201cI think it\u2019s quite scandalous that they chose to throw out our kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know full well that those two facilities they mentioned, they are vacation facilities for our kids and this is Christmas, and this is vacation time for our schools. This is the time when the kids go to those facilities. So to close our access to them just while those holidays were starting, to me was rather silly.\u201d President Obama announced the step Thursday as part of a raft of sanctions that included the expulsion of 35 Russians who the U.S. said were spies operating under diplomatic cover. President Vladimir Putin castigated the U.S. on Friday, but said no U.S. diplomats will be ousted in reprisal for Mr. Obama\u2019s moves. The decision came as a surprise; tit-for-tat expulsions are common diplomatic practice and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had suggested hours before Putin\u2019s announcement that Russia would oust 31 American diplomats. On Thursday, people who identified themselves as State Department employees asked reporters to leave when they approached the Maryland property. A dock is seen at a recreational compound owned by the Russian government near Centreville, Maryland, on Dec. 29, 2016. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \u201cWe coexist with these people peacefully,\u201d said Alison Davis, who lives nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s basically their summer cottage, but we see the diplomat tags driving here all the time, very friendly. We see them biking, say hello.\u201d Still, she said, local residents don\u2019t \u201creally have any interactions with them. They kind of keep to themselves.\u201d She said the compound has a private beach and was typically used for a sailing regatta during the end-of-summer Labor Day weekend. An Associated Press story from 1992 about the sprawling property said at the time that the brick mansion had been converted into 12 apartments and a dozen cottages, each with four apartments. In total, the compound can accommodate 40 families at a time, according to that report. That report also said that the property then boasted four lighted tennis courts, a swimming pool and a soccer field and that a camp was held there for Russian children during the summer and for two weeks each Christmas. Russia maintains two weekend retreats for its U.N. diplomats about an hour\u2019s drive outside New York City, where the United Nations has its high-rise headquarters. One of them, Elmcroft, was built on a part of Long Island made famous in F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s 1925 novel \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Its main house originally had 27 rooms and 11 baths and was constructed for an executive at a Brooklyn company that made heavy machinery and torpedoes. Later it became the home of a former New York governor, Nathan Miller. Satellite photography shows that the grounds today include a tennis court, gardens, a soccer field and another large, modern building. \u201cThey\u2019ve been quiet neighbors,\u201d said Elliot Conway, mayor of Upper Brookville, the village in Oyster Bay where the estate is situated. A short drive away, Russian diplomats stay at another grand Gold Coast estate, the Killenworth mansion, not far from the city of Glen Cove. It, too, was bought during the Cold War. Glen Cove Mayor Reggie Spinello said Friday that Killenworth was not being closed down by the government. Both Long Island properties were the subject of long-running property-tax battles between the Russian government and local officials. Those disputes have since been resolved, and for years Oyster Bay has waived parking and beach fees for Russia\u2019s U.N. diplomats as a goodwill gesture. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
