The state's Emergency Commission voted Wednesday to borrow the funds from the state-owned Bank of North Dakota. The commission is headed by Gov. Jack Dalrymple. The group earlier approved $10 million in emergency spending. Officials say the new loan should cover the state's cost of policing protests over the $3.8 billion pipeline through December. Dalrymple says requests for reimbursement from the federal government have been unsuccessful. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says it made an offer to reimburse the state for policing costs. Dalrymple says he is not aware of an offer and it's unclear whether the state could legally accept it. 0 Shares ",

Kanye West at the 2016 Met Gala in New York City.

It\u2019s unclear whether West was going to one of his homes or another location, the source said. Little is known about his hospitalization. It took two hours for authorities and friends to persuade West to go to a hospital after receiving a call that the rapper was acting erratically  last week at the residence of his personal trainer, two sources involved in the case\u00a0said.

The source said it was a physical altercation but did not provide details. Authorities talked with West for some time, hoping he would voluntarily seek medical attention. He eventually did, and was taken by paramedics to UCLA Medical Center, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

    "text": "Supreme Court Tests Whether Detained Immigrants Have Right To Hearing Supreme Court Tests Whether Detained Immigrants Have Right To Hearing Embed Embed The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday about whether immigrants can be detained indefinitely without a chance to persuade a neutral judge that they are entitled to temporary release. Pool/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Pool/Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday about whether immigrants can be detained indefinitely without a chance to persuade a neutral judge that they are entitled to temporary release. Pool/Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court appeared closely divided Wednesday as it tried to figure out whether immigrants can be detained indefinitely without a chance to persuade a neutral judge that they are entitled to temporary release. The people who brought the case are a special subset of immigrants, who number 6,000 to 8,000 on any given day. They are long-term residents of the U.S., whose legal status was revoked after they committed a crime, often a relatively minor crime such as possession of a drug or petty theft. Or some are asylum seekers who claim a credible fear of persecution in their home countries. Ultimately, these asylum seekers win legal status here 70 percent of the time. The long-term permanent residents prevail 40 percent of the time. But their cases take a long time, on average 13 months, during which they live in prison-like conditions and have no chance to ask a judge to be released. Article continues after sponsorship Supreme Court To Consider How Long Immigrants May Be Detained Without Bond Hearing \"We're not talking about the rules for how long you can detain someone; we're talking about how long you can detain somebody without a hearing,\" said Ahilan Arulanantham, the lawyer representing the detainees. A federal appeals court in San Francisco agreed. It ruled that after six months behind bars, these detainees are entitled to a hearing to determine if they are a safety or flight risk. If not, the appeals court held, the immigrants can be temporarily released by posting a money bond, or by agreeing to electronic monitoring, or both. The Obama administration appealed that court's ruling to the Supreme Court. Inside the high court chamber Wednesday, the three most conservative justices appeared to have little sympathy for the immigrants' position. A fourth conservative, Justice Anthony Kennedy, seemed only marginally more supportive. The four liberal justices were a bit more concerned about the constitutional problems of long-term detention without a hearing. But all the justices wrestled with multiple, and sometimes conflicting, statutory provisions, and the argument splayed out into something of a mess. Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn told the Court that the reason deportations take so long is that federal law allows detained immigrants to submit evidence proving they are entitled to stay here legally. As long as the government is diligently pursuing a determination on an immigrant's status, he said, there should be no time limit, though he conceded that 20 years would be too long. Justice Elena Kagan interrupted: We would all say \"you can't just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness ... [or] flight risk.\" Why not \"set some guideposts\" for evaluating these cases after six or nine months, she continued, \"rather than having one suit pop up here... and another in another place,\" with everybody being treated \"differently\"? Lawyer Gershengorn responded that while the Court has the power to do that, it is unnecessary. He noted that 90 percent of the cases conclude after 19 months. Justice Sonia Sotomayor replied caustically, \"We are in an upended world when we think ...19 months is a reasonable time to detain a person.\" In response, Chief Justice Roberts proposed the government's suggestion for a \"safety valve\"\u2014namely that detainees could file a writ of habeas corpus, demanding a hearing on the reasons for their imprisonment. But Arulanantham, who was representing the detainees, rejected that idea, noting that most of the people in this class-action lawsuit do not have individual lawyers; they aren't familiar with the ins and outs of the American judicial system, and as a practical matter, he said, requiring such a legal action would \"close the courtroom door to them.\" Arulanantham told the justices that under other statutes accused terrorists get a bond hearing in six months. In contrast, he noted, legitimate asylum seekers escaping torture and persecution are detained on average for more than a year before getting a bond hearing. A decision in the case is expected by summer. ",

    "text": "After beating back rival for House leadership post, Nancy Pelosi says Democrats are ready for Trump House Democrats Hold Leadership Elections Mark Wilson / Getty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco speaks on Capitol Hill after winning the House Democratic leadership election. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco speaks on Capitol Hill after winning the House Democratic leadership election. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has done it again, fending off a rival to win another term as minority leader and\u00a0confirming her staying power as the party prepares to confront President-elect Donald Trump . The San Francisco Democrat has beaten back ouster attempts before. But this year\u2019s challenge by an Ohio Democrat\u00a0focused attention on Trump\u2019s success in attracting white, working-class voters in Rust Belt states, and whether that was a sign that Democrats needed changes at the top. Rep. Tim Ryan , whose Youngstown-area\u00a0district represents\u00a0the kind of blue-collar voters that fueled Trump\u2019s victory,\u00a0made a strong showing. Though he lost 134-63, it was a closer margin than previous rivals who have\u00a0aspired to replace Pelosi.\u00a0 The competition appears to have only emboldened Pelosi,\u00a0a tough-as-ever survivor who shows no signs of relinquishing her position as one of the most powerful Democrats in the country. \u00a0 Scope of Donald Trump's falsehoods unprecedented for presidential candidate \u00bb \u201cWe\u2019re at a time where it\u2019s well beyond politics,\u201d Pelosi said after the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s about the character of America and how we go forward ... to differentiate between us and the administration that will come into Washington in January.\u201d Republicans could not have been more pleased. One Republican walking to his office near the Democrats\u2019\u00a0closed-door meeting said he hoped Pelosi would win because he features her prominently in his TV campaign ads back home. With President Obama leaving the White House, Republicans are eager to continue focusing on Pelosi as a caricature of liberal Democrats out of touch with the rest of the country. The\u00a0House Republican campaign team unfurled a poster spoofing its support for her from their headquarters across from the Capitol. \u201cCongrats Nancy!\u201d it read Wednesday. However, even Pelosi\u2019s foes warn against underestimating the first woman to become House speaker, a position she has her sights set on reclaiming. Responding to the challenge, Pelosi proposed an expansion of her Democratic leadership team with more seats at the table for younger members and those from states Trump won. The move reflected a similar tact taken after the November election in the Senate by incoming Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, who added moderates from the Rust Belt\u00a0as well as progressives to his team. This is Bernie Sanders' plan to lead Democrats out of the wilderness \u00bb Ryan, 43, who picked up support from fellow Rust Belt lawmakers as well as those from the intermountain Western states of Arizona and Colorado, said he had succeeded in opening up the leadership ranks. \u201cWe\u2019re a family, and sometimes families have to have tough conversations,\u201d Ryan said after the vote, flanked by supporters. \u201cWe come out of here stronger than we went in. We\u2019re all going to participate in leading the party.\u201d While the changes appeared to soothe some rank-and-file lawmakers, others said Pelosi will need to do more to loosen her grip on power and allow more voices into\u00a0the decision-making process. Many lawmakers remain fearful of speaking out against Pelosi, who draws allies close but also keeps tabs on dissenters. The leadership changes will be considered by the caucus in the days ahead. \u201cFor her to have two-thirds support shows there\u2019s overwhelming\u00a0trust in her as a leader, but folks want to see new energy behind her and I think she\u2019s open-minded to that,\u201d said California Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin), who is among those younger members taking on new leadership duties. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.)\u00a0said she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the vote. \u201cThis should be a time of critical reflection and clear-eyed change, not a time to rubber stamp the failed strategy of the past.\u201d First elected to House leadership 15 years ago, Pelosi has faced calls for her ouster since Democrats lost the majority under her watch in 2010, during Obama\u2019s first term in office. The mother of five \u2014\u00a0and grandmother \u2014 also has endured questions about how much longer she will stay at the helm. \u00a0The 76-year-old typically swats back such inquiries\u00a0by pointedly noting the comparable ages of male colleagues in leadership roles elsewhere in the Capitol.\u00a0 Pelosi remains\u00a0a fundraising powerhouse, and despite interest by a deep bench of Democrats eager to take a turn at leadership, few have been able to make the case to their peers that they could match her drive.\u00a0 But this year, following Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2019s loss in the presidential election , Pelosi appeared to take her challenger seriously. She repeatedly worked to shore up support from liberals and minorities who make up the bulk of the Democratic caucus. She also pointed to the gains Democrats made under her watch, despite Clinton\u2019s defeat \u2014\u00a0the House picked up six seats in November. She warned that losses\u00a0could have been worse. Pelosi\u00a0foreshadowed a tough campaign season in 2018, the midterm elections when the party in the White House typically loses seats in Congress. \u201cWe know how to win elections,\u201d she said Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.\u201d For some, hers was a message that resonated. \u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t Nancy Pelosi,\u201d said Rep. Rick Nolan of Minnesota, who supported Clinton\u2019s rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, during the Democratic primary. \u201cThe problem was the top of the ticket.\u201d Pelosi had postponed the election to allow time for challenges and changes\u00a0but always predicted she would prevail with two-thirds of the vote. The rest of the leadership team also was reelected. Two Californians were vying for a down-ballot leadership spot, and Rep. Linda Sanchez of Whittier narrowly defeated Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland, 98-96. Democratic Rep.\u00a0 Adam B. Schiff \u00a0of Burbank, in nominating Pelosi during a closed-door meeting Wednesday, said, \u201cWe need the very best to lead us. \u2026 No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

Rifts usually form at an ice shelf\u2019s borders, where ice is thinner, Howat said. But the rifting in the Pine Island Glacier originated from the center, which implies that the ice shelf was already weakened at the center, likely by the\u00a0 warming ocean melting an ice crevasse \u00a0at the bedrock level, he explained. The bottom of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet also lies below sea level, which allows ocean water to intrude far inland and remain unseen, according to the researchers. This intrusion can create a\u00a0 \u201cvalley\u201d in the ice shelf \u00a0where ice thins. New valleys can be an outward sign of the ice melting at the bottom of the ice sheet. \u201cThe really troubling thing is that there are many of these valleys further up-glacier,\u201d Howat said. \u201cIf they are actually sites of weakness that are prone to rifting, we could potentially see more accelerated ice loss in Antarctica.\u201d Pine Island and other glaciers in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet \u2014 including Pine Island\u2019s nearby twin, the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 could undergo\u00a0 rapid retreat \u00a0and melting in warming oceans, the researchers said. The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers also block the ice flow of one of the most active ice streams on the continent. With continued melting of the glaciers, nearly 10 percent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could drain into the sea, according to researchers. \u201cWe need to understand exactly how these valleys and rifts form, and what they mean for ice-shelf stability,\u201d Howat said. \u201cWe\u2019re limited in what information we can get from space, so this will mean targeting air and field campaigns to collect more detailed observations.\u201d The study was published online Nov. 28 in the\u00a0 journal Geophysical Research Letters .

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times Every president in the past four decades, Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter noted, has taken personal holdings he had before being elected and put them into a blind trust in which the assets were controlled by an independent party. If Mr. Trump were willing to sell his assets, one option would be to seek a certificate of divestiture from the Office of Government Ethics, which would allow him to sell his real estate holdings and other businesses with an enormous tax advantage. This system was set up to allow wealthy Americans to take jobs in the government and avoid conflicts of interest without a large financial impact. It allows incoming government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on any earnings on the investment. This could generate an enormous windfall for Mr. Trump, given his vast real estate holdings. After Henry Paulson was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as Treasury secretary, he left a job at Goldman Sachs and took advantage of this provision , avoiding conflicts of interest by selling an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock. Money generated from the liquidation of Mr. Trump\u2019s assets would have to be invested in \u201cpermitted property,\u201d which is limited to Treasury bonds or diversified mutual funds, ending the real estate ventures that are so tied to the Trump family\u2019s identity. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, that is what the Office of Government Ethics has said he should do. The office is normally a staid, low-profile agency that rarely talks to reporters on the record, but Wednesday\u2019s Twitter posts were strangely enthusiastic. The series of nine posts suggested that officials were celebrating what they thought was a decision by Mr. Trump to accept their legal advice. In their posts, officials at the ethics agency referred to a 1983 legal opinion in which the office urged presidents to \u201cconduct themselves as if they were\u201d bound by conflict of interest laws, even though such laws do not apply to occupants of the Oval Office. . @realDonaldTrump this aligns with OGE opinion that POTUS should act as if 18 USC 208 applies. https://t.co/T6nNUPxFwp \u2014         U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) Nov. 30, 2016 In a statement, Seth Jaffe, an agency spokesman, said that officials there were \u201cexcited\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s announcements on conflicts of interest and that the messages were not based on any information about the president-elect\u2019s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. Asked later about the disclosure of the advice that the Office of Government Ethics had given to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, Mr. Jaffe said he could not provide additional comment. But the agency has left the posts on its official government account. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest List. Officials for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment about the disclosures from the agency. And Reince Priebus, who will be the White House chief of staff, said on the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he was not ready to provide any more information about the legal discussions. \u201cYou should know that he\u2019s got the best people in the world working on it,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. In fact, the president-elect\u2019s plan to deal with conflicts remains unclear. Simply removing Mr. Trump from day-to-day control of business decisions could still allow him to benefit financially from payments made to his companies by foreign governments, which may be prohibited by the so-called Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, Mr. Eisen said. And Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts said nothing about whether his children, who serve as advisers on his presidential transition committee, would continue to have roles in his administration. If Mr. Trump\u2019s business is run by his children, they must be entirely separated from government operations, Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter said. That means they could not participate in meetings with world leaders, like the prime minister of Japan, as Ivanka Trump did this month . Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWithout an ethics firewall that is set up at once and continues into the administration, scandal is sure to follow,\u201d Mr. Eisen and Mr. Painter said in their statement. Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately questioned on Wednesday whether Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts indicated a significant change in his plans, and called for a formal investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. A letter sent by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and signed by 15 other Democrats on the committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s posts raised \u201ca number of questions,\u201d including whether Mr. Trump intends to transfer ownership of his assets. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump emphasized the appearances he would need to maintain as president, saying he believed it was \u201cvisually important\u201d to avoid conflicts between his role as the head of government and his businesses. I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my ... \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 30, 2016 great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While I am not mandated to .... \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 30, 2016 do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 30, 2016 Mr. Trump insisted, as he has before, that he is not legally required to take any steps to divest himself of his financial ties. In an interview with The Times last week, he said, \u201cThe law is totally on my side, meaning the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest.\u201d He also said in the interview, \u201cI would like to try and formalize something, because I don\u2019t care about my business.\u201d Divesting could be costly and complicated. \u201cThat\u2019s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cSelling real estate isn\u2019t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different. It\u2019s in a much different world.\u201d ",

    "text": "CBS News November 30, 2016, 2:36 PM Authorities investigating OSU attacker's potential radical ties Abdul Razak Ali Artan. Email Last Updated Nov 30, 2016 4:48 PM EST COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The man who went on a rampage with a car and knife at Ohio State University earlier this week , injuring 11 people before he was shot dead by a campus police officer, may have been inspired by ISIS and al Qaeda, the FBI said during a news conference on Wednesday.\u00a0 Anwar al-Awlaki CBS FBI special agent in charge Angela Byers said Abdul Razak Ali Artan may have been inspired by al Qaeda-linked cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, Reuters reported. Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011.\u00a0 On Tuesday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. Reuters reported an ISIS news agency posted a photo of Artan wearing a blue shirt and sitting with greenery in the background. It described him as a soldier of the group, and added the caption: \u201cBrother Abdul Razak Ali Artan, God accept him, implementer of the Ohio attack, a student in his third year in university.\u201d Investigators have so far found no direct link between the terrorist organization and Artan. ISIS has previously taken claim for attacks that it had no planning nor part in. Sources previously told CBS News that Artan put an angry message on Facebook before the attack, saying: \u201cAmerica! Stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah. We are not weak.\u201d What investigators are discovering is a dramatic escalation in his statements online. Hallmark signs, law enforcement officials say, of someone radicalized -- and turning to action. Authorities now believe the student who carried out the attack at The Ohio State on Monday was inspired by ISIS. Former CIA covert operations off... Law enforcement sources said shortly before the attack, the suspect posted a message or messages on Facebook suggesting that he was disturbed by how Muslims were being treated, CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reported. Artan reportedly posted: \u201cI am sick and tired of seeing my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters being killed and tortured EVERYWHERE.\u201d Officials said Artan came to the U.S. with six family members in 2014 after fleeing Somalia and spending seven years in a refugee camp in Pakistan. CBS News has learned that Artan\u2019s father was abducted in Somalia in 2007 and that is why his family left the country to ultimately seek refugee status in 2012. The family came to the U.S. by flying into New York, then going through Dallas and on to Ohio where they settled. At least 10 people were injured in an attack on Ohio State University campus, according to officials; suspect in the attack is dead Artan first attended community college in Columbus where he graduated on the dean\u2019s list. Last August he became a student at Ohio State University where he was interviewed by the campus paper, The Lantern. He complained about what he believed was the media\u2019s negative portrayal of Muslims. \u00a0 \u201cI wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media...if people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to think, what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s the media that put that picture in their heads so they\u2019re just going to have it and it, it\u2019s going to make them feel uncomfortable.\u201d CBS News has learned that Artan was in the D.C. metropolitan area last week. FBI investigators are trying to piece together what he was doing there. Authorities said he visited a Home Depot style store while in the D.C. area.\u00a0 Home Depot said that they couldn\u2019t share details about anything and didn\u2019t want to inadvertently interfere with the investigation. A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milion that Artan was was at the Home Depot in D.C. but could not confirm that he purchased a knife at \u00a0the time. Investigators discovered he was in the D.C. area through bank records. The source said that Artan dropped his sister off at high school and then went to Walmart in Columbus where he purchased the knife used in the attack. One of Artan\u2019s victims, Iraq war veteran and OSU senior Anderson Payne told CBS News that he was trying to help car crash victims when he was slashed.\u00a0 \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Payne told CBS News\u2019 Dean Reynolds. \u201cHe looked very angry he had just wrecked his car which is normal to be mad. But when he started swinging his knife, I knew it wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d A senior U.S. official told CBS News that while they believe that Artan was inspired by radical terrorists, they are still compiling a list of people he may have been contacting. It\u2019s unclear if federal officials have been able to access Artan\u2019s digital devices, but they do have a list of people he was possibly in contact with and are setting up interviews.\u00a0 Also Thursday, officials released 911 calls made during the attack. The 911 calls describe panic and confusion on the campus.\u00a0 \u201cYeah I\u2019m on the Ohio State campus, I think there\u2019s been some type of terrorist attack uh\u2026\u201d a male voice says in one of the 911 calls. \u201cBecause a guy ran a car through a crowd of students!\u00a0 He did it purposely.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a man who drove a car through a group of people, he hit an OSU employee, he drove it in to a crowd of people, the car is now sitting in front of the building, the man got out of the car and took off running \u2013 I just need an ambulance here right now!\u201d another male can be heard saying on one of the calls. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Got it By Kevin Stankiewicz November 30 at 11:56 AM Abdul Razak Ali Artan was shot and killed after an attack on the Ohio State University campus in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday. He is shown in this photograph from Aug. 23 \u2014 the first day of classes \u2014 from the Lantern student newspaper. (Kevin Stankiewicz via the Lantern) Abdul Razak Ali Artan was sitting alone at a red table outside Mendenhall Lab when I met him. It was a little before 6 p.m. on Aug. 23, the first day of classes for the semester at Ohio State, and he was the first person I came across as I headed onto campus that evening. That he was alone was primarily why I approached. I was on assignment for the Lantern, looking for students for a new feature in the student newspaper called \u201cHumans of Ohio State.\u201d Several paragraphs and a photo profiling members of the campus community, introducing readers to different perspectives. I wanted to find someone who had a moment to talk that day; Artan would be the first such profile. I found a thoughtful, engaged guy, a Muslim immigrant who wanted to spread understanding and awareness while expressing muted fears that U.S. society was becoming insular and fostering unfair stereotypes of his people. He was measured and intellectual, not angry or violent. [ Islamic State says Ohio State attacker was its \u2018soldier,\u2019 school seeks unity as classes resume ] When I introduced myself, Artan initially seemed surprised. It was his actual first day of classes at Ohio State, as he had just transferred to one of the largest college campuses in the country from a community college nearby. But he opened up quickly. He was soft-spoken, in a slightly accented voice, and friendly. 1 of 24 What the Ohio State University campus looks like after assaults View Photos Several people have been hospitalized after they were attacked by a student at the university on Monday.

Nov. 29, 2016 Students walk by Watts Hall as they return to classes following the attack. John Minchillo/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. In a 20-minute, wide-ranging conversation, Artan told me about his major in logistics management. He told me about his family fleeing Somalia when he was about 10 years old \u2014 including fuzzy memories of his native, war-torn land \u2014 and then about living for years in Pakistan and how much he enjoyed it. He bemoaned what he felt were western misconceptions about Pakistan: \u201cIt\u2019s not like people believe.\u201d He told me about his family\u2019s journey once they got to the United States just a few years earlier, first spending some time in Dallas before coming to Columbus, which has a large and vibrant Somali expat community. Artan spoke calmly but seriously about his acute awareness of what he saw as major American misconceptions about Islam, his religion. From memory, he ticked off examples of Islamophobia that garnered media attention, such as the police being summoned because a man in Avon, Ohio, was speaking Arabic in a parking lot or when a college student was removed from a plane after he said \u201cInshallah\u201d in a phone conversation with his uncle. [ For Muslims at Ohio State, unease and fears of a backlash after terrifying attack ] He told me, in great detail, about the biggest struggle of his first day on campus: finding a place to pray. That became the central element of the feature in the Lantern, something that felt both important and relevant, enlightening and humanizing, the whole point of our new feature. \u201cThis place is huge, and I don\u2019t even know where to pray,\u201d Artan told me. \u201cI wanted to pray in the open, but I was scared with everything going on in the media.\u201d His tenor remained the same, but it was clear those examples saddened Artan and likely contributed to his fear to pray openly. He even told me the possibility of being shot if he prayed had crossed his mind. At the time, in the final stretch of a divisive presidential campaign, he spoke of his fears of then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward Muslims, what it might mean for immigrants and refugees, what it might mean for those, like him, who practice Islam openly. How ignorance about Islam propels bigotry and hatred. [ Trump says Ohio State attacker should not have been in the country ] Abdul Razak Ali Artan allegedly ran down Ohio State University professor William Clark with his car Nov. 28, before stabbing others. At a news conference the next day, Clark refused to condemn Artan, saying he was waiting for more information to pass \"judgment.\" (Reuters) He said it is so important to travel and see different parts of the world, as he had. That if everyone could see the world with their own eyes, they\u2019d be so much more informed and have less prejudice toward people who are different than they are. As the start time of his class neared, I thanked him for his time, made sure the few photographs I took earlier were in focus, and walked home. It was a deep conversation to begin the weekly series. I remember thinking that it would be unlikely I would find a more meaningful personal story this semester. I went home, transcribed the interview, sent the caption and photo to my editor. It ran in print two days later. There is nothing I heard from Artan that day that would have ever made me think he could be responsible for the brutal, senseless attack that would come just three months later. Nothing to indicate his thoughtful frustrations and fears would lead him to drive a car into a crowd of people on campus, that he would lash out with a knife at students and faculty, that he would make national news for what many believe was a terrorist attack. That he would be dead, shot by a police officer trying to prevent him from killing others. Aerial view of the Ohio State University campus. (Jo McCulty/The Ohio State University) I was out at the scene of Artan\u2019s attack near Watts Hall on Monday morning reporting with colleagues when we began working to see if we could confirm the suspect\u2019s identity. I thought about Artan and his story a few times since late August, but nothing prepared me for the Monday phone call I received at 1:31 p.m. It was one of my journalism professors, and mentor, Nicole Kraft. She called to tell me that reports of the attacker\u2019s identity had surfaced from media reports; it was Artan. My heart sank; that thoughtful, engaged student I had met on the first day of classes had snapped. He had tried to kill people. I wished the whole day was a dream in the first place; I wished a gray Honda sedan never drove over a curb, struck a group of people, before being lunged at with a knife; I wished the sirens I heard on my walk to class were phantom. And then I wished \u2014 like I\u2019ve never wished before \u2014 that the assailant was not Artan. A lot of people have asked me if I regret, or wanted to rethink, what I published on Artan in August. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what was in his heart when we spoke and exactly how, when or why that morphed into violence. The goal of the \u201cHumans of Ohio State\u201d project was to share stories about the people who make up the Ohio State community, from all walks of life. On Aug. 23, Artan told me part of his story, one that I still believe is important on so many levels. But what he said about his wishes for open-mindedness and unity make little sense now given what happened on Monday, the terror he inflicted. His comments to me about his fears of a nation divided by hate and lack of understanding are now chilling, and what happened Monday has shaken me, as it has much of the Ohio State community.

Sherri Papini, a 34-year-old mother of two from Redding, was found bound along Interstate 5 in Yolo County at around 4:30 a.m. Thanksgiving Day, more than three weeks after she was abducted on Nov. 2, authorities said. Papini was kept isolated by her captors, described as two Hispanic women who were armed with a handgun and frequently wore masks, Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko told reporters. At one point Papini was branded by the suspects, but Bosenko wouldn't describe if a message was branded on to her or where. \"The interviews were very intense, for both the investigators and for Sherri, with her having to relive this traumatic event,\" Bosenko said, of the interviews with detectives, which took place over the last two days. \"She was cooperative and courageous during the interviews.\" NBC Bay Area: Northern California 'Supermom' Who Vanished Weeks Ago Found Safe Bosenko spoke with reporters about the chilling abduction a day after Papini's husband, Keith Papini, said in a statement to ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that she was badly bruised and had a broken nose, her long blonde hair chopped off, and she weighed only 87 pounds after she was able to flag down a passing driver after being released by her captors last week.

While there is no confirmation what specific position she might be interested in, her son-in-law has dropped a hint. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Saul Young / AP Dakota Meyer, a Medal of Honor recipient married to Palin's daughter Bristol, posted his appeal on Facebook, including a video that makes a glossy pitch for Palin as an advocate for America's veterans. \"Governor Palin has relayed to the Trump transition team her offer to continue helping the next President either in the public or private sector,\" a Palin adviser said. However, Trump transition officials declined to comment on what position, if any, for which Palin might be considered. Related: 'Drain the Swamp'? Trump's Potential Cabinet Fills Out With Washington Insiders The role of veterans affairs secretary remains unfilled. Other early Trump endorsers, former Sen. Scott Brown and House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Jeff Miller, have also been described as in the running for the cabinet position. Trump transition sources also say a \"CEO type\" with military experience has been considered. Palin was among the early voices for Trump and notably endorsed him instead of her ally Sen. Ted Cruz, who had courted her support. Palin campaigned with Trump a few times in the early phase of the campaign season. Trump and Palin also appeared together at the United States' Capitol for a high-profile rally against the Iran deal. Play ",

Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters confirmed three new deaths at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. No identities were released because the victims' families hadn't been notified. \"We certainly want to pray for those families, the folks involved in the fatalities,\" Waters said. \"We continue to try to identity them. We haven't been able to yet.\" A firefighter suffered minor injuries, and 53 people have been treated at LaConte Medical Center, Waters said. He didn't know the conditions of the patients, but he said \"many of those have been released.\" The remains of a home smolder Wednesday in the wake of a wildfire in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Brian Blanco / Getty Images Incident commanders said the blazes started with the human-caused Chimney 2 Fire, which was reported in the park a week ago. By Monday, the region's prolonged drought and extreme winds were causing the fire to spit out embers that quickly ignited numerous new fires, they said. Fire commanders said Wednesday night that more than 15,500 acres have been burned in the area, with much of the charred landscape on national parklands. More than 700 structures in Sevier County have been damaged or destroyed, about 300 of them in Gatlinburg, and as many as 14,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes, authorities said. The main fire remained only 10 percent contained, fire commanders said. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime event,\" Waters said. \"This was a perfect storm.\" ",

Play Donald Trump dines with Mitt Romney, makes 3 more cabinet picks 3:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161201020528if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/820747331593\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump handing over his business to his children wouldn't eliminate the conflicts of interest. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted this morning that he will be holding a news conference with his children in December \"to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total.\" In a series of dispatches, he tweeted: I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my ... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While I am not mandated to .... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 But there are a couple of big hitches here. Trump's tweets don't outline any specifics of how the unwinding would actually work. And if in fact he just puts his children in charge of the business, it wouldn't actually eliminate any conflicts of interest, especially when they've been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders. What the Trump campaign has done here is bought themselves time to figure out what do to \u2014 and a way to answer the continuing barrage of questions about Trump's business conflicts for the next few weeks. But we're a long way from real answers on this yet. And at least so far, it's hard to see how the solutions Trump has floated up until this point would do anything to truly remove the big conflicts his family's business entanglements could cause. Should Trump pick his country over his business (and his family)? This is why, weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal recommended that best way for Trump to eliminate any conflict of interest was to liquidate his business. And here's how conservative opinion writer Peggy Noonan framed the issue. \"It would be a painful act, selling the business he loves and around which he has ordered his life. But there would be comfort in this: In doing the right thing, in denying his opponents a sword, in enhancing his stature and demonstrating that, yes, he will sacrifice for his country. That's pretty great comfort. You've made your money. Now go be a patriot.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also talked about Trump's conflicts of interest. \"I don't think people would want me to have a business relationship as a senator, where my business partners can reap the benefit of my position and I one day give the chairman profits. I don't think it would be good for me, I don't think it would be good for my state, I don't think it would be good for the country. But let's give him a chance to figure this out.\" Play The list of potential conflicts of interest keeps growing for Trump 2:01 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161201020528if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/820565571611\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump's conflict of interest with his new DC hotel The federal government's General Services Administration owns the lease to the historic Post Office Pavilion, which houses the new Trump hotel. The problem here, as NBC's Ken Dilanian writes : Trump would be his own landlord when he becomes president. More from Government Executive : \"The Post Office Lease differs from many of Mr. Trump's other business arrangements. That's because, in writing the contract, the federal and D.C. governments determined, in advance, that elected officials could play no role in this lease arrangement. The contract language is clear: 'No ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom...'\" Per NBC's Ari Melber, this potential conflict stands out as different from many of the others because: 1) The arrangement could be voided or altered as a matter of contract law - meaning it does NOT matter that Trump is otherwise exempt from federal conflicts laws, because contract law governs here; and 2) The arrangement presents the *prospect* of future self-dealing. Melber adds that it's possible a judge would find a change in the status of one of the parties (i.e., Trump as president), not foreseen at the time of the agreement, did not constitute a material breach. The Carrier news is a short-term win for Trump, but with long-term caveats Give them their due: The news that Carrier Corp. will keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indiana rather than move them to Mexico looks like a first big win for the incoming administration - at least in the short run. Yes, we'll have to read the fine print about what was promised. (And, yes, we're wondering how much of this was a Mike Pence project versus a Trump one). But the announcement is still a victory that Trump can tout to his supporters, and it's a prime example of how he can effectively use the bully pulpit to follow through on his promises. Here's the long-term problem, though: Targeting individual companies one by one simply isn't a sustainable strategy like actual economic policymaking would be. As the University of Michigan's Justin Wolfers puts it: \"Every savvy CEO will now threaten to ship jobs to Mexico, and demand a payment to stay.\" By the way: Imagine the reaction from Republicans, circa 2009-2010, if Barack Obama were making details to force a business's behavior. We'd be hearing cries of \"socialism\" and \"crony capitalism.\" What say you, free-market conservatives? Mitt Romney's 180-degree turn Yes, plenty of Republicans have changed their tune about the president-elect in the last few weeks, but the turn from Trump's onetime top foe Mitt Romney is particularly stunning. As Alex Jaffe points out, back in March, Romney said this about the man he derisively referred to as \"The Donald\" : \"Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes. He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit First Amendment freedom of the press. This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss.\" And here's what Romney said last night, with a possible administration job on the line: \"He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing. He won the general election. And he continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\" Wow. Nancy Pelosi vs. Tim Ryan This morning, House Democrats hold their leadership election, and the top-billing race pits House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi versus Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH). It features dividing lines over age, geography (the coasts vs. Middle America), and the party's performance at the ballot box. When Ryan was asked on \"Meet the Press\" this past Sunday what Pelosi's fireable offense was, he answered, \"We're not winning.\" As NBC's Alex Moe reminds us, Democrats postponed these elections until Thanksgiving after internal unrest in the caucus in the wake of the party's defeat in the Nov. 8 general election. In the face of this challenge, Moe adds, Pelosi announced several lower level leadership spots late last week trying to show she understands there is frustration within her caucus. Pelosi is still the strong bet to win, but it will be interesting to see how many votes Ryan gets in the secret ballot. Trump expected to name Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, Ross to head Commerce \"President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name his former campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary and investor Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary as early as tomorrow,\" NBC's Alex Jaffe writes . Cabinet Watch Here is our running list of possible candidates we've been hearing about so far. We'll continue to update it as the president-elect's team makes its choices final.

Here is what we know about the 53-year-old. USA TODAY NETWORK Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, shown in a Trump Tower interview in Nov. 2016. (Photo: ALBIN LOHR-JONES / POOL, EPA) Americans should expect\u00a0the \"largest tax change since Reagan,\" with federal tax cuts for average income earners as well as U.S.businesses, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary said Wednesday. \"There will be a tax cut for the middle class,\" banker, movie producer\u00a0and former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin told CNBC's Squawk Box in his first public comments on the incoming administration's economic priorities. \"Any tax cuts that we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions to pay for it.\" Tax deductions for charitable contributions would still be allowed, he said. There would be a cap on mortgage interest payments, though \u00a0\"some deductibility\" would continue, said Mnuchin. The proposed changes also include\u00a0cutting\u00a0the nation's 35% top business tax rate to 15%, along with an effort to encourage\u00a0repatriation of the estimated $1 trillion that large U.S. corporations hold in foreign\u00a0subsidiaries to avoid the domestic tax bite. Trump has proposed a special 10% rate on overseas funds\u00a0the companies shift back to the U.S. \"We think by cutting corporate taxes we'll create huge economic growth and we'll have huge\u00a0personal income, so the revenues will be offset on the other side,\" Mnuchin said in the interview. The changes should help increase sustained U.S. economic growth, he predicted. \"I think we can absolutely get to sustained 3% to 4% GDP. And that is absolutely critical to the country,\" Mnuchin said. \"To get there, our No. 1 priority is tax reform. This will be the largest tax change since Reagan.\" The proposals echo some proposals\u00a0Trump outlined during his campaign. However, the claim that any tax cuts for the wealthy would be offset with fewer reductions appeared\u00a0to conflict\u00a0with the formal tax plan of the New York City businessman. Although Trump said his economic team projected\u00a03.5% GDP growth over the next decade during a September speech at the Economic Club of New York, he also told the gathering, \"I think we can do better than that.\" Bank tied to Trump adviser accused of discrimination Some tax experts voiced cautious optimism about the proposals, even as they cautioned about a potential repeat of the federal deficit increases that followed the Reagan tax system overhaul in 1981. Slashing the corporate tax rate and allowing businesses to expense capital investments in the year they're made could make 3% to 4% GDP growth \"a reasonable goal,\" said Robert Goulder, senior tax policy counsel for Tax Analysts, a non-partisan\u00a0publisher focused on tax policy and administration. However, capping mortgage tax deductions and other cost-saving proposals, such as reducing or eliminating deductions for state and local taxes, could prove politically difficult, said Goulder. Others have tried such plans and failed, he said,\u00a0citing the federal tax reforms proposed in 2014 by then-congressman David Camp, R-Mich. \"Where are the spending cuts? Where are the federal entitlement reforms?\" asked Goulder. \"Can we run up a larger deficit without having negative effects that outweigh the positives of pro-growth tax plans?\" Cutting the corporate\u00a0tax rate will generate more investments, factory growth and jobs, said\u00a0Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at\u00a0the Cato Institute, a public policy group focused on limited government and free markets. However, referring to personal income taxes, Edwards\u00a0predicted it would be \"difficult to ensure that everyone gets a break.\" Follow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc 721 CONNECT TWEET 12 LINKEDIN 280 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gKO81G ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Paul Kane and Ed O'Keefe November 30 at 4:55 PM Follow @pkcapitol Follow @edatpost Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Nov. 30 was reelected as House minority leader, winning 134 votes against 63 votes for her challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) won an eighth term leading the Democratic caucus Wednesday, prevailing in a contest that became a vote of confidence in her continued stewardship and an early proxy battle over the future of the Democratic Party. Pelosi easily beat Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a seven-term lawmaker who launched an upstart bid to lead House Democrats two weeks ago in response to the party\u2019s disappointing November election results and concerns that Democrats have become out of touch with working-class voters in key swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. But Pelosi\u2019s margin of victory, 134 votes to 63 for Ryan, signaled a large degree of discontent with her leadership after 14 years atop the caucus and, more broadly, with the Democratic policy agenda that many lawmakers say has grown stale. While she cleared her self-declared margin of victory, a two-thirds majority, many Democrats were stunned that almost a third of the caucus was willing to vote for a backbench lawmaker with no major policy or political experience. Many were left wondering whether a more seasoned Democrat could have actually toppled Pelosi, with several privately suggesting these next two years would have to be Pelosi\u2019s last as leader. Ryan\u2019s 63 votes marked the largest bloc of opposition Pelosi has faced since winning a deputy leadership position 15 years ago that set her on a course to become the first female House speaker. Although they came up well short, Ryan and his band of supporters declared a symbolic victory in prompting Pelosi to propose elevating junior lawmakers and lead a more inclusive leadership table. They also declared that the party\u2019s economic agenda, at times neglected by their presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, would move to the front and center alongside the cultural issues that dominated the 2016 campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win as Democrats if we have an economic message that resonates in every part of the country,\u201d Ryan told reporters after his defeat. \u201cWe are disappointed, because I like to win. \u2026 But the party is better off,\u201d he added. Speaking to reporters after Democrats voted to reelect Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as leader, Nov. 30, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) said his \"message resonated\" with Americans. (The Washington Post) Afterward, Pelosi publicly congratulated Ryan and acknowledged that he had run \u201ca very aggressive campaign.\u201d She told reporters that it forced her to work harder than two previous challenges to lead the caucus. \u201cI quite frankly feel more liberated than I ever have,\u201d she said. After gaining just six seats in the November elections \u2014 despite Pelosi\u2019s proclamation they would gain more than 20 \u2014 she was left more vulnerable than at any moment in her leadership tenure, more so than in 2010, when she oversaw the loss of 63 seats and the majority. She began the campaign in a boastful mode, declaring that she had \u201cmore than two-thirds\u201d of the votes locked up, but she ended issuing a series of letters that amounted to concessions to an anxious rank-and-file looking for new ideas if not new leaders. [ Meet Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat challenging Nancy Pelosi to lead House Democrats ] Pelosi tried to placate junior lawmakers by offering new or modified positions, including the new position of \u201cvice-ranking member\u201d on the more than 20 standing House committees and reserving it for lawmakers who have served four terms or less. A policy leadership position would be divided into three co-chairmen and reserved for those who have served five terms or less. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.), 44, credited Ryan\u2019s challenge with forcing those proposals. \u201cThat\u2019s partly a response to the competition in the caucus for votes, and that\u2019s a healthy thing,\u201d O\u2019Rourke, first elected in 2012, said. At 76, Pelosi is one of three septuagenarians leading the caucus, followed by 77-year-old Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), the minority whip; and 76-year-old Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the assistant to the leader. Hoyer and Clyburn were unchallenged Wednesday for their reelection, and the caucus elevated Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) to the No. 4 post of caucus chairman, and Rep. Linda T. S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.) became the first Latina in leadership as caucus vice-chairman. Republicans, after years of vilifying Pelosi\u2019s West Coast liberalism, were gleeful at the stasis among Democratic leaders. The National Republican Congressional Committee immediately hung a \u201c Congrats Nancy! \u201d poster atop a \u201cHire Pelosi\u201d banner that had been affixed to Republican National Committee headquarters this week. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) faces reporters on Capitol Hill after his bid to unseat Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as House Democratic leader failed. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post) Others remain upset at Pelosi\u2019s control of the House campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has overseen a series of poor election performances. \u201cWe should have been recruiting earlier, we should have better targeting. I think our messaging was off,\u201d Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said Tuesday in an interview. Some of Pelosi\u2019s biggest detractors fear that the results will only empower the more coastal liberal wings. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to change anytime soon. We\u2019re going to be in the minority for the next 15 years,\u201d said Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, a centrist group.\u00a0 He added that Democrats need to develop \u201ca farm team that\u2019s not just the socialist side of our party.\u201d Some longtime critics supported her but in a fashion that suggested that she has less leeway than in the past. \u201cIf I think changing engines is going to get us there faster and more efficiently and effectively, I would do that. I\u2019ve told that to Nancy,\u201d said Rep. Bill\u00a0Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), who helped nominate Pelosi on Wednesday. Pelosi\u2019s most loyal backers reminded detractors that House Democrats are now in a comeback situation facing President-elect Donald Trump, who will employ an aggressive set of media skills unlike any recent president. \u201cThe role of leader is one of tactician, of negotiator, of knowing all the rules, of having all the tools to stand up when necessary to Donald Trump,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.). \u201cShe\u2019s effectively done that and is ready for this fight.\u201d Mike DeBonis contributed to this report. powerpost ",

UCLA student Yesenia Capellino lends her voice during a rally for the Dream Act on the lawn of Marco Antonio Firebaugh High School in Lynwood on July 28, 2011. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Teresa Watanabe The University of California announced sweeping actions Wednesday to protect its students who came into the country illegally, saying it would refuse to assist federal immigration agents, turn over confidential records without court orders or supply information for any national registry based on race, national origin or religion. \u00a0\u201cWhile we still do not know what policies and practices the incoming federal administration may adopt, given the many public pronouncements made during the presidential campaign and its aftermath, we felt it necessary to reaffirm that UC will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our community have the right to work, study, and live safely and without fear at all UC locations,\u201d UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement. Napolitano\u00a0said the university\u00a0would \u201cvigorously protect the privacy and civil rights of the undocumented members of the UC community.\u201d The policies, described as a statement of principles, mark the first unified approach toward federal immigration issues for\u00a0the system\u2019s 10 campuses, according to UC spokeswoman Dianne Klein. Napolitano formed a task force to examine possible actions shortly after\u00a0the presidential election of Donald Trump stirred widespread unease and uncertainty on campuses.\u00a0UC does not track students\u2019 immigration status but says about 3,700 have obtained in-state tuition benefits under AB 540, a 2001 law designed to help those in the country illegally.\u00a0 The UC president announced the new policies a day after\u00a0she and the heads of the California State University and California Community Colleges sent a joint letter to President-elect Trump urging him to allow students without legal status to continue their educations. Trump, during his campaign, had said he would reverse an Obama administration\u00a0program Napolitano created as Homeland Security secretary\u00a0that deferred deportation proceedings against certain young people who stayed in school and out of trouble. That program has\u00a0helped nearly 720,000 young people nationally and 214,000 in California apply for work permits and continue their studies without fear of deportation. The new policies heartened students such as\u00a0Benyamin bin Mohd Yusof, who was brought illegally to the country from Brunei when he was 2 years old and is now a senior at UC Berkeley studying molecular cellular biology and South and Southeast Asian studies. He said he has felt unsafe since Trump\u2019s election, which he said showed that millions of Americans supported \u201cviolent and dehumanizing rhetoric about undocumented immigrants like myself.\u201d \u00a0 While the UC protections will help him, he said, he worried about those not able to benefit from them. \u201cWhere will that protection be for my mother and brother?\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe have to do more for undocumented students and others everywhere.\u201d Among the new UC principles:\u00a0 Campus police will not assist local, state or federal agents to investigate, detain or arrest\u00a0students for violations of federal immigration law. Police\u00a0also will be told not to contact, detain, question or arrest individuals solely on suspicion of immigration violations.\u00a0 No confidential student records will be released without a judicial warrant, subpoena or court order unless authorized by the student or required by law. UC will continue to admit all eligible students without regard to immigration status and take the same stance in treatment of\u00a0patients at its medical centers. \u00a0 University police should use\u00a0their limited resources to build\u00a0community trust and a \u201csafe and secure environment\u201d on campus rather than to\u00a0assist in immigration cases, which is a federal responsibility, the statement said. Campus police also will decline requests by federal immigration agents to detain any individuals unless their assistance is required by law or the individuals are wanted for serious or violent felonies. The California attorney general has concluded that compliance with such requests is voluntary. In addition, UC will not cooperate with any effort to\u00a0compile a federal registry\u00a0of selected groups of people \u2014 such as one for Muslims, suggested by Trump during his campaign. \u201cA federal effort to create a registry based on any protected characteristics \u2026 would be antithetical to the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, federal and state laws, and principles of nondiscrimination that guide our university,\u201d the statement said. Earlier this month, Cal State\u00a0 affirmed that it\u00a0would not help local, state or federal authorities enforce federal immigration law. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Sarah Palin said to be mulled by Trump for VA secretary Sarah Palin Mary Altaffer / Associated Press Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin endorses Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally at Iowa State University on March 22, 2016. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin endorses Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally at Iowa State University on March 22, 2016. (Mary Altaffer / Associated Press) Kellie MejdrichRoll Call Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with a post on her public Facebook account appeared Wednesday to confirm a report that she\u2019s under consideration by President-elect Donald Trump to become secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The post \u00a0included a highly stylized video produced by SARAHPAC, her political action committee, about the former vice presidential candidate\u2019s ideas on how to fix the troubled agency, and a link to the ABC news report that first broke the news of her vetting by the Trump transition team. ABC said that both a Palin aide and the Trump transition team confirmed she\u2019s under consideration to run the VA. \u201cWe should be grateful we\u2019ll soon have a commander-in-chief who will champion our vets and honor the promises our nation made; a pro-private sector individual who surely understands bigger government is NOT the answer; a President who promised to drain the swamp and clean up all government corruption \u2026 all things our vets and active duty troops deserve,\u201d Palin wrote, followed by an American flag emoji. Palin, who unsuccessfully ran on a ticket with Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., in 2008, would take the helm of an agency marked by scandal and crisis. The VA also stands at a policy crossroads, with many lawmakers in favor of allowing veterans to more widely use private doctors and hospitals, a plan vehemently opposed by many Democrats and some veterans groups. In 2014, lawmakers scrambled to expand access to VA health care when it was discovered that some veterans seeking care were waiting so long that they died before seeing a doctor. Palin, who is known for her brash speaking style, if tapped and confirmed would also inherit a position in which current VA Secretary Robert McDonald received considerable blowback for a public statement made about wait times. McDonald was excoriated by lawmakers and advocacy groups for comparing VA wait times to lines at a Disney theme park. Palin\u2019s video lays out three major platforms for what she wants to see from federal veterans\u2019 care: allow veterans to receive care in the private market through vouchers, allow veterans re-entering the civilian workforce to use military certifications in place of civilian ones for job skills, and maintain veterans\u2019 retirement benefits. Those changes won\u2019t come without a price. For example, lawmakers are currently grappling with how to extend a $10 billion private care program that expires in August 2017 or whenever the money allocated to it runs out. Recently, CQ reported that the program, while designed to provide a new route of access for patients facing distance issues or long wait times, was mostly serving veterans who couldn\u2019t get the care they wanted at a VA facility. That\u2019s triggered questions about whether the program is being administered in the way it was intended. There\u2019s also a slew of concerns from House authorizers about the way the VA is spending money on a construction project in Denver and reports of lavish art purchases at medical facilities \u2014 issues which were the subject of a federal subpoena issued by House lawmakers in September.

He plans to visit a combination of states \u2014 several he won and some where he didn't prevail as planned, according to the official. Before kicking off the tour, Trump and Vice President\u2013elect Mike Pence will head to Indiana on Thursday afternoon to announce that air-conditioning company Carrier has decided to keep jobs in the United States that were previously bound for Mexico.

Read their stories:\u00a0 latimes.com/sbvictims Family and friends remember the San Bernardino shooting victims. Read their stories:\u00a0 latimes.com/sbvictims Paloma Esquivel Contact Reporter After a heavily armed San Bernardino County employee and his wife attacked\u00a0a county holiday event last Dec. 2, killing 14 people and wounding 22, county leaders sounded a clear message of support for their workers. \u201cThe events of that day could have torn us asunder. They have not. They have drawn us closer together and rebounded our commitment to take care of one another,\u201d Board of Supervisors Chairman James Ramos said at a memorial in January. But a year later, some county employees who were victims of the attack, including witnesses and those who were physically injured, say such pledges ring hollow. In interviews and at a recent public meeting, employees described struggling to cope with a callous county bureaucracy that provided little comfort as they tried to heal. Instead, they were left scrambling for help and tangling with a county-administered workers\u2019 compensation program that has led to delays and denials of needed medication and treatment, the employees\u00a0said. San Bernardino terror attack Read more stories \u201cThere\u2019s a level of secondary trauma that has occurred to all of us,\u201d said Ray Britain, who was interim division chief for the county\u2019s Division of Environmental Health Services on the day of the attack.\u00a0\u201cWe were abandoned and betrayed by a co-worker, and when we asked our employer for help, a lot of us were abandoned and betrayed by them.\u201d Several employees said they have struggled to cope with constant uncertainty about whether treatment or medication will be approved. In some cases, they said\u00a0they were made to repeatedly argue and appeal when treatment was denied. County spokesman David Wert said caring for those affected by the terrorist attack has been a top priority of the county.\u00a0 \u201cWorkers\u2019\u00a0compensation requires many parties to do their respective parts, and it doesn\u2019t always run as smoothly as it should,\u201d he said in a written response to questions. \u201cThe county has always acted in the best interests of the wounded, improving practices along the way, and will continue to do so.\u201d Some of the problems appear inherent to California\u2019s\u00a0workers\u2019 compensation programs, which can be difficult to navigate\u00a0and often rely on\u00a0precise guidelines for treatment approval. But the county also has latitude to affect the process. Christine Baker, director of the California Department of Industrial Relations, said she reminded the county this week that it has\u00a0\"full discretion to provide medical care even after a review of the guidelines.\" \u201cWe\u2019ve told the county these are unusual circumstances and they\u2019ve got to take extraordinary steps to take on these issues,\u201d she added. After county workers recently began to air their concerns publicly, county officials said Monday they would hire a firm dedicated solely to helping process paperwork for those affected. But that has been little comfort to victims who have struggled for the past year. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like they have had any compassion for us,\u201d Sally Cardinale, 35, a program specialist, said of the county. \u201cWe were victims when it was convenient for them.\u201d Hanan Megalla, 48, was shot four times on Dec. 2, in the head, arm and chest. She suffered nerve damage and bone fractures. She lost function in one arm, has difficulty sleeping and is frequently in pain. \u00a0 \u201cHer doctors keep asking for physical therapy. They keep asking for medication,\u201d said her husband, Osama Megalla, 51. \u201cEach time the doctor writes a prescription \u2026 they shoot it down.\u201d After pushing back, he said, some of her medications have been\u00a0approved.\u00a0 But, he added, \u201cthey keep telling you it\u2019s only approved for one time only. Which means that every month we have to go through this refill drama again. It\u2019s unbearable.\u201d Britain, 48, who supervised most of the workers in the room on Dec. 2, was seated at a table when the shooters entered the room. \u00a0 \u201cI sat at the head of the table and watched it all happen,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI froze as he entered, and I think I was just in shock and disbelief at what I was seeing.\u201d Though he\u00a0escaped physically uninjured, he soon realized\u00a0he would need psychological treatment. When he sought it, he said, county officials \u201cmade us feel ashamed that we even needed help if you weren\u2019t physically injured.\u201d \u201cEverything has been a fight,\u201d Britain said. \u201cI had to fight to get into the workman\u2019s comp process. Once in the workman\u2019s comp process,\u00a0you realize that\u2019s a flawed system. \u2026 Every month you\u2019re wondering if your\u00a0medication is going to be approved, what\u2019s going to be denied, what\u2019s going to be delayed.\u201d Photos (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) The policies and procedures required under\u00a0workers\u2019 compensation, which was never tailored for victims of terror attacks, can be daunting. \u00a0 Workers must first submit a request to a county adjuster. If that person cannot approve it, the request is forwarded to \u201cutilization review,\u201d conducted\u00a0by doctors at a firm hired by the county. Baker, of the Department of Industrial Relations, said state officials have told the county that some treatments being submitted for higher review could be approved at the county level. Often, employees and their family members said they have found themselves stymied each step of the process. But many have been particularly frustrated by decisions made during the review process by\u00a0faraway doctors who do not treat the patient. In one case\u00a0reviewed by The Times, a woman who had been shot asked for authorization to consult with a psychologist. Five months after the attack, she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder\u00a0and was having crying spells. She\u00a0was\u00a0unable to sleep and haunted by nightmares, according to records. \u00a0 The utilization review doctor denied the request because \u201cpsychological evaluation and treatment has already been performed,\u201d according to the records.\u00a0 The county could change decisions made in utilization review, said county spokesman Wert, but he argued that doing so would be wrong. \u201cIn cases of prescriptions and medical treatment it would be wrong for the county, which is not a doctor, to overrule a decision made by a doctor. It could harm the patient, make the county liable for anything that goes wrong and result in cancellation of the county\u2019s insurance.\u201d The utilization review decision can also be appealed to the state for independent review.\u00a0 Attorney Geraldine Ly, who represents nine of the victims, said that in her experience those appeals for treatment are overwhelmingly denied.\u00a0 Wert said delays have often stemmed from employees\u2019 doctors not submitting proper documentation to approve treatment.\u00a0 Priya Krishnakumar For some patients, a number of treatments and medications recommended by their doctors were submitted with detailed documentation but denied because reviewing doctors determined that the recommended treatments\u00a0did not meet their guidelines, records show.\u00a0 Cardinale, the program specialist, was in a bathroom when the shooting started. She and three others hid in a stall, standing on a toilet so their feet would not show under the door. She has wanted\u00a0to go back to work \u2014\u00a0and did so for almost six months\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but has suffered from anxiety and panic attacks. In November, she received notice that her anxiety medication, antidepressants\u00a0and others\u00a0would not be approved. \u201cThe claimant should have already been completely weaned from this medication,\u201d the determination read, even though Cardinale\u2019s own doctor had prescribed it.\u00a0 The same report noted that she suffered from PTSD and that her symptoms had been exacerbated by the anniversary of 9/11.\u00a0 \u201cMy psychiatrist believes that I need to be on the medication. That\u2019s why he wrote the prescription,\u201d Cardinale said.\u00a0 Cardinale and others said they were reluctant to raise their concerns publicly because talking about the attack and its aftermath is exceedingly painful.\u00a0 But in recent weeks they decided to come forward, feeling that they were out of options. On Monday, victims and their supporters spoke out at a Board of Supervisors meeting. Julie Swann-Paez, who was shot,\u00a0voiced her frustration at county supervisors for the way employees had been treated over the past year. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel as if we\u2019re being treated as the county family,\u201d she said. \u201cMore like the ugly stepkids, who if we were just out of the picture, it would make everything run more smoothly.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump has made a number of key cabinet decisions , Nancy Paulikas went into a bathroom at LACMA on Oct. 15, then she vanished , \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump pledged to protect Medicare, but his choice for health secretary has other ideas , and\u00a0 Regina Bejarano was looking to leave San Bernardino, but tragedy struck.

    "text": "By Tom Metcalfe Livescience.com November 30, 2016, 2:56 PM Rare Ming Dynasty banknote found inside antique sculpture The rare Ming Dynasty paper banknote was hidden in the wooden sculpture of a Chinese religious figure more than 600 years ago. Mossgreen Auctions Email Art experts in Australia have found a rare paper banknote from the Ming Dynasty of Imperial China hidden inside an antique wooden sculpture that was being prepared for auction. The Chinese characters on the crumpled banknote show that it was issued in the third year of the reign of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first\u00a0 emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u00a0\u2014 or 1371 in the Western calendar. The inscriptions also warn would-be counterfeiters that they face the penalty of death by beheading. The 645-year-old banknote was found hidden inside a wooden sculpture of the head of a \u201cluohan,\u201d a religious figure from Chinese Buddhism, that may once have stood in a family or public temple, said Paul Sumner, chief executive of Mossgreen\u2019s Auctions in Melbourne, Australia, which discovered the note. [ See photos of the paper banknote that dates back to China\u2019s Ming Dynasty ] Sumner said the firm\u2019s specialist in Asian artworks, Ray Tregaskis, spotted the note wedged inside the hollow head of the sculpture as he inspected the artifact in preparation for an auction in Sydney, Australia, next month. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to see \u2014 it was hidden right up out of eyesight, folded up into a little, 1-inch fold,\u201d Sumner told Live Science. \u201cThe note has been in at least two collections that we know of without the knowledge of the owners.\u201d Currency experts at Mossgreen\u2019s Auctions immediately identified the note as a rare paper \u201cbank seal\u201d that was issued in China during the\u00a0 Ming Dynasty . \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in very good condition, as you\u2019d imagine with all those folds and after hundreds of years with some degree of exposure to the elements,\u201d Sumner said. Very few of these Ming Dynasty banknotes have survived to present day, he added, \u201cbearing in mind that they were constantly being handled \u2014 it\u2019s not like people kept them in plastic sleeves, like collectors would today.\u201d Ming money The Ming Dynasty banknote is much larger than modern paper money, roughly equivalent to the size of a standard \u201cU.S. letter\u201d page of paper. Chinese characters and official seals printed in red and black ink declare that the note is a \u201cGreat Ming Treasure Note\u201d with a value of \u201cone guan\u201d \u2014 depicted as 10 \u201cstrings\u201d of\u00a0 Chinese copper coins , which could be grouped with a string through the hole in each coin. According to the American historian of Chinese currency\u00a0 John E. Sandrock , one guan was equivalent to 1,000 copper coins, or 1 ounce of pure silver. The newfound banknote also includes a dire warning to counterfeiters that they will be punished with decapitation , and offers a large reward to anyone who informs on such criminals. At the time this banknote was issued,\u00a0 paper money \u00a0was almost unheard of outside China. The first European banknotes date from the mid-17th century, around 300 years later. [ The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth ] Based on the date on the banknote and the expert dating of the sculpture it was found in, it\u2019s thought the money may have been\u00a0 hidden as a religious offering \u00a0when the sculpture was already 30 to 50 years old, Sumner said.

    "text": "Nov 30 2016, 6:01 pm ET SCOTUS Immigration Case Could Undermine Trump Deportation Plan by Amanda Sakuma advertisement The U.S. Supreme Court seemed divided Wednesday over whether immigrants held in detention for lengthy periods deserve the chance to argue for their release on bond. And depending how the incomplete bench of eight justices is swayed, legal experts predict the outcome stands to severely impact president-elect Donald Trump's vows to detain and deport more immigrants than ever before. The lives of thousands of undocumented immigrants and even those here legally are on the line as they await a decision and, in the meantime, fight orders of deportation. Ahilan T. Arulanantham for respondents Art Lien \"You can't just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness, without any finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of time, and not run into due process,\" Justice Elena Kagan said during oral arguments. Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to mull whether a lower court should handle the matter. \"Our job is to read the statute and if it presents \u2014 if it's unconstitutional, that's our job,\" he said. \"But we can't just write a different statute because we think it would be more administrable.\" Trump made a name for himself in championing a harsh line on illegal immigration. But he already faces a number of practical and resource limitations to carry out his pledge to swiftly deport as many as 3 million undocumented immigrants. And if the justices side with the lower courts and find that immigrants should be able to fight their detention, the result would make it nearly impossible for Trump to keep his campaign promises at the rate he has proposed, said Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California Davis. \"If Trump wants to implement his plan, he would have to create enormous infrastructure to do so,\" Cooper said. Related: SCOTUS to Decide if Indefinite Immigrant Detention is Illegal Trump's primary impediment would be a notoriously backlogged immigration court system that has all but stalled deportation proceedings on a massive scale. According to the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, cases take an average of two and a half years to complete. The Obama administration has scrambled to hire more immigration judges to clear out the log jammed dockets. But still there are a record 521,676 cases still pending in the immigrant courts. The extreme backlogs are a main contributor behind why immigrants, even green card holders and asylum seekers, have languished behind bars for years to fight their deportation. Michael Tan, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrant's Rights Project, which brought the class action lawsuit says the case became all the more urgent since the presidential election, in part because Trump has pledged to implement a hiring freeze within his first 100 days in office. Suspected illegal immigrants are transferred out of the holding area after being processed at the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Tucson, Arizona, on Aug. 9, 2012. Ross D. Franklin / AP Without more immigration judges, coupled with Trump's plan to step up deportations, it means more immigrants in detention for longer durations, Tan says. \"A federal hiring freeze would effectively paralyze people's cases and will take all the longer to be decided,\" he added. The Obama administration on Wednesday defended its broad authority to use detention as an enforcement tool. From a practical sense, the government has maintained that it is necessary to keep immigrants eligible for deportation in federal custody while their cases are processed. The U.S. is already detaining more than 40,000 immigrants nationwide under Obama, the highest the country has ever seen. Related: Donald Trump's Deportation Plan Must Still Overcome These Roadblocks Should the Trump administration exceed that capacity, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a staff attorney with the American Immigration Council, said the bond hearings would provide immigrants an extra layer of protection in ensuring that the people with strong legal cases to remain in the U.S. aren't wrongfully deported. \"The bail and bond structures are so important that we enshrined it in the Constitution,\" Reichlin-Melnick said. \"It should not be taken away lightly.\" Amanda Sakuma ",

Mui and Jim Tankersley November 30 at 8:46 AM Follow @ylanmui Follow @jimtankersley Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood financier, is President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for treasury secretary. He spoke at Trump Tower Nov. 30. (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Treasury Department on Wednesday called reforming the nation\u2019s tax code his top priority, promising significant tax breaks for the middle class but no overall tax\u00a0cut for high-income households. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood financier, confirmed in an interview Wednesday on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box that Trump had asked him to serve in the administration. Billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross also confirmed that he is the nominee for Commerce Secretary. In the joint interview, they professed confidence in the new administration\u2019s ability to boost economic growth as high as 4 percent a year. Crucial to that projection would be passage of Trump\u2019s proposed overhaul of the tax code, including streamlining individual tax rates into three brackets and reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Independent research groups have estimated the plan could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade. However, that analysis does not include the potential economic benefits the tax cuts could generate. Mnuchin said Wednesday that he believed the tax cuts would generate more jobs, helping to offset the cost. Some of Trump\u2019s economic advisers said during the campaign that his plan would not add to the federal deficit. However, the Tax Foundation estimated that even with so-called \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d Trump\u2019s tax package could cost about $3 trillion over a decade. In addition, Mnuchin emphasized that a reduced tax rate for the highest earners would be offset\u00a0by the elimination or curtailing of many deductions that favor the wealthy. He suggested that the cap on the popular deduction for mortgage interest could be lowered but did not provide details. The current cap is $1 million on first and second mortgages. Banker Steven Mnuchin is the next potential Treasury Secretary in Donald Trump's administration. Here's what you need to know about him. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Mnuchin also pushed back against analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that found the bulk of the benefits under Trump\u2019s plan would go to wealthy households, while some single-parent households would end up paying higher taxes. He highlighted plans for a child-care tax credit and rebates for lower-income families. \u201cThere will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,\u201d he said. \"There will be a big tax cut for the middle class.\u201d [ Trump expected to name financier Steve Mnuchin to Treasury ] The comments highlight two potential sources of tension for the Trump administration as it pushes its tax plan \u2013 one with congressional Republicans, the other with the federal budget deficit. They also fly in the face of every independent analysis of the Trump plan, including one Trump has frequently cited favorably. Mnuchin reiterated Trump\u2019s commitment to cutting taxes for the middle class, a key difference between the president-elect\u2019s campaign plan and the tax blueprint put forth by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. The congressional plan, like Trump\u2019s, would cut taxes for the wealthy and for corporations, but it would not do nearly as much as Trump would to cut taxes for lower- and middle-income Americans. Reconciling the two will be a major sticking point in any tax-reform negotiations next year. Mnuchin also said two things about Trump\u2019s tax plan that independent analyses do not support. One is the idea that the wealthy will receive no net tax benefits from the plan. The other is that the plan will not add to the deficit, because of increased economic growth. Even the friendliest analysis toward Trump, work by the independent Tax Foundation that the Trump campaign frequently cited to bolster his proposals, finds Trump\u2019s plan would add at least $2.6 trillion to the federal debt over a decade, and as much as $3.9 trillion, after accounting for increased economic growth. The Tax Foundation also finds Trump\u2019s plan would boost incomes for the top 1 percent of U.S. earners by between 10 and 16 percent, an amount that dwarfs the benefits lower- and middle-income earners would see from the plan. That\u2019s true even though the group factored in Trump\u2019s promise to limit deductions for high earners, which Mnuchin reiterated on Wednesday. Mnuchin and Ross also appeared to step back from some of Trump\u2019s most confrontational rhetoric on the campaign trail. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy double-digit tariffs on goods coming from China and Mexico and pull out of existing free-trade deals. But Ross said Wednesday those measures may only be a last resort. \"Everybody talks about tariffs as the first things. Tariffs are the last thing. Tariffs are a part of the negotiation,\u201d he said. \"The real trick is going to be increase American exports.\u201d Trump scored an early victory Tuesday night when air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier announced it was\u00a0reversing plans to move a factory from Indiana to Mexico after speaking with the president-elect. The decision is expected to save about 1,000 U.S. jobs. \u201cI\u2019s a present from the president,\u201d Ross said. \"Here we have a trade victory before we even come into office.\" business ",

Got it The Debrief: An occasional series offering a reporter\u2019s insights President-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney appear to be allies now, but that hasn't always been the case. Here's a look back at their turbulent relationship. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) By Philip Rucker November 30 at 1:38 PM Follow @PhilipRucker For Republicans fearful of a Donald Trump presidency, Mitt Romney was their voice and conscience. The GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee became the unyielding face of the resistance to the party\u2019s 2016 nominee. Then Trump won. One by one, Republicans who stood up to Trump or questioned his statements and antics have made a pilgrimage to Trump Tower to kiss the president-elect\u2019s ring, or joined his administration, or decided uncharacteristically to just keep their mouths shut. And at long last Tuesday night, the figurehead of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement also capitulated. After an intimate dinner with Trump of frog legs and diver scallops at a fine Manhattan restaurant (in a Trump-owned building, naturally), Romney publicly acquiesced. In an apparent attempt to secure Trump\u2019s trust in him as a possible secretary of state, Romney lavished praise on the president-elect: Trump\u2019s dinner company was \u201cenlightening and interesting and engaging\u201d and his transition appointments give him \u201cincreasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\u201d After meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump's golf course in New Jersey, Mitt Romney described it as 'thorough and in-depth discussion' on areas of the world with particular significance to U.S. interests. Trump said the meeting 'went great'. (The Washington Post) Romney\u2019s turnabout illustrates the power that comes with winning \u2014 the ability to reshuffle the political hierarchy. In less than two months, Trump will be the president of the United States. And with Romney\u2019s move, Trump has officially and almost completely cowed the elements of the Republican Party that had shunned the real estate tycoon and reality-television star during the turbulent campaign. Some Republican Trump critics \u2014 such as Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) \u2014 have shown some signs of resistance and could emerge as counterweights to the new administration on some issues. [ In about-face, Romney emerges from dinner with Trump with high praise ] But so far, at least, their postures have been relatively meek. McCain declared Tuesday that he was finished talking about Trump. Asked to weigh in on Trump\u2019s call to penalize people who burn the American flag with jail time or loss of citizenship, McCain told CNN, \u201cI have not been commenting on Mr. Trump, and I will continue not to comment on Mr. Trump.\u201d There are several reasons Romney and other Republicans who resisted Trump may have decided to bend the knee. For one, they are patriots and want to see the 45th president succeed for the good of the nation. But they also are ambitious and may want to serve in the administration, or at least see no upside to antagonizing a powerful enemy in the Oval Office. \u201cThe GOP is folding like cheap tents to Trump\u2019s authoritarian nature/nationalist message,\u201d Matthew Dowd, formerly a top strategist on President George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns and now an ABC News analyst, tweeted Wednesday morning. President-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney walk out after a meeting at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Nov. 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) In a blistering speech in March, Romney called Trump a \u201ccon man,\u201d a \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201cphony\u201d who would lead the country to recession and peril. \u201cHe has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president, and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill,\u201d Romney said. But late Tuesday, after his dinner with Trump, Romney delivered a 332-word statement to the media that tried to wash all of that away. He also sounded a note of humility and subservience. \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s not easy winning,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that myself. He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in. He won the general election and he continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\u201d [ From enemies to allies: How the Trump-Romney divide began to heal ] This may not have been the public apology that Trump\u2019s ardent loyalists have demanded, but Romney\u2019s groveling no doubt pleased the president-elect. In another tweet Wednesday, Dowd wrote, \u201cThe degree of difficulty in Romney\u2019s dive last night was greater than a reverse 4\u00bd somersault in tuck position. Stunning flipflop.\u201d Romney is a finalist to serve as Trump\u2019s secretary of state. People familiar with Romney\u2019s thinking say he is eager to return to public service and feels a sense of patriotic duty to help the new president. Since ending his 2012 campaign, Romney has become increasingly animated by world affairs and spent considerable time reimagining the United States\u2019 place in the world after the Obama years. So he sees serving as the nation\u2019s top diplomat to be a natural assignment. Ross Douthat, a conservative columnist, wrote recently in the New York Times about the dilemma Republicans who opposed Trump face during this transition phase. \u201cIf they fear how Trump might govern, can they in good conscience work for him?\u201d Douthat wrote. \u201cThe answer, for now, is that they can and should \u2014 and indeed, precisely because they fear how Trump might govern, there is a moral responsibility to serve.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s dinner, Romney and Trump were joined by Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman and incoming White House chief of staff, who is close to both men. Priebus described the conversation as productive and relaxed, saying they talked not only about foreign policy but also about sports, bonding over their shared regard for the New England Patriots and star quarterback Tom Brady. Asked Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d whether Trump and Romney had reached a personal comfort level, Priebus said: \u201cOh, I think so. I mean, I think it\u2019s getting to that point.\u201d [ The Fix: Mitt Romney\u2019s stunning 180 on Donald Trump ] He added: \u201cObviously there\u2019s a lot of respect, I think, for each other. And I think the relationship has built over time. They\u2019ve talked many times on the phone.\u201d As Trump has met with dozens of potential appointees and other political and business leaders in recent weeks, his advisers have stressed their ideological diversity and the fact that many did not support him or offered their support only nominally. Consider, for instance, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. She spoke out against Trump during the primaries. After he won the Republican nomination, she eventually supported him, but she did little to help him in the general election. Yet after the election, she hit it off with Trump, and he was impressed enough with her to nominate her to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most inherently curious people I\u2019ve ever met in my life,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Tuesday night on Fox News. \u201cTo be in these meetings \u2014 we\u2019ve had this galaxy of extraordinary men and women from a broad range of backgrounds, you know, many Republicans, even some Democrats who have come in and sat down.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "OSU attack suspect visited Washington DC area days earlier, source says Published               November 30, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 An Ohio State University student who injured 11 people when he attacked pedestrians on campus with a car and a knife traveled to the Washington D.C. area days before Monday's assault, a law enforcement source told Fox News.\u00a0 The source said Abdul\u00a0Razak Ali Artan, 18, arrived late on Nov. 24 and left the following day. The short duration of the trip suggested his visit was \"purposeful,\" the source added. FBI agents are now seeking court approval to get records from Artan's phone and Internet service provider, which can help determine where he travelled in the D.C. area and whether he contacted anyone. OSU TERROR SUSPECT'S RADICALIZING VIDEOS MAY HAVE INCLUDED ALL-AMERICAN ADVERTISEMENTS Artan was shot and killed by a university police officer shortly after he began his attack Monday. Because of Artan's death and the lack of evidence\u00a0that he was connected to a larger group, the FBI's requests are being processed through regular channels.\u00a0 Investigators confirmed earlier Wednesday that Artan \"may have been inspired\" by the ISIS terror group, though they aren't aware of any direct contact between ISIS and the attacker.\u00a0 Angela Byers, the FBI special agent in charge of the Cincinnati division, said investigators have\u00a0not found evidence that anyone else was involved in the attack or the planning of it. Authorities are trying to piece together a gap of several hours between the time Artan bought a knife at a Wal-Mart near his home and the attack. Police don't know if that was the same weapon he used on campus, investigators said. #OSU : 11th high profile terror incident in the U.S. since 2009 involving a suspect tied to or inspired by U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. pic.twitter.com/4ozL7uZEEQ \u2014 Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) November 30, 2016 In a series of Facebook posts hours before the attack, Artan\u00a0praised American-born Al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki as a \u201chero\u201d and warned of more Muslims in sleeper cells. Al-Awlaki has been cited as inspiration by numerous terror suspects over the years, including the brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon, the Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, and, more recently, the man charged in bombings in New York and New Jersey. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told the Associated Press it seems clear Artan was radicalized online. He also said there doesn't seem to be much time between the onset of Artan's apparent radicalization and the attack, a period known in law enforcement and intelligence circles as \"flash to bang.\" That trend has disquieted law enforcement officials, who fear disaffected individuals are being inspired to violence after being only briefly exposed to radical ideology. \"This may be one of those cases which was just unpreventable,\" he said, adding that there was no evidence yet to suggest Artan had been publicly communicating radical intentions over a long period of time. He said the fact that Artan may have been inspired by a cleric killed five years ago shows the \"limits of taking people off the battlefield.\" \"As long as you have disaffected or alienated young people who are searching for something to belong to, the lure of this radical propaganda will continue to be very dangerous,\" Schiff said. Fox News' Catherine Herridge and the Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

(Photo: Amy Smotherman Burgess, Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel) SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Seven people now have been confirmed dead in the wildfires that swept Gatlinburg this week, authorities\u00a0said Wednesday. Early assessments indicate\u00a0more than 700 homes and businesses have been damaged or destroyed across Sevier County as flames\u00a0whipped in high\u00a0winds raged through town Monday night into Tuesday morning and displaced more than 14,000 residents in Gatlinburg alone, Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said.\u00a0Fire officials said that number includes about 300 buildings inside\u00a0Gatlinburg city limits. Witnesses called the inferno unlike any in the past century, and officials estimate that the wildfires have consumed more than 15,000 acres in the Great Smoky Mountains. A firefighter also received minor injuries in fighting the blaze, Waters said. The search continues for others who might have been killed or injured but not discovered because of blocked roads and power outages. Smell from Gatlinburg wildfires blows to southern Mich. \"We are trying to get into every area,\" Waters said. At least three people trapped because of fire damage had been rescued by Wednesday afternoon. The names of those killed have not been released. Three bodies were found Tuesday in Chalet Village North, an area of vacation rental cabins, another three were found Wednesday afternoon in a home on Campbell Lead Road, and one was discovered in a burned-out hotel off U.S. 321. Eight new fires erupted Tuesday into Wednesday, mostly brush fires, but one was a vacant home, Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller said. The heavy rains that followed the fires have created new challenges\u00a0as firefighters continue to check hot spots and assess damages. \"We're experiencing small rockslides and mudslides as we have to go back into areas we previously thought were accessible,\" the chief said. The blaze apparently began when embers from a wildfire on nearby Chimney Tops Trail in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park\u00a0wafted Monday night into the Twin Creek and Mynatt Park areas of Gatlinburg as already heavy winds doubled in speed, Miller said.

A lot of evacuees have been able to connect with\u00a0friends and family and find a place to stay. Inside the shelter stacks of food, bottled water, personal hygiene items and diapers. Local restaurants have donated hot prepared food as well. The shelter also has an abundance of pet food and pet supplies.

Right now the shelter has too much and workers are trying to channel some of the items back into the community, he said. \"If people want to help, we've got everything we need right now,\" Lewis said.

Joel Michael Guy Jr. was arrested Tuesday on a fugitive warrant in Baton Rouge, the Knox County Sheriff's Office said. He's accused of killing his parents, Joel Michael Guy Sr., 61, and Lisa Guy, 55. They are believed to have been killed Friday or Saturday. The Tennessee sheriff's office, in a news release, said both victims were stabbed and dismembered, with remains found in multiple rooms in the house. Portions of the remains were discovered in an acid-based solution, in an apparent attempt to destroy evidence. \"Both suffered multiple, vicious stab wounds as well as dismemberment,\" sheriff's Maj. Michael MacLean tells WBIR-TV ( http://on.wbir.com/2gWsmMA ). He called the crime scene \"gruesome.\" \"It would be described as horrific \u2014 a very gruesome crime scene,\" said MacLean, adding that there was no indication why the remains were scattered. Authorities said the suspect, who lives in Baton Rouge and attended LSU until last year, had visited his parents for the Thanksgiving holiday. The parents were last seen Friday. Signs indicate they struggled, said MacLean, who added that authorities believe Guy stayed in the house after the bodies were dismembered. Investigators spent much of Monday going through the couple's home after they were told the mother didn't show up for work. MacLean said authorities with the FBI, the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office placed Guy under surveillance during the past few days and apprehended him at his Baton Rouge apartment Tuesday when he tried to get into his 2006 Hyundai Sonata. Guy has declined to talk with authorities. Online jail records did not list an attorney for him. MacLean has said Guy allegedly needed money and met with his parents to discuss that issue. He said Guy has two sisters in Maryville and another in Kingsport. The sheriff's office spoke with them but they told investigators their brother didn't give them any indication that anything was wrong. Officials expect to return him to Knox County in the next couple of days. 0 Shares ",

(Chicago Tribune/Antonio Perez) Steve Schmadeke and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune An undercover sting on Chicago's South Side ended in a hail of bullets after two reputed gang members opened fire after handing over three handguns in exchange for $1,500 from an undercover informant,Cook County prosecutors said Wednesday. The joint operation by the FBI and Chicago police targeted illegal gun sales, prosecutors said, but it went sour quickly on Monday morning. Prosecutors said Jose Guzman, 21, a reputed Latin King gang member, had just completed the guns-for-cash trade in the 6100 block of South Kolmar Avenue when a cohort, Jose Gurumendi, 22, strode out of a gangway and fired three shots at the informant's vehicle, prosecutors said. Officers and agents conducting surveillance saw Gurumendi, a reputed Maniac Latin Disciple, open fire and then flee with Guzman into the back of a waiting car containing two others, said Assistant State's Attorney Lorraine Scaduto. Authorities attempted to box the car in at 61st Street, with one officer getting out of his vehicle with his gun drawn, but the vehicle eluded them and headed south, she said. Guzman then fired two shots at a Chicago police sergeant driving one of the covert police vehicles and continued to hold his gun out the window until the sergeant backed his vehicle away, she said. \"Use caution! Block them in! They're going to be trapped in there. They're going to have to go on foot soon,\" an officer called out over his radio, according to a recording of scanner traffic. After the gunmen ditched their car near 69th Street and Kenneth Avenue, officers began searching backyards and garages in the West Lawn neighborhood, police said. ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times His proposal would allow parents earning less than $250,000 individually or $500,000 jointly to deduct the average cost of child and elder care from their income taxes. In a nod to social conservatives, he said parents who stayed home with children would also get the child care tax deduction. \u201cThe idea here is letting the family choose how the money is spent,\u201d said Bradford Wilcox, director of the national marriage project at the University of Virginia. For low-income families, Mr. Trump proposed child care spending rebates as part of the earned-income tax credit. He also said he would make pretax dependent care savings accounts available to everyone, not just people whose employers offer them, and give tax deductions to employers that offer on-site child care. Democrats have favored refundable tax credits over deductions because they say they are more helpful to lower-income families, who might not make enough to pay income taxes. Also, credits directly reduce someone\u2019s tax bill, while deductions reduce taxable income but not necessarily the final bill. Democrats see the ultimate goal as high-quality, universal care for young children. There seems to be bipartisan support for a small step in that direction. Advertisement \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got there is a tremendous amount of support from women \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2014 to move forward,\u201d said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee. Apprenticeships Mr. Trump has pledged to create 25 million jobs over the next decade. Analysts and policy makers on both sides of the aisle say one route toward that goal is apprenticeships. They are viewed as a way for people to acquire vocational skills while earning money, as opposed to attending college and building up debt. Not only would they address unemployment among people without college degrees, advocates say, but they could also lead to more stable families. The unemployment of working-class men has been a prime reason for the decline in marriage and rise in single motherhood, researchers have found. When job opportunities are plentiful, people are more likely to marry before having their first child, Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins, found in a study published in August in the American Sociological Review. \u201cIt\u2019s likely if we can improve the job picture for working-class young adults, they\u2019d have family lives that are more stable,\u201d he said. The construction industry already uses apprentices, so perhaps Mr. Trump is familiar with their benefits, said Robert I. Lerman, a fellow at the Urban Institute. They would be possible in a range of fast-growing industries, like health care and information technology, he said, and in white-collar jobs like hotel management. They could also be useful in putting people to work building the new infrastructure that Mr. Trump has promised. \u201cPeople want to have earnings, they want to have dignity, they want to show that they\u2019ve been able to master a certain profession, and that gives them a kind of identity,\u201d Mr. Lerman said. \u201cIt has both a social as well as an economic dimension.\u201d Though the idea has received bipartisan support, some Republicans have resisted registered apprenticeships, which are overseen by the Labor Department, because of their association with unions. Some Democrats have questioned whether apprenticeships lead to a two-tier wage system, and have focused instead on making college accessible to more people. Policy makers and researchers have a long list of other policy ideas for Mr. Trump that they believe could help blue-collar families. Some have historically appealed to Republicans, like those that encourage marriage. Others, like mandating predictable work schedules for hourly workers, have been promoted by Democrats.

Daily News 8:15 p.m. EST November 30, 2016 x Share A military jeep carries the ashes of Fidel Castro along streets lined with hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Cubans in Havana, starting a four-day journey to his final resting place across the island. Video provided by AFP Newslook The Caravana de la Libertad, or the Caravan of Freedom, transports Fidel Castro's ashes through the town of Matanzas, Cuba, on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. Wednesday marks the first day of the cross-country caravan that started in Havana and will end in Santiago on Saturday, with the funeral to be held Sunday. (Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily News) MATANZAS, Cuba \u2014 When the motorcade carrying Fidel Castro\u2019s ashes approached this northern shore town's Freedom Plaza on Wednesday, the crowd lining the sidewalks, benches, rooftops, balconies and even window bars started to chant his name. \"Yo soy Fidel!\"\u00a0(\u201cI am Fidel!\u201d), hundreds of people shouted in Spanish. \u201cViva Fidel!\u201d\u00a0(\u201cLong live Fidel\u201d). Some carried Cuban flags, many held smartphones to record the moment, and a few cried. And within a moment, the caravan disappeared along the street where thousands of Cubans waited for a glimpse of the urn that held Castro\u2019s ashes, to tell him goodbye. \u201cI have a lump on my throat,\u201d said Juana Inelda Fernandez after she saw him pass in the motorcade, that included a police escort, a military vehicle and a truck pulling a trailer. Crowds gathered Wednesday, the first of three days along the roads the motorcade is traveling from Havana to Santiago de Cuba to deliver the former president's remains to his final resting place. The caravan, which left Havana early Wednesday, is traveling the route Castro followed to reach Havana in January 1959 in his successful rebellion, known as the Caravana de la Libertad, or Freedom Caravan. Castro\u2019s ashes are scheduled to reach Santiago on Saturday, when a public tribute will be held before a private funeral Sunday. People fill the streets waiting for the Caravana de la Libertad, or the Caravan of Freedom, to arrive, transporting Fidel Castro's ashes through the town of Matanzas, Cuba, on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. Wednesday marks the first day of the cross-country caravan, which started in Havana and will end in Santiago on Saturday, with the funeral to be held Sunday. \u00a0(Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily News) Fernandez, 65, said she came to Matanzas, the capital of the province with the same name along the Bay of Matanzas, after walking half an hour. She made the trip after checking with her doctor earlier who is treating her for cancer, which appears to be in remission. She said her father, who worked harvesting sugar cane with a machete, admired Castro. \u201cTake care of him, because like that one, no other is coming,\u201d she said her father used to tell her. Fernandez, who was 9 when Castro launched his revolution, said that as a child she lived with only a change of clothing and a pair of shoes. The school was small and precarious and there weren\u2019t many hospitals. After Castro won, she said, her father\u2019s pay improved, and the school got improvements. Her daughter is now an engineer. On Wednesday, she remembered her father, who died five years ago. \u201cIf he learned about this, I\u2019m sure he would cry,\u201d she said. Thousands expected to rally in Miami for political change in Cuba The image offered by Cubans mourning Castro this week is different from the Communist ruler criticized by others who point to human rights violations, loss of freedoms and the dictatorship he created during his tenure. Unlike those critics, Tamara Olivera's eyes water when she says that, thanks to Fidel Castro, she was able to attend college. \u201cIt marked my whole life,\u201d she said. Olivera, 70, said her older siblings couldn\u2019t do the same because her parents couldn't afford it. Her two brothers became a carpenter and a watch repairman. Her sisters became housewives. Olivera said when Castro arrived in Matanzas in 1959 during his Freedom Caravan, she was in the same square as she was Wednesday to view his remains. All those years ago, it was getting dark when he approached. The radio station had announced he was on his way. \u201cPeople were touching him, to know if it was real,\u201d said Iluminada Curbelo, 68, who sat near Olivera. Elis Aria, left, and her daughter Wendy Brizuela cry as the Caravana de la Libertad, or the Caravan of Freedom, transports Fidel Castro's ashes through the town of Matanzas, Cuba, on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. Wednesday marks the first day of the cross-country caravan that started in Havana and will end in Santiago on Saturday, with the funeral to be held Sunday. \u00a0(Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily News) During his stop, Castro got out of a truck and went to a balcony overlooking what was then the Government Palace to give a speech, Olivera says. That balcony is now marked with a star to commemorate the event. Olivera doesn\u2019t remember what Castro said, but she remembered the square was so crowded people couldn't move. \u201cPeople were happy. They had gone through a lot with the previous regime,\u201d Curbelo said, noting that the Batista government tortured and killed. Olivera said she believes Castro delivered most of what he promised. If he made mistakes, she said, it was due to inexperience, not on purpose. She doesn\u2019t consider the country's current economic situation, where the average salary is about $20 a month, as bad. She has a pension of 270 Cuban pesos, or about $9 a month. \u201cWe went through so much need and misery in the other system that maybe that\u2019s why one values what we have as much,\u201d she said.

(Photo: Collier County Sheriff's Office) Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Leon Orr was arrested Tuesday and faces charges for possession of marijuana and a controlled substance, according to the Collier County Sheriff's Office. Orr, 24, was booked into the Naples Jail Center and posted the $7,000 bond. He faces a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana (not more than 20 grams) and a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance. Deputies stopped Orr on Tuesday afternoon along the\u00a0eastbound lanes of Interstate 75 near the toll plaza, not far from Collier Boulevard, because his black BMW appeared to have illegally tinted windows, an arrest report states. When deputies approached Orr's car, they \"could immediately smell the odor of the marijuana coming from inside the vehicle,\" the report states. Orr told deputies that he had been pulled over for the window tints a week earlier and showed officers the citation, according to the report. Deputies asked Orr to step out of his car and noticed that \"he was adjusting his shorts\" while facing away from the deputies, the report stated. They began patting Orr down for weapons and noticed that\u00a0Orr was \"hesitant\" when they asked him \"to separate his legs,\" according to the report. \"I told him he was hesitant because he had marijuana stuffed down his pants and that he needed to just be honest about it,\" deputies wrote in the report. Because of Orr's \"nervous behavior and hesitation\" to listen to and cooperate with the instructions, deputies detained him, according to the report. After checking Orr, deputies began searching his car. There they found a gray backpack on the front passenger seat floor board. Inside the backpack deputies found \"what appeared to be three glass vials containing what appeared to be marijuana wax,\" the report stated. They also found \"a green plastic bottle containing a red liquid inside,\" according to the report. The front label of the bottle read \"kush syrup\" and the back label said the substance contained cannabis, the report stated. On the front driver's door map pocket deputies found an additional bottle, this one orange in color, with similar labels, according to the report. Deputies tested the substance in the green bottle and results came back positive for THC, according to the report. The wax substance also tested positive for marijuana, the report stated. The drugs, the \"in-car DVD\" and a gun were placed into evidence, according to the report. Orr was recently promoted from the Dolphins' practice squad to the team's 53-man roster, the Sun-Sentinel reported . The defensive tackle was inactive for the Dolphins game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. Orr, a native of Largo, played college football at the University of Florida, but was kicked off the team\u00a0during his senior season when he returned to the Gainesville campus before a road game at Vanderbilt because he was upset he wouldn't be starting, USA Today reported in 2015. The fifth-year senior apologized two days later in a tweet that said he put his family ahead of his team, but then-coach Will Muschamp announced that Orr wouldn't be allowed to return to the program. The Oakland Raiders signed Orr as an undrafted free agent in 2015 and played there three games. The Miami Dolphins signed him to their practice squad in September, the Miami Herald's Barry Jackson reported . Dolphins head coach Adam Gase told reporters Wednesday that he found out about Orr's arrest during practice that day\u00a0and that the team immediately released him. \"We\u2019re in the middle of the season,\" Gase said. \"We have priorities and this is the No. 1 priority. If guys have other priorities, then they can go about their business somewhere else.\u201d Orr has one tackle for the season in five games for the Dolphins. 598 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://nplsne.ws/2gL2YVI ",

Email SAN FRANCISCO -- Officials say a technician with the Cirque du Soleil \u201cLuzia\u201d show who died after being hit in the head by an aerial lift Tuesday is the son of one of the founders of the show. In a statement from Cirque du Soleil, officials confirmed that 42-year-old Olivier Rochette, of Quebec, Canada, died Tuesday night in San Francisco.\u00a0 \u2014 Cirque du Soleil (@Cirque) November 30, 2016 According to the statement, his immediate family, including his father Gilles Ste-Croix, one of the founders of Cirque du Soleil, has been informed of the accident. Police say officers with San Francisco Police Department Traffic Collision Investigation Unit and investigators with the state\u2019s workplace safety regulator, Cal/OSHA, are investigating. Julia Bernstein of Cal/OSHA said Wednesday that the employee was struck in the head by an aerial device. The agency had no further information. The Tuesday and Wednesday night shows were canceled.\u00a0 Cirque du Soleil\u2019s \u201cLuzia\u201d tent in San Francisco was the site of a fatal accident involving the performing arts group\u2019s employees, Nov. 29, 2016.\u00a0 CBS SF Bay Area CBS San Francisco reported , that in the late 1970s, Ste-Croix was living in a commune in Victoriaville, Quebec, picking apples to make money. One day he mused that the job would be a whole lot easier if he could attach the ladder to his legs\u2014and devised his first set of stilts.\u00a0 A friend happened to mention the Bread and Puppet Theater in nearby Vermont, which used stilt-walking as the basis of many of its performances. Ste-Croix went to see the company and realized that his apple-picking skills might actually be in demand in the wider world of entertainment. In 1980, Ste-Croix and a band of street artists founded the \u00c9chassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul and organized a street performance festival called the F\u00eate foraine de Baie-Saint-Paul, which would eventually lead to the founding of Cirque du Soleil with Guy Lalibert\u00e9 in 1984. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(David Zalubowski / AP) Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Cubs thought so highly of Jon Jay that they signed him with the intent that he\u2019ll shore up some of the skills provided by now-retired David Ross and popular Dexter Fowler . \u201cFrom a makeup and leadership standpoint, he\u2019s got an off-the-charts reputation,\u201d general manager Jed Hoyer said Wednesday during a conference call. \u201cWe knew that losing David Ross would be a big void for us, and bringing in a guy like Jon would be important for us. He can come in and complement the good group of young leaders we already have. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel like there were that many guys who could come into a team that just won a World Series and be able to fit that seamlessly and be able to help lead this team. And I think he can, given his reputation and a lot of comments we\u2019ve gotten from his now-teammates indicate his reputation precedes him.\u201d Although Hoyer didn\u2019t completely rule out the return of Fowler, a free agent, the signing of Jay to a one-year, $8 million contract was designed in part to aid the development of Albert Almora Jr., whom Hoyer envisioned as \u201cour center fielder of the future.\u201d But the Cubs remain in a win-now mode, and Hoyer stressed that the bulk of playing time in center field would be based on performance. \u201cWe\u2019re a team that expects to win a lot of games next year,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a performance-driven game. I love the balance of the two of them. \u201cIt\u2019s important for (Almora) to develop in the big leagues and face all kinds of pitchers. But ultimately, this game does come down to performance, and we\u2019ve given Joe (Maddon) two very good options in center field.\u201d Almora was one of a few Cubs players who welcomed the signing of Jay, and Hoyer revealed the two players worked out together last season in their native Miami. \u00a0 Jay was limited to 79 games in 2015 because of a sore left wrist that resulted in a career-low .210 batting average. But Hoyer pointed to Jay\u2019s consistency at the plate, as he has batted .291 or higher in five of his seven seasons. Despite the obvious need for pitching, the Cubs pursued Jay from the start of spring training , dined him at Swift & Sons steakhouse on Nov. 18 before securing a deal. The addition of Jay all but rules out a return by the switch-hitting Fowler, 30, who set a career-high with a .393 on-base percentage and was extremely popular with his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019d never close the door on Dexter, but we are aware it\u2019s something that may not happen for us,\u201d Hoyer said. Hoyer reminded reporters that Fowler wasn\u2019t expected to return last February until preferred offers didn\u2019t crystallize. \u201cWe think Albert is definitely ready to play center field in the big leagues,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe thought what he did both in September and even the postseason offensively and defensively and the terrific base running play in Game 7 (of the World Series), he\u2019s a very instinctive player, a great defensive outfielder,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cJon allows him to ease into that role a little bit if Dexter doesn\u2019t return.\u201d ",

    "text": "Beware: Searching for these popular celebs on the internet could leave you vulnerable to hackers This specific malware, nicknamed Gooligan, has been steadily infecting older versions of Android devices since August of this year; Check Point estimates that 13,000 new devices continue to be breached daily.\u00a0 Once it lives on a user\u2019s Android device, Gooligan exploits known vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to install other apps and malicious software without users\u2019 permission. Using that foothold, attackers can steal users\u2019 email addresses and authentication tokens in order to dive deeper into their extensive personal data stored across Google: Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, etc., Check Point said. \u201cIf you download an infected app ... it gets in under the operating system and gives it access to your Google account, which is tied into your Android phone because Android is from Google, and your Google account is from Google, so you\u2019ve kind of handed them [hackers] the keys to the store,\u201d CNET editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News. Ackerman said only about 20 percent of Android devices are running the latest software updates, so many users are vulnerable when flaws emerge in older versions. Check Point set up a website where individuals can enter the emails associated with their Android devices to check if their Google accounts were breached. If that\u2019s the case, Check Point recommends users immediately install a new operating system and change their Google passwords. Check Point reached out to Google\u2019s security team after uncovering the malware and has been working with Google to investigate the massive breach.\u00a0 \u201cAs always, we take these investigations very seriously and we wanted to share details about our findings and the actions we\u2019ve taken so far,\u201d Adrian Ludwig, Google\u2019s director of Android security, said in a statement \u00a0confirming Check Point\u2019s findings.\u00a0 Check Point Software Technologies Ludwig outlined the steps Google has taken against this latest threat, which include strengthening security to block Android users from installing unverified apps from outside Google Play; deleting apps associated with the malware from affected devices and from Google Play; and working with internet service providers to take down the infrastructure that supports the malware.\u00a0 Google has contacted all the users known so far to be affected, the company said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

In the mountains above the beaches of Malibu, a neighborly dispute is underway -- between man and mountain lion.\u00a0 \u201cLast night he went to the petting zoo and killed a sheep and pygmy goat and ate the goat,\u201d said Wendell Phillips.\u00a0 Wendell Phillips with some of his alpacas.\u00a0 CBS News Like many here in the Santa Monica mountains, Phillips keeps exotic animals on his ranch. Five of his alpacas were recently killed by a predator known as P-45. He struck again next door, killing 10 alpacas, a goat and a sheep. Phillips now has a state permit to shoot the mountain lion. \u201cNo one wants to kill an animal, he is an animal I wish we could preserve his life. But I don\u2019t want to keep donating my animals to the food chain,\u201d Phillips said.\u00a0 Roughly 6,000 mountain lions live in California, and the largest group in Southern California roams just 40 miles from Los Angeles. \u00a0Many are tracked by the National Park Service. P-45, as he\u2019s known, has a GPS collar that logs every move. Mountain lion known as P-45.\u00a0 \u201cWe know he was there at the time. So it\u2019s pretty darn likely that it was him,\u201d said Seth Riley. Riley is a wildlife ecologist studying the mountain lions in the area, where more than 50 ranch animals have been killed in the last year. In Riley\u2019s eyes the solution is pretty simple.\u00a0 \u201c...which is to protect livestock,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that means is bringing them in to full enclosures at night, they wont be vulnerable.\u201d Phillips said hunting the lion is another option. But Riley said it\u2019s not a solution.\u00a0 \u201cWell definitely not in the long run...because there are other mountain lions out there,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Phillips has one week left to find P-45 before his permit runs out So, for now, the hunter will remain the hunted. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Email SAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 One of two inmates who sawed their way out of a Northern California county jail and vanished last week was recaptured late Tuesday after he crashed through a ceiling while hiding from police in his sister\u2019s attic, officials said Wednesday. Santa Clara County Undersheriff Carl Neusel said Laron Campbell, 26, was arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service and Antioch police. Campbell\u2019s sister, Marcaysha Alexander, 24, was also arrested on suspicion of harboring a fugitive. Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Mike Glennon said authorities received \u201cnumerous tips\u201d that helped authorities locate Campbell after Sheriff Laurie Smith announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to the fugitives\u2019 recapture. Authorities are still searching for Rogelio Chavez, who was awaiting trial on several felony charges, including burglary, extortion, false imprisonment, resisting arrest and firearms violations. Campbell has been in jail since February 2015 on felony charges that include robbery, false imprisonment and making criminal threats. Chavez and Campbell escaped with two other prisoners the night before Thanksgiving by cutting through bars covering a second-story window and then rappelling to the ground on a rope fashioned from bedsheets. The two other prisoners were quickly apprehended. But Chavez and Campbell eluded a massive manhunt that night and several subsequent raids of places the two were thought hiding, including a San Jose mobile home that heavily armed deputies surrounded early Tuesday with no success. In the process, a 35-year-old San Jose woman was arrested on suspicion of helping Chavez hide in a Gilroy motel raided Monday. Glennon said Campbell was tracked to his sister\u2019s home on Monday and authorities with the U.S. Marshals Service and Antioch Police launched a stake out. Glennon said a raid was planned for Tuesday night and a warrant obtained after officials spotted Campbell in the house. Glennon said Campbell fled into the home\u2019s attic when authorities burst into the house. But he came crashing down through the flimsy roof shortly after and was taken into custody without further incident. Glennon said authorities are looking into where Campbell spent his week on the lam and investigating if he received help beyond the alleged assistance of his sister. Chavez and Campbell are facing possible life sentences if convicted of their pending charges. They are also expected to face new charges related to their escapes.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

She looked around to see what was happening and saw a stranger coming straight at her with a butcher knife. They locked eyes and then he said something she will never forget. \"I'm going to kill you.\" A young woman is led to an ambulance by emergency personnel following an attack at Ohio State University's campus in Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 28. Colin Hass-Hill / The Lantern via Reuters The young man who would later be identified as Abdul Razak Ali Artan slashed at her left arm, the blade slicing through the sleeve of her L.L. Bean ski jacket and into her skin. Strausbaugh, 27, told NBC News it happened so quickly she didn't even have time to be scared. But she ran away from Artan as fast as she could. \"Your instincts take over,\" she said. \"I just knew I had to get away as soon as possible.\" She dashed to the entrance of the nearest building, where someone with a swipe card ushered her into a locked computer lab. Inside, an \"amazing girl\" took a scarf from around Strausbaugh's neck and fashioned it into a tourniquet for her bloody arm, she said. \"A boy was holding my hand and saying, 'You are OK,'\" she recalled. \"It was so amazing how so many people tried to help me.\" Play Ohio State University Victim Recounts Attack 3:25 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161201023928if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/820226627552\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Outside, a campus police officer killed Artan with shots to the head and chest after he refused to drop the knife, according to officials. The 18-year-old was a student at Ohio State, too. That morning he bought a knife at Walmart, posted a rant with references to ISIS and radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki to Facebook and drove his older brother's car to campus. A suspected gas leak had just forced the evacuation of Watts Hall. Students and faculty were milling about on the sidewalk outside, waiting for the all-clear to return to class when Artan roared onto the scene. \"The fire truck hadn't pulled away 30 seconds before when I heard a lot of screaming and people shouting,\" said a 21-year-old science major, who asked that her name not be used. \"I turned around and it looked like a big mass coming toward me,\" she said. \"There were tires screeching and everything and I got out of the way.\" A car which police say was used by an attacker to plow into a group of students is seen outside Watts Hall on Ohio State University's campus. HANDOUT / Reuters The Honda Civic mounted the curb and slammed into a large planter. The rear swung around and clipped several people, including the science major, who was knocked to the ground. \"I thought it was an accident,\" she said. \"I looked to see if the driver was OK and then I saw him pull out a knife and then I knew \u2014 this was not an accident.\" Artan, she said, \"let out a war cry.\" \"He was angry and full of hate. He did start chasing people. I didn't stick around.\" She ended up with some contusions and bruised bones. \"I consider myself really lucky,\" she said. \"If I was a couple of feet to the left, I would have been hit with a more forceful part of the car. Maybe I wouldn't have been able to get up and run away. Who knows what would have happened?\" Strausbaugh walked away with 12 stitches in her arm and two starkly different memories \u2014 of the stranger who wanted to kill her and the strangers who rushed to her aid. \"It restored my faith in humanity,\" she said of the aftermath. \"It's like something terrible can happen but you are immediately surrounded by so much help and love.\" Tracy Connor ",

(Joe Mazza photo) Chris JonesChicago Tribune \"Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind,\" one of the longest running shows in Chicago history and a fixture at the Neo-Futurarium in Andersonville, is to close Dec. 31. The comedic, sketch-style production, which has played since 1988, reached thousands of audience members, and is known for featuring 30 plays in 60 minutes, appears to be the victim of a dispute between Greg Allen, who created the piece, and The Neo-Futurists, his longtime collaborators, former artistic home, and, for many years, his licensee. In a statement sent Wednesday to the Tribune, Allen said he planned to proceed independently producing \"Too Much Light\" with a new diverse company that \"embraces a specifically socially activist mission.\" Allen cited a desire to \"combat the new Trump administration.\" He also said his new company would be composed entirely of performers who represented \"disenfranchised voices.\" He did not specify when or where the show would reopen. For its part, in a separate statement, the Neo-Futurists said they were \"surprised\" by the news that Allen was pulling the show and proceeding independently, and the statement cited numerous \"artistic differences\" and \"irreconcilable personality conflicts\" with the founder over the years. The company, who long has relied on the income from the show staged on the corner of Ashland Avenue and Foster Avenue, also said it planned to open a new late-night production of its own devising in 2017. But the title will have to change. CJones5@chicagotribune.com ",

Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. hide caption toggle caption Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., won re-election as House minority leader on Wednesday with support from just over two-thirds of her caucus. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Nancy Pelosi beat back her toughest challenge yet to her leadership of Democrats in the House of Representatives, defeating Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan to secure another term as House minority leader. The California Democrat got 134 votes to Ryan's 63 in a secret ballot vote on Wednesday. Pelosi had boasted going into the vote that she had support from two-thirds of the caucus, and she received just over that amount. Ohio Congressman Will Try To Take Down Pelosi As House Democratic Leader Pelosi, 76, has held the top slot in House Democratic leadership since 2003. She became the first female speaker of the House in history when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006. But since they suffered devastating losses in 2010, the liberal San Francisco congresswoman has faced questions about whether she's the best one to lead the minority party in the House. After Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010, she faced a challenge from then-North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler, who drew 43 votes. Ryan's 63 votes is the most serious defection she has faced. The debate over who was best to lead the House Democrats, who are now entering their sixth year in the minority, was emblematic of the larger debate over the direction of the party after Hillary Clinton suffered a surprising and stinging loss in the presidential race to Donald Trump. House Democrats had hoped to pick up as many as 15 or 20 seats to cut into Republicans' 30-seat edge. Instead, they flipped only six seats, a disappointing showing to many Democrats. Article continues after sponsorship Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, fell short in his effort to topple Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic House minority leader. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, fell short in his effort to topple Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic House minority leader. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump's upset came after he was able to win narrow victories in a handful of Rust Belt states, such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, delivering him the Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. Many of the seats Democrats were unable to win back also came in more working class, rural areas of those states. Ryan argued that the party needed someone who understands blue collar voters as well as new, younger blood in leadership. The 43-year-old Democrat argued he was better equipped to do that, coming from the manufacturing hub of Youngstown, Ohio. Ryan's home county had even flipped to Trump by six points after previously voting for President Obama by 22 points just four years ago. Pelosi mocked that loss in an interview with the Huffington Post , saying he \"didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton.\" But others saw it as a sign that Ryan was the type of Democrat who could win over working class voters better than someone from ultra-liberal San Francisco.

Authorities said they are still working on identifying the deceased. The blaze -- which has devastated the cities of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and surrounding areas -- has also injured 53 people, scorched more than 700 homes and forced thousands to evacuate, officials said. SLIDESHOW: SLIDESHOW: Wildfires Devastate Eastern Tennessee Town Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam said that the wildfire is the state's biggest in 100 years. Gov. Haslam spoke with President Obama Wednesday, according to the White House. \"The President expressed his deepest condolences for the lives lost in the fire as well as his sympathies for the affected residents who may have lost their homes or businesses,\" read a statement from the White House. \"The President asked the Governor for an update on the ongoing response, and committed to providing the assistance necessary to combat this fire.\" \"I've never seen anything like this in the county, and we'll never see anything like it again,\" said Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters. The fire was exacerbated on Tuesday by what authorities have described as \"hurricane-force\" winds of up to 87 mph. The heavy winds have presented a challenge to firefighters, who said that fallen trees have limited access to certain areas, according to Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller. Brian Blanco/Getty Images The remains of a van and home smolder in the wake of a wildfire, Nov. 30, 2016 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Though heavy rain helped suppress the fire today, it also presented new challenges, Miller said. Firefighters are now experiencing some rock and mudslides, he said. The fire chief added that unless the rain penetrates deep into the brush fire, there is still a threat. Brian Blanco/Getty Images Smoke fills the air and surrounds businesses and resorts in the wake of a wildfire, Nov. 30, 2016, in downtown Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Over 200 firefighters remained on the ground this morning, according to Miller. Gatlinburg mayor Mike Werner said at a news conference on Tuesday that it was a \"devastating time\" for the city but that its people were \"strong and resilient.\" There are still areas that authorities are trying to reach, Werner said, noting that \"nobody had a clue\" the fire would spread \"that fast.\" Brian Blanco/Getty Images The remains of a business are pictured in the wake of a wildfire, Nov. 30, 2016, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The blaze was \"a scary sight to see,\" he said, adding that \"people were basically running for their lives.\" Officials from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency have said that it is likely that 14,000 residents and visitors have been evacuated from the city of Gatlinburg alone. Numerous roads remain closed and blocked by fallen trees and power lines as a result of the fires, officials said. 0 Shares ",

Authorities have recovered the black boxes at the accident site outside Medellin. There were reports the plane may have suffered electrical failure or run out of fuel. The father of a team member who was not on the flight said, \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. There are no words to explain it.\u201d The Chapes, as they were affectionately called, played in obscurity for decades. In 2014, they were promoted to Brazil\u2019s top soccer division. There were no big stars, but with each match, the underdog\u2019s following grew. Last week, the Chapes celebrated their unlikely berth in the finals of the second most important club tournament on the continent. \u201cNot just Brazil, but all of South America is mourning and just grieving this. \u2026 It\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t come along that often, and to have it end the way it did is really just horrifically sad,\u201d USA Today Sports columnist Nancy Armour said. Their opponent said the Chapes should be named South American Cup champions. In a gesture of solidarity, other Brazilian teams have offered to help them rebuild by loaning out their own players. Last night Pope Francis also sent his condolences to all those who are mourning the tragedy. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Matt Pearce) It remains unclear how much the loss in ad revenue will hurt Breitbart. The media company is privately held and doesn\u2019t discuss its business operations. But Chief Executive Larry Solov recently told the Los Angeles Times that the company relies on advertising for the majority its revenue and that it uses multiple ad networks. The company said Wednesday that Kellogg\u2019s decision \u201cwill make virtually no revenue impact.\u201d It said the move by Kellogg and other companies represents an escalation in the war \u201cagainst conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.\u201d Breitbart is rumored to receive significant backing from the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who has been a key supporter of Trump. The site was founded a decade ago by journalist Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012, and has an editorial staff of about 100 worldwide. The site has seen a surge in popularity in the months leading up to the election and is planning to expand its footprint into France and Germany to capitalize on the nationalist movements gaining steam in Europe as a result of the continent\u2019s refugee crisis. On Wednesday, some of Breitbart\u2019s top brass took to social media to take aim at the advertising defectors, describing Kellogg as \u201cbigotry for breakfast.\u201d \u201cFar, far, far more bigotry comes from the left than the right,\u201d said Alex Marlow, Breitbart\u2019s editor in chief, on Twitter.\u00a0 Caption Why 'The Red Turtle' has no dialogue Director\u00a0Michael Dudok de Wit explains why \"The Red Turtle\" has no dialogue.

Time Nivaldo, a 42-year-old goalkeeper for Chapecoense, announced his retirement on Wednesday, a day after 19 of his teammates died in a plane crash. (Photo: MB Media, Getty Images) His full title\u00a0is Jose Nivaldo Martins Constante,\u00a0but as is the custom in Brazilian soccer, he is known by a single name\u2014\u00a0Nivaldo. He is a 42-year-old goalkeeper, a handsome, athletic man, typically full of energy and humor, but whose face is drawn and eyes are bloodshot now. He hasn\u2019t slept since the news came in, they say. Few\u00a0in Chapeco have. Nivaldo came to Chapecoense, the Brazilian soccer club had 19 team members die in an airplane crash\u00a0Tuesday, a decade ago. He didn\u2019t come for the money, not with the organization then mired in financial crisis. He wasn\u2019t drawn in by the prospect of fame or prestige, not during a period when Chapecoense was rooted three divisions below the top level of Brazilian soccer. He came for a chance. Nivaldo and Chapecoense rose together. The goalkeeper found confidence and authority as he moved\u00a0through his 30s. He became a team leader, and his game flourished. The fans and his teammates loved him. Chapecoense made a fairy-tale ascent through the divisions, and Nivaldo was its ringleader. He pulled on the jersey for 299 games. Chapecoense vows to compete, possibly with borrowed players As of this season, Chapecoense was suddenly a contender, making waves in Brazil\u2019s top division and embarking on an inspirational run to the final of the continental Copa Sudamericana tournament. They were on their way from a league match in Sao Paulo to the first leg of the final, against Atletico Nacional in Colombia, when the plane went down. But Nivaldo was not on the flight. He\u00a0had not been playing much of late, his age having caught up with him and a new, thrilling young keeper, Danilo, having taken over. Instead Nivaldo was told to stay home and rest up for a swansong match, his 300th appearance in the colors, that will now never happen. \u201cAs there was a change in the trip, the team would not return to Chapeco and instead go straight from Sao Paulo to Medellin,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. \u201cSo Caio (the coach) said he would not take me.\u201d The tale of the goalkeepers of this club are a subplot in themselves in a story where the word tragedy barely suffices. Chapecoense striker had just found out he would be a dad There was reserve keeper Marcelo Boeck, who was allowed to stay home instead of making the ill-fated trip so that he could enjoy his birthday celebration. There is Jackson Follmann, one of the\u00a0few survivors, who underwent a leg\u00a0amputation in the hours after the crash. And there was Danilo, the charismatic first choice and reluctant hero of this season\u2019s dramatics, who initially survived but died of his injuries. Danilo\u2019s final moments were spent uttering a few words, by telephone, to his wife. It is all so sad that it is impossible to process. Perhaps at some point the video of players laughing and joking on cell phone video as the plane prepared for takeoff will provide fond memories instead of sending a chill through the bones. x Share Several players on the Chapecoense soccer team shared their smiles and excitement on social media as they boarded their flight to Colombia. Their plane crashed on the way to the Copa Sudamerica finals in Medellin. USA TODAY NETWORK It is a sense of haunting that can be seen and felt most starkly through the faces of those who, through some confluence of fate or circumstance, were not among those who perished. And it was seen on the face of Nivaldo on Wednesday and he struggled to find the words to pay tribute to his fallen friends. He would play no longer, he said. Not without his brothers, not without those who lost. \u201cEverything has a reason in life,\u201d he said, as he explained how it came about that he was not on the flight. His is a burden that will be carried by the survivors and by those who did not travel, whether through injury or happenstance or, in one case, a forgotten passport. Quite rightly, there are no thoughts of soccer right now. Brazil\u2019s league games have been cancelled this week and there is every chance that Chapecoense will not play for the rest of this season and be protected from relegation for three future campaigns. But there will come a time when the team takes the field again amid a flood of emotion. Dealing with such things is not about strength or character, much as movies screenwriters would like to have us think. Survivor\u2019s guilt is a brutal, overwhelming, crushing phenomenon. The more you loved, the more you hurt. The bitter squeeze of heartache is a tortured tale that can be told in endless ways. Each of those who were lost, each player, coach, journalist or crewmember, had their own story. As the world remembers them so too must thoughts be spared for but for fate could have joined them. Those, like Nivaldo, whose story continues, albeit altered forever. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

South America\u2019s soccer federation canceled all scheduled matches in a show of solidarity, while the Real Madrid and Barcelona clubs in Spain interrupted their training sessions for a minute of silence. Brazil\u2019s top teams offered to lend players to the small club for next season as it rebuilds, saying: \u201cIt is the minimum gesture of solidarity that is within our reach.\u201d In a moving gesture, Atletico Nacional asked that the championship title be given to Chapecoense, whose upstart run in the tournament electrified soccer-crazed Brazil. Three players were among the survivors. Alan Ruschel was reported in the most serious condition, facing surgery for a spinal fracture. Teammates Helio Zampier and Jakson Follmann also suffered multiple trauma injuries, and doctors had to amputate Follmann\u2019s right leg. View Gallery Members of the first-division Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense are seen on the field before the start of play during a match in Brazil, in a photo posted to the team\u2019s Facebook page, Nov. 21, 2016. A chartered plane carrying the team to Medellin, Colombia, crashed before landing on Nov. 28, 2016.\u00a0 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol/Facebook \u201cThe chances of surviving an airplane crash are practically zero. That my son is one of the survivors is a miracle of God,\u201d Follman told The Associated Press. A journalist also underwent surgery and two Bolivian crew members were in stable condition, hospital officials said. The aircraft is owned by LaMia, a charter company that started in Venezuela but later relocated to Bolivia, where it was certified to operate last January. Despite apparently limited experience, the airline has a close relationship with several premier South American soccer squads. Earlier this month, the plane involved in the crash transported Barcelona forward Lionel Messi and Argentina\u2019s national team from Brazil following a World Cup qualifying match. The airliner also appeared to have transported the national squads of Brazil, Bolivia and Venezuela in the last three months, according to a log of recent activity provided by Flightradar24.com. Before being taken offline, LaMia\u2019s website said it operated three 146 Avro short-haul jets made by British Aerospace, with a maximum range of around 2,965 kilometers (1,600 nautical miles) - about the distance between Santa Cruz and Medellin. Hans Weber, a longtime adviser to U.S. aviation authorities, said the aircraft\u2019s range deserves careful investigation. He noted that air distance between cities is usually measured by the shortest route but planes rarely fly in a straight line, with pilots steering around turbulence or changing course for other reasons. Given the model of the plane and the fact that it was flying close to capacity, \u201cI would be concerned that the pilots may have been cutting it too close,\u201d Weber said. A spokesman for Bolivia\u2019s civil aviation agency, Cesar Torrico, said the plane was inspected before departing for Colombia and no problems were reported. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Drew Harwell November 30 at 4:45 PM Follow @drewharwell Donald Trump delivers a policy speech during a campaign stop on June 28 in Monessen, Pa. (Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) President-elect Donald J. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he would soon leave his \u201cgreat business in total\u201d to focus on the presidency, a response to growing worries over the businessman-in-chief\u2019s\u00a0conflicts of interest\u00a0around the globe. Shortly after, the official Twitter account of the Office of Government Ethics, the traditionally staid federal agency that often works closely with presidential transition teams, issued a rapid-fire series of tweets celebrating that Trump had committed to fully divesting his company stake \u2014 though Trump has publicly said no such thing. The back-to-back tweetstorms raised more questions than they answered: whether Trump\u2019s move would focus on severing his\u00a0ownership ties, or simply his management responsibilities; and whether the OGE was releasing new information or simply the victim of a hacker, prankster or official gone rogue. The OGE\u2019s messages were deeply out of character for a federal ethics agency that is\u00a0famously quiet and unadventurous. Among the nine tweets: \u201c@realDonaldTrump Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!\u201d The tweets were first posted Wednesday morning, then deleted within an hour. They then reappeared at 1 p.m.,\u00a0for unknown reasons. In a 1:30 p.m. statement from the OGE\u2019s email account, attributed to OGE spokesman Seth Jaffe, the agency said, \u201cLike everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect\u2019s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don\u2019t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.\u201d A second statement at 3:30 p.m. added, \u201cThe tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE\u2019s tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect\u2019s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\u201d Phone messages left with a dozen agency executives and representatives seeking verification or more details were not returned. OGE lawyers have\u00a0been influential in past presidents\u2019\u00a0decision making, but their advice\u00a0has almost always been kept confidential. If nothing else, the OGE\u2019s tweets have publicly revealed federal-ethics officials\u2019 preference for the president-elect to completely divest \u2014 a form of lobbying that is potentially unprecedented for the agency. The messages surprised many who had worked with the agency in the past: Brett Kappel, a Washington campaign-finance lawyer who has worked with OGE, said the agency \u201cnever tweets about an individual federal official\u2019s ethics issues unless they are announcing the conclusion of an enforcement action.\u201d . @realDonaldTrump this divestiture does what handing over control could never have done. \u2014 U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016 The tweets followed\u00a0Trump\u2019s morning announcement, which appeared to echo his long insistence that he would cede the company\u2019s management to his children, a way of putting distance\u00a0between\u00a0his private interests and public power. But\u00a0it remained unclear whether the new arrangement would include a full sale of Trump\u2019s stake in the company. Ethics advisers said a management hand-off to his children would not resolve worries that the business could still influence his\u00a0decisions in the Oval Office. \u201cI will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my\u00a0great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Trump tweeted . \u201cWhile I am not mandated to\u00a0do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.\u00a0Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus on Nov. 20 addressed Trump's potential conflicts of interest. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [ A scramble to assess the dangers of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s global business empire ] Presidents are not bound by the strict conflict-of-interest laws\u00a0governing most U.S. elected officials. But most modern presidents have agreed to sell or sequester their assets in a blind trust, led by an independent manager with supreme control,\u00a0in order to keep past business deals, investments and relationships from influencing their White House term. Giving company management to his adult children \u2014 Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka \u2014 would still leave open the potential for Trump to make presidential decisions for their benefit. The children have already played a key part in Trump\u2019s governing preparations, serving on the\u00a0transition team now selecting key appointees and sitting in on meetings with foreign heads of state. Trump spokespeople did not immediately return requests for more details on the move.\u00a0But Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said the move\u00a0did not appear to offer enough of a division to keep entanglement worries at bay. \u201cThat\u2019s business operations, not ownership. The problem is, we need to resolve the conflicts of interest that arise from his ownership. And we\u2019re hearing nothing about how that\u2019s getting resolved,\u201d Painter said. \u201cEven if he does not operate the businesses, you\u2019re going to have lots of people working for the business running around the world trying to cut deals,\u201d Painter added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s critical that none of those people discuss U.S. business in a way that could be interpreted, or misinterpreted, of offering quid pro quo \u2026 or soliciting a bribe on the part of the president.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s presidency, overseas business deals and relations with foreign governments could all become intertwined ] If Trump\u2019s family does take over management of the business, Norman Eisen, the chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama from 2009 to 2011, said an \u201cethics firewall\u201d would need to be put in place to combat the\u00a0\u201crisk of improper preferential relationships and\u00a0treatment for the Trump Organization with the United States government and foreign ones.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman\u00a0Reince Priebus\u00a0said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he was not \u201cready to reveal\u201d whether the move would\u00a0include Trump truly severing ties to his business or whether he would simply leave the day-to-day operations to his kids. \u201cIt\u2019s not the easiest thing to work out,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWhat you see in those tweets is the person at the top that understands and is willing and showing the American people that he\u2019s working hard on it and he\u2019s taking it seriously.\u201d Others in the president-elect\u2019s orbit have shared little more on his plan. Asked Wednesday if he would take over the business, Eric Trump said, while walking through Trump Tower, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear it soon enough.\u201d Asked how the new arrangement would be set up, Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition team\u2019s executive committee, said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to steal Mr. Trump\u2019s or the children\u2019s thunder on that, so let\u2019s wait for Dec. 15.\u201d He added, \u201cAt age 70, after having this phenomenal life and building this phenomenal business in this great tower, he\u2019s going to be a hundred percent focused on working for the American people and for the United States.\u201d The weeks since Trump\u2019s electoral victory have been marked by a series of entanglements between his private ventures and public ambitions. Trump welcomed a group of Indian business executives to meet with him and his family at Trump Tower, where talk turned to the potential for new real-estate deals. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, who will likely play a key part in running the company, met with\u00a0Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u00a0during Trump\u2019s first meeting as president-elect with a foreign government leader. His\u00a0company, the Trump Organization, has over the years sealed lucrative real-estate and branding deals for business in at least 18 countries and territories\u00a0across the world, including in places\u00a0where the U.S. has sensitive diplomatic ties, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and India. Trump\u2019s company is also pitching foreign diplomats on his new luxury hotel in Washington as a place to book rooms and hold meetings. But such entreaties eventually could run afoul of an \u201cemoluments\u201d clause in the U.S. Constitution that bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign leaders \u2014 even if he is not actively running the company. Eric Trump also traveled to Turkey this week to hunt wild deer at the invitation of a Turkish businessman, according to\u00a0Turkish newspaper Hurriyet.\u00a0Trump\u2019s company has made millions off\u00a0licensing the name to Trump Towers Istanbul,\u00a0a luxury project in a country under close scrutiny by U.S. diplomats. Buffeted by entanglement worries,\u00a0Trump has largely dug in, arguing \u201cthe law\u2019s totally on my side, meaning, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest\u201d last week in an interview with the New York Times. \u201cIn theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don\u2019t care about my business.\u201d [ A running list of how Donald Trump\u2019s new position may be helping his business interests ] Peter Schweizer, a conservative author\u00a0who raised alarms in the book \u201cClinton Cash\u201d about Hillary Clinton\u2019s possible conflicts of interest because of\u00a0donations to her family\u2019s foundation, said Trump will face an equally skeptical public, not just about his entanglements but those of his children as well. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on the president of the United States, particularly one who is seemingly committed to \u2018draining the swamp,\u2019 to remove any questions about financial transactions involving him or his family,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Schweizer, who is also close to Trump senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who served as chairman of the Government Accountability Institute, where Schweizer is president. \u201cForeign entities look at family members as a route to gaining influence and getting special favors. It\u2019s not a question of if it\u2019s going to happen \u2014 it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0The best thing he could do is set up mechanisms now to avoid those pitfalls that invariably\u00a0surround presidential families.\u201d He suggested both\u00a0Trump and his adult children\u00a0voluntarily submit to quarterly in-depth disclosures about their financial holdings and major Trump Organization financial transactions, even though the law does not require it. He also proposed that Trump\u2019s charitable foundation cease accepting donations from non-family members and that Trump\u2019s children agree they will not accept paid speaking engagements for fees larger than those they were paid before their father was elected president. Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s domestic policy chief and helped guide his transition to the White House, called Trump\u2019s announcement today \u201can important first step showing that he recognizes the concerns of the press and the public.\u201d Eizenstat recalled that Jimmy Carter put his interest in a peanut warehouse in a blind trust before inauguration day and that Carter agreed to recuse himself from discussion of Agriculture Department policy towards peanuts and limit his involvement in sugar \u2014 the latter playing a critical role in the fortunes of Coca-Cola, a leading home state industry. Trump presents a unique challenge from an ethics perspective because of his wide ranging business interests and because his name is used so widely in pursuit of those interests around the globe. \u201cWe are navigating in uncharted waters,\u201d Eizenstat said. Eizenstat, who also held several major positions in the Clinton administration,\u00a0 said the blind trust approach might be unworkable for Trump given those wide-ranging interests, his name brand on his companies and the active involvement of his children in the business. He spoke approvingly of the idea of an independent monitor as a possible way to reassure the public. But he said that a monitor can be cumbersome and expensive. Given those hurdles, the best way to deal with the public policy challenges of Trump\u2019s vast business portfolio may be to simply encourage \u201ca free and unfettered press\u201d to investigate Trump\u2019s holdings and potential conflicts \u2014 along with his disclosure statements. \u201cThe power of a free press is what separates our country from non-Democratic countries and the vibrancy of the press would be the best instrument\u201d to deal with Trump\u2019s international holdings and the constitutional prohibition against his receiving favors from foreign leaders.\u00a0 In addition, Eizenstat said that Trump\u2019s honesty and credibility in discussing his holdings is critical. \u201cIn the end, he is going to want to be sure that he is seen by the public as a president animated by the national interest,\u201d Eizenstat said. \u201cI am hopeful he will meet that standard.\u201d Michael Toner, who served as general counsel to the Bush-Cheney transition in 2000, recalled the 10-week post-election period as a time for setting broad ethical policy \u2014 and considering specific safeguards for the incoming president \u2014 that would set the tone for the incoming administration. At the time of the Kennedy-Johnson transition, Lyndon Johnson separated himself from the Texas radio stations he operated, drawing up new ownership documents putting his wife, Lady Bird, in charge and removing himself, at least officially, from the company\u2019s operations. After his election in 1976, Jimmy Carter set up elaborate arrangements to remove himself from the family peanut business, its management and knowledge of day to day decisions. For decades incoming presidents and vice presidents have used the inaugural period to meet with federal ethics officials to take steps, such as setting up blind trusts, to remove themselves from their previous business activities and investments. The idea, Toner and others said, is to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. One of Trump\u2019s most visible potential entanglements, even under a potentially new business arrangement, would be\u00a0Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., the new luxury hotel he opened in the White House\u2019s backyard. Charging his children with running the Trump Organization also does not necessarily protect against potential contractual or constitutional violations his presidency may trigger in regards to his D.C. hotel, legal experts say.\u00a0Trump remains the majority owner of the project, which the company leases from the federal government. Trump opened the hotel this fall after spending $42 million of his own money and borrowing another $170 million to foot the cost of construction. There is a provision in the lease allowing Trump to sell or transfer his stake in the hotel to \u201cany Trump Family Member.\u201d Selling it to an outside entity would likely require approval by the General Services Administration. If Trump chooses not to sell, his ownership stake could create two problems once he steps into office. A boilerplate 88-word lease measure may require that the government terminate the deal because it bars \u201can elected official of the Government of the United States\u201d from having \u201cany share or part of this Lease.\u201d [ For foreign diplomats, Trump hotel is place to be ] Procurement experts Steven L. Schooner and Daniel I. Gordon have argued the GSA ought to terminate its deal with Trump because of that clause, writing in The Post a week after the election that \u201chaving the president\u2019s adult children negotiate with the staff of the president\u2019s appointee at GSA presents what any reasonable person would view as the appearance of a conflict of interest.\u201d Schooner, a George Washington University law professor, said in an email Monday that he worried GSA officials wouldn\u2019t terminate the lease out of risk of financial penalties or \u201cintimidation\u201d from the incoming president. But Steven J. Kelman, a former administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the Office of Management and Budget,\u00a0said the passage may apply only to elected officials at the time of lease negotiations. Even if it\u2019s not a violation of the lease, putting his children in charge would leave them to negotiate with Trump administration officials over the deal going forward.\u00a0The official who oversaw the selection of Trump for the project, Robert A. Peck, said recently that he couldn\u2019t imagine the average federal employee feeling much empowered to negotiate with one of Trump\u2019s children while they also advised their father in the White House, if he holds on to the property. \u201cIt would be one thing if his kids ran the business, if his kids didn\u2019t also want to be White House advisers,\u201d Peck said. \u201cBut even then, the specter of some \u2026 contracting officers sitting across the table from Eric Trump. How does that feel?\u201d Rosalind S. Helderman, Jonathan O\u2019Connell and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. business ",

    "text": "Trump says he saved American jobs, but he hasn't shown how he can turn the victory into policy Carrier Darron Cummings / Associated Press Carrier Corp. and President-elect Donald Trump reached an agreement to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, including at this plant in Indianapolis. Carrier Corp. and President-elect Donald Trump reached an agreement to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, including at this plant in Indianapolis. (Darron Cummings / Associated Press) Noah Bierman and Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s newly announced agreement to save more than\u00a01,000 jobs in Indiana gave him the kind of trophy he covets: a tangible victory that matches his campaign promise to serve as deal maker in chief. But its long-term value will depend on what Trump gave up to keep those factory jobs from going to Mexico and whether he is able to craft a successful fiscal policy that has a broader impact on the economy. \u201cThis is an unquestionably positive development for the workers who otherwise would have lost these good jobs,\u201d\u00a0said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and former economic advisor to Vice President Joe Biden . \u201cBut to try to pick off jobs firm by firm with tax breaks and regulatory goodies, it won\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not\u00a0sustainable.\u201d Throughout his campaign, Trump railed relentlessly against Carrier Corp.\u2019s decision to ship 1,400 manufacturing jobs to Mexico, using it as an example of all that was wrong with the U.S. economy and all that he would set right when he took office. He threatened to impose 35% tariffs and renegotiate trade deals with Mexico to stop Carrier and other companies from outsourcing jobs. Trump began speaking directly with Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies\u00a0Corp., after he won election, securing a brief\u00a0announcement late Tuesday from both Carrier and Trump that most of the jobs would no longer be shipped abroad. But details of what Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence may have given up, or the threats they may have lodged, remained elusive. Trump\u2019s team and Carrier deferred such explanations until a formal announcement in Indianapolis on Thursday. Steve Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s newly announced pick to be Treasury secretary, called the deal a \u201cterrific opportunity\u201d\u00a0for the incoming administration and said it came about because Trump and Pence\u00a0were willing to listen to businesses. \"The president-elect and the vice president[-elect] picked up the phone and called the CEO of the United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here,\u201d he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York\u00a0on his way to meet with Trump on Wednesday. Yet the victory was largely symbolic. On an average day this year, the American workforce added\u00a0six times as many jobs. Not only are the jobs saved a trifle\u00a0for a U.S. economy adding an average of 181,000 jobs a month this year, but they are a tiny percentage of the 197,000 employees of United Technologies. Carrier said Wednesday that \u201cincentives offered by the state were an important consideration\u201d in keeping its gas furnace production in Indianapolis, as was \u201cthe incoming administration\u2019s promises of a better business climate.\u201d The company added\u00a0that\u00a0it still believes \u201cin the benefits of free trade\u201d and that businesses need broader solutions to keep the country competitive. Armand Emamdjomeh The show of strength might send a signal of resolve to other companies considering offshoring, and it buys Trump time to craft a policy to match his top campaign promise. In a similar vein, Trump offered sketchy details Wednesday about his latest efforts to wall off his businesses from the appearance of conflict of interest that have dogged him since he won the election and continued to meet with business partners. \u201cLegal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The presidency is a far more important task!\u201d he tweeted. Trump promised to provide new details on his plans during a Dec. 15 news conference, but offered few answers to how he would prevent a conflict, given that his children plan to retain full control. Trump and his aides did not say whether he would relinquish ownership. The Carrier deal\u2019s merits will depend heavily on specifics as well. Trump\u2019s staff said Wednesday that Pence, who remains governor of Indiana and has a history of offering economic incentives to private industry, was heavily involved in negotiations with Carrier, which makes heating and cooling equipment. Pence\u2019s office declined to answer questions. As the incoming president, Trump has some significant leverage with United Technologies, which is a major defense contractor.\u00a0In 2015, the company had $5.6 billion in sales to the federal government, 10% of its total sales, according to United Technologies\u2019 annual report. That federal business might have been a factor in Carrier\u2019s decision to keep jobs in the U.S., said John Eade, director of portfolio strategy at investment research firm Argus Research.\u00a0 \u201cMy guess is that the new administration offered some carrots \u2013 potential for lower taxes, a potential change in trade policies, etc. \u2013 as well as a stick: \u00a0less certainty on U.S. government contracts, which are significant for several of United Technologies\u2019 other businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, I am sure Carrier wants to move out of the national spotlight on this issue,\u201d Eade said. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose left-wing populism tapped some of the same issues as Trump\u2019s anti-globalist message during the Democratic presidential primary, said over the weekend that Trump needed \u201cto make it clear to the CEO of United Technologies that if his firm wants to receive another defense contract from the taxpayers of this country, it must not move these plants to Mexico.\u201d The Carrier deal could prompt other companies to try the same tactic, predicted Dan\u00a0Ikenson, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. \u201cIt creates a short-term political victory for the president-elect, but it opens up a Pandora's box in the sense that other companies are going to want the same sort of handout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have an overall policy that companies can bank on.\u201d Indiana state Sen. Tim Lanane, who leads the Democratic minority in the chamber, said Pence had yet to reveal details of the deal. But most breaks he has offered in the past, including tax incentives and credits, would not need legislative approval. He noted that Pence was unsuccessful in persuading Carrier to stay when it initially announced plans to move, in February. Lanane said the state had a spotty record in ensuring that companies stick to their promises after receiving subsidies. \u201cDoes there come a point where you just can\u2019t do that every time?\u201d Lanane said. Pence and his Economic Development Corporation approved $24 million in tax breaks for 10 companies that sent work abroad, failing in several cases to recover money from companies that laid off employees in the state, the Indianapolis Star reported during the campaign. Trump has said his broader plan to stop manufacturing jobs from leaving the U.S. is to lower the corporate tax rate and renegotiate trade deals to reduce the incentives. Trump\u2019s staff also highlighted the president-elect\u2019s personal involvement, saying it was a sign of things to come as he works to keep jobs from fleeing. The style is unlikely to work on a larger scale, given the volume of companies that could opt to move manufacturing jobs. It may even provide an incentive for other companies to lodge similar threats in hopes of winning government give-backs. But it could also prove a political asset that may help Trump move some of his economic policies through a GOP-controlled Congress that remains skeptical of his anti-globalist trade policy.\u00a0 Bernstein said the Carrier deal also highlighted the different backgrounds and approaches of Trump and President Obama, a former university professor who has gathered business leaders and academics at the White House in the past to address such weighty economic issues. Trump is \u201cmuch\u00a0more comfortable calling up a CEO and admonishing him than he is sitting around a table with a bunch of policy wonks talking about the best way to change the incentive structure,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to solve the economics of this, you\u2019ve got to get at the incentive structure. You can\u2019t simply be handing\u00a0out goodies to every single company that\u2019s planning to relocate.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

Those frantic last words from the jet chartered by the Chapecoense team were captured on a recording of the flight's final moments that were obtained Wednesday by various Colombian news outlets, The Associated Press reported. On the audiotape, the pilot can be reportedly heard repeatedly requesting permission to land because of a \"total electric failure\" while a female controller gives instructions.

Colombian officials have not publicly identified the cause of the crash , which wiped out most of the Chapeco, Brazil-based soccer team as it was heading to a tournament. But Alfredo Bocanegra, who heads the country's aviation agency, has said they have not ruled out electrical problems or a lack of fuel as the likely culprit. \"If this is confirmed by investigators it would be a very painful ... because it stems from negligence,\" Bocanegra told Caracol Radio on Wednesday. Meanwhile, two investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board with expertise in jet engines were flying to the South American country to help in the investigation, NBC confirmed.

There was no new information of the conditions of the other two survivors, Suarez and aircraft mechanic Erwin Tumiri. Both were reported earlier to have non-life threatening injuries.

Governor Bruce Rauner speaks to the media in Alsip, Ill., on Oct.\u00a05, 2016. (Gary Middendorf / Daily Southtown) Privacy Policy As lawmakers prepare to wrap up the fall session, Exelon and ComEd on Wednesday announced an agreement with Gov. Bruce Rauner to raise rates on consumers to help two struggling nuclear power plants. The last-minute attempt to resolve the long-festering electricity issue came on a day the Republican governor and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan continued to try to position the other guy to take the blame over the lack of a state budget. All of which sets up the prospect of lawmakers going home for the year on Thursday after voting to bail out the power companies but failing to approve a state budget. A temporary spending plan to keep universities and social service programs afloat is set to expire come January. While Exelon and subsidiary ComEd issued a news release that profusely thanked Rauner for his office's \"input\" on the \"historic energy bill,\" no floor votes were taken Wednesday. Democrats want assurances that Republicans will put up some votes to pass the bill, which would raise rates to prevent the closure of plants in Downstate Clinton and the Quad Cities. As often happens at the Capitol, lawmakers likely will be asked to approve a complex, lengthy regulatory bill without much time to digest the fine print. A final version wasn't expected to surface until Thursday. Illinois legislature , the power companies say they are paring the bill even further. The most recent changes would trim below 25 cents the average monthly increase... A week after ComEd and Exelon dropped some of the most contentious provisions of a controversial energy bill making its way through the Illinois legislature , the power companies say they are paring the bill even further. The most recent changes would trim below 25 cents the average monthly increase... (Ally Marotti) Exelon says the agreement would limit rate increases to 25 cents a month for ComEd residential customers. It also would limit increases on commercial customers to a 1.3 percent increase over 2015 rates, though officials noted actual bills will fluctuate from month to month. Opponents said the rate caps weren't strong enough. A coalition of businesses and government groups against the bill questioned the utility's math, estimating the average consumer bill will spike by more than $4 a month. Dave Lundy, spokesman for Better Energy Solutions for Tomorrow, said the utility was using a complex formula to get to the 25-cent average by assuming customers will see future savings after it puts in place various energy efficiency programs, which consumers will be required to foot the bill for up front. Attorney General Lisa Madigan 's office said late Wednesday that it needed more time to review the bill before taking a position, noting the fast pace at which the legislation was evolving. \"While we are encouraged that there are rate caps, we also know from hard experience that the devil is in the details,\" said Susan Satter, assistant attorney general in the Public Utilities Bureau. \"This is a wildly complicated effort and we just simply have not had the time to understand how it will work or even if it is workable in it's current form.\" Rauner's office would not comment publicly late Wednesday, but aides indicated on background that the governor will sign the bill if it passes. Bruce Rauner 's administration criticized aspects of a controversial and potentially costly energy bill, the power companies pushing the legislation on Tuesday dropped some of its most problematic provisions. ComEd gave up on its attempt to use the measure \u2014 whose primary... Hours after Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's administration criticized aspects of a controversial and potentially costly energy bill, the power companies pushing the legislation on Tuesday dropped some of its most problematic provisions. ComEd gave up on its attempt to use the measure \u2014 whose primary... (Kim Geiger) The quick movement speaks to the big influence of the power companies in the Capitol. Exelon and ComEd gave more than $1.2 million to state campaigns since the beginning of 2015, and an army of lobbyists were hired to fight for, or against, the proposal. What has emerged is a stripped-down version of a sweeping measure that at one time also included subsidies for Downstate coal plants. That was abandoned, along with a controversial provision that would have changed how customers are charged for their monthly energy use. That plan would have allowed billing based on an average of a customer's top 30 minutes of usage on weekdays. Under the still-developing legislation, the utilities would collect about $235 million annually from customers for the nuclear power plant subsidy, instead of the $285 million called for in the previous versions of the legislation. The adjustment would allow ComEd to spend about $400 million annually on energy efficiency, down from the original $500 million. The company says it currently spends about $240 million a year. The energy legislation appeared to be the one area ripe for agreement between Rauner-led Republicans and Democrats who control the General Assembly . Rauner doesn't want to be blamed for the loss of jobs associated with the plants closing, while Democrats want to appease unions who support the legislation. Meanwhile, both sides continued to dig in on a state budget. Another meeting between Rauner and legislative leaders failed to produce any progress toward a resolution. (Kim Geiger) Madigan emerged from the hour-and-a-half-long session to repeat his stance that a budget deal could be reached only if Rauner followed the \"framework\" for other emergency spending measures. That's Madigan's way of saying he won't consider the economic agenda items Rauner has made a condition of a larger budget deal. Instead, Democrats pushed for a re-examination of the state's financial footing given recent changes that have made fixing the state's money problems more difficult, including a decision by the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System to lower assumed stock market returns. That leaves the state on the hook for an additional $400 million to $500 million a year, while a recent change to the Illinois Constitution approved by voters would prevent the state from being able to dip into money earmarked for transportation to fill budget holes. While both sides have long said a combination of tax increases and budget cuts will be needed to help balance the books, Madigan tried to flip the script Wednesday. The long-serving speaker suggested the first-term governor's push for a deal in the coming weeks is an effort to muscle though a tax increase during the lame-duck session \u2014 the couple of weeks in January when lawmakers who did not win re-election could take tough votes on their way out the door. Madigan twice referred to the \"Rauner lame-duck tax increase\" before allowing a House vote on a symbolic resolution that declares the chamber is opposed to any lame-duck tax increase that might pop up. The measure was sponsored by Rep. David McSweeney, a Republican from Barrington Hills who has staunchly opposed tax increases. Similar legislation that would overhaul the Illinois Constitution to permanently bar such lame-duck tax increases could come up for a House vote Thursday. Madigan voted against the anti-tax resolution, but calling the measure for a vote allowed him to provide some political cover for Democrats who already are being targeted by Republicans in 2018. Among them was Rep. Jerry Costello , of Smithton, near St. Louis, who voted in favor. Republicans were quick to note that it was Democrats who pushed through a 67 percent increase in the income tax rate in 2011. Portions of that increase expired in 2015, a rollback Rauner supported during his bid for office. \"What is going on in the House today is more political theater, it's not substantive,\" House Republican leader Jim Durkin said. Rauner has said he is open to raising taxes, but only if Democrats approve his economic wish list as part of a comprehensive budget agreement. But facing continued resistance from Democrats, Rauner raised the possibility that he could agree to another stopgap bill but only if Democrats agree to term limits and a property tax freeze. Madigan, who was first elected in 1970, argues term limits already exist in the form of elections. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR The federal ethics watchdog isn't the kind of agency that typically airs its positions on Twitter \u2014 let alone in a snarky tone, with exclamation points. But it's been an all-around weird day at the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. It started Wednesday morning, when President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to address concerns about his ability to lead the U.S. government while also holding massive business interests around the world. Trump Says He Will Pull Back From Businesses But Offers No Details Yet \"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" Trump tweeted, adding that \"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations\" and that he will be leaving his \"great business in total.\" What exactly that means remains unclear. But the verified Twitter account of the typically decorous federal ethics office chimed in with statements that appeared to goad Trump about divesting his businesses \u2014 something he hasn't specifically promised to do. \"Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!\" the agency tweeted, mimicking Trump's own tweeting style. And: \"OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!\" And then things kept getting weirder. All of the tweets disappeared. Twitter erupted in confusion. Observers were suggesting this was a hack or the work of a rogue employee, as The Washington Post posited : \"Maybe the OGE has inadvertently leaked that Trump intends to sell off his assets, a dramatic move that the president-elect may have intended to save for his 'major news conference' Dec. 15. Maybe the tweets are a hacker's social-media joke. Or maybe an OGE official went rogue with the agency's social-media accounts, as a way to sarcastically poke at Trump or, having misread the news, cheer him on.\" Article continues after sponsorship But then, some hours later, the tweets returned \u2014 re-posted all over again, sending a new wave of confusion. U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR An OGE spokesman, Seth Jaffe, who is the chief of the agency's ethics law and policy branch, emailed a statement to NPR: \"Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect's twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don't know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.\" The statement suggested that the tweets have been deliberate all along. And, in fact, the OGE later confirmed to NPR that this was not a hack. A few things remained a mystery, among them: Did the OGE know something about Trump's plans that he hasn't made public? As NPR's Scott Detrow has reported : \"Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to turn the Trump Organization over to three of his children. But Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump all remain close political advisers and members of his transition team, so it's hard to see how the Trump Organization and the Trump administration would remain separate, if that remains the case.\" Almost two hours after the first statement, the OGE issued another one: \"The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE's tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect's plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\" The agency's officials still haven't answered why the tweets \u2014 if they were deliberate \u2014 initially were deleted. And more fundamentally, why did the usually straitlaced OGE decide to break character and publicly vocalize its opinion? Perhaps it's part of a new, Trump-inspired era of governing and social media.

    "text": "The U.K.'s first-ever 'plastic' 5 bill has really upset vegans By Trevor Mogg Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Bank of England governor Mark Carney poses with a new polymer five pound note at Whitecross Street Market in London, Britain September 13, 2016. (REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth) The Brits launched their first-ever \"plastic\" bill in September , and at the time made much of its multifarious security measures aimed at deterring counterfeiters. Everyone seemed delighted with the new 5 bill, which the Bank of England governor described as tough enough to survive \"a splash of claret, a flick of cigar ash, the nip of a bulldog and even a spin in the washing machine.\" How it stands up to the anger of annoyed vegans, however, is another question entirely. In response to a question asked on Twitter this week, the Bank confirmed that the bill contains traces of animal fat in the form of tallow, included apparently to help it slide more easily in and out of machines. @SteffiRox there is a trace of tallow in the polymer pellets used in the base substrate of the polymer \u00a35 notes \u2014 Bank of England (@bankofengland) November 28, 2016 It wasn't long before vegans and vegetarians started hitting social media to voice their alarm at the revelation, upset that the Bank was using animal products in its newest bill. The obligatory online petition quickly showed up, too, demanding that the Bank of England \"cease to use animal products in the production of currency that we have to use.\" It's already gathered more than 70,000 signatures. Vegan Dan Hanks told the London Standard he was thinking about boycotting the bill for \"the same reason I don't wear leather -- it would make me uncomfortable using something that has (at least partly) come from animal suffering,\" adding, \"I've tried to stop contributing to animal suffering in all other areas of my life.\" The petition is still gathering signatures while disgruntled vegans continue their assault on the bill via Twitter: Can't believe the #fivepoundnote contains the product of an animal when we have the technology and resources to produce it without cruelty. \u2014 Effie Herdman (@EffieHerdman) November 29, 2016 The new five pound notes aren't vegan!! They contain tallow, which is derived from animal fat \uf621 #vegan #govegan pic.twitter.com/QQbrsplweh \u2014 The Vegan Punk (@TheVeganPunk) November 28, 2016 \u00a0 However, many tweets on the subject were along the lines of this one: To all #vegans not liking the new \u00a35 notes I'm offering an #exchange I will give u \u00a31 for every new \u00a35 u dont want @bankofengland #tallow \u2014 Beardy Man Jay (@BeardyManJay) November 29, 2016 The Bank of England has so far declined to officially respond to the outcry. The new fiver is the U.K.'s first-ever bill made from polymer, a thin and flexible plastic material. Its robust structure makes it more resistant to dirt and moisture, and so it should last around 2.5 times longer -- about five years in all -- than the paper bill it replaced. Around 440 million new fivers are believed to already be in circulation, which certainly sounds like a whole lot of tallow. The Bank is also introducing its first polymer 10 bill next summer, followed by a 20 bill by 2020, though we'll have to wait and see if the current controversy prompts it to replace the animal fat with a more acceptable substance.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The Associated Press \u00a0(Italian comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo is part of a rising tide of populist leaders on the continent. ) Italians vote Sunday on a series of sweeping reforms, the outcome of which could determine the future of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s rule - but also serve as a gauge for the rising populist movement throughout Europe. If Italians reject the reforms \u2013 which are basically an unofficial plebiscite on the prime minister \u2013 Renzi has vowed to step down, setting up a caretaker government and the chance for the populist comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement to take power in the next election. Italy\u2019s situation is a microcosm of what is happening across Europe, where the political establishment is being challenged by a slew of populist \u2013 and mostly far-right \u2013 politicians who are riding the same anti-establishment anger that earlier this year saw the United Kingdom vote to leave the European Union and the United States elect Donald Trump as president. Mainland Europe\u2019s populist leaders are up in the polls in large part because of their promises to restore flagging economies, reverse the continuing trend of unemployment, stem the flow of migrants from the Middle East and Africa and, in some cases, even leave the EU. \u201cMany of these countries are looking at a series of complex questions, but they want an easy answer,\u201d Michael Geary, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, told FoxNews.com. \u201cPeople are looking for answers and these politicians can take advantage of this because of the political unrest.\u201d Here are some European nations that are experiencing populist uprisings: Italy Expand / Contract Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi could step down from power following a referendum vote. (The Associated Press) Despite Renzi and his center-left government enjoying widespread approval when he came into office in 2014, Italians quickly soured to him as the country continued to struggle economically and unemployment rates remained high. Adding to the fiscal woes, Italy has also been one of the main landing points for migrants from North Africa and many Italians are upset with Renzi\u2019s handling of the crisis, which some see as an open door policy. Mirroring both the campaigns of Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders in the U.S., Grillo and his Five Star Movement have gained a large number of followers by harnessing Italian anger at political elites and frustration over slow economic growth.\u00a0Unlike his fellow populists throughout Europe, however, the ideologically-elusive Grillo has not played into national identity politics the way that more right-wing leaders in places such as France, the Netherlands and Austria have. \u201cGrillo and his movement is a bit more of a response to the economic crisis hitting Italy,\u201d Kimberly Morgan, a political science professor at George Washington University, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s much more of an economic issue and less to do with identity.\u201d With Italians voting on Sunday, most experts predict that Renzi\u2019s reforms will not pass, but it is difficult to tell as before a blackout was imposed ahead of the vote, about a quarter of Italians were still undecided. France Expand / Contract French politician Francois Fillon is a follower of late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. (The Associated Press) Francois Fillon, a socially conservative former prime minister and an adherent of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s economics, looks poised to face the leader of the far-right National Front party, Marine Le Pen, in a run-off election next year. While the two share similar ideologies when it comes to Europe\u2019s migrant crisis \u2013 Fillon has shifted farther right by promising to crack down on immigration and to destroy what he has called \u201ctotalitarian\u201d Islamists \u2013 they differ on how to solve France\u2019s unemployment and economic issues. Unlike Le Pen, Fillon has given no indication that he would push for France to leave the EU and has instead been an ardent advocate of free market capitalism. \u201cFillon picked up a lot of Le Pen\u2019s line on immigration, but he is much more neoliberal when it comes to his economic policies,\u201d Morgan said. With the memory of the Paris and Nice terror attacks still fresh in the minds of many in France, Fillon has also promised to reduce immigration and invest 12 billion euros in security, defense and justice. He has also called for closer ties with Russia in the fight against terrorism and recently penned a book, entitled \u201cBeating Islamic Totalitarianism.\" Germany Expand / Contract German Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for her fourth term in office. (The Associated Press) As Chancellor Angela Merkel runs for a fourth term, the popular leader may face her toughest test yet from a resurgent right-wing led by populist politician Frauke Petry of the Alternative for Germany party. Merkel, who has been described by many as the last defender of the liberal West, has come under fire from opponents who disagree with her insistence on accepting large numbers of Syrian refugees and on Germany\u2019s continued financial support for its faltering southern European neighbors. \u201cPetry has really mobilized a lot Germans with her stance on asylum for refugees,\u201d Morgan said. She added that since World War II, the country has maintained a very open policy toward refugees \u201cas a sort of atonement for their past,\u201d but those attitudes appear to be shifting. Despite the popularity of Petry and the Alternative for Germany\u00a0party, experts say that Merkel still looks poised to maintain her chancellorship. \u201cGermany\u2019s economy is in very good shape under Merkel and that bodes well for her chances of winning reelection,\u201d Morgan said.

    "text": "German Spy Agency Finds It Hired an Islamic Extremist Mole By david rising, associated press BERLIN \u0097 Nov 30, 2016, 11:52 AM ET 0 Shares Email On one side of the internet chat was an Islamic extremist who had just got himself a job with Germany's domestic intelligence agency. On the other side was an agent of Germany's domestic intelligence agency pretending to be an Islamic extremist. When the 51-year-old mole, a German who had converted to Islam , offered to use his new job to provide information to \"help the brothers\" plan an attack against his employer, German law enforcement swooped in. It appears little harm was done to the intelligence agency, known by its German acronym BfV, Duesseldorf prosecutors said Wednesday. \"So far, there have been no reliable indications that the accused had already given security-relevant information to people from the violent Salafist scene,\" prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck, whose office is leading the investigation, told The Associated Press in a written response to questions. The suspect, whose identity has not been released, is now in custody and has partially confessed to investigators, Herrenbrueck said. He told questioners that his goal was to infiltrate the BfV to warn his \"brothers in faith\" of operations against them. The suspect is under investigation on suspicion of preparing an act of violence against the state and of an attempted violation of state secrets regulations, among other charges. The man, described by German media as a former bank employee who was married with children, started with the BfV in April and was tasked with the surveillance of Salafists, adherents of an ultra-conservative form of Islam that can also turn violent, Herrenbrueck said. There are an estimated 9,200 Salafists in Germany . The BfV said it had uncovered no red flags in the hiring or the interviewing process. \"The worker, who started not long ago, had been inconspicuous during the application process, training and at work,\" the agency told the AP. The agency said once it had uncovered the man, who had used a pseudonym online, it turned the case over to Duesseldorf prosecutors. \"So far there is no indication that there is a concrete danger for the security of the BfV or its employees,\" the agency said. Interior Ministry spokesman Tobias Plate, whose ministry oversees the agency, said he couldn't recall any comparable cases in the recent past and said that there were \"no indications that there are fundamental structural problems\" at the BfV. Plate said authorities will have to see whether there are lessons to be learned from the case about recruitment procedures but said \"it's too early to derive any concrete recommendations.\" Germany has not seen any mass-casualty Islamic extremist attacks, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks in the summer were carried out by asylum-seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach. Both of the attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "That is not what independent analysts concluded after analyzing the tax proposal Mr. Trump made during his campaign , which would reduce the income tax rate on the wealthiest families from its current 39.6 percent to 33 percent. In that plan, middle-class families would see a 0.8 percent increase in their after-tax income, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation , while the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see a 10.2 to 16 percent gain. Another group, the Tax Policy Center, calculated middle-class families would get a 1.8 percent boost in after-tax income, while the top 0.1 percent of earners would see a 14 percent gain and a tax cut worth an average of $1.1 million. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Mnuchin was talking big: \u201cThis will be the largest tax change since Reagan.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin suggested closing some tax loopholes would counter the effect of lower tax rates for the rich, but he mentioned only one: a cap on the mortgage interest deduction. Tax reformers have long suggested that mortgage payments should either no longer be deductible or be capped for mansions and second homes. Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury pick did not clarify what he meant. It was not clear whether the comments on Wednesday represented a shift in Mr. Trump\u2019s tax policy intentions or political spin. \u201cWhat he described there doesn\u2019t match the plan unveiled in September,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation. \u201cThis statement could be a legitimate pivot, or it could be hand waving. I don\u2019t know which.\u201d Photo Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for Treasury secretary, at Trump Tower on Wednesday. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times One promise of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s that matched Mr. Trump\u2019s was a 15 percent corporate income tax rate, a huge cut from the current 35 percent. Leaders in both parties favor a lower corporate rate, paid for with a simpler tax code with far fewer deductions and dodges. But former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner could get the rate down only to 28 percent when he ran the numbers. Even House Republicans have aimed for 25 percent. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut corporate taxes, which will bring huge amounts of jobs back to the United States. We\u2019re going to get to 15 percent, and we\u2019re going to bring a lot of cash back to the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross suggested that the plans would not widen the budget deficit thanks to \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d or forecasts that assume tax cuts will release much faster economic growth and therefore pay for themselves. But the Trump tax cuts would need to unleash far faster growth than the historical record suggests is likely to avoid rapidly increasing the budget deficit. The Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis of the September Trump campaign plan found that even with dynamic scoring, the plan would reduce federal revenue by $2.6 trillion to $3.9 trillion over the next decade, which absent spending cuts would enlarge the deficit by up to one-third over levels the Congressional Budget Office projects. And the Trump nominees stuck with a bullish forecast for long-term growth. \u201cOur No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told reporters gathered at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday. \u201cWe believe that\u2019s very sustainable.\u201d Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also black, shot Keith Lamont Scott, 43, in a parking lot as officers were preparing to serve an arrest warrant against someone else. Vinson has said he saw Scott rolling a marijuana joint and holding a gun, and fired at him out of concern for public safety. The case gained national notoriety after Scott's wife, Rakeyia, shared cellphone video she took of the moments leading up to the killing, in which she begs officers not to shoot her husband. \"It is my opinion that Officer Vinson acted lawfully when he shot Mr. Scott,\" Mecklenburg County District Attorney Andrew Murray said at a news conference. \"He acted lawfully.\" Play Cops Won't Face Charges in Keith Lamont Scott's Fatal Shooting 1:44 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161201024003if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/820914755966\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> A team of 15 career prosecutors made the decision unanimously based on the legal definition of what justifies the use of deadly force for self-defense, Murray added. \"The same legal standards apply to both private citizens and police officers,\" he said. \"[But] police are sometimes required to run toward, rather than away, from dangerous situations to protect the public.\" In this case, Vinson had to make a split-second decision, Murray said. He ultimately fired four shots at Scott after Scott drew his weapon and didn't obey repeated commands by the officers to drop it, staring at them with a \"trance-like look\" in his eyes, Murray added. Murray met with Scott's family prior to making his announcement. \"As you can imagine, it was a difficult discussion. However, the family was extremely gracious,\" Murray said. \"No one, and I mean no one, should ever experience, let alone witness, the violent death of a loved one.\" In a statement, the Scott family said they were \"profoundly disappointed\" with the decision. \"While we understand that many in the Charlotte area share our frustration and pain, we ask that everyone work together to fix the system that allowed this tragedy to happen in the first place,\" the statement said. Justin Bamberg, an attorney for the Scotts, later called it a \"bittersweet day.\" \"We've been saying from the very beginning that we want to know the facts, we want certain questions answered. And we did get some of those answers today,\" Bamberg said. \"But we're going to continue to look into this matter.\" A police officer shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, 43, near the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. via Facebook Whether Scott was armed was a key point of contention in the case. In the video taken by Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott insists he's not. \"He doesn't have a gun. He has a TBI [traumatic brain injury],\" she says . \"He's not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine.\" The family continued to maintain after the killing that Scott was unarmed, and Bamberg said Wednesday that Rakeyia Scott \"was not aware of her husband having a gun\" at the time. Protesters demanded police release more video to prove whether or not Scott was armed as anger boiled over in Charlotte after the shooting. Vinson was not wearing a bodycam at the time of the incident, but the three other plainclothes officers who were at the scene were.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney eventually decided to release bodycam and dashcam videos , but neither clearly showed whether Scott had a firearm in his hand. Putney said police concluded from other evidence \u2014 namely a gun found at the scene, which a lab analysis showed had Scott's DNA and fingerprints on it \u2014 that Scott was armed at the time.

Netflix hide caption toggle caption Netflix At no extra cost to the user, Netflix subscribers are now able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices. Netflix In the race for video streaming domination, Netflix surges forward. On Wednesday, Netflix announced and implemented in its latest update, the ability to download TV and movie titles on mobile devices. At no extra cost to the user, Netflix subscribers will now be able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices, then watch on the go without the need for an Internet connection. Say goodbye to lackluster in-flight movies, Netflix is now airplane-mode compatible. What's Hot On Netflix? A Startup Aims To Track Ratings In The Streaming Age The move places Netflix in direct competition with iTunes and other services that offer video rentals and purchases for download. Netflix is not the first streaming service to offer offline viewing. Last year, Amazon Prime Video extended its download service to iPhones, iPads, and Android devices after offering it exclusively for the Amazon Fire Tablet. The rise of Netflix, and its over 86 million subscribers , has been a force to compete with. Content providers are scrambling to stay relevant in its wake. In 2015, HBO and Showtime introduced standalone streaming services, offering cord-cutters access to premium content without a cable package. However, what makes Netflix so attractive is the amount of content for the dollar spent. HBO Now begins at $14.99 a month. Showtime can be an add-on to a Hulu or Amazon subscription or at a standalone monthly price of $10.99. While Netflix's basic monthly package begins at $7.99, and the premium version is $11.99. Article continues after sponsorship In The New 'Gilmore Girls,' Rory Gilmore Turns Out To Be A Bad Journalist Cable providers are trying to evolve as well. Also Wednesday, AT&T; launched DirecTV Now , an Internet streaming service available on phones, tablets, computers, and streaming devices. In February 2015, Dish introduced Sling TV , which streams cable channels through the Internet. The convenience of streaming TV and movies has led many people to cut the cord. Hulu subscribers are willing to pay for the most up-to-date episodes and movies, and sit through 90-second adds every few minutes. While there is a premium Hulu service which does not include commercial breaks, the \"No Commercial Plan\" does not apply to popular shows such as Scandal, Grey's Anatomy, and How to Get Away With Murder. As Netflix paves the way for online streaming, you have to wonder what former Blockbuster executives are thinking now. It was 16 years ago that Blockbuster passed on purchasing the then DVD mailing service for only $50 million . Netflix is worth $50 billion. Blockbuster has just a handful of stores left .

Richmond of Louisiana. \u201cYou should go there and engage people and tell them what you believe in.\u201d Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election, a handful of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs, such as the chairman of the party\u2019s campaign arm, into elected positions. That plan is expected to meet resistance from Ms. Pelosi, who retains the power to appoint people to those positions, though some Democrats have expressed an interest in the idea. Last week Ms. Pelosi selected Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico to again lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, even though House Democrats picked up just six seats in this election. Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements, Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Pelosi, long considered a legislative and fund-raising powerhouse. Driven by the conviction that Democrats need a new leader, he tried to harness discontent with a leadership team that has failed three times to reclaim the majority since being swept out in 2010. Trying to quell calls to replace her, Ms. Pelosi announced her nominations last week for a handful of other positions, and proposed that three members from Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York share the leadership duties of the party\u2019s messaging committee, offering more regional diversity. She also released plans to incorporate more junior members into leadership roles, among other ideas, such as including a freshman Democrat in the leadership team\u2019s regular meetings. But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to. It is from that sizable collection of House Democrats that she draws her picks for smaller leadership posts, making her a powerful ally and, for those like Mr. Ryan who have challenged her, a formidable opponent. \u201cShe has a lot of friends,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThis is her caucus, clearly.\u201d Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

(Photo: Paul Efird, Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel) SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Gatlinburg's devastating fire\u00a0that left hundreds of homes and businesses significantly damaged or destroyed started on a blustery Monday night when embers from\u00a0a wildfire on\u00a0Chimney Tops Trail in\u00a0Great\u00a0Smoky Mountain National Park blew into the area. The resulting flames\u00a0swept through Gatlinburg, about 10 miles up the mountain from here,\u00a0in less than 15 minutes, fanned by winds at speeds that approached 90 mph. More people could be dead Though officials have confirmed seven deaths as of Wednesday, many are worried about additional fatalities because several people still are missing. Debris and downed power lines have limited authorities' abilities to explore. Among the missing are a 61-year-old Memphis couple, Jon and Janet Summers,\u00a0who were separated from their three sons as they tried to escape the wildfire early Tuesday.\u00a0The young men were found injured, transported to a Nashville hospital burn unit and are in critical but stable condition. Several officials have said that the area is fortunate that the inferno didn't occur over Thanksgiving weekend when the number of visitors would have been higher. The Summers family was vacationing on an extended holiday. Not all was destroyed The flames that roared through Gatlinburg and nearby Pigeon Forge weren't all encompassing, fire officials said. The Castle, an iconic home overlooking Gatlinburg, is almost all gone. So are several churches and Cupid's Chapel of Love wedding venue. Death toll rises to 7 in Gatlinburg wildfires Officials surveying early damage said\u00a0Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort & Spa, with more than 100 buildings, is likely entirely destroyed. But Dollywood, the theme park of country-music legend Dolly Parton, was spared significant damage and will reopen Friday. Ober Gatlinburg ski resort said on its Facebook page that its properties and animals are OK, and Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies, whose caretakers had to abandon the building at the height of the fire, is intact and all of its animals are safe. Rain won't douse all the flames Portions of Sevier County, where Gatlinburg and nearby Pigeon Forge are located, received about a half inch of rain overnight Tuesday and are expected to get an additional\u00a0inch or so Wednesday. While the wet weather\u00a0helps firefighters, the rain likely won't penetrate the piles of dry leaves and brush that have accumulated in the forest through the years, according to Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller. Smell from Gatlinburg wildfires blows to southern Mich. Eight new fires already have erupted from hot spots and blowing embers between Tuesday and Wednesday, he said. Forecasters are adding a new worry to the mix:\u00a0flash flooding because\u00a0a big downpour has a difficult time soaking into parched ground. Gatlinburg is not the only fire Though the Gatlinburg fire has been the most destructive in terms of loss of life and property damage, 19 wildfires were burning across six Southeast\u00a0states Wednesday, U.S. Forest Service officials said. Fires have consumed more than 15,000 acres of forest in the Great Smoky Mountains alone, officials estimate. Flooding now a concern in fire-ravaged Gatlinburg Generally an average of two fires, caused by lightning, occur in the\u00a0park each year, usually in May or June, National Park Service officials say. While the causes of many of the current fires are under investigation, many are believed to be caused by people, either as arson or by accident. Between 1901 and when the national park was established in 1934, hundreds of thousands of trees in virgin\u00a0forests were clear cut, leaving mostly brush and stubble behind. For most of the past 75 years or so, fire officials would put out the naturally occurring wildfires as forests regrew, so some areas have a lot of dead vegetation \u2014 potential fuel for wildfires.

(Nov. 29) AP This November 15, 2011 file photo shows vehicles as they drive by the US Treasury Building in Washington, DC. (Photo: KAREN BLEIER, AFP/Getty Images) U.S. Treasuries suffered their worst month since 2009 as investors fret President-elect Donald Trump's policies will spell bad news for debt investors and also brace for hikes in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond fund, which tracks the broad bond market, has dropped 2.7% this month in its worst monthly performance since the wake of the financial crisis, according to Bloomberg data. Bond prices are falling, and yields on these debt securities are rising sharply, as investors expect an uptick in two of the things most toxic to fixed-income portfolios\u00a0inflation and government spending and borrowing. The 10-year Treasury's price fell in\u00a0November so its\u00a0yield, which moves opposite of price, jumped to 2.37% from 1.82% at the start of the month. The November jump in the 10-year Treasury yield comes after a significant gain in October. Taken together, the yield on the 10-year Treasury has jumped from 1.59%, the largest rise in a two-month period\u00a0since 2013, Bloomberg says. Back then, investors sold off Treasuries fearing a more aggressive rate hike schedule by the Federal Reserve. Bond prices are falling as investors worry about an uptick in inflation and U.S. government borrowing. (SPDR Blmbg Barclays Aggregate Bond ETF). \u00a0(Photo: Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence) Politics and expectations are driving the jump in rates. Trump's campaign largely hinged on his promise to boost fiscal stimulus by spending on government construction projects like bridges and roads. Big spending plans coupled with promises of large tax cuts could mean higher government deficits and additional government borrowing. More borrowing could likely cause the government to sell additional long-term debt, which is hurting prices of existing long-term Treasuries as investors brace for additional supply. Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin fanned fears further about a growing supply of long-term debt saying he favors selling debt with maturities of more than 30 years. Mnuchin outlines 'largest tax change since Reagan' It's not just the potential additional supply of debt that worries Treasury investors. They expect inflation to pick up, which is a negative for bond investors who collect\u00a0fixed income payments. Greater fiscal spending could stoke inflation as well as higher oil prices. Word OPEC plans to curb production for the first time since 2008 reinvigorated inflation fears further Wednesday. Greater inflation could give the Fed the freedom to raise short-term rates, rather than keeping them low as it has been doing for years, according to a report from S&P Global Market Intelligence co-authored by its President Michael Thompson. Traders are pricing in a 94% chance the Fed will increase short-term interest rates at its December meeting, which would be the first hike this year. The question is now how much higher rates could go from here. Investors and traders are torn. While the trend has been pointed upwards for months, the yield on long-term government debt at around 2.4% is still relatively attractive, especially compared with the roughly 2% dividend yield on stocks, S&P Global says. Once rates get to around their multi-year high of 2.5%, investors would likely step in and buy, allowing rates to hold the line in the near term. \"10-year T-note yields (are) capped for the time being at 2.50%,\" S&P Global said in its note to clients. 24 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gLPyZZ ",

Federal researchers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services examined data from the National Health Interview Survey and found that the percentage of people under age 65 in families having difficulty paying medical bills has decreased from 21.3 percent in 2011 to 16.2 percent in the first six months of 2016. The NHIS defines \"family\" \"as an individual or a group of two or more related persons living together in the same housing unit,\" according to the report. Decreases were seen in a variety of groups including people both with and without private insurance, people who were above and below the poverty line and both those under the age of 18 and those between the ages of 18 to 64. The researchers did not look at data for those over the age of 65 and did not speculate on why fewer people were having difficulty paying medical bills. They examined responses from the National Health Interview Survey starting in 2011 and ending during the first six months of 2016. How the End of Daylight Saving Time Can Affect Health Karen Politz, senior fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation, said with the passage of the Affordable Care Act , the number of people without health insurance has declined, which has likely led to fewer people having issues paying medical bills. \"The highest incidence with people in medical bill problems has always been uninsured and we\u2019ve seen that number declined substantially in last couple years,\" Politz told ABC News. She said medical costs can still be a problem for people with insurance. \"Some people have health insurance who nonetheless experience cost problems,\" Politz said. She pointed out people sometimes accidentally go out of network \"and get billed by people who you thought was in network.\" Among people under 65, 28.5 percent of people who were in uninsured families had trouble paying medical bills as compared to 21.1 percent of people in families who had public coverage and 12.6 percent of people in families with private coverage. In addition, 24.9 percent people living near the poverty line (with incomes of 100 to less than 200 percent of the poverty threshold) had trouble paying these bills compared to 23.0 percent of people in families below the poverty threshold and just 12.6 percent of people whose incomes were 200 percent or more than the poverty threshold. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "A smoker snuffs out a cigarette at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. Rich Pedroncelli/AP hide caption toggle caption A smoker snuffs out a cigarette at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. Rich Pedroncelli/AP The Obama administration has issued a sweeping final rule banning smoking in all public housing units nationwide, extending a smoke-free environment to nearly a million units. The rule, issued Wednesday by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, prohibits smoking any lit tobacco products (like cigarettes, pipes and cigars) in indoor areas of public housing complexes. It also bans smoking in public housing administrative offices and in outdoor areas within 25 feet from the buildings. The department says the rule \"will save public housing agencies $153 million every year in repairs and preventable fires, including $94 million in secondhand smoke-related health care, $43 million in renovation of smoking-permitted units, and $16 million in smoking-related fire losses.\" It gives public housing agencies 18 months to bring their buildings into compliance. The department says it has been encouraging public housing agencies to impose smoke-free policies since 2009 and about a quarter of the units already have these rules in place. \"More than two million people now live in public housing, including 760,000 children,\" as NPR's Pam Fessler told our Newscast unit. Article continues after sponsorship No, You Can't Vape On Commercial Flights, Transportation Department Says \"Every child deserves to grow up in a safe, healthy home free from harmful second-hand cigarette smoke,\" said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said in a statement . \"HUD's smoke-free rule is a reflection of our commitment to using housing as a platform to create healthy communities. By working collaboratively with public housing agencies, HUD's rule will create healthier homes for all of our families and prevent devastating and costly smoking-related fires.\" The new prohibition on smoking \"will have the biggest implications in New York,\" The New York Times reports , where the nation's largest public housing agency \"has lagged behind many of its smaller counterparts in adopting smoke-free policies.\" Questions remain about how the ban will be enforced. HUD said in the rule that it was leaving it up to individual public housing authorities to use \"lease enforcement actions\" to make sure tenants don't smoke in the buildings, and suggested \"a graduated enforcement approach that includes escalating warnings with documentation to the tenant file.\" However, those decisions will remain at the discretion of each public housing authority. \"The last thing that we want are evictions,\" Castro told reporters, according to the Times. \"We don't see this as a policy that is meant to end in a whole lot of evictions. We're confident that public housing authority staff can work with residents so that that can be avoided.\" The rule does not ban electronic cigarettes, but does allow individual public housing authorities to prohibit them at their discretion. It's unclear what kind of action the incoming Trump administration will take on this issue. As Pam reports, \"the next administration could overturn it, but ... Castro said he was confident the rule will remain because of the proven health benefits.\" ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Elsa Hosk presents a creation during the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. (Photo: MARTIN BUREAU, AFP/Getty Images) Bells must be ringing across the City of Light, because several angels received their wings on the runway Wednesday. Kendall Jenner and\u00a0Bella and Gigi Hadid were among the winged beauties to strut the legendary runway, hosted for the first time in Paris. The toned women walked as Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and The Weeknd performed, adding a musical backdrop to the over-the-top lingerie costumes.\u00a0Swedish model Elsa Hosk wore one of the most dramatic ensembles, with a Chinese dragon wrapped around her body. The\u00a02016 cast\u00a0includes 51 women, from\u00a0 newcomer\u00a0Bella Hadid to seasoned pro\u00a0Adriana Lima. Backstage,\u00a0chaos reigned before the show began, as\u00a0the women received final touches on makeup and hair, the latter designed to reflect\u00a0their natural strands this year. Stylist Sarah Potempa told Refinery 29 they would be ditching the extensions that have previously dominated. \"We want to embrace everyone's natural beauty,\" Potempa said. \"We're giving a carefree approach to the length and type of curl. Some women with shorter hair, maybe a lob, will walk with that hair. We're not gonna add extensions to make it super-long ... we're not gonna put a wig on. We\u2019re gonna embrace it. There are 51 women, and we\u2019re gonna make them feel their most beautiful.\" Maria Borges (from left), Luma Grothe and Megan Williams backstage. \u00a0(Photo: Pascal Le Segretain, Getty Images Europe) While stylists went to work on her hair, Jasmine Tookes talked about another highlight of this year's lingerie show: the $3 million fantasy bra. \"It is so beautiful. It's covered in white diamonds and emeralds and it has about 9,000 gemstones,\" she gushed. \"So stunning.\" Tookes is the third black Angel chosen to wear the coveted bra, which she said was constructed on a mold of her upper body. \"It's very heavy; it weighs more than 450 karats. It weighs down on my shoulders a little bit, but it's so worth it,\" she said. \"I might jog out of this show with it, though.\" ",

By Mark Berman November 30 at 7:38 PM Follow @markberman Protesters raise their arms during a march in Charlotte on Sept. 22 prompted by the fatal shooting of Keith Scott. (Jeff Siner/The Charlotte Observer via AP) The\u00a0officer who fatally shot a Charlotte man in September will not be charged for the shooting, prosecutors said Wednesday, concluding that the man was armed and that the officer acted lawfully during the encounter. \u201cIt\u2019s a justified shooting based on the totality\u00a0of the circumstances,\u201d\u00a0R. Andrew Murray, district attorney for\u00a0Mecklenburg County, said during a news conference. The shooting of Keith Lamont Scott on Sept. 20 set off days of heated, sometimes violent protests in Charlotte, some of the most intense demonstrations seen nationwide amid an increased focus on how police use deadly force. Murray said that the recommendation from 15 career prosecutors in this case was unanimous. He said\u00a0that he informed Scott\u2019s family of the decision earlier Wednesday. \u201cIt was a difficult decision,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHowever, the family was extremely gracious.\u201d Scott\u2019s family said they were \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d by\u00a0the announcement.\u00a0They also thanked Murray and investigators for sharing information about how the probe unfolded and concluded. Charles Monnett, an attorney for the family, suggested during a news conference that\u00a0Scott\u2019s relatives\u00a0may still seek a civil lawsuit against the police department or the city for the shooting, adding: \u201cWe look\u00a0forward to someday obtaining justice for Keith and his family.\u201d [ Video taken by Scott\u2019s wife shows her pleading for his life ] Police have said that Scott raised\u00a0a gun at officers before Brentley Vinson, a\u00a0black plainclothes officer in Charlotte, fired the fatal shots. Scott\u2019s family has disputed that the 43-year-old\u00a0pointed a gun at the officer and whether he had a gun. After the shooting, police released photos of a gun and ankle holster, and authorities said that gun was loaded and had Scott\u2019s fingerprints and DNA. During the news conference, Murray pored over details from the day of the shooting, ultimately saying he had no doubt that Scott had a gun during the encounter. He also said\u00a0the gun \u2014 a Colt. 380 semi-automatic \u2014 was loaded, the safety was off and\u00a0a bullet was in the chamber. \u201cThere\u2019s been some speculation in the community regarding whether Mr. Scott\u00a0was armed,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAll of the credible and available evidence suggests that he was, in fact, armed.\u201d District Attorney Andrew Murray\u00a0discussing evidence as he announced the decision Wednesday. (Diedra Laird/Charlotte Observer via AP) In a letter to Bob Schurmeier, head of the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation, and Kerr Putney, chief of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police force, Murray said that evidence included DNA on the gun\u2019s grip and slide, officers discussing seeing the gun on the radio before the shooting and a person admitting they illegally sold Scott the same gun found at the shooting scene. Police\u00a0had previously released a photo of a \u201cblunt\u201d from the scene. Authorities said\u00a0officers in an unmarked car in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred were conducting surveillance in an unrelated case when they saw Scott, in his own car, rolling the blunt with marijuana. Murray said Wednesday that while police said they were not going to act on the marijuana, they decided to move on Scott when they saw him raise a gun while sitting in his car. Vinson was\u00a0not wearing a recording device at the time of the shooting, police said, but the department released other videos from the scene after intense pressure.\u00a0Murray said Wednesday that none of the videos showed Scott with the gun in his hand when he got out of his car, something all four officers at the scene reported seeing. A still image from a video the Charlotte police released showing Keith Scott looking\u00a0at\u00a0officers\u00a0with hands by his sides just before he was shot. (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department\u00a0via\u00a0Reuters) However, Murray\u00a0said that videos did appear to show that Scott\u2019s pant leg was pulled up above where police said they recovered the ankle holster. During the briefing, Murray also showed surveillance video footage from the same day showing a bulge in Scott\u2019s ankle that he said was consistent with a holster and a gun. In a recording of the shooting taken\u00a0by Scott\u2019s wife,\u00a0Rakeyia, she can be heard yelling at the officers that her husband was unarmed while pleading with them not to fire. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don\u2019t shoot him.\u201d In his report on the shooting, Murray said that officers called on Scott to drop his gun 10 times before he got out of his SUV and continued saying it after he was\u00a0out of the car. Vinson told authorities that\u00a0he felt Scott was\u00a0\u201can imminent\u00a0threat\u201d to him and the other officers. During an interview with\u00a0a Charlotte detective conducted a day after the shooting, Vinson said he fired because\u00a0Scott was looking at the officers like he was \u201ctrying to decide who he wanted to shoot first.\u201d \u201cI felt like if I didn\u2019t do anything right then at that point it\u2019s like he\u2026he was gonna shoot me or he\u2019s gonna shoot one a my buddies, um, and it was gonna happen right now,\u201d Vinson said during the interview, according to a transcript released\u00a0by Murray\u2019s office. The family of Keith Lamont Scott \u2014 including his wife Rakeyia Scott, right\u00a0\u2014 at a news conference\u00a0after finding out charges would not be filed against the officer who shot and killed him. (Davie Hinshaw/The Charlotte Observer via AP) Footage from a body camera worn by another officer at the scene\u00a0captured part of the encounter, but it lacked audio because the officer did not activate it until after the shooting. Investigators and the public were therefore unable to learn\u00a0some key details about what happened before the shots were fired. An autopsy showed that Scott had four gunshot wounds , including one to his back. According to Murray, investigators\u00a0spoke to a number of people who said they saw the shooting, but some of them gave conflicting statements. Three of these people had said on social media or told reporters they thought Scott was unarmed, but investigators determined they never saw the shooting, Murray said. The State Bureau of Investigation put 63 agents on this probe, and they spend more than 2,300 hours on the case, Murray said. While initial accounts\u00a0said that Scott was reading a book when he encountered police, state investigators found no evidence he had a book with him when he was shot. Police in Charlotte, N.C., released video from one body camera and one dashboard camera on Sept. 24th of the fatal Keith Scott shooting. (Editor's note: This video contains graphic content.) (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department) Scott\u2019s family, as well as attorneys representing them, called on anyone who protests the decision to do so peacefully. \u201cWhile we understand that many in the Charlotte area share our frustration and pain, we ask that everyone work together to fix the system that allowed this tragedy to happen in the first place,\u201d the Scott family said in a statement released through their attorneys. \u201cAll our family wanted was justice and for these members of law enforcement to understand that what they did was wrong.\u201d By 7 p.m. Wednesday, a small group of\u00a0protesters wearing ponchos gathered in the rain outside the Charlotte police headquarters.\u00a0The crowd gradually grew to a few dozen demonstrators over the next two hours as the rain receded. The protesters\u00a0marched through downtown to a spot where a man, Justin Carr,\u00a0was fatally shot during a previous protest in September in the days after Scott\u2019s killing. Police said three people were arrested for obstructing traffic. A suspect was arrested, who according to officials confessed to the Carr killing, but the demonstrators Wednesday continued to blame police for his\u00a0death. \u201cWe recognize that for some members of our community, this news will be met with different reactions,\u201d the city of Charlotte said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cNo matter where you stand on the issue, the events surrounding the Scott shooting have forever changed our community, and we intend to learn from and build a stronger Charlotte because of it.\u201d The unrest set off by Scott\u2019s death left the city reeling\u00a0and struggling to return to normal . Some small protests continued after the demonstrations that garnered national media coverage, while downtown streets remained unsettled\u00a0in the aftermath of peaceful protests that had descended into chaos. \u201cThe lives of both the Scott and Vinson families have been changed forever,\u201d the\u00a0Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cOne of our officers\u2019 had to make the difficult but split second decision to use their service weapon and as a result a life was lost. In these circumstances, it is important that we remain focused on our sworn duty and unwavering commitment to protecting our community along with serving it.\u201d Vinson was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. A police spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding his status after Murray\u2019s announcement. Scott is one of 875 people fatally shot by police officers so far this year, according to a\u00a0Washington Post database tracking such shootings. Charges against officers who fatally shoot people are rare, but this number has increased recently after waves of protests prompted by high-profile deaths involving police\u00a0in New York, Baltimore, Cleveland and Baton Rouge. Earlier this month, prosecutors in Minnesota said they were charging an officer \u00a0with manslaughter for fatally shooting\u00a0man during a July\u00a0encounter partially streamed on Facebook. In September, while Charlotte was still roiled by protests, a Tulsa police officer was charged with manslaughter for\u00a0shooting and killing an unarmed black man four days before Scott was killed.

    "text": "Lawsuits Challenge Abortion Restrictions in 3 States By david crary, ap national writer NEW YORK \u0097 Nov 30, 2016, 8:31 PM ET 0 Shares Email Taking the offensive after Election Day setbacks, Planned Parenthood and its allies filed lawsuits Wednesday in North Carolina, Missouri and Alaska challenging laws that they view as unconstitutional restrictions on abortion. \"We are going to fight back state by state and law by law until every person has the right to pursue the life they want, including the right to decide to end a pregnancy,\" said Planned Parenthood's chief medical officer, Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley. McDonald-Mosley was joined at a teleconference by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights, which are partners in the litigation. The attorneys said the lawsuits are a follow-up to a major U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier this year that struck down tough abortion laws in Texas. The restrictions being challenged in Missouri are similar to those that the high court struck down in Texas. They require abortion clinics to meet physical standards for surgical centers and mandate that their doctors have admitting privileges in nearby hospitals. Partly as a result of those laws, only one licensed abortion clinic remains in operation in Missouri. To reach that clinic in St. Louis, some women must drive more than 300 miles, Planned Parenthood officials said. Targets of the other lawsuits: \u2014Restrictions in Alaska, passed more than 40 years ago, that in effect ban abortion in outpatient health centers after the first trimester of pregnancy. The abortion-rights lawyers said this forces many women to make lengthy out-of-state trips for second-trimester procedures; Planned Parenthood alone says it sends about 30 women out of state each year to get abortions. \u2014A North Carolina law that prevents doctors from performing abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy with a narrow exception for immediate medical emergencies. The ACLU said this ban forces doctors caring for a woman with a high-risk pregnancy to delay necessary care until her condition imposes an immediate threat of death or major medical damage. \"A woman must be able to make health decisions at different points in her pregnancy that are best for her circumstances, including whether to end a pregnancy, without interference from politicians,\" said Irena Como, staff attorney for the ACLU of North Carolina. The lawsuits were announced as supporters of abortion rights brace for renewed anti-abortion efforts at the state and federal level in the aftermath of the sweeping Republican victories on Election Day. A prominent anti-abortion leader, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, said the lawsuits were a sign of panic by abortion-rights advocates. \"They lost big at the ballot box, so now they're looking to the courts to undo the will of state legislatures,\" she said. \"They realize the sense of urgency to head to the courts now knowing that the judicial landscape will change under a pro-life President Trump.\" The Republican-controlled Congress is expected to seek a halt to federal funding of Planned Parenthood and also to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. President-elect Donald Trump says he favors both measures, and also has promised to fill Supreme Court vacancies with justices who would consider overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. Abortion-rights groups' concerns deepened with Tuesday's announcement that GOP Rep. Tom Price, a physician from Georgia, is Trump's choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Price is a longtime foe of abortion and critic of Planned Parenthood. At the state level, lawmakers in several Republican-controlled legislatures are planning to propose new abortion restrictions in sessions that convene in January. In some states, such as Iowa, election gains for the GOP improve the prospects for passage of such measures. Even in Texas, despite the recent rebuff by the Supreme Court, new restrictions are in the offing. One new rule \u2014 requiring the cremation or burial of fetal remains \u2014 is scheduled to take effect in three weeks. McDonald-Mosley, the Planned Parenthood medical officer, said the overall political developments add up to \"the biggest threat we've seen\" in the organization's 100-year history. She said it was too early to gauge the likelihood \u2014 or the impact \u2014 of a halt to Planned Parenthood's federal funding, which goes primarily to subsidize contraception and other non-abortion medical services for low-income women. \"We're working to be prepared,\" McDonald-Mosley said. \"We're going to provide care to our patients whether they have insurance or not.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Martha Waggoner in Raleigh, North Carolina, Margaret Stafford in Kansas City, Missouri, and Rachel D'Oro in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been updated to say that the Alaska restrictions in effect ban abortion in outpatient health centers after the first trimester of pregnancy. The restrictions do not officially ban abortion. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/CraryAP 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Sudarsan Raghavan November 30 at 4:11 PM Follow @raghavanWaPo Ahmed Sadek carries his 2-year-old grandson, Osama Hassan, in the mountainous area of Bani Saifan, where their village is located. Osama is suffering from severe malnutrition, but his family cannot afford to send him to a hospital. (Sudarsan Raghavan/The Washington Post) The family of Osama Hassan faced a wrenching choice as his tiny body wasted away. Should they use the little money they had, in a time of war, to take the 2-year-old to a hospital? Or should they buy food to feed their other children? His family chose food. Outside their hut, Ahmed Sadek grimly observed his frail grandson, who was lying on a wooden cot and staring blankly at the gray sky. His hair was sparse, his teeth decayed, his arms sticklike. He could no longer walk on his spindly legs. With every raspy breath, Osama\u2019s ribs protruded through his dry skin. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do for him,\u201d Sadek said. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to die.\u201d Every day children are perishing in rural Yemen, where two-thirds of the nation\u2019s population lives. Parents are forced to decide between saving their sick children and preventing healthier ones from following the same perilous route. Cemeteries in this desperately poor and rugged stretch of villages in the northwest contain the bodies of children who have recently died of hunger and preventable diseases. Most are buried in unmarked graves, their deaths unreported to authorities. The watered grave of Udai Faisal, who died of severe acute malnutrition, is marked only by stones, at a graveyard in Hazyaz village on the southern outskirts of Sanaa, in March. (Hani Mohammed/AP) The more fortunate are taken to a hospital, often hours away on broken roads. Survival, though, is bittersweet. Families are often bankrupt after paying for medical care, and the children return home to the same cycle of war- induced poverty and malnutrition. Hunger has long gripped the Middle East\u2019s poorest country, its hold tightening as the nation \u00adcollapsed after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled President Ali Abdullah Saleh. But Yemen\u2019s \u00ad20-month-old civil war has brought the country closer to famine. The health system and other safety nets that caught many children before their bodies withered away are frayed or have disappeared. International aid agencies are facing a multitude of barriers, including airstrikes by a Saudi-led coalition helped by the United States and obstruction by the rebels who rule the capital, Sanaa, as well as the main northern sea port of Hodeidah. The U.N. Children\u2019s Fund estimates that 370,000 Yemeni children are severely malnourished and facing death, and 2 million are in urgent need of help. \u201cThis is an entire generation that\u2019s at risk here,\u201d said Erin Hutchinson, Yemen director for the aid agency Action Against Hunger. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a worsening situation as the conflict continues, and it\u2019s not stabilizing. The needs are only deepening at the moment.\u201d A malnourished boy sits on a bed at a malnutrition treatment center in Sanaa, Yemen on Oct. 30, 2016. (Khaled Abdullah/Reuters) Few aid agencies to help Osama was born prematurely six months before the war started. Underweight, his first view of the world was from inside an incubator. His father worked in Saudi Arabia as a laborer, like tens of thousands of others in Hajjah province, which borders the kingdom. His grandfather sold grain from the family\u2019s small farm at the base of a craggy mountain. There was money, but not much, to take Osama to a hospital. By March 2015, northern rebels known as Houthis had seized the capital and forced President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi into exile, fracturing the nation. Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries entered the conflict to restore him to power with the Pentagon providing weapons, intelligence and other forms of support. The rebels, aligned with Saleh\u2019s loyalists, control the northwest, while portions of the south and east are held by forces backing Hadi\u2019s government. Radical Islamists, including al-Qaeda\u2019s local branch and an emerging Islamic State affiliate, rule areas that aren\u2019t under government or rebel\u00a0control. Few aid agencies operate in Bani Saifan and other remote areas. Hospitals have been destroyed by airstrikes or depleted of medicine partly because of a Saudi air and naval blockade. Jobs have disappeared as the violence and siege have torn up Yemen\u2019s economy and displaced more than 3 million people, nearly half of whom are children. With the border closed, Osama\u2019s father never returned from Saudi Arabia. Soon, his remittances stopped. The child\u2019s grandfather and uncle care for him, his mother and three siblings, as well as 20 other relatives. \u201cThis year is more difficult than last year,\u201d said Sadek, a thin man with a white beard. \u201cMany people can no longer afford to buy my grain. They are suffering like us.\u201d Osama\u2019s body began to break down this year. Unable to afford fruit, vegetables and other nutritious foods, his family fed him a diet of goat\u2019s milk and biscuits. Unclean water and poor sanitation abetted his decline. Three children have died of hunger in their village this year, Sadek said. Other families in Bani Saifan face a similar situation. Four months ago, Faris al-Shamiri \u00adburied his 9-month-old daughter, Samah, in a cemetery near their home. \u201cA lot of children are buried there,\u201d Shamiri said. \u201cTwo months old, 6 months old, they are of different ages. Most of them have died of hunger.\u201d Samah had stopped eating. But Shamiri delayed taking her to the hospital because he didn\u2019t have money, and prayed that she would improve. Samah died in the intensive care unit. \u2018No sense of urgency\u2019 Help for the region is hardly on the way. The Houthi administration is struggling financially as the war strangles the economy. And the United Nations has raised less than half of its appeal to international donors this year as Yemen remains in the shadow of Iraq, Syria and other crises. \u201cYemen ultimately is a media blackout,\u201d said Jamie McGoldrick, the top U.N. humanitarian official in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting the attention it deserves. It\u2019s not Aleppo. We don\u2019t have drones flying over it showing the destruction. We don\u2019t have a \u00adMosul, which has BBC cameras 24-7 on it.\u201d Osama\u2019s uncle took him to the nearest government clinic, a bumpy journey on a motorcycle taxi that lasted an hour. There was no doctor to serve the district\u2019s population of 70,000. The staff hasn\u2019t been paid in three months. Medicine and supply cabinets were empty. A nutritional supplement provided by UNICEF to treat severe malnutrition, a peanut-base paste known as Plumpy\u2019Nut, had run out. The Houthi authorities have not cleared deliveries for weeks, said Bismarck Swangin, a UNICEF spokesman. He added that 240 health facilities in the north and coastal areas were facing the same predicament. Vaccines and other essential supplies have also sat for months in neighboring countries, awaiting approval from the Houthis. The rebels, long suspicious of the West and running out of resources, seek to control and direct the flow of aid, Western aid officials\u00a0say. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two levels of a blockade, really,\u201d said a senior U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing relations with the rebel government. \u201cThe blockade which is the result of the [Saudi-led] coalition, an economic blockade of the country. Inside that blockade, you have some elements of the [Houthi] authorities who are making life so incredibly complicated. The medical response is not as effective as it could be. \u201cThere\u2019s a malnutrition crisis in the country,\u201d the official added, \u201cand yet the overall government approach seems to show no sense of urgency.\u201d Mohammed Albukhaiti, a Houthi political official, denied the allegation. He blamed the crisis on the Saudi-led coalition, saying that it \u201chas stopped many medicines from coming into the country and [is] selective in what they allow to enter.\u201d The coalition has publicly blamed the Houthis for Yemen\u2019s \u00adhumanitarian woes.

(AFP/Getty Images) Legs of a malnourished boy are pictured at a malnutrition treatment center in Sanaa. (Khaled Abdullah/Reuters) At the government clinic, the need for urgency is unmistakable. Last month alone, 116 children under the age of 5 arrived with severe malnutrition, 17 of them from Bani Saifan. \u201cCan you help my child?\u201d pleaded Zahra Meksha, who was carrying her malnourished \u00ad4-year-old daughter, Widad. She explained that her husband was unemployed and that they were surviving on milk and yogurt. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything for her,\u201d said Hassan Chailan, the clinic\u2019s malaria coordinator. \u201cShe needs to be admitted to a hospital for at least a week.\u201d The clinic advised Osama\u2019s uncle to take the child to a therapeutic feeding center at the main government hospital in Hajjah city, the provincial capital. But the trip there, a three-hour drive from their village, costs $50, a princely sum in Bani Saifan. Two weeks after his clinic visit, Osama was still at home, his face gaunt and taut like an old man. By then, his grandfather had made a decision. There were too many mouths to feed in the family, including Osama\u2019s 4-year-old brother, who had also suffered from malnutrition but was \u00adimproving. \u201cThis is God\u2019s judgment,\u201d Sadek said, looking first at Osama, then at his other grandson. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Osama Hassan suffers from severe hunger in Bani Saifan, Yemen. (Sudarsan Raghavan/The Washington Post) \u2018He died in my arms\u2019 Even when a child is taken to the hospital, there are no guarantees. Ali Humeit and his wife, who live less than a mile from Bani Saifan, took their 5-year-old son, Rayaan, to the malnutrition ward of Hajjah hospital. It was a return visit. In October, Rayaan was hooked up to an IV drip and given nutritional supplements and medicine. He recovered his appetite in 10 days. But when he returned home, he began to lose weight fast. His parents could only afford to feed him water, milk, tea and\u00a0bread. \u201cSince the war began, I have not been working,\u201d said Humeit, who was a construction worker before the conflict. For the first hospital visit, Humeit borrowed $150 from othervillagers. This time, he was forced to beg on the street, he said. At night his wife sleeps with their child at the hospital, and he beds down free on the floor of a nearby\u00a0mosque. With four other children to feed, Humeit has prepared himself for the most agonizing decision of his life if Rayaan gets ill again. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have money, I can\u2019t bring him back,\u201d he said, looking at his son, who was visibly irritated and crying. \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave him at home, and let God handle\u00a0it.\u201d Abdul Fatah Baashami and his wife never got to see their only child, Nabil, walk or talk. Eight months ago, the signs of hunger emerged: swollen stomach, loss of weight. Nabil refused to breast-feed. So his parents carried him to nearby private hospitals, then to the same clinic where Osama had been taken. But he still teetered between life and\u00a0death. Then last month, Baashami\u2019s father died. As the eldest son, he was suddenly responsible for 18 relatives. He earned $1 to $3 a day as a laborer \u2014 whenever he found work. \u201cI owe a lot of people money \u2014 $650,\u201d he said. Abdul Fatah Baashami stands next to grave of his only child, Nabil, who died of hunger. He was 14 months old. (Sudarsan Raghavan/The Washington Post) When Nabil\u2019s health deteriorated, the couple borrowed more money to take him to the hospital in Hajjah. \u201cMy son was just skin and bones,\u201d recalled Najua Showken, 18, his mother. In the morning, an hour before their trip, she tried to breast-feed Nabil. Too weak to respond, he began to fade away. Drifting in and out of consciousness until his \u201ceyes were rolling up,\u201d he finally went silent, his mother said. \u201cHe died in my arms,\u201d she said. Nabil had lived for 14 months. Three hours later, after Nabil\u2019s body was washed and wrapped in a white cloth in accordance with Muslim ritual, he was placed in a grave at a cemetery a short walk from their home, where eight other children were buried this\u00a0year. The cost of his funeral was covered by the money his father had borrowed to save the child\u2019s\u00a0life. Ali Al-Mujahed contributed to this report. Read more: ",

Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. Gene J. Puskar/AP You might not know his name but you undoubtedly know his famous sandwich, and many of us remember singing its ingredients along with a commercial in the 1970s: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.\" YouTube Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac, died Monday. He was 98. Delligatti was one of McDonald's earliest franchise holders, opening his first restaurant in Pittsburgh in 1957. He eventually owned and operated 47 additional McDonald's locations in Western Pennsylvania, making him one of the single largest franchise holders in company history. Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th-birthday party in 2008. Gene J. Puskar/AP hide caption toggle caption Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th-birthday party in 2008. Gene J. Puskar/AP The menu was pretty simple back in those early days \u2014 hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes. But Delligatti saw that his customers wanted something bigger, so in 1967 at his restaurant in Uniontown, Pa., he put together two hamburger patties, topped it with cheese, lettuce, onions and pickles, and he developed a special sauce for the burger. He called it the Big Mac. In a 1993 interview with the Associated Press, he said McDonald's initially rejected the burger. \"I tried for two years to have McDonald's let me try to make this Big Mac and they said no,\" Delligatti said, adding, \"They figured, why go to something else if [the original menu] was working so well?\" So Delligatti made and sold Big Macs in his Pittsburgh-area restaurants, experimenting with the special sauce along the way, until eventually, McDonald's executives came around and began selling the Big Mac nationally. Now, almost 50 years later, the Big Mac is sold in more than 100 countries and has become the most popular sandwich on the planet, according to the fast-food chain. Article continues after sponsorship An obituary put out by his family notes that Delligatti was a true innovator in the fast-food industry, instrumental in introducing breakfast at McDonald's, making the hotcakes and sausage meals for hungry millworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the steel mills. Delligatti co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House and supported many other charities in Western Pennsylvania. He also served in the Army in World War II. \"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" reads a statement from McDonald's corporate headquarters. \"He is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children. We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman.\" ",

    "text": "Nov 30 2016, 12:42 pm ET Lawmakers Strike Deal to Help Soldiers Forced to Pay Back Bonuses by Corky Siemaszko Christmas has come early for the thousands of vets who were being forced to pay back the money they got for reenlisting to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. California Army National Guard soldiers at Moffett Federal Airfield in 2011. Paul Sakuma / AP file Lawmakers reached a compromise on Tuesday that allows the Pentagon to forgive the enlistment bonuses of $15,000 or more and student loan benefits that were improperly awarded to thousands of soldiers, mostly in California. \"This largely meets the needs of the soldiers who accepted their bonuses in good faith, as the vast majority of them did,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff , a California Democrat. \"It should give these soldiers peace of mind during the holidays that the Pentagon won't claw them back.\" \"This is an important fix that ultimately does the right thing,\" added Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican. The compromise is part of a defense bill that the House is expected to vote on Friday and which the Senate will take up next week, lawmakers said . Robert D'Andrea, an Iraq war veteran who served with the U.S. Army and the California National Guard, holds a framed photo of his team during his first deployment to Iraq. Al Seib / AP file It would require that the Defense Department refund any repayments soldiers have already made \u2014 as long as they are not guilty of fraud. And it would put the onus on the Pentagon to inform the credit agencies that the debt has been paid. The scandal goes back a decade to when the Bush administration, which was struggling to find soldiers to fight two unpopular wars, began encouraging state National Guard units to offer sign-up bonuses. Some 9,700 California National Guard soldiers got the bonuses in 2006 and 2007. Then in 2010, federal investigators discovered that thousands of those bonuses, as well as student loan payments, were improperly approved. But instead of forgiving the botched bonuses, the California National Guard sicced auditors on the soldiers arguing that the law did not allow them to do otherwise. They concluded that a majority of those soldiers, about 6,500, needed to repay the money because they were not actually eligible for them or the paperwork was riddled with errors. There was a national outcry when the Los Angeles Times broke the story earlier this year and prompted Defense Secretary Ash Carter in October to order the Pentagon to stop clawing-back the bonuses while lawmakers worked on a fix.
