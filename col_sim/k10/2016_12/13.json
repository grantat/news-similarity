    "text": "Share via Email First lady Michelle Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 25, 2016. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Three weeks after Inauguration Day in 2009 and still a long way from crafting an agenda, Michelle Obama climbed into her motorcade and paid a visit to Mary\u2019s Center, a Latino community services agency a few miles north of the White House. She read \u201c Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? \u201d to the young children and met with teenagers who asked why she had come. The first reason, she said, was that Washington was now the Obamas\u2019 home and they had always been taught to listen and not just pass on by. The second reason identified the audience and framed the approach that would define this most uncommon first lady\u2019s agenda for the next eight years. \u201cI think it\u2019s real important for young kids, particularly kids who come from communities without resources, to see me, not the first lady,\u201d she said. \u201cTo see that there is no magic to me sitting here. There are no miracles that happen. There is no magic dust.\u201d With the 13 teenagers seated in a semicircle, Obama shared the setbacks and self-doubt she faced as the daughter of black working-class parents in Chicago. When people told her she couldn\u2019t achieve something, she set out to prove them wrong. One step at a time, she climbed, and now she felt an obligation to share. \u201cWhen you get, you give back,\u201d she said. Obama would give much bigger speeches on much bigger stages as she became one of the most famous people in the world. For many Democrats, she was the moral voice of the 2016 presidential campaign, calling out Republican Donald Trump for trafficking in \u201cprejudice, fears and lies.\u201d For other fans, she was simply the first lady who went viral, making them smile with her eclectic fashion choices and her energetic, sometimes goofy pitches for healthier eating. The heart of Obama\u2019s efforts, however, was a message about the persistent inequities of race, class and gender in America. In scores of speeches and projects, she turned again and again to the stacked deck. These were the themes and conundrums that animated her work before she reached the White House and now seem certain to shape her choices after she departs. For all the grief she took from critics who conjured radicalism, grievance or, bizarrely, racism from her finely tuned remarks, Obama\u2019s antidotes were fundamentally timeless and conservative. More than anything, she used the strength of her own Chicago-to-Princeton-to-the-White-House narrative to urge kids to believe in themselves and never quit. She mastered the levers of popular culture and harnessed the convening power of her office and her carefully curated brand to establish partnerships with the private sector.

(Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Obama addressed obesity, which disproportionately affects low-income families and children of color. She worked to increase arts education in poorly performing schools and ease the path for aspiring first-generation college students. She dispensed hugs to thousands of children, saying in a simple embrace that she believed in them. At a BET special, she called out, \u201cBlack girls rock!\u201d A straight-talker by temperament, she modulated her tone in deference to the role. Eternally disciplined and pragmatic, she never swung for the fences. Critics on the left chided her for not being bold enough, as she acknowledged last year. Her answer: \u201cThese were my choices, my issues, and I decided to tackle them in the way that felt most authentic to me \u2014 in a way that was both substantive and strategic, but also fun and, hopefully, inspiring.\u201d When Obama took up her unpaid job three days after her 45th birthday, she faced vast and conflicting expectations. She was the first African American first lady in a country that was anything but post-racial. She was the magnetic campaigner who told audiences that power concedes nothing without a struggle. She was the highly educated, professionally accomplished mother of two young daughters who smilingly adopted the moniker of \u201cmom in chief.\u201d \u201cFrom the moment we walked in the door, people have wanted to get inside her head and figure her out. \u2018Is she in this box or that box? Why isn\u2019t she doing this or doing that?\u2019 \u201d said Jocelyn Frye, a Harvard Law School friend who became Obama\u2019s first policy adviser. \u201cShe\u2019s not a person who lives in boxes. It\u2019s just not that simple.\u201d Her road to the White House The personal story that Obama carried into the White House in January 2009 was enough to etch her name in the history books even if she did not accomplish anything more. She called herself \u201cthe little black girl from the South Side of Chicago.\u201d As she would say later, her ancestors had arrived in the United States in chains and now she and Barack Obama were living in a home that slaves helped build. But in other ways, too, Obama brought a set of experiences markedly different from her modern-day predecessors. Of the previous eight presidents, four had been governors, four had been vice presidents. Their wives had lived in the public eye. Obama was a young Chicago professional, a working mother in a big city who spoke openly about juggling jobs, chores and child-rearing with her increasingly famous and preoccupied husband. By upbringing, she was urban and attuned to issues of prejudice, hardship and inequality. She adored her father, Fraser C. Robinson III, a gregarious aspiring artist who spent his working life as a shift worker in the city water plant. A swimmer, boxer and soldier as a young man, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his 30s. His health deteriorated, and he went from one crutch to two to a motorized cart. He died in 1991 at age 55, still working at the plant. Both of Obama\u2019s grandfathers had come north in the Great Migration, and many members of the Robinson and Shields families lived nearby. Purnell Shields, a talented carpenter and Obama\u2019s maternal grandfather, was barred as an African American from the labor unions that claimed the highest-paying jobs. Fraser C. Robinson Jr. spent much of his career as a postal worker. If he had been born white, Obama once said, he would have been a banker. Obama spent time with this extended family. She knew them all, from those who were prospering to those who were ailing or just getting by. She also knew countless schoolmates who seemed hardly different from her, yet had fallen short of their ambitions. When Barack Obama met her in 1989, he detected a sense of vulnerability that he traced to Michelle\u2019s sense that life was \u201cterrifyingly random.\u201d She called herself \u201ca statistical anomaly.\u201d After ditching the prosperous law firm, where she found the work soulless and many colleagues narrow, she spent two years doing economic development work at City Hall with future White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. Next, in what she described as the happiest phase of her working life, she built the Chicago office of Public Allies, a nonprofit leadership training program with roots in community organizing. Next, she spent a dozen years as an administrator at the University of Chicago, where she elevated the interests of neighboring African American communities. Much as she would in the White House, she searched for ways to connect a powerful and often remote institution with communities where it could do some good. Comfortable and connected in both worlds, she saw herself as a bridge. In 2001, protesters seeking more construction jobs for African Americans at the university medical center said she should be fired. One said Obama and her colleagues were looking out for themselves and did \u201cnot have the best interests of blacks at heart.\u201d Obama persisted. In the next seven years, 42.9 percent of the hospital\u2019s spending on new construction, or $48.8 million, went to firms run by minorities or women, according to university figures. The focus was not new. At Harvard Law School, where the tenured faculty was 96 percent white and 92 percent male, Obama spoke up for greater diversity. Charles Ogletree, a mentor and professor, pinpointed her passions early. \u201cEverything she wrote, the things that she was involved in, the things that she thought about,\u201d he recalled of her law school years in the mid-1980s, \u201cwere in effect reflections on race and gender. And how she had to keep the doors open for women and men going forward.\u201d A portfolio of passions Michelle Obama exercises with children from Orr Elementary School in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 6, 2013. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) One of Obama\u2019s signatures was the push for a seat at the table \u2014 or in \u201cthe room where it happens,\u201d to borrow from \u201cHamilton,\u201d the Broadway musical the Obamas admire. A few years ago, she told a gathering of White House interns that if they were not prepared to risk their power when they claimed that seat, they needed to make room for someone who would. In reaching the most rarefied of tables, she figured she had four years, maybe eight, to make something happen, to \u201cmove the needle,\u201d as she put it. As the media made a fuss over a new hairstyle, she once explained how she saw the role of first lady: \u201cWe take our bangs and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see. And, eventually, people stop looking at the bangs and they start looking at what we\u2019re standing in front of.\u201d Obama saw early that she could connect with disadvantaged young people by describing her South Side upbringing and the choices she made in her life. Even as the Obamas set out unambiguously to be the president and first lady for the entire country, they were determined \u201cto look out for people who historically have not had people looking out for them,\u201d Valerie Jarrett said in an interview. \u201cCertainly, African American women and girls see themselves in her in a unique way.\u201d The White House portfolio included Let\u2019s Move, her childhood obesity project, and efforts to open the White House and its grounds to kids who barely knew where it was and never imagined stepping inside. She established Joining Forces to help the military and their families with jobs and workplace issues and started a small mentoring program that became a personal cause. She worked on homelessness among veterans and pushed Reach Higher, seeking to increase post-secondary education for low-income adolescents. Finally, she launched Let Girls Learn, an international initiative designed to improve access to secondary school for millions of girls around the world who found themselves on the outside looking in. Throughout, Obama made clear to her staff that she favored coherent projects backed by creative but realistic thinking. She sought buy-in from federal agencies, state governments and private partners, and she wanted to make use of every opportunity. She told her aides, \u201cDon\u2019t just put me on a plane, send me someplace and have me smile.\u201d \u201cShe never looked at things esoterically or theoretically. It was practical and real,\u201d said Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter, who advised her at key moments. \u201cHer focus was never \u2018How do I move Washington?\u2019 It was much bigger than that. It was \u2018How do you mobilize a country? How are real people outside of Washington going to see things?\u2019 \u201d At the White House, she staged arts events, from dance, music and spoken word to food and design workshops. She made sure that artists who were performing for well-heeled East Room audiences at night were teaching children at the White House or local schools during the day. Her tastes tilted to designers, artists, playwrights and directors of color, choices that alerted millions of Obama-watchers to work they might not have seen or heard. In 2011, she helped launch Turnaround Arts, a program designed to deliver arts teaching, inspiration and supplies to some of the worst-performing schools in the country \u2014 often in places where arts programming was a budget casualty. From eight pilot programs in 2011, the project now reaches 68 schools, with 20 to be added in 2017. \u201cShe knows the power of the arts. It\u2019s visceral and it\u2019s who she is,\u201d said Megan Beyer, executive director of the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. \u201cEvery time we do an event, she\u2019ll look at the audience and she\u2019ll say, \u2018This is not a fluke. This is what happens when you invest in these kids.\u2019 \u201d To critics on the right, including former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who mocked or denounced new science-based standards for school lunches as overly intrusive, Obama urged them to look more closely. She pointed to the millions of low-income children who depend on those meals and the federal government\u2019s help in paying for them. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t afford to say, \u2018Oh, well, it\u2019s too hard, so let\u2019s not do it,\u2019 \u201d Obama said in 2014. When lobbyists persuaded Congress to count one-eighth of a cup of tomato paste in pizza sauce as the equivalent of a half-cup of vegetables, she wrote dismissively in the New York Times, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d Preserving normalcy President Obama and the first lady, along with their guests, wear 3-D glasses at a Super Bowl party at the White House in 2009. (Pete Souza/The White House) Inside the East Wing, Obama commanded intense loyalty from her staff and set her own agenda, down to the number of public days on her schedule \u2014 two at first, while Malia and Sasha were getting settled, and later three. She stayed closer to home than Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who each traveled abroad more than twice as much, and put limits on her campaign trips, especially when not campaigning for her husband. She tightly controlled her message. In eight years, she never gave a news conference, although she held a select few roundtables with reporters. She rarely granted interviews to the beat reporters who knew her work the best. More often, and more strategically, she granted face time to grateful personalities and comedians, along with media outlets carefully chosen for the audiences they reached. Aides and friends were barely more accessible. When reporters called, former chief of staff Jackie Norris once said, Obama expected her friends to \u201ccheck in and have conversations and make sure that it\u2019s good for her.\u201d Mostly, the friends did. The first family prepares to board Air Force One on Aug. 21, 2016, after their vacation on Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts. (Steven Senne/Associated Press) Since the beginning of the first presidential campaign nearly 10 years ago, Obama has credited her girlfriends with keeping her grounded amid the maelstrom. \u201cWhen you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s when you need your girls. They can keep you together when no one else can,\u201d said Angela Kennedy, a D.C. public defender and former Princeton roommate who sees Obama regularly. \u201cShe\u2019s smart. She recognized that.\u201d Not trailed by the presidential press pool, Obama escaped to the gym, restaurants, theaters and her friends\u2019 houses, as well as the occasional trip to the presidential retreat at Camp David. It helped to have her mother, Marian Robinson, now 79, living on the third floor of the White House. \u201cI can always go up to her room and cry, complain, argue,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd she just says, go on down there and do what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d Obama spoke often of what it meant to have normal family dinners and activities with Malia and Sasha, talking about the girls\u2019 doings and keeping things light. She has always been able \u201cto stay above the fray,\u201d said Frye, her Harvard friend, in part by \u201cmeeting with real people and talking about real-world problems. At the end of the day, she has kept her head.\u201d Obama\u2019s ascendance \u2014 as mother, mentor, leader and critic \u2014 carries many meanings in American culture, particularly as an African American woman, said Nell Irvin Painter, an emeritus professor of American history at Princeton. \u201cHer power is a symbolic power,\u201d Painter said, noting the way Obama \u201chas conducted herself as first lady. She has grace, there is no question, but I would add elegance. It\u2019s a kind of assurance that is also something new for a black woman in public life. She is the symbol of what an American can be. Michelle Obama has presented a universal American identity.\u201d A voice on race and racism Michelle Obama blows kisses to graduates after delivering the commencement address for Bowie State University, a historically black university, in Maryland in May 2013. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) On May 9, 2015, Obama took the stage at Tuskegee University in Alabama and delivered the most thorough and personal speech about race and racism of her tenure. As a speechmaker, said author Garry Wills, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his study of Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address, \u201cI don\u2019t know that she has any competitors in women\u2019s history.\u201d She wowed millions of fans with keynote addresses at three successive Democratic National Conventions, but she also had a serious body of work that received less attention in mainstream circles. Many times before her Tuskegee appearance, she had spoken about the country\u2019s history of violence and discrimination against African Americans. She did it in Orangeburg, S.C., in 2007 to woo black support for her husband\u2019s candidacy. She did it in Nashville during the 2012 reelection campaign, and in Topeka, Kan., in 2014 to mark the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. And she did it at other historically black universities, including Bowie State, Jackson State and North Carolina A&T. Together, the talks reflected a lifetime of thinking about the shifting landscape of racism, the advances and the setbacks. At Tuskegee, she spoke of slights and hurdles while suggesting strategies \u2014 tested by her own experience, as always \u2014 to block out the noise and navigate a path forward. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: The road ahead is not going to be easy,\u201d she told the graduates in an address that tracked the history of the Tuskegee Airmen, a storied black flying squadron in World War II. \u201cIt never is, especially for folks like you and me. Because while we\u2019ve come so far, the truth is that those age-old problems are stubborn and they haven\u2019t fully gone away. So there will be times, just like for those Airmen, when you feel like folks look right past you or they see just a fraction of who you are.\u201d \u201cToo many folks feel frustrated and invisible,\u201d Obama said. She cited worries about being pulled over \u201cfor absolutely no reason,\u201d or being overlooked for a job \u201cbecause of the way your name sounds,\u201d or sending children to schools \u201cthat may no longer be separate, but are far from equal.\u201d Above all, she said, there is the \u201crealization that no matter how far you rise in life, how hard you work to be a good person, a good parent, a good citizen, for some folks, it will never be enough.\u201d The Obamas were not immune, despite their efforts, their achievements, their conduct. For years, Donald Trump sowed doubts about Barack Obama\u2019s birth and citizenship, while talk show host Rush Limbaugh told his millions of followers that Michelle suffered from \u201cuppity-ism\u201d and called her \u201cMichelle My Butt.\u201d Foes likened her to a character from Planet of the Apes, a Star Wars Wookiee and a gorilla, a racist slur with a particularly long and ugly history. They challenged her patriotism and even questioned her gender. But no matter how grim the outlook and how significant the structural challenges, Obama said at Tuskegee, despair and anger are \u201cnot an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up.\u201d Instead, she proposed the measured, practical, traditional responses that had worked for her. Study, organize, band together, be a mentor, help a cousin fill out a financial aid form and \u201cvote, vote, vote.\u201d \u201cYou have got everything you need to do this. You\u2019ve got it in you,\u201d she said in her best I-believe-in-you tone. \u201cMost of all, you\u2019ve got yourselves and all of the heart, grit and smarts that got you to this day.\u201d It was never Obama\u2019s style to summon people to the barricades. She drew criticism from some African American intellectuals and activists for perpetuating a bootstraps narrative that said black people must be twice as good to do just as well as whites. Painter recognized the critique but saw Obama\u2019s message differently. \u201cShe also says you can figure it out. That\u2019s a crucial part,\u201d Painter said. \u201cHer commentary to black kids is, \u2018You can do it. It\u2019s not just lecturing and shaking her finger in their faces, but an encouragement. It\u2019s pragmatic, but the way she phrases it, it is full of empathy and I think there is still a lack of empathy in the way the United States speaks to black people.\u201d The response to Obama\u2019s remarks provided proof aplenty. Conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham saw \u201ca litany of victimization.\u201d Media comment boards filled with talk of a \u201ctirade\u201d and an \u201cAmerica-hater\u201d and an \u201cangry woman who has no appreciation for the many gifts our country has bestowed on her.\u201d Someone wrote, \u201cCan she or her husband ever just be Americans? Why do they always have to focus on their skin color? Repulsive.\u201d But also, \u201cMichelle for President!\u201d \u2014 something that Obama, whose favorability ratings routinely topped 60 percent, has said will never happen. \u201cNo. Nope. Not going to do it,\u201d she said earlier this year. Assessing America Michelle Obama campaigns with Hillary Clinton in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 27, 2016. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Michelle Obama was dismayed by the rise of Donald Trump. She perceived danger in the candidacy of an unstudied Republican who lied with abandon and routinely mocked and disparaged rivals, critics and entire swathes of the American populace, all the while vowing to wreck much of what the Obama administration spent eight years building. \u201cThis is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\u201d Obama declared at an October rally in New Hampshire after a tape surfaced of Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals. A growing number of women said they had been accosted. \u201cI know it\u2019s a campaign, but this isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about human decency. It\u2019s about right and wrong.\u201d Obama said repeatedly during the campaign that Trump was dangerous, undeserving and lacking \u201cany idea what this job takes.\u201d In Philadelphia, she pointedly recalled Trump\u2019s leadership of the birther movement, referring to the \u201churtful, deceitful questions deliberately designed to undermine\u201d her husband\u2019s presidency. The attacks on Trump were the strongest, sharpest words Obama uttered in public during the White House years. Whatever her anger or dismay, she never said she was surprised, for these were the regressive forces that she had seen in action her entire life. On a weekday morning, with not many people watching, Obama delivered her take on the political moment. To a rapt church audience \u2014 men and women, white and black \u2014 she said in a tone more suited to a seminar than a rally, \u201cMy fear is that we don\u2019t know what truth looks like anymore.\u201d She spoke of her hard-won understanding of the world, drawing on her Chicago life, where persistence and good intentions came with no guarantees. Politicians had become expert at turning doubt into fear, she said, as life got \u201charder, progressively harder, for regular people.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still a nation that\u2019s a little too mean,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI wish mean worked, because we\u2019re good at it. Our tone is bad and we\u2019ve grown to believe that, somehow, mean talk is tough talk . . . and we reward it. Not just in politics, but we reward it in every sliver of our culture. We look on people who are tough and say, \u2018That\u2019s what we need.\u2019 \u201d Obama spoke those words in South Carolina in January 2008. As Trump makes his way to Washington with his gilded pitchfork, her assessment rings true for more than 62\u00a0million Americans who supported him and millions more who didn\u2019t care enough to vote. She is leaving the White House with work unfinished and fresh troubles brewing. She was right that day at Mary\u2019s Center, in her first weeks on the job, when she offered a verdict that applied as much to the nation as to herself. There are no miracles, no magic dust. What Obama offered was something else. To audiences great and small, she presented conviction, savvy, a dose of inspiration and a certain faith that the battles were worth waging and the effort would pay off in the end.

    "text": "CBS/AP Dec 12, 2016 3:30 PM EST CHARLESTON, S.C. -- When he was arrested, the man accused of killing nine people during a Bible study in a Charleston church had a list of other area black churches in his car, law enforcement officials testified on Monday.\u00a0 Murder trial for accused Charleston church shooter begins During roughly two hours on the stand, former State Law Enforcement Division agent Brittany Burke testified that names of a handful of other churches and their addresses were found on a handwritten list in a backpack in Dylann Roof\u2019s car.\u00a0 A yellow piece of paper listed Mother Emanuel AME, Central Baptist, Morris Brown AME, Calvary Episcopal, Ebenezer AME and another Catholic church, CBS Charleston affiliate WCSC reported . On another piece of paper were the addresses, phone numbers and names of churches in Mayesville, Columbia and Eastover. The Associated Press reports that papers found in Roof\u2019s car also included phone numbers for the Statehouse complex in Columbia, as well as the name of Denmark Vesey, one of the founders of Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church, where the shooting that killed nine people took place. Vesey led a failed 1822 slave rebellion that drove the church underground. After the plot was reported, Vesey was hanged and the church was burned. The church was rebuilt, but in 1834 all black churches were banned and members worshiped \u201cunderground\u201d until 1865, when Emanuel AME Church was formally reorganized. Burke is one of the state agents who processed evidence found in Roof\u2019s car when he was arrested after the June 2015 shootings at the church known as Mother Emanuel. A jury began last week hearing testimony against Roof, 22, who is on trial on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion. Roof has formally entered a not guilty plea to all the charges in federal court. But his attorneys have said he\u2019s willing to change that to guilty if prosecutors agree not to seek the death penalty against him. In his videotaped, two-hour confession played for jurors last week, Roof told FBI agents he left bullets in a magazine so that he could kill himself after the slayings but changed his mind when he didn\u2019t see any police immediately after the shooting. \u201cOh no. I was worn out,\u201d Roof said, when an agent asked if he thought about killing more black people.\u00a0 Roof laughed repeatedly in the video and made exaggerated gun motions as he described the massacre. He wanted to leave at least one person alive to tell what happened, he explained, complaining that his victims \u201ccomplicated things\u201d by hiding under tables. Malcolm Graham, whose 54-year-old sister Cynthia Hurd was murdered, spoke to CBS News . \u201cThis was an attack on a race of people and an attack on the Christian church and an attack on humanity,\u201d Graham said. Evidence shown in photographs introduced Monday showed Roof was essentially living in his car. Recovered from his black sedan were multiple items of clothing, food, beverages and an empty liquor bottle. There were also multiple travel brochures, a cellphone, laptop computer and a burned American flag.\u00a0 Additionally, a Confederate flag, a laser attachment for a gun, empty ammunition boxes and glock magazine packaging inserts were discovered in his vehicle, WCSC reported . New developments on how Charleston shooting suspect got gun Jurors were shown a surveillance video showing Roof buying a gun at a store in April 2015,\u00a0 WCSC reported . Prosecutors also questioned a witness who detailed the process of Roof\u2019s gun purchase. Ronnie Thrailkill, manager of Shooter\u2019s Choice in West Columbia, testified that a typical background check was done on Roof when he came in to buy a Glock .45-calibur handgun in April 2015, two months before the shootings.\u00a0 At that time, Thrailkill testified, Roof filled out the standard paperwork required by federal law and left to wait out a three-day waiting period to allow time for background checks. States can add more time onto that window, but no such efforts have passed the state Legislature.\u00a0 Roof had been arrested for drugs two months earlier, but Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon told The Associated Press after the shootings that a jail clerk had entered incorrect information that wasn\u2019t ever fixed in a state database. When Roof sought to buy the gun, an FBI examiner spotted the arrest, but because of the error, called the wrong agency to get his record. Without the necessary documents, the purchase had to go through after three days, and Roof came back for his gun. Victims\u2019 families are suing the FBI for negligence in allowing the sale. FBI Director James Comey has said Roof should have never been allowed to buy the gun and promised a full review. Federal prosecutors have said they could wrap up their case as early as Wednesday. Acknowledging the role of Roof in the shootings , his defense team has been more focused on the penalty phase of the trial \u00a0that will determine whether Roof faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Too Many Favorite Shows? Take Them In at High Speed By CHRISTOPHER MELE Continue reading the main story Photo Some viewers watch movies at an accelerated speed to save time. Credit J. Emilio Flores for The New York Times So much media, so little time. Consumers face a dizzying array of entertainment choices that include streaming video such as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Netflix; cable channels and apps from outlets like HBO and Showtime; YouTube; and as many as 28,000 podcasts . With them all offering uncountable hours of addictive programming, how is a listener or viewer supposed to keep up? For some, the answer is speed watching or speed listening \u2014 taking in the content at accelerated speeds, sometimes two times as fast as normal. While speed viewing does save time \u2014 devotees say it can save hours over the season of a series \u2014 others raise concerns that it undermines the rhythm of a production and can dilute some creative elements. Jan Rezab said in an article in Forbes last year that his viewing eventually progressed from 1.2 times to two times as fast. \u201cAs you continue to speed watch, higher speeds get easier and easier to comprehend,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve been speed watching for the last 2 years, and I now feel comfortable watching at 2x the normal viewing speed.\u201d He watches some even faster. Speed TV Watching - 10 second from Game of Thrones - at 1x speed Video by Jan Rezab Speed TV Watching - 10 second from Game of Thrones - at 1,2x speed Video by Jan Rezab Speed TV Watching - 10 second from Game of Thrones - at 2x speed Video by Jan Rezab Be prepared to jump through a few hoops if you want to speed up your content, though. While some players make it easy to change your playback speed, others make it more difficult. On YouTube, it lives under settings. On Apple\u2019s native podcast app, it\u2019s right next to the play button, and other podcast players have a similar function. Audible, the major audiobook app, offers the option as well. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Netflix, Hulu and HBO, however, don\u2019t offer higher speeds on their players, but there are workarounds available. It\u2019s possible to speed up online video through a Google Chrome extension, and an open-source media player called VLC will play many formats of digital media. Some set-top boxes like TiVo allow high-speed playback of recorded programs. Photo Speed listening to podcasts can save as much as 10 minutes per show, according to a practitioner. Credit Stan Olszewski/Dallas Morning News, via Associated Press It\u2019s not clear how widely the practice has been adopted. In an informal poll on Twitter , David Chen, a host and producer of the movie and television podcast \u201c Slashfilmcast ,\u201d asked, \u201cDo you ever listen to podcasts or watch TV/films at a faster speed than intended?\u201d Of 1,505 responses, 79 percent chose the response \u201cNo, it\u2019s an abomination,\u201d while 16 percent said they did so for podcasts, and a total of 5 percent said they did so for films, television and podcasts. On a recent episode of the podcast , Mr. Chen and his co-hosts, Jeff Cannata and Devindra Hardawar , took up the question of speed viewing. A listener asked, \u201cIn this increasingly content-rich, time-poor world, I wonder, how much of a crime against culture I am committing by speeding through these shows?\u201d The podcast hosts seemed aghast. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d Mr. Cannata, said, adding that the practice \u201ccheapens your entertainment.\u201d Mr. Hardawar said speed viewing did not allow time to soak in what was happening. \u201cI feel like you are not even actually watching it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re consuming it. You\u2019re not actually like absorbing it or letting it work on you in a creative way. So yeah, this is bad. This is bad.\u201d Speed viewing waters down the emotional impacts of a movie, Peter Markham, senior filmmaker-in-residence at the American Film Institute Conservatory in Los Angeles, said in an interview last week. Photo David Chen, a host of the film and television podcast \u201cSlashfilmcast.\u201d Credit David Chen \u201cIf you were watching a play by Pinter, for example, the pause could carry the greatest meaning,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine watching a movie at twice the speed.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Renan L. Borelli, 31, who is director of audience growth and engagement at MTV News and who has a 35-minute commute from Park Slope in Brooklyn to the West Village in Manhattan, is a big fan of podcasts. He listens to as many as three or four a day and subscribes to about 30. Mr. Borelli estimated he could save about five to 10 minutes per podcast. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a couple of minutes, it\u2019s a help,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he has \u201cmany gigabytes\u201d of podcasts stored on his phone. Nicholas Quah, who writes Hot Pod , a newsletter about podcasts, said in an email that it was unclear how widespread speed listening was, but that anecdotally, it appeared to be \u201can established behavior\u201d among high-volume listeners. He said he saw no harm in it. He wrote, \u201cSpeed listening might be more offensive to folks who make highly produced, preciously crafted and sound-rich podcasts (vs. a loose conversational one, like the Slate gabfests), but what we\u2019re actually confronting here is that tension in the relationship between artist and consumer: Which is more important, the artist intent or the consumer\u2019s preference?\u201d Mr. Chen, of \u201cSlashfilmcast,\u201d said in an email that speed listening was a consumer\u2019s way of saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care how you wanted me to experience this work you\u2019ve created. I just care about the information exchanged.\u201d Lost are elements of dramatic or comedic timing and intentional silences, he said. \u201cIt becomes a fundamentally different experience that disregards what the creator intended\u201d at an accelerated speed, he wrote. He said the practice was like trying to eat twice as many meals as normal to avoid missing any culinary treats. \u201cSure, you might actually be consuming more, but you\u2019re probably having a worse, more grotesque experience,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd you\u2019re certainly not doing it in a way that the chef intended.\u201d Correction: December 12, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a video streaming service.

    "text": "\"The election results were correct, nothing will change that,\" elections commission head Alieu Momarr Njai said Sunday, as Reuters reported. \"If it goes to court, we can prove every vote cast. The results are there for everyone to see.\" Jammeh initially said the election must be re-run. Then, as Ofeibea reports: \"Gambia's governing party said it was going the legal route to challenge the results in court. However, the opposition coalition that defeated Jammeh has told journalists that Gambia has no sitting Supreme Court to consider the case. The coalition also says the outgoing president has no constitutional authority, in his final days in office, to appoint new judges to hear his petition.\" It's not clear exactly what role the judiciary will play in the matter, but Jammeh is said to exert significant influence over the country's judges. A challenge to the vote must be submitted to a court by Tuesday, according to Reuters. Leaders from neighboring countries are reportedly flying in to meet with Jammeh. \"The presidents of Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone will arrive in the Gambia on Tuesday to try to persuade him to step down,\" according to The Guardian . Article continues after sponsorship Meanwhile, President-elect Adama Barrow, a businessman, is reportedly afraid for his safety. Over the weekend, Reuters reported, his home \"was surrounded by around 30 unarmed supporters who said they were providing security after the police and military declined to protect him.\" One of the biggest unanswered questions is why Jammeh waited a week before he came out against the election results that would unseat him. The Economist suggests a possible answer: \"[O]ne theory among diplomats in Gambia is that he had become so confident of his own popularity that on this particular vote \u2014 his fifth since seizing power \u2014 he did not bother to rig it, allowing ballots to be counted on the spot rather than in central counting houses away from prying eyes. When that relatively fair and transparent vote caught him by surprise, it took several days for him to work out a plan of action, during which time he had little choice but to play the role of magnanimous loser.\" ",

Plans to release a Wonder Woman comic book next spring dedicated to the empowerment of woman and girls remain on course, she said. \"Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her U.N. honorary ambassadorship,\" Simmons said.

Schmitt-Matze told NBC affiliate WBIR in an emotional interview Monday how he answered the call to grant one child's final wish to see Saint Nick before he died. \"When I got there, it was my job to make sure he got Christmas,\" Schmitt-Matzen told WBIR through tears. Schmitt-Matzen said he had just gotten home from work about a month and a half ago a when a nurse at a local hospital called him and said she had a very sick child who wanted to see Santa. \"He was more concerned about missing Christmas, than dying,\" Schmitt-Matzen told WBIR. When he arrived, Schmitt-Matzen said he asked unnamed boy's family to leave the hospital room if they thought they would get too emotional so that he wouldn't burst into tears himself.

That's when the boy told him he heard he was going to die. \"Well, you're not going to miss Christmas, the elves already had your present, we knew you wanted this for a long time,\" he said he told the boy. Eric Schmitt-Matzen WBIR \"Really?\" the boy asked, according to Schmitt-Matzen. He then gave the boy his gift \"and that put a grin on his face,\" he said. Schmitt-Matzen choked up as he told WBIR that he told the boy \"When you get up those pearly gates, you just tell them you're Santa's number one elf.\" \"I am?\" the boy asked, perking up, according to Schmitt-Matzen. \"You sure are, I'm sure they'll let you right in,\" he said. The boy then gave him a big hug, he said, and \"he just looked at me and said, Santa, can you help me?\" \"And that's when he passed,\" Schmitt-Matzen said. Play ",

    "text": "You could have missed this news \u2014 those leaks about\u00a0 DEFLATEGATE 2.0 may have grabbed your attention\u00a0\u2014 but Rashaan Salaam\u2019s brother told USA TODAY Sports that the former college and NFL running back committed suicide after experiencing memory loss and depression. These are tell-tale signs of CTE, the degenerative brain disease linked to concussions and the sort of repetitive blows to the head that football players take. There is no plan to study Salaam\u2019s brain \u2014 his Muslim faith prevents \u201cdesecration\u201d of the body \u2014 but that\u2019s probably beside the point. CTE has been found primarily in players whose families suspected it was present; it\u2019s a self-selecting group. It was present in the brains of other players who committed suicide: Junior Seau, Andre Waters, Dave Duerson. (AP Photo/Winslow Townson, File) We know this much. What we don\u2019t know is why those players were affected, while others were not. And we don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to figure out, ahead of time, which athletes might be more susceptible. We also don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a drug out there \u2014 perhaps marijuana \u2014 that could help prevent the spread of CTE or mitigate its symptoms. Getting to those answers has proven difficult. The NFL was slow to even acknowledge a link between CTE and football; NFL executive Jeff Miller did so in March of this year, nearly a decade and a half after Dr. Bennett Omalu examined former Steeler Mike Webster\u2019s brain and found extensive damage unlike anything he\u2019d seen before. The NFL, to its credit, has spent or donated more than $100 million\u00a0to research concussions and CTE. A portion of that that money has been spent on making football safer, which seems, ultimately, like an impossible task. Certainly the NFL\u2019s various rule changes have caused players to target the head far less frequently, but big hits are still the much-celebrated norm. This disgusting hit on\u00a0Darren Sproles was a penalty, but only because Deshazor Everett\u00a0interfered with Sproles\u2019 ability to catch the ball. Deshazor Everett hits a defenseless Darren Sproles pic.twitter.com/uvX1XQJXB5 \u2014 The Cauldron (ICYMI) (@CauldronICYMI) December 11, 2016 Consider your brain: it is about three pounds of soft tissue, floating inside your skull. Think about taking the sort of hit you see literally hundreds of times on any given Sunday \u2014 the ones a notch or two or three less violent than the one above. The collisions between linemen, causing subconcussive damage. A safety timing his hit perfectly and making it legally, without targeting the head, causing a wide receiver to go from running full speed in one direction to going the other way in a fraction of a second. On hits like those the brain is going to move. Making football safer would take drastic changes to the way the game is played. Equipment innovations may help, but as long as football is tackle football, brains are going to rattle. The NFL did pledge $40 million this fall\u00a0for, according to spokesman Brian McCarthy, \u201cmedical research over the next five years, primarily dedicated to neuroscience. The NFL is assembling a Scientific Advisory Board comprising leading independent experts, doctors, scientists and clinicians to develop and lead a clear process to identify and support compelling proposals for scientific research.\u201d (Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports) This is a positive step forward. But as Deadspin revealed last week , the league\u2019s draconian stance on marijuana is already hampering research that could have been valuable in the future: A joint research project between Johns Hopkins and the University of Pennsylvania meant to monitor marijuana usage by NFL players was thwarted when the players union advised its members that their information \u2014 researchers pledged to protect the players\u2019 anonymity \u2014 could be made public if the confidentiality of the work was for some reason challenged in court. So the players \u2014 aware that the NFL\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement still bans all usage of marijuana, despite it being legal in some form in 29 states and the District of Columbia \u00a0 \u2014 backed out. Earlier this year, Tennessee Titans player Derrick Morgan told me he was advocating for the NFL and the NFLPA to study the effect of cannabis on the human brain after his own research led him to believe it could have a protective and regenerative effect on the brain. Clinical trials appear to have showed evidence of as much, but more study is needed. And that, as much as anything, was the point of the Hopkins-Penn study: to plot the course for further clinical study. Now that work has been delayed. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) The NFLPA did announce last month that it would look into marijuana as a method for pain relief, but all of this progress is coming at a glacial pace and is too tied up in the politics of a league so concerned with its public image that it won\u2019t let players wear decorated\u00a0cleats but one time a year. Science is slow, as a rule, and requires careful consideration of hard evidence \u2014 not anecdotes. But on this front a league making well over $10 billion a year at this point owes it to its employees to accelerate the process more so than it already has. Rashaan Salaam is not an anomaly, he is a precursor. Go and look at all the players selected in the same draft as him. Even if only\u00a010 percent are going through what Salaam appears to have gone through because of football, then 25 men from this\u00a0one\u00a0draft class are depressed, anxious, forgetful, apathetic. They\u2019re lost. And as Salaam\u2019s case appears to show, even former NFL players and their families may not be able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to recognize these symptoms for what they are. That must change. A Supreme Court decision\u00a0issued today means the NFL will finally start paying out what could be more than 20,000 players as part of a concussion settlement it reached three years ago after about 5,000 suits were filed by ex-players. Many of them suffer silently. I can\u2019t shake what Morgan said to me earlier this year when we were talking about player suicides: \u201cThat\u2019s the glaring extreme end. You don\u2019t hear as much about the guys suffering from those ailments, but not to such an extreme.\u201d The NFL, for all its popularity, is a league full of anonymous men. Right now too many of them go on to lives that drift off the way Rashaan Salaam\u2019s did:\u00a0weighed down by sadness and confusion. They\u2019re often too late to seek help \u2014 ignoring pain is a virtue in football \u2014 and even if they do they face a disease we still know too little about. Related: ",

The added that they plan to continue their professional life together. \"Like many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage,\" they said. \"During this process, we are committed to our kids and being the best parents we can be. We will continue to work through this process civilly and cooperatively, and plan to continue our professional life together.\" HGTV told FOX411 they are \"currently airing episodes of Flip or Flop and the series will continue production as scheduled.\" According to TMZ , the El Moussas' marriage began to crumble after an incident in May when police responded to \"a call of a possibly suicidal male with a gun\" at the couple's home. TMZ claims witnesses saw Tarek take a gun from his safe and leave his home. Officials caught up with the reality star who told authorities he was not intending to hurt himself but just wanted to \"blow off some steam.\" Police reportedly seized five guns from the El Moussa residence at the time. The couple said in their statement Monday that police were called out of \"an abundance of caution.\" They say there was no violence and no charges were filed. The El Moussas married in 2009 and have two children. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Accused Charleston Church Shooter Dylann Roof Had Handwritten Note Listing Churches By EMILY SHAPIRO Dec 12, 2016, 5:10 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Alleged Charleston Church Shooter's Confession Shown in Court 0 Shares Email Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old accused of killing nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, had a handwritten note in his car with the names of several churches on it, according to testimony today at Roof's ongoing trial. Former South Carolina Law Enforcement Division agent Brittany Burke, who processed Roof's car after the shooting, was on the stand this morning, recounting items found in the car after the then-21-year-old was captured. Besides the note listing churches, notable items in Roof's car included a Confederate flag, a burned American flag, a gun, an empty box of ammunition and a laser attachment for a gun that helps with accuracy. Personal items were also in the car like a GPS, deodorant and cigarettes, Burke said. Charleston Church Shooting Survivor Recounts Watching Her Son Die at Dylann Roof Trial Roof, who is white, is accused of fatally shooting nine black parishioners during a Bible study at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. Roof allegedly entered the Church armed and \"with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,\" according to the federal indictment against him. The parishioners welcomed Roof into their Bible study group, according to the indictment, after which Roof allegedly drew his pistol and opened fire. Roof was captured in North Carolina the day after the shooting. The federal courtroom was packed today on the victims' side. Roof appeared in court wearing a green sweater and grey pants. A prosecution witness, Ronald Thrailkill, who sold the Glock used in the attack to Roof, also testified today. Roof purchased the Glock in April -- two months before the shooting, Thrailkill said. Surveillance video was played in court showing Roof coming into the gun store and looking around. Video also shows Roof coming back to the store to buy the gun three business days later. Roof filled out paperwork, including background information that asked about drugs and mental health, Thrailkill testified. If the perspective buyer answers \"yes\" to any of those questions, the sale is canceled, he said. Any licensed firearm dealer has access to the national instant criminal check (NICS), which can allow, deny or delay a purchase within three business days, he said. Thrailkill testified that he can sell a gun if there's no response from the NICS system after three business days. During cross-examination, Thrailkill testified that when NICS didn't respond to him in three days, he decided to go ahead with the sale to Roof. Thrailkill testified that on June 29, 2015 -- after the church shooting -- he received communication from NICS that the sale was to be denied. Roof, then in custody, had at that point admitted to authorities that he used narcotics. FBI agent Tracy Sicks also testified today about a website believed to belong to Roof that included a manifesto with racist language, according to ABC affiliate WCIV. On Friday, a video interview of Roof conducted by law enforcement was played in court, in which Roof laughed as he admitted to the shooting. He also said he used a Glock 45 to do it, according to the video. \"I didn't say anything to them before I pulled it out, not even one word,\" Roof said of the gun in the video. \"I mean they reacted after I shot them.\" Roof said in the interview he did not expect to survive the shooting because he expected police to respond to the church and shoot him. Once he escaped, he says he spontaneously decided to go to Charlotte, North Carolina, because he didn't want to go home to Columbia. After an agent told him he killed nine people and asked how he felt, Roof responded in a monotone voice, \"It makes me feel bad.\" Testimony on Friday also addressed letters Roof wrote to his parents and a journal he kept with racist entries -- all found in his car after he was apprehended. In a note to his mother, Roof apologized and said he loved her, and he wrote, \"Childish as it sounds I wish I was in your arms.\" In the journal, Roof degrades African Americans and Jews, and a state law enforcement agent on the witness stand read the racist entries aloud. Some jurors leaned on their hands as they read the journal entries on monitors and appeared in shock. Roof wrote that he was not raised in a racist place. He also wrote that after reading a Wikipedia entry about the Trayvon Martin case, it was obvious to him that George Zimmerman, the man who fatally shot Martin, was in the right, and he was never the same again. Roof also wrote that one of his only regrets is that he was never able to fall in love. Chuck Burton/AP Photo Charleston, S.C., shooting suspect Dylann Storm Roof, second from left, is escorted from the Shelby Police Department in Shelby, N.C., June 18, 2015. The 33 federal counts against Roof include hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death. If convicted, Roof faces the death penalty. Roof has pleaded not guilty. He also faces a state trial, set for early next year, in which he may also face the death penalty. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump digs in on Russia, setting up conflict with his own party's Washington leaders Donald Trump Associated Press The president-elect appeared last week before a crowd of supporters in Grand Rapids, Mich. The president-elect appeared last week before a crowd of supporters in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Associated Press) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Donald Trump dug in deeply Monday\u00a0against growing concerns over Russian efforts to influence the presidential election, setting up a conflict with his own party\u2019s leaders even before he is inaugurated. Trump sought to blame Hillary Clinton and the CIA for a renewed\u00a0controversy over the hacking of Democratic\u00a0emails during the\u00a0campaign. The nation\u2019s\u00a0intelligence agencies jointly\u00a0have blamed the hacking\u00a0on Russia, and the CIA separately has reportedly concluded that the Russian effort was done with the specific intention of helping Trump win. Trump persistently has refused to accept\u00a0either of those\u00a0conclusions; this weekend he sharply criticized the CIA and\u00a0termed \u201cridiculous\u201d any thought that Russia had tried\u00a0to aid him. On Monday,\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u00a0defended the CIA. He and other Republicans announced their support for a congressional\u00a0investigation of the foreign government\u2019s actions. As Trump and leading Republican senators head in opposite directions on the issue, concerns over\u00a0Russia seem\u00a0likely to dominate the\u00a0weeks before Trump is inaugurated and could continue\u00a0into the confirmation\u00a0hearings for his senior advisors. That is particularly true if he nominates the current front-runner for secretary of State,  Exxon Mobile Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who has a close relationship with Russian  President Vladimir Putin . The\u00a0tension between the president-elect and GOP senators\u00a0escalated Monday\u00a0after a common Trump tactic: a series of early-morning tweets, this time aimed at the\u00a0CIA analysis, which was first reported over the\u00a0weekend by the Washington Post. \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning. \u201cUnless you catch \u2018hackers\u2019\u00a0in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?\u201d he asked. In fact, Russian involvement in the hacking was brought up before the election, and Trump even talked about the topic during the presidential debates. The nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, in a rare public step, announced on Oct. 7, one month before the election, that Russia was interfering in the election.\u00a0 After Trump\u2019s tweets were published, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said concerns about Russian election interference were an attempt to deny Trump his rightful win by \u201csome people who are bitter that their candidate lost in November.\u201d He lumped the intelligence reports together with Democratic emphasis on\u00a0Clinton\u2019s popular vote victory and Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s attempted recounts in three key states as\u00a0part of an\u00a0effort to \u201cde-legitimize President-elect Trump\u2019s win.\u201d The Russia debate has opened a rift between Trump and his party in Congress in a way that other issues have not.\u00a0During the campaign, Republican leaders gave Trump a wide berth as he upended\u00a0decades of GOP ideology during the campaign \u2014 on trade, spending and entitlements, among other issues. Their strategy\u00a0appeared\u00a0driven by fear of political retaliation by his fervent supporters as well as by\u00a0confidence that, in the sausage-making of federal Washington, more conventional Republicans could substitute their goals for his proposals. The issues upon which they disagreed also were unlikely to become main topics\u00a0early in his presidency, Republican leaders believed, and would not disturb\u00a0a honeymoon period focused on shared objectives. But unlike Trump, whose political alliances are situational and driven in part by his business background, most Washington Republicans rose in a party steeped in fierce opposition to Russia and its communist precursor, the Soviet Union. In little more than a generation, the party has moved\u00a0from President Reagan, who challenged\u00a0Moscow\u2019s\u00a0hold on satellite states, to President-elect Trump, who has talked of weakening\u00a0the military alliance that kept the Soviet Union in check. For Republicans, Monday made for a delicate dance: to push back at Trump\u2019s views on Russia\u00a0without undercutting his\u00a0presidency. Without specifically criticizing the president-elect, McConnell went out of his way to praise\u00a0the CIA, which Trump on Friday had mocked for asserting more than a decade ago that Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. That assessment contributed to the 2003\u00a0Iraq war, during which no such weapons were found. \u201cI have the highest confidence in the intelligence community and especially the Central Intelligence Agency,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cThe CIA is filled with many selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people.\" \u201cThe Russians are not our friends,\u201d McConnell added,\u00a0tersely contradicting Trump\u2019s rosier hopes to work more closely with Moscow. He also differed with Trump\u2019s campaign statements on NATO, calling it\u00a0\u201cone of the most if not the most successful military alliance in world history.\u201d \u201cAnd I think we ought to approach all of these issues on the assumption that the Russians do not wish us well,\u201d McConnell said. A wide range of Republican senators have supported an investigation into Russian interference in the campaign. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who had already signaled his intent to buck any Trump effort to soften relations with Russia, said in a CNN interview that he believes both parties were targeted by the foreign intervention. Republican Party leaders have strenuously\u00a0denied that their computer systems were hacked. If they were, the fact that no GOP files were released\u00a0would suggest Russia\u00a0had decided to avoid disclosures that might embarrass the GOP, and raise suspicions that Moscow has stockpiled Republican files that might be used later in an effort to\u00a0influence Trump. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), in a less forceful written statement Monday, also expressed his support for an investigation. The potential nomination of Tillerson, the Exxon chief, has been ensnarled in the fight over Russian hacking, heightening concerns about a Trump administration tilt toward Russian.\u00a0Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who sits on the committee that will consider the nomination, already has joined McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in indicating discomfort with Tillerson\u2019s friendship with Putin. Democrats heightened their effort Monday to investigate\u00a0Russia\u2019s actions.\u00a0Ten members of the electoral college, led by Christine Pelosi , the daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco,\u00a0demanded an intelligence briefing before their vote on Dec. 19. \u201cTrump\u2019s willingness to disregard conclusions made by the intelligence community and his continuing defense of Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin demand close scrutiny and deliberation from the electoral college,\u201d read the letter, which also mentioned Trump\u2019s public request in a July news conference that Russia seek out Clinton\u2019s emails. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta , whose emails were hacked during the campaign, asked the Senate to publicly release information pertaining to Russia. Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House  Intelligence Committee, also insisted that Congress conduct public hearings into \u201cthe length and breadth of Russian interference in our elections.\u201d The goal, he said, was \u201cdeterring the Russians from further malign cyber action and inoculating the public against such manipulation in the future.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

By Greg Miller and Adam Entous December 12 at 6:55 PM Follow @gregpmiller The CIA assessment that Russia waged a cyber-campaign to help elect Donald Trump is based in part on intelligence suggesting that Moscow\u2019s hacking efforts were disproportionately aimed at targets tied to the Democratic Party and its nominee Hillary Clinton, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials said that both parties were repeatedly targeted as part of a months-long cyber-operation linked to Moscow, but that Democratic institutions and operatives came under a more sustained and determined online assault. U.S. officials said the Republican National Committee\u2019s computer systems were also probed and possibly penetrated by hackers tied to Russian intelligence services, but that it remains unclear how much material \u2014 if any \u2014 was taken from the RNC. The lack of a corresponding Republican trove has contributed to the CIA assessment, reported by The Washington Post, that Russia was seeking to elect Trump and not merely to disrupt last month\u2019s presidential election. The disclosure of that CIA finding has roiled Washington, prompting calls for a broad congressional probe, compounding tensions between the president-elect and U.S. spy agencies, and extending the turmoil of a turbulent campaign. CIA officials told senators it is now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Donald Trump was Russia\u2019s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Clinton officials on Monday joined calls for U.S. intelligence agencies to share their findings with members of the electoral college before they formally cast their votes, a step that would represent an extraordinary departure from a process that is typically an overlooked formality in the U.S. election process. [ FBI and CIA give differing accounts on Russia\u2019s motives in 2016 hacks ] Trump has denounced the CIA conclusion as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Republican operatives have vehemently disputed that their party\u2019s computer systems were hacked or, by implication, that Russia possessed but \u201csat\u201d on a secret trove of emails or other materials that might have undermined the GOP nominee. U.S. intelligence officials said that the Russian government appears to have succeeded in penetrating computer systems associated with both parties, but \u201cprioritized\u201d Democratic institutions in a campaign that culminated with the posting of thousands of sensitive emails on the WikiLeaks website. The CIA briefed the administration that it thinks the Russians \u201cbreached\u201d the RNC systems, according to a senior U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cObviously there haven\u2019t been the same sort of leaks and pilfered documents spread about from this intrusion as there were from the various DNC and related incursions.\u201d Other officials familiar with the CIA\u2019s assessment said there is \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the RNC was targeted but less certainty that the Russians got inside the committee and stole material. The explanation for the lack of damaging Republican leaks remains a source of debate across the U.S. intelligence community, but officials think it may reflect in part an allocation of resources and effort by Russian-backed actors who have been tied to the hacking campaign. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) There are other possible explanations still being explored, with some officials noting that Republican Party computers may simply have been better protected from intrusion. That theory is viewed with skepticism, however, by security officials and experts who describe Russia as a highly capable cyber-adversary, and see it as unlikely that a concerted campaign orchestrated by Moscow would fail to extract material. [ Trump, CIA on collision course over Russia\u2019s role in U.S. election ] \u201cIf the Russians want to get into an unclassified network, one that has young staffers, it\u2019s not going to be that hard,\u201d said a U.S. official who has reviewed intelligence on the intrusions. The official said that the intelligence gathered so far indicates a more \u201csustained effort\u201d was aimed at Democratic targets. The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. U.S. officials emphasized that intelligence agencies are continuing to gather and examine intelligence in an effort to reconstruct the alleged Russian intervention in a U.S. election, and that there are disagreements among agencies over how to interpret what they have assembled so far. The FBI has been more cautious in assessing Russian intentions, and has so far stopped short of endorsing the CIA position that Russia \u201cquite clearly\u201d favored Trump. Some have attributed the competing positions to cultural differences between the bureau, accustomed to courtroom standards of proof, vs. the agency, whose mission is to help policymakers understand global events. A senior FBI counterintelligence official was equivocal during a briefing with congressional officials last week \u2014 confirming that Republican systems had been targeted and acknowledging the apparent imbalance in damage done to Democrats, but refraining from assigning a pro-Trump motive to the Kremlin. The RNC has vigorously disputed reports that its systems were hacked, let alone that Russia made off with a trove of material that it protected as part of an effort to elevate Trump\u2019s election chances. \u201cThe RNC was not \u2018hacked,\u2019\u00a0\u201d GOP spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday evening in response to a New York Times report. He said the report was \u201cexhibit #1 in the fake news.\u201d U.S. officials said the competing claims may reflect disagreement over terminology. \u201cThere is no definition of \u2018hack,\u2019\u00a0\u201d a U.S. official said. \u201cIf you\u2019re probed are you hacked? If a low level staffer is breached are you hacked? Or do you have to get a massive release of documents?\u201d The DNC \u201cwas hacked by the common understanding of the word \u2014 the data was exfilled,\u201d the official said, referring to the exfiltration of files. \u201cWhether the data in the RNC was exfilled, maybe not. But if not, why not?\u201d Republicans contributed to the confusion surrounding the issue with contradictory statements before the election. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex,) the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in September during a CNN interview that Russian operatives had \u201cnot only hacked into the DNC but also into the RNC.\u201d He subsequently said that he had misspoken, and that the targets had been \u201cRepublican political operatives.\u201d The material turned over to WikiLeaks included not just emails stolen from the DNC, but a separate trove taken from top Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta. U.S. intelligence officials said the CIA has identified the \u201cactors\u201d who took possession of those stolen files and delivered them to WikiLeaks. The individuals are known for their affiliations to Russian intelligence services, but \u201cone step\u201d removed from the Russian government. A senior administration official said that the CIA did not have \u201chigh confidence\u201d about Russia\u2019s motives until after the election, and that White House officials had engaged in numerous deliberations about how much to disclose before Election Day. \u201cThere was an honest and ethical determination among the senior leadership not to undermine the election,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe political sensitivity was extremely important to take into account.\u201d After failing to get bipartisan backing from senior members of Congress for a joint statement condemning Russian interference, the White House released language from National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson accusing Russia of interfering in the election. Last week, President Obama ordered all U.S. spy agencies to cooperate on a fuller investigation and to deliver a consensus report on Russian interference before Trump is inaugurated.

(Nov. 29) AP Women participate in a self-dense class at the Muslim Community Network in New York on Dec. 3, 2016. (Photo: Religion News Service) 44 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE Melissa Grajek was subjected to all kinds of taunts for wearing the hijab, but an incident at\u00a0\u00a0Discovery Lake in San Marcos, Calif., sealed the deal. Her 1-year-old son was playing with another boy when an irate father saw her and whisked his son away, telling Grajek: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until Trump is president because he\u2019ll send you back to where you came from.\u201d The man then scooped up a handful of wood chips and threw them at Grajek\u2019s son. At that moment, Grajek thought, enough was enough. She decided to take off her head covering. \u201cI had been on the fence regarding hijab, but that incident made it clear my religious choices could be putting my son at risk,\u201d she said. Grajek\u2019s decision to doff the hijab follows reports of assaults against Muslim women. Last week, Ilhan Omar, a\u00a0newly elected Minneapolis state representative, was leaving the White House, where she discussed\u00a0policy initiatives, when a cab driver\u00a0threatened to yank her hijab while shouting expletives and calling her \u201cISIS.\u201d A day earlier, a man pushed a New York City transit worker down a staircase at\u00a0Grand Central Terminal, yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist, go back to your own country!\u201d And two weeks ago in Brooklyn, another man threatened an off-duty police officer with his pit bull, telling her and her son to \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d All three women were wearing hijabs. Assaults or intimidation of Muslims had been steadily rising well before the election, but they became more common during the divisive campaign of President-elect Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and proposed a registry for U.S. Muslims. A Pew Research Center analysis of\u00a0 hate crimes statistics from the FBI shows that the number of physical assaults against Muslims reached 9/11-era levels last year. The number of anti-Muslim intimidation crimes \u2014 defined as threatening bodily harm \u2014 also rose. Now some imams across the country are saying it\u2019s OK to take\u00a0the hijab off, at least temporarily. Imam Abdullah Antepli recently asked a group of women at the Islamic Association of Raleigh (N.C.) how many of them felt unsafe in public. Dozens of hands shot up. He then told them the extraordinary circumstances under which Muslim Americans now live may require extraordinary measures \u2014 including taking off\u00a0the hijab, at least for a while. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be alarmist,\u201d said Antepli, the chief representative of Muslim affairs at Duke University. \u201cBut the nation is being sucked into a combustible mix. We have to think unconventionally.\u201d Antepli\u2019s call to remove the hijab, which he repeated at a mosque in Cary and in home gatherings of Muslims in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, is rare but not unheard of. In Texas, Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and resident scholar\u00a0at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, said women\u2019s fears should be taken seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s important to give our women support and validate the fear they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Suleiman said.\u00a0 \u201cFear isn\u2019t quantifiable; it\u2019s to the person\u2019s own experience.\u201d While Suleiman doesn\u2019t foresee a blanket call to abandon the head scarf, he advises women to consider practical measures, such as wearing a hoodie instead of a hijab if they feel like they may be in danger. For many Muslim women, the head covering is a quintessential mark of their identity\u00a0\u2014\u00a0much as the kippah or yarmulke is a customary requirement for Orthodox and some Conservative Jewish men. While often understood as a symbol of modesty and\u00a0privacy, the hijab is much more for those Muslim women who choose to wear it. They view it alternately as a sign of religious devotion, discipline, freedom from Western expectations\u00a0or simply a way to be in a continuous state of prayer. Many Muslim women would never think of giving it up, even if it means being targeted. \u201cThis is a difficult time,\u201d acknowledged Khalilah Sabra, a Raleigh Muslim activist who works for the Muslim American Society\u2019s Immigrant Justice Center. Just last month, a man spit in her face as she descended the stairs of the Garfield, N.J., Municipal Court, where she was testifying in a domestic violence dispute.\u00a0 \u201cI had to pause and decide do I fight or let it go?\u201d Sabra decided to buck up and carry on. \u201cWe have to stand up for our religious rights and encourage women to stand their ground,\u201d she said. Others, however, are taking security measures. On Nov. 9, when New York\u2019s Muslim Community Network posted a notice on Facebook about a self-defense workshop, leaders expected 50 or 60 women would respond. Within hours, 2,700 women had signed up. Some\u00a0Muslim women are buying pepper spray, taking firearms training or applying for concealed carry permits. And quietly, some Muslim women are uncovering their hair. \u201cOne of the reasons women are encouraged to dress modestly is for their protection,\u201d said Engy Abdelkader, senior fellow and adjunct professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Walsh School of Foreign Service. \u201cOnce that purpose is no longer served there\u2019s an argument that it becomes a matter of necessity to remove it.\u201d 44 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 32 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hxibhO ",

USA TODAY Prince Harry recently took the unusual step of confirming his relationship with American actress Meghan Markle in an attempt to get the press to back off her. (Photo: AP/Getty Images) Meghan Markle is using the\u00a0spotlight to reveal\u00a0what\u00a0it's like to be biracial in Hollywood. The 35-year-old American actress, who has become a paparazzi target since it was revealed that she's dating Prince Harry, penned an essay for Elle U.K . acknowledging\u00a0she was initially \"scared\" to talk about her mixed-race heritage in public. Markle's dad is white; her mom is black. The two\u00a0met in showbiz: her father\u00a0was a lighting director for a soap opera and her mother,\u00a0now a social worker, was a temp at the television studio. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle escape paparazzi cameras again Growing up in the predominantly white suburbs of Los Angeles, Markle's mother was \"caramel in complexion with her light-skinned baby in tow, being asked where my mother was since they assumed she was the nanny,\" says the actress. Fast forward to Markle's college years at Northwestern University. \"I was home in LA on a college break when my mom was called the 'N' word. We were leaving a concert and she wasn't pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver,\" she writes. In\u00a0Hollywood, Markle envisioned a new start. \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous,'\u00a0as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role,\" she says.\u00a0\"Morphing from Latina when I was dressed in red, to African American when in mustard yellow; my closet filled with fashionable frocks to make me look as racially varied as an Eighties Benetton poster. Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\" Prince William backs Prince Harry's call for Meghan Markle's privacy Then Suits came along, \"the Goldilocks of my acting career \u2013 where finally I was just right,\" says Markle, who plays the whip-smart legal mind Rachel Zane on the USA series. Though Markle does not address her relationship with Harry\u00a0in the essay, the Toronto-based actress details racist trolls she's been forced to block on Twitter as a result of her role on Suits. She became a target anew thanks to her high-profile royal romance. In late November, Prince Harry released a highly unusual statement both confirming his relationship with Markle and defending her from ugly attacks. Tabloid snaps show Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle in London \u201cHis girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public \u2014 the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social-media trolls and web-article comments,\u201d reads a statement released by the palace. It continued: \u201cPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle\u2019s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game.\u2019 He strongly disagrees. This is not a game \u2014 it is her life and his.\u201d Prince William swiftly put out a supportive statement of his own. Markle writes\u00a0that she has decided to carve her own path. \"You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom,\" she says. 115 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hxk7a8 ",

    "text": "By James Hohmann December 12 at 9:46 AM Follow @JamesHohmann ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson speaks at the World Gas Conference in Paris. (Eric Piermonteric/AFP/Getty Images) THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0If just three Senate Republicans defect, Rex Tillerson\u2019s expected nomination as secretary of state would be dead. Since he has not officially announced his selection, blowback from leading hawks on the right over the ExxonMobil CEO\u2019s ties to Vladimir Putin could prompt Donald Trump to go another direction. -- Three Republicans who have themselves run for president fired shots across the bow on Sunday: Marco Rubio: \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State.\u201d Lindsey Graham: \u201cI don\u2019t know the man much at all, but let\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, \u2018the order of friendship,\u2019 then we\u2019re gonna have to do some talkin\u2019. We\u2019ll have some questions. I don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy, but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d John McCain: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\u201d -- A longtime confidant to the Arizona senator added this on Twitter: Tillerson would sell out NATO for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad. Should be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor. https://t.co/cZmA3swddK \u2014 Mark Salter (@MarkSalter55) December 9, 2016 -- From one of our congressional reporters who spent the weekend working the phones: That sound I'm hearing right now is balloon deflating for Tillerson. This is gonna be a tough vote for many Senate Rs. \u2014 Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) December 12, 2016 -- Terrible timing for Tillerson: NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell scooped Saturday that the 64-year-old had won \u201cThe Apprentice: Foggy Bottom edition,\u201d just hours after The Post revealed that the CIA had concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency , rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. Three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday afternoon to The Post that Trump is expected to name Tillerson. Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson attend a ceremony together to celebrate a joint development deal. (Mikhail Klimetev/EPA) -- In case you missed it, here is some background on his ties to Putin and his cronies: \u201cIn the 1990s, Tillerson oversaw an Exxon project on Russia\u2019s Sakhalin island and developed a working relationship with Putin. In 2011, Exxon signed an agreement with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to work jointly on oil exploration and development in the Arctic and Siberia. After inking the deal in New York, Tillerson and Rosneft chairman and Putin confidant Igor Sechin dined on caviar at the luxury Manhattan restaurant Per Se,\u201d Steven Mufson and Philip Rucker report . \u201cThe next day, they gave oil analysts black pens with the date of the agreement engraved in gold. Two years later, the Kremlin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, an honor reserved for foreigners.\u201d -- This confirmation fight would become the proxy for a broader debate about Russian interference in the American election. That is a debate Trump does not want to have. -- Reinforcing this, Trump even cited Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Putin as an asset. \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia,\u201d the president-elect said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d adding that Rex is \u201ca world-class player.\u201d In the same interview, he argued that the CIA\u2019s conclusion is \u201cridiculous\u201d and he does not \u201cbelieve it at all.\u201d -- But Trump, during that Fox interview and then on Twitter, spoke as if Tillerson is not a done deal, giving himself an out and easy way to save face: Whether I choose him or not for \"State\"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2016 -- Similarly, no Senate Republican has come out as a hard \u201cno\u201d yet. Even McCain is leaving himself some wiggle room to capitulate. -- Right now Trump is testing congressional Republicans to see if they are really as big of push overs as he kept telling voters throughout the primaries. That\u2019s plainly what he was doing with his talk about tariffs last week, gauging the response carefully. He will keep pushing the boundaries further and further until conservatives get the backbone to oppose him. If the GOP ultimately falls in line on Tillerson, Trump\u2019s takeaway will be that he doesn\u2019t need to worry about being constrained by his adopted party. This is how he thinks about the world. -- Republicans are testing Trump too. Does he back off at the first sign of pressure or double down? Marco Rubio and John McCain arrive for a meeting last month. (Andrew Harnik/AP) -- Rubio\u2019s skeptical tweet is especially significant because he is one of 10 GOP members on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must clear Tillerson before he can get an up-or-down vote on the floor. Republicans only have one more member on that committee than the Democrats, so Rubio could singlehandedly torpedo Tillerson if he chose to. A \u201cno\u201d vote would be a good way for Rubio, who wants to run again for president in 2024, to show movement conservatives that he\u2019s still principled. He constantly promised to be a check on Trump as he sought reelection in Florida this year. Recall that, back in October, the senator also warned Republicans not to talk about John Podesta\u2019s hacked emails. \"I will not discuss any issue that has become public solely on the basis of Wikileaks,\" Rubio said at the time . \"As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process and I will not indulge it. I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks. Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.\u201d -- Rand Paul is also on Foreign Relations, and Tillerson is the kind of globalist that libertarians are so uncomfortable with. -- Jeff Flake, another member of the committee, is up for reelection in 2018 in Arizona. If McCain broke against Tillerson, it is hard to see him not following suit. -- What about the other seven Republicans on the committee? Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, who was himself a finalist to be secretary of state, responded favorably: If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very impressive individual. \u2014 Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) December 11, 2016 The rest are party loyalists with safe seats who can pretty reliably be counted on to do whatever they are told by Mitch McConnell: Wyoming\u2019s John Barrasso (who is number four in party leadership), Idaho\u2019s James Risch, Georgia\u2019s Johnny Isakson and David Perdue and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson (who just got reelected). Similarly, Cory Gardner will be reluctant to upset the energy industry, not just because he\u2019s from Colorado but because as NRSC chairman he\u2019ll need to aggressively hit up oil executives for money the next two years. -- In the full Senate, also watch someone like Susan Collins, who could use a no vote to bolster her independent credentials if she runs for governor of Maine in 2018. -- Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, is not heeding calls to recuse himself from voting for his potential cabinet colleagues, as would be customary, because the margin of error is so small. -- Democratic leadership aides feel pretty good about keeping their members in line. They\u2019re always going to have to worry about someone like Joe Manchin caving, especially now that he\u2019s in cycle (he\u2019s meeting with Trump in New York today), but the liberal base badly wants at least one scalp for cathartic reasons. Jim Mattis was theoretically the best Trump pick to target because of his need for a waiver to become Defense secretary, but a lot of Democrats respect him and think he\u2019s independent enough to stand up to Trump. He\u2019s also publicly against torture, which works bigly in his favor as he tries to avoid a confirmation battle. Bob Menendez\u00a0is introduced at a news conference after the death of Cuba's Fidel Castro. (Julio Cortez/AP) -- The Dems on Foreign Relations are coalescing in opposition to Tillerson. Ben Cardin, the ranking member, said on CNN that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d about his \u201crelationship with Russia\u201d and wants to make sure the nation\u2019s chief diplomat puts U.S. interests first. Bob Menendez went much further, called Tillerson\u2019s nomination \u201calarming and absurd\u201d in a much harsher statement. \u201cWith Rex Tillerson as our Secretary of State, the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President\u2019s Cabinet guiding our nation\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cThe term \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the web of dubious business interests and bank accounts that Tillerson and his company Exxon shares with Vladimir Putin and Russian oil companies. Having no practical experience in diplomacy, Mr. Tillerson has no proven knowledge or regard for the norms and necessities that so much of our modern diplomatic and security efforts depend upon.\u201d -- As a consequence of Harry Reid\u2019s short-sighted decision to invoke the nuclear option in 2014, Tillerson only needs 50 votes, instead of 60, to take over Foggy Bottom. The GOP has 52 seats, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence would provide the tie-breaking vote. -- But even if he ultimately made it through, Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearings at the very least would be brutal. All of Exxon\u2019s deals would come under the microscope, especially the ones that have been adversely affected by the U.S. sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its illegal invasion of Crimea. Exxon claims these sanctions cost it $1 billion a year. \u201cExxon discovered oil in a well it drilled in the Kara Sea, but the joint partnership was put on ice after Russian intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea led to international economic sanctions,\u201d Mufson and Rucker note . \u201cAs secretary of state, Tillerson, who has been critical of the sanctions, would be in a position to argue for easing them, which could allow Exxon to resume operations. And for a company the size of Exxon, few countries outside of Russia hold sufficient potential to bolster the oil giant\u2019s reserves. In addition to the Arctic, Exxon wants to drill in the deep waters of the Black Sea and search for shale oil in West Siberia. In each case, the company would be providing expertise and technology that Russia lacks. \u2018Russia is critical for Exxon,\u2019 said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co.\u201d -- Tillerson\u2019s personal stake in Exxon is more than $150 million. Because much of this is via stock options that do not mature for a while, he cannot easily divest or put everything in a blind trust. How will he not think of his company\u2019s interests in 50 countries and on six continents as he negotiates on behalf of the U.S.? -- The bigger issue, though, would be questions about where Tillerson\u2019s true loyalties lie. The CEO is a major character in Steve Coll\u2019s excellent 2012 book on Exxon, \u201cPrivate Empire.\u201d Coll, the dean of the Columbia Journalism School, describes Tillerson\u2019s selection as \u201castonishing on many levels\u201d in a new piece for the New Yorker . \u201cAs an exercise of public diplomacy, it will certainly confirm the assumption of many people around the world that American power is best understood as a raw, neocolonial exercise in securing resources,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is hard to imagine, after four decades at ExxonMobil and a decade leading the corporation, how Tillerson will suddenly develop respect and affection for the American diplomatic service he will now lead, or embrace a vision of America\u2019s place in the world that promotes ideals for their own sake, emphatically privileging national interests over private ones.\u201d The main theme of Steve\u2019s book is that ExxonMobil sees itself as an independent, transnational corporate sovereign, with power independent of the American government, and devoted firmly to shareholder interests. \u201cExxon\u2019s foreign policy sometimes had more impact on the countries where it operated than did the State Department,\u201d he explains. \u201cTake, for example, Chad, one of the poorest countries in Africa. During the mid-two-thousands, the entirety of U.S. aid and military spending in the country directed through the U.S. Embassy in the capital, N\u2019Djamena, amounted to less than twenty million dollars annually, whereas the royalty payments Exxon made to the government as part of an oil-production agreement were north of five hundred million dollars. Idriss D\u00e9by, the authoritarian President of Chad, did not need a calculator to understand that Rex Tillerson was more important to his future than the U.S. Secretary of State.\u201d \u201cIn Kurdistan, during the Obama Administration, Tillerson defied State Department policy and cut an independent oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government, undermining the national Iraqi government in Baghdad. ExxonMobil did not ask permission. After the fact, Tillerson arranged a conference call with State Department officials and explained his actions, according to my sources, by saying, \u2018I had to do what was best for my shareholders.\u2019\u201d Because oil projects require huge amounts of capital and only pay off fully over decades, Tillerson has favored doing business in countries that offer political stability, even if this stability was achieved through authoritarian rule: \u201cThe right kinds of dictators can be more predictable and profitable than democracies. ExxonMobil has had more luck making money in Equatorial Guinea, a small, oil-rich West African dictatorship that has been ruled for decades by a single family, than in Alaska, where raucous electoral politics has made it hard for Exxon to nail down stable deal terms.\u201d \u201cAlthough ExxonMobil hires former State Department, Pentagon, and C.I.A. officials from time to time in order to bolster its political analysis and negotiations, some of the Exxon executives I interviewed spoke about Washington with disdain, if not contempt,\u201d Coll writes. \u201cThey regarded the State Department as generally unhelpful, a bureaucracy of liberal career diplomats who were biased against oil and incompetent when it came to sensitive and complex oil-deal negotiations. They managed Congress defensively, and as just one capital among many in the world, a place more likely to produce trouble for Exxon than benefits.\u201d ( Read the full piece here. ) As a political scientist at Columbia puts it: Tillerman is impressive businessman, but would Exxon shareholders hire a CEO without industry experience? Y wld voters do the same at State? \u2014 Timothy Frye (@timothymfrye) December 11, 2016 -- The New York Times says Trump is attracted to him because he is very aggressive: \u201cTwenty years ago, as [Tillerson] was rising through the ranks at Exxon, he was charged with negotiating with the government of Yemen to build a natural gas export plant. The talks got bogged down over Yemen\u2019s insistence that it have veto power over important business decisions. Mr. Tillerson, at one point, flew into a rage, throwing a five-inch-thick book across the room and storming out, perhaps for dramatic effect. Yemeni negotiators and other representatives of other oil companies partnering with Exxon in the international consortium looked on in bewilderment. In the end, Yemen got at least some of its demands.\u201d -- Recommended holiday reading: One of my favorite novels is Allen Drury\u2019s \u201cAdvise and Consent,\u201d which is about the confirmation fight for a controversial secretary of state nominee. Ironically, the president\u2019s nominee in that 1959 book is soft on Russia and would rather accommodate than confront Moscow. The movie is pretty good, too, but not as good as the book.

Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs and Jennifer Dlouhy report : \u201cTwo Democratic senators from energy-producing states -- Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- are also in the mix, along with Ray Washburne, a Dallas investor and former chairman of the RNC. If Trump picks any of the four he\u2019ll break with recent tradition of putting scientists at the top of the Energy Department.\" -- Chris Christie reportedly declined several offers to serve in Trump\u2019s administration. The Star Ledger's Matt Arco reports that the New Jersey governor turned down \u201ccabinet-level posts\u201d such as Homeland Security secretary and VA secretary, as well as positions such as a White House advisory role or even U.S. ambassador to Italy. Christie was not offered the role of attorney general that he was vying for, per Matt. (It's very possible that the Christie and Trump people are just saying this to save face and that it's not true.) Omarosa Manigault attends the MGM National Harbor Grand Opening Gala last week in National Harbor. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for MGM National Harbor) -- Reality TV star Omarosa Manigault is playing a significant role in Trump\u2019s transition, and some say she may get a White House role similar to the one now held by Valerie Jarrett (!). From Abby Phillip and Lisa Rein : \u201cManigault has emerged as Trump\u2019s emissary to a broad array of interest groups inside and outside Washington on issues of diversity, political outreach and hiring for his nascent administration. \u2026 Last weekend, she flew to Atlanta to address an annual meeting of presidents of the country\u2019s historically black colleges. At the events, she signaled her growing role in Trump\u2019s transition as a senior adviser leading the Office of Nationwide Engagement. She is said to have an open line of communication with the president-elect, with whom she developed a close relationship after becoming the breakout star of the first season of \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\" Manigault\u2019s presence in transition meetings has raised eyebrows:\u00a0\u201cSome advocates who attended a recent meeting with veterans groups said privately that they were surprised to see her there, given that she does not have expertise in veterans health care, benefits or the complexities of the sprawling Veterans Affairs agency.\u201d Her last stint in D.C. was a disaster: In the 1990s, Manigault worked in a series of jobs in the Clinton administration in the White House and briefly in the Commerce Department. \u201cShe was asked to leave as quickly as possible, she was so disruptive,\u201d Cheryl Shavers, the former undersecretary for technology at the Commerce Department, said of Manigault in a 2004 People magazine story. \u201cOne woman wanted to slug her.\u201d K. T. McFarland, President-elect Trump's choice for deputy national security advisor, walks in the lobby at Trump Tower last week. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) -- Out of her depth? There are deep fears in the foreign policy establishment that the soon-to-be Deputy National Security Adviser, K.T. McFarland, is more theatrical than substantive. From Politico\u2019s Michael Crowley : \u201cAt a political rally in June 2009, K.T. McFarland offered a jarring prediction. China might cancel the Fourth of July, she said. \u2018They\u2019re going to want something for their money. They\u2019re not our sugar daddy,\u2019 McFarland [said], referring to America\u2019s more than $1 trillion in debt to Beijing. Unless voters \u2018throw the bums out\u2019 McFarland said, \u2018we can all start learning Chinese.\u2019 She then read aloud Mandarin phrases from an index card. \u2026 McFarland\u2019s theatrical performance might have been lighthearted, but its breezy and simplistic tone underscores why national security experts in both parties worry she is unqualified for what national security veterans say is among the hardest\u2014and most important\u2014jobs at the White House. McFarland, 65, last worked in government three decades ago.\u201d -- Trump White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, a former FEC member, has always been an \u201ciconoclast bent on shaking things up,\u201d the\u00a0 New York Times\u2019 Eric Lichtblau writes in a profile:\u00a0\u201cStill, it was an audacious move even for Mr. McGahn when he signed on in early 2015 as the lawyer for Mr. Trump\u2019s long-shot presidential bid. At the time, few other Washington insiders would get behind Mr. Trump, and some were skeptical of Mr. McGahn\u2019s decision, even openly scornful. Now, Mr. McGahn stands to become one of the most powerful, if least known, figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle. The Atlantic City-born lawyer, a guitarist in a rock band who has a personality to match Mr. Trump\u2019s, will be the legal arbiter for the enormously complicated thicket of ethical issues awaiting a president-elect who has built a vast business empire. One key question, however, is how strongly he will push back if Mr. Trump, a man who has defied many norms, seeks to cross into murky legal terrain. If his record is any guide, Mr. McGahn will be a fierce proponent of the president\u2019s executive authority to operate independently on a wide range of issues.\u201d TWO TAKES\u00a0ON TRUMP'S PROCESS: -- The simple truth is that Trump\u2019s transition process has been a logical continuation of the campaign he ran: a total disregard for the established methods and the rules governing those methods,\u201d says The Fix\u2019s Chris Cilizza . Now, he says, a major question remains: \u201cIs Trump\u2019s ability to innovate in the political campaign space \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what he has done, whether you like it or not \u2014 something that can carry over to his time in the White House? Do voters want something different in a president than they want in a presidential candidate? If so, Trump\u2019s unwillingness to change could badly damage his presidency.\u201d -- \u201cTo Trump, all the world is baubles, and he reaches reflexively for the shiniest one,\u201d writes\u00a0 New York Times columnist Frank Bruni . \u201cHe surely sits back and grins as he watches aspirants vie for his favor. Before Trump, the way to land a top spot under a new president was to be discreet, but discreet does nothing to fortify his ego. He wants the whole world to see how many important people hanker to work for him. So they show the world, posing for pictures with him and fanning out on TV to proclaim their ardor and aptitude. Decades from now we\u2019ll still be talking about Trump\u2019s version [of Cabinet-vetting], which presented a crystalline window into the man himself, revealing the titanic whole of his tortured psyche: the bloated ego, the boundless need, the capriciousness, the obsession with appearances. It was a fitting coda to his campaign and, I fear, a harbinger of his presidency.\u201d CONGRESS: -- \u201c New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions,\u201d by Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell: \u201cRepublicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before [Trump] is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law\u2019s insurance would go away. Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible \u2026 But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast.\"\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,\u201d said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Santa Claus visits a slum in Caracas. (Reuters/Ueslei Marcelino) WAPO HIGHLIGHTS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE: -- \u201c How \u2018food apartheid\u2019 is punishing some Venezuelans ,\u201d by Mariana Zu\u00f1iga: \u201cWith food riots breaking out and supermarket shelves woefully bare, the government of embattled President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro launched a new food distribution system in April promising to deliver subsidized groceries to every household in need. Maduro called the new system \u2018CLAPs\u2019 (Local Committees of Supply and Production). The name might be fitting, because those who don\u2019t applaud his government haven\u2019t been getting anything to eat. Maduro told Venezuelans that the CLAP system would alleviate chronic scarcities and the \u2018economic war\u2019 against his government he says is being waged by opposition leaders, business owners and the street-level black market vendors \u2026. Instead, critics say the system has devolved into a kind of \u2018food apartheid\u2019 meant to punish those who oppose Maduro.\u201d -- \u201c An unexpected result of Yemen\u2019s war: More men are cooking and cleaning ,\u201d by Sudarsan Raghavan: \u201cThe women in this village never earned money, never left home without the permission of their husbands. It had been that way for as long as anyone could remember. Then the war arrived. Now before dawn each day, mothers and daughters walk to the mountainous scrub to gather wood, which they turn into charcoal and sell. The men stay home and care for the children, and sometimes do the cooking and the cleaning. Yemen has consistently ranked among the worst countries for women and girls, and the war has only made life harder. But in pockets of the Middle East\u2019s poorest country, an unexpected social recalibration appears to be underway \u2026 As the war destroys jobs and countless men join the fight, a growing number of women are providing income for their families. Often, they are working in areas that had been considered the purview of men or culturally unacceptable for women in Yemen\u2019s ultraconservative tribal society. Some are now butchers, bar \u00a0\u201cI feel the war has changed my personality,\u201d said Ayde Ahmed Shabon, 33, her voice soft but clear. \u201cI feel equal to the man now.\u201d Chris Arnade, a former Wall Street bond trader, has been traveling around the U.S. for years photographing poor and working class Americans. He saw Trump's victory coming. (Photo courtesy of Chris Arnade) -- \u201c Chris Arnade photographs the \u2018back-row kids.\u2019 He knew they could elect Trump ,\u201d by Margaret Sullivan: \u201cThe best way to get photographer Chris Arnade to go somewhere is to warn him not to. Hunts Point in the Bronx is dangerous; stay away, friends said, when Arnade began walking all over New York City with his camera. That was when Arnade, now 51, was still a Wall Street bond trader, years before he would find himself documenting what he thinks of as [Trump\u2019s] America: the poor or working-class people left behind by the economic recovery. Back in May, when many were still pooh-poohing Trump\u2019s chances, Arnade wrote a notable series of tweets: If Trump didn\u2019t win this time around, it would only be because he was such a deeply flawed candidate; but some Trumplike figure soon would capitalize on people\u2019s anger and disenfranchisement. [Clinton], he said, \u2018represented the front row\u2019 \u2014 the smartest students in class, destined to enjoy the money and status that came with silver-spoon success. For what Arnade calls the \u2018back-row kids,\u2019 the frustration, anger and, yes, humiliation had become overwhelming. Arnade has little confidence that Trump will actually address the economic and cultural inequality that helped to power his appeal. But Arnade saw the emotions up close: \u2018You have to put people\u2019s decisions in context \u2014 how distant they are from the money.\u2019\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Ann Telnaes re-imagines the Time cover. \"The president-elect\u2019s use of red meat and political dog whistles earned him this distinction,\" she writes: Trump\u2019s tax simplification couldn\u2019t be simpler to understand, adds cartoonist Tom Toles: Graham and McCain joined Democrats in calling for a bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking: Don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what Russia is up to -- they're trying to undermine democracies all over the world. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2016 Russia is trying to break the backs of democracies \u2013 and democratic movements \u2013 all over the world. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2016 I'm not challenging the outcome of the election, but very concerned about Russian interference/actions at home & throughout the world. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2016 Sen.

One man asking for protection; another man charged with deciding his fate. Asylum systems in countries like Italy are overwhelmed, and some nations are tightening their requirements. Simply being from a poor or war-torn place is generally not enough. For the moment, a hierarchy of human misery prevails: People fleeing well-defined conflicts, like the civil war in Syria, or oppressive states, like Eritrea, have a far higher chance of success, while the fate of many others can hinge on their individual stories. Mr. De Francesco\u2019s job amounts to parsing the misery, picking winners and losers from a pool of applicants who had lost so much already. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have only one person deciding the life of someone else,\u201d [said an Interior Ministry official.] Yet for now, that is close to the reality \u2014 as well as Mr. Francesco\u2019s burden.\u201d -- NBC News, \u201c Fake News: How a Partying Macedonian Teen Earns Thousands Publishing Lies ,\u201d by Alexander Smith: Dimitri points to a picture on his Instagram showing a bar table decked with expensive champagne and sparklers.

Dillon apologized to Hagen at the event for online posts critical of Hagen\u2019s decision to hold the rally in February despite not having security. The New York Times reports that the alleged stabbing took place just before the KKK\u2019s North Carolina \u2018victory parade\u2019 held to celebrate the election of Trump.

If the measure is formally enacted, which seems likely, the punishment for anyone who violates its proscriptions will be over $30,000 in fines and up to two years of jail time. Supporters of the law have attempted to fend off well-deserved criticism by noting that the measure punishes only \u2018misinformation\u2019 about abortion \u2026 But the bill\u2019s language undeniably criminalizes nearly all pro-life speech \u2014 or, at the very least, allows most types of anti-abortion speech to be judicially interpreted as \u2018misinformation\u2019 when viewed from a progressive perspective.\u201d \u00a0 In Trump's world: Trump meets with Carly Fiorina, Joe Manchin, Raul Labrador and Rick Santorum.

(Andrew Harnik/AP) -- \u201c Is the D.C. mayor losing control of her city ?,\u201d by Peter Jamison: \u201cMayor Muriel E. Bowser is struggling to stand up to an aggressively liberal D.C. Council, which in the past six weeks alone has legalized assisted suicide in the nation\u2019s capital and guaranteed new parents two months of paid time off. A moderate Democrat whose roots are in the middle-class African American neighborhoods of Northeast Washington, Bowser increasingly finds herself at odds with a council infused with the leftist tendencies of the District\u2019s millennial newcomers. Heading into her third year in office, the mayor appears to be losing ground, sidelined as lawmakers advance a wish list of progressive policies without her cooperation, and sometimes despite her opposition. The outcome could determine whether the city focuses on the national priorities of the political left \u2014 such as social-welfare programs and business regulation \u2014 or Bowser\u2019s more conventional urban agenda of schools, crime and homelessness \u2026\u201d -- \u201c How a murder convict facing a life sentence became a D.C. mayoral appointee ,\u201d by Justin Wm.

Ferguson is the director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Returning Citizen Affairs, tasked with helping D.C. residents released from prison get back on their feet. Ferguson faces a tough road. In 2015, the D.C. inspector general found the office to be understaffed, underbudgeted and not fulfilling its mission. Ferguson\u2019s personal story, meanwhile, is worthy of a Charles Dickens novel. He was a 20-year-old college student in West Virginia when he was accused in 2002 of fatally shooting a fellow classmate \u2014 a crime he says he didn\u2019t commit.

    "text": "Dec 12 2016, 5:13 pm ET Pipeline Spills 176,000 Gallons of Oil Into Creek 150 Miles From Dakota Access Protests by Tom DiChristopher, CNBC advertisement A pipeline leak has spilled tens of thousands of gallons of crude oil into a North Dakota creek roughly two and a half hours from Cannon Ball, where protesters are camped out in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes, as well as environmentalists from around the country, have fought the pipeline project on the grounds that it crosses beneath a lake that provides drinking water to native Americans. They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. North Dakota officials estimate more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline into the Ash Coulee Creek. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says a landowner discovered the spill on Dec. 5 near the city of Belfield, which is roughly 150 miles from the epicenter of the Dakota Access pipeline protest camps.

It's not yet clear why electronic monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, Owen told the Asssociated Press. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. The pipeline is buried on a hill near Ash Coulee creek, and the \"hillside sloughed,\" which may have ruptured the line, she said. Related: Veteran Finds Forgiveness, Peace in Standing Rock Fight \"That is our number one theory, but nothing is definitive,\" Owen said. \"We have several working theories and the investigation is ongoing.\" Last week, the Army Corp of Engineers said it would deny Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners the easement it needs to complete the final stretch of the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline. United States Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do.

Republican President-elect Donald Trump has voiced support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. About 5,000 people are still occupying land near the planned construction site. Military veterans march in support of the \"water protectors\" at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 5 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Scott Olson / Getty Images The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek. Suess says about 37,000 gallons of oil have been recovered. \"It's going to take some time,\" Suess said of the cleanup. \"Obviously there will be some component of the cleanup that will go toward spring.\" True Cos. has a history of oil field-related spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. True Cos. operates at least three pipeline companies with a combined 1,648 miles of line in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming, according to information the companies submitted to federal regulators. Since 2006, the companies have reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products, most of which was never recovered. Tom DiChristopher, CNBC ",

McConnell's pronouncement puts him at odds with President-elect Donald Trump, who has denounced any suggestion that Russia attempted to steer the outcome of the presidential election . \"I agree with Senator Schumer, Chairman McCain, (Sen.) Burr and others, this simply cannot be a partisan issue,\" McConnell said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. He rejected the idea of an investigation done by a special committee set up specifically for the issue, a move that would elevate the issue to a higher priority and significance. Instead he said the committees with jurisdiction should have oversight. McConnell said the Senate intelligence committee, chaired by Sen. Richard Burr, R- North Carolina, and the Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, should take the lead in looking into foreign breaches.

Trump has said he does not believe Russia was the culprit of the DNC's hacked and released emails, calling it \"ridiculous\" on Fox News Sunday. And on Monday he suggested that it is a conspiracy theory in a tweet. Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 McConnell, who was reportedly briefed on the breach before the November 8 election, refused to discuss his role during those briefings, but joined his fellow senators in condemning any Russian interference and defending U.S. intelligence agencies. \"Obviously any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts,\" he said, adding that he has the \"highest confidence in the intelligence community.\" Related: U.S. Publicly Blames Russia for Hacking McCain said that the purpose of the congressional investigations should be to determine if breaches were done to influence the outcome of the election. \"The question is, of course, what was the intention and that's why we need an investigation,\" McCain said on Fox News Monday. The Armed Services Committee plans to create a new subcommittee to address cyberattacks. While both the DNC and the RNC systems were broken into, only the emails of the DNC were released to the public. Incoming Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said \"we welcome\" McConnell's support of a Senate investigation \"so that we can find out how this happened, and how we can stop it from happening ever again.\" McConnell refused to comment on if the breach impacted Trump's win. And he also refused to comment on Trump's defense of Russia, saying he would only give his own view: \"The Russians are not our friends.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan echoed that sentiment on Monday and underscored that congressional intelligence committee efforts to examine state-sponsored cyberattacks and the impact on the democratic process have his full support. However, he also sounded a note of caution about any partisan attempts to use intelligence gathered on hacks to interfere in the election's outcome. \"Any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests,\" Ryan said Monday in a statement. \"At the same time, exploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes our national security. As we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\" A member of House Democratic leadership, Rep, Linda Sanchez of California, said Monday that Congress should stop funding the GOP-spearheaded investigation into the deadly 2012 attacks by militants on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Sanchez said Congress should redirect that money to investigate the Russian hacks instead, adding in a statement that \"ensuring the legitimacy of our electoral system must be our main concern.\" Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid doubled down on his criticism of FBI Director James Comey on Saturday and accused the agency head of withholding information about Russia's alleged attempts to meddle in the 2016 election. Reid, who is retiring, told MSNBC Comey should be investigated. \"The FBI had this material for a long time but \u2026 Comey, who's of course a Republican, refused to divulge this information,\" Reid told MSNBC. \"\u2026 He has let the country down for partisan purposes.\" McConnell also refused to comment on the pending appointment of Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, a candidate who has close ties to Russia through the oil and gas business. McConnell said he hopes all in the new administration \"share my view\" but won't comment on a \"phantom nominee.\" Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

Examining city records, The Times\u2019s Julie Turkewitz learned that Ms. Ng owns a number of properties in Oakland and has been fined in the past for \u201cnuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious\u201d conditions. Several people who have stayed at the Ghost Ship said Ms. Ng had visited the warehouse, which was not permitted for residents. But it was unclear if she knew what was going on inside. \u2022 The master tenants: Derick Ion Almena and his wife, Micah Allison, who ran the Ghost Ship, have also avoided the public eye. Friends, associates and former tenants speaking in the news media have variously depicted the couple as misunderstood or manipulative. In an anguished interview on \u201cToday\u201d last week, Mr. Almena was asked whether he should be held accountable. \u201cShould I be held accountable?\u201d he said. \u201cI can barely stand here right now.\u201d \u2022 The aftermath: Artists dwelling in illegal structures across the Bay Area are worried that inspectors would target them after the fire.

Initially, the family was sued by the federal government in September of 2015 in a complaint case of eminent domain. A few days later the government then filed a motion to take the over the property.\u00a0 Now, Appraisal reports are being exchanged in the discovery phase of the litigation. If the parties cannot reach a sufficient value for the land, the Sheahans are prepared to fight it in a jury trial. The mine hasn\u2019t been in full operation since 1954, but until fall of 2015 family members went out from time to time to blast for minerals.\u00a0 The 400 acres of land sits almost 6,000 feet above sea level with panoramic views of the surrounding Groom Mountain Range and borders the Nevada Test and Training Range, which includes Area 51. According to Sheahan, his family\u2019s land had always been highly sought after by the U.S. Air Force base looking to expand its flight-testing range, \u201cThey told me the land was like a suit hemmed in too tight that needed to breathe, that\u2019s why they want our land\u201c Sheahan said. REAL-LIFE 'X-FILES'? CIA POSTS TROVE OF UFO DOCUMENTS Sheahan told Fox News that Air Force officials started showing up unannounced on the property in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, intimidating his grandparents.\u00a0 He said his family complained to the Air Force, but nothing happened. Then nuclear tests came without warning. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal archives, on Jan. 27, 1951, the Air Force detonated the first above-ground test on land next to the Groom Mine. Sheahan says his family wasn\u2019t told about the test.\u00a0 \u201cThis bomb goes off, who do you call, who do you Google, there\u2019s no one \u2026 those blasts did significant damage to the property, not only in radiation,\u201d he said. Sheahan claims family members and mine workers suffered long-term radiation effects and says some livestock died from beta burns. In the winter of 2014, government officials from the Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force approached the Sheahan family about purchasing the property.\u00a0 At that time, Sheahan and other family members had never had the property appraised but he says the family thought offers of $2.4 million, $5.2 million, and $1.5 million from the Air Force were too low and so they rejected them. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit down with those numbers at the table.\u201d said Sheahan. The Air Force confiscated the property on Sept. 16, 2015 through a federal court ruling in US District Court in Nevada. The family had three outside experts appraise the property after the seizure. Due to its proximity to Area 51 and the mineral rights to the land, each appraiser recognized the \u201cunique value\u201d of the property and came to the conclusion that the real value of the land was worth upwards of $44 million to $116 million dollars, Leavitt told Fox News. AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE JOINS $100 MILLION SEARCH FOR ALIEN LIFE In a statement on Nov. 9, 2016 obtained by Fox News, a prior commander at Nellis Air Force Base, Col. Thomas E. Dempsey explained the reason for seizing the land; \u201cOver the years, technology has increased demand for the test and training range assets and the Air Force has developed infrastructure that directly supports range activities that cannot be replicated elsewhere.\u201d Leavitt is fighting to get the family just compensation, which real estate expert and Fox News Legal Analyst Bob Massi explains as \u201can objective understanding of the value of that property.\u201d Fox News reached out for a comment from Justice Department, which is representing the Air Force but was told by deputy press secretary Wyn Hornbuckle the department will not comment on pending litigation. 'IT WAS NOT FROM THIS WORLD': WITNESS TO 'BRITAIN'S ROSWELL' UFO INCIDENT BREAKS 36-YEAR SILENCE Freelance local investigative reporter Glen Meek has been researching the Sheahan case since the government seized the land and is making a documentary about the land dispute. He noted government\u2019s unwillingness to provide answers and boiled it down to two major fundamental issues - individual rights and national security, saying \u201cthe government\u2019s position is pretty much, the testing that\u2019s going on there now is incompatible with civilians having private land in that area.\u201d The case is currently in discovery. Sheahan says he is a God-loving American and does not want to be portrayed as unpatriotic but wants his family to receive just compensation.\u00a0 Sheahan and Leavitt expect a late spring or early summer court date where a jury will\u00a0decide on the matter of just compensation.\u00a0 Trending in Science ",

PHILADELPHIA \u2014 A federal judge has sentenced Former Pennsylvania Congressman Chaka Fattah to 10 years behind bars on charges of racketeering, fraud and money laundering. Earlier this year, Fattah, 60, was convicted of misspending government grants and charity money to fund his campaign and personal expenses , even as he and his TV anchor wife earned more than $500,000 a year. U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle called the Philadelphia Democrat\u2019s crimes \u201castonishing\u201d given that he and his wife had an annual income that put them at or near the \u201ctop 1 percent.\u201d Fattah spent two decades in Congress before losing the primary this year. As he awaited his sentence, Fattah said he had \u201cmixed emotions\u201d: saddened to find himself in court but grateful for the work he was able to do. \u201cI\u2019ve helped tens of millions of people,\u201d Fattah said. \u201c(That) has nothing to do with the fact that I\u2019ve been found on the wrong side of these questions by a jury.\u201d Rep. Chaka Fattah responds to corruption charges: \"This is not Deflate-gate\" A jury this year found that Fattah took an illegal $1 million loan from a wealthy friend to prop up his failed 2007 campaign for Philadelphia mayor. He then repaid some of it with federal grant money from NASA that he had steered to an education nonprofit run by loyal former staffers. The nonprofit efforts \u2014 including a NASA-funded mobile science classroom emblazoned with Fattah\u2019s name that roamed Philadelphia during the mayoral campaign \u2014 helped promote Fattah\u2019s political career, prosecutors said in their sentencing memo. The jury convicted him of leading a five-person racketeering enterprise that included the loyal aides and political consultants who did his bidding, comingling campaign, nonprofit and government funds and using them as directed for Fattah\u2019s personal and political needs. For example, Fattah used $23,000 in nonprofit funds to repay his son\u2019s college loans and took an $18,000 bribe to try to help a friend become an ambassador. He even lobbied President Barack Obama on the friend\u2019s behalf, to no avail. Fattah and his wife used the $18,000 for a down payment on a Poconos vacation home. They told authorities the money covered the friend\u2019s purchase of a Porsche owned by Fattah\u2019s wife, but the Porsche never left their garage. \u201cFor someone so interested in advancing education for the disadvantaged, you had the temerity to steal from the Educational Advancement Alliance, a nonprofit supported by government funds,\u201d Bartle said. The judge said it was equally \u201castonishing\u201d that Fattah would steal money to cover his son\u2019s debts, to pay taxes and to buy a family vacation home. \u201cWhile you have done much good, you also engaged in grave and widespread criminal activity,\u201d Bartle said. \u201cYou abused your trust, time and time again.\u201d Fattah insists the Justice Department, though led by fellow Democrats, has been out to get him and his family for years. His son, Chaka Fattah Jr. is serving a five-year prison term in an overlapping fraud case that went to trial last year. Chaka \u201cChip\u201d Fattah Jr., who never finished college, was convicted of using fraudulently obtained business loans to fund his jet-set lifestyle. Fattah, who earned $174,000 as a congressman, is married to longtime Philadelphia news anchor Renee Chenault-Fattah. They have two school-age children. Chenault-Fattah, who is also a lawyer, spent 25 years with WCAU-TV before she resigned after the indictment named her a participant in the bribery scheme. She was never charged and has denied wrongdoing. Two of Fattah\u2019s political consultants pleaded guilty in the case and testified against him. The four others convicted at trial will be sentenced later this week. They include former Philadelphia Deputy Mayor Herbert Vederman, of Palm Springs, Florida, who had sought the ambassadorship. On Monday, U.S. District Judge sentenced Fattah to 10 years in prison. He was ordered to report to prison by Jan. 25, 2017. Fattah, who began his career in the Pennsylvania statehouse and entered Congress in 1995, lost the spring Democratic primary days before his trial began and resigned after his conviction in June. Former state Rep. Dwight Evans, a fellow Democrat, now holds his seat. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

By Emily Rauhala December 12 at 9:43 AM Follow emilyrauhala BEIJING \u2014 Donald Trump is\u00a0 talking about Taiwan again \u2014 and so is China, in angry and mocking \u00adcomments Monday that questioned whether the president-elect grasps a core \u00adelement of \u00adrelations between the world\u2019s top economic powers. In an interview broadcast Sunday, Trump said the United States would not necessarily be bound by the one-China policy \u2014 the diplomatic understanding that underpins ties between Washington and Beijing and that leaves China\u2019s \u00adrival Taiwan on the diplomatic sidelines with the United States. Trump suggested the policy could be revisited unless America could \u201cmake a deal,\u201d potentially on trade between the two countries. The remark elicited a sharp response from Beijing, with the Foreign Ministry expressing\u00a0\u201cserious concern\u201d and a party-controlled newspaper calling the president-elect\u00a0\u201cas ignorant as a child.\u201d\u00a0By appearing to treat Taiwan as just a bargaining chip for trade deals, he may also have irked Taipei, experts said. The comment came less than two weeks after the president-elect made headlines by taking a phone call from Taiwan\u2019s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, a surprise move that was interpreted by some as a high-stakes slip-up and by others as an overdue show of support for a democratic friend. 1 of 41 Trump continues his post-election \u2018thank-you\u2019 tour View Photos The president-elect has gone to Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio, and saluted workers at an Indiana plant where he says he saved more than 1,000 jobs. Caption The president-elect has gone to Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio, and saluted workers at an Indiana plant where he says he saved more than 1,000 jobs. Dec. 9, 2016 Trump walks out to speak in Grand Rapids. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump\u2019s latest foray into East Asian affairs came when he was asked by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about the planning for the Dec.\u00a02 call. He said that he learned about the call \u201can hour or two\u201d before it took place but that he understood the stakes. \u201cI fully understand the one- China policy, but I don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a one- China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, look,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want China dictating to me,\u201d he said. Since winning the U.S. presidential election, Trump\u2019s public comments and tweets on East Asian politics have put the region on edge and thrown the future of U.S.-China and U.S.-Taiwan relations into question. [ Why the Trump-Taiwan call was a big deal ] When Trump took a call from Tsai, he broke with decades of diplomatic practice \u2014 indeed, it was the first such call since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979. The call was condemned by \u00adChina, which lodged an official complaint in Washington. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the Obama administration remains \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to the one-China \u00adpolicy, even as he acknowledged that the U.S. stance may change in less than six weeks if the new administration pursues an entirely different policy. The Washington Post\u2019s Jia Lynn Yang explains the backstory on relations between the U.S., China and Taiwan and the ramifications of Friday's telephone call between President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. (Alice Li,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \u201cWe have continued what has been a bipartisan approach for the past 40 years with respect to a one-China policy, and this administration continues to believe that serves our national security interests in the best possible way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next administration, the president-elect, will have to make these decisions for himself and for themselves.\u201d A Monday editorial in the Global Times, a state-controlled newspaper known for its strident nationalism, suggested that\u00a0Trump ought to read some books on U.S.-China ties. It also warned that if the United States abandoned the one-China policy, Beijing\u00a0would have no reason to \u201cput peace above using force to take back Taiwan.\u201d \u201cChina needs to launch a resolute struggle with him,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cOnly after he\u2019s hit some obstacles and truly understands that China and the rest of the world are not to be bullied will he gain some perception. \u201cMany people might be surprised at how the new U.S. leader is truly a \u2018businessman\u2019 through and through,\u201d the paper said. \u201cBut in the field of diplomacy, he is as ignorant as a child.\u201d Su Hao, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, said Trump\u2019s comment was a \u201ccareless and irresponsible\u201d act that could\u00a0\u201cshake the foundation of the bilateral relationship.\u201d The stance on Taiwan, he said, is not open for negotiation.\u00a0\u201cInternational politics is not business. Not everything is on the table for trade.\u201d Taiwan might actually agree \u2014 but for different reasons.\u00a0 Many in Taipei hailed the call between Trump and Tsai as a breakthrough \u2014 a sign that the thriving democracy might finally get the U.S. backing it says it deserves. They did not see the call as a slip-up or a diplomatic gaffe but rather as the product of a \u00adRepublican-led recalibration of U.S. foreign policy that has been years in the making.\u00a0 William Stanton, a career diplomat who served as de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan from 2009 to 2012 and now heads the Center for Asia Policy at Taiwan\u2019s National Tsing Hua University, said Trump\u2019s comment Sunday seemed to throw that idea into question by treating Taiwan\u2019s status as just an element of trade negotiations. \u201cEither he doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about, or he is endangering the status that Taiwan has always had in U.S. policy,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cHaving done a good thing, from my point of view, Trump has undone it.\u201d Wu Jieh-min, an associate research fellow at Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica, said the United States should not use Taiwan as a means to an end. \u201cTrump\u2019s call with President Tsai may signal a possible readjustment of the U.S. policy toward Taiwan and China respectively,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cBut from the perspective of the Taiwanese people,\u201d he said, \u201cthe legitimate principle should be that Taiwan should not be used as something for trade between the great powers.\u201d Luna Lin in Beijing contributed to this report.

Stein initially filed for recounts in three states where the final margin for President-elect Donald Trump was narrow: Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania . She and her campaign will hold a call Tuesday morning to address what\u2019s next. In Wisconsin, officials announced Monday evening that the recount was complete -- and that rather than find additional votes for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton or Stein, the recount actually increased President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s margin there by 131 votes. Mr. Trump won the state by a margin of 22,748 votes, according to the newest totals from the Wisconsin Election Commission. Stein\u2019s campaign paid approximately $3.5 million for the Wisconsin recount. Jill Stein pushing for election recount in 3 states And in Pennsylvania, a federal judge ruled Monday morning against Stein\u2019s request for a review of the voting systems, saying it was possible they had been hacked and compromised. In his decision, federal judge Paul Diamond said Stein\u2019s allegation of possible election tampering \u201cborders on the irrational.\u201d Diamond also cited the delay between Election Day and Stein\u2019s decision to file the lawsuit, and said Stein didn\u2019t have standing to sue on the issue. \u201cGranting her later than last minute request for relief, however, could well ensure that no Pennsylvania vote counts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a result would be both outrageous and completely unnecessary; as I have found, suspicion of a \u2018hacked\u2019 Pennsylvania election borders on the irrational.\u201d Stein could appeal the decision, but time is short: all states must certify their election results by this Tuesday, so it\u2019s unlikely any new action could be taken before then. And in Michigan, the third state on Stein\u2019s list, the recount process ended last week after a judge lifted an order forcing the statewide review of ballots. The recount lasted three days, and examined ballots in 20 of the state\u2019s 83 counties. Stein first began raising money for a possible recount in late November, and quickly began bringing in millions of dollars for the effort. According to Stein\u2019s fundraising page, the effort has raised more than $7.3 million. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Trump postpones announcement about severing his business ties Published               December 12, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump will postpone until January a planned announcement about severing ties with his businesses, a transition source told Fox News late Monday.\u00a0 Trump had been scheduled to give a press conference Thursday at which he would discuss his financial holdings. However, the source told Fox that the president-elect was too busy filling his Cabinet to squeeze the press conference in. \"We were trying to get it all done, but we bit off more than we can chew,\" the source admitted. \"Delaying it is not a big deal. We'll get it done.\" A specific date for the rescheduled press conference was not immediately known. A Democratic operative involved in the 2016 presidential campaign noted to Fox News that the press conference would now take place after electors formally choose the new president Dec. 19. The transition team has faced a number of\u00a0questions about potential conflicts of interest between Trump's expansive financial holdings and the decisions that will reach his desk as president. Some details of Trump's finances are unknown given that he never released his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent. In an interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" this week, Trump said he would\u00a0not manage the Trump Organization but left open the question of whether he would retain his ownership stake.\u00a0 \"My executives will run it with my children,\" Trump told host Chris Wallace. For decades, presidents have sold their stocks and other personal holdings and put the cash into a blind trust overseen by an investment manager. Trump has ownership stakes in residential towers, hotels, resorts and golf clubs in the U.S., and has struck licensing and property management deals for similar properties around the world. In a financial disclosure he was required to file during the campaign, he listed stakes in about 500 companies in at least 25 countries. Only by selling to an uninterested third party can Trump assuage critics who suggest that otherwise he could shape regulatory, tax or foreign policies to enrich himself. A sale would also prevent people from trying to influence policies by helping -- or threatening to hurt -- his business. Few are expecting Trump to make a clean break. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a vice chairman of Trump's transition team, has said voters knew Trump was a billionaire businessman when they elected him and he shouldn't have to sell. Instead, Gingrich said he recommended to transition officials that Trump appoint a panel of five ethics \"jurists\" to vet potential conflicts. The government agency charged with monitoring ethics is pushing for far more. The Office of Government Ethics tweeted recently about Trump, \"We can't repeat enough how good this total divesture will be.\" The office clarified later that it did not know if that was indeed his plan.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel gets ready for talk to reporters after a Nov. 30 Chicago City Council meeting. (Zbigniew Bzdak/Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Chicago aldermen on Monday advanced a plan to roll back part of one of Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's signature initiatives to restrict the sale of flavored tobacco products near schools. Under the proposed ordinance passed by the Finance Committee, flavored cigarettes and cigars \u2014 including menthol cigarettes, candy-flavored cigars and other tobacco products with flavors added often favored by young smokers \u2014 could be sold in stores within 500 feet of grade schools. The changes would weaken the ordinance the mayor muscled through the City Council in 2013 which outlawed the sale of flavored tobacco within 500 feet of any school in Chicago. At the time, Emanuel heralded that move as \"a serious thing we're going to do to protect our kids\" from addictive products big tobacco companies push to get them hooked at a young age. In a statement Monday evening, Emanuel spokeswoman Lauren Huffman called the amended ordinance \"a fair compromise with aldermen on issues important to their communities, while preventing any setback on the progress we've made in protecting youth from tobacco use.\" The proposal would continue to prohibit sales of menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco near high schools as laid out in the 2013 city rule. The new standards would prohibit any new tobacco retailers from opening up within 500 feet of a Chicago high school, effectively making those operating within the boundaries the last ones that can do so. That could help the mayor try to frame the changes as a continuation of his tough anti-tobacco stance. Some aldermen and business groups favor the idea as a way to help struggling convenience stores and gas stations. Ald. Patrick Daley Thompson, 11th, said Emanuel's move this year to raise the age to buy tobacco in Chicago from 18 to 21 made redundant the ban near grade schools. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association says the ban has unfairly punished small business owners, and Daley Thompson said three or four corner stores are in trouble in his South Side ward with the loss of revenue from flavored tobacco sales. Rahm Emanuel and aldermen to allow menthol cigarettes to be sold in stores near elementary schools, an attempt to roll back part of the city's 2013 complete ban on selling flavored tobacco products near schools. The push, which could surface at... Chicago merchants are trying once again to get Mayor Rahm Emanuel and aldermen to allow menthol cigarettes to be sold in stores near elementary schools, an attempt to roll back part of the city's 2013 complete ban on selling flavored tobacco products near schools. The push, which could surface at... (Hal Dardick) \"An eighth-grader doesn't look 21 years old, so the other restrictions that have been put in place have largely dealt with this situation,\" Daley Thompson said. \"Often, when this type of rule is adopted, existing stores are grandfathered in, but that wasn't the case with the school ban, and I have longtime retailers that are really suffering.\" And some aldermen, particularly from the South and West sides, argue Emanuel's moves over the past several years to increase the cost of cigarettes and restrict their sales have helped drive a thriving black market in loose cigarettes that's often controlled by street gangs. Anti-smoking advocates decried the move to undermine the flavored tobacco ban near schools. \"I'm sympathetic to the sales of 'loosies,' but I don't know how to reconcile that with the fact that we appear to have saved an awful lot of lives and medical conditions by having ordinances such as the one that's being modified,\" said Joel Africk, president and CEO of the Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago. Rahm Emanuel last week to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco. Experts say the... Teens and young adults are likely to stop smoking \u2014 or never start \u2014 if they have to ask those 21 and older to buy cigarettes for them. That's the premise of research that supports a new plan put forth by Mayor Rahm Emanuel last week to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco. Experts say the... (Dawn Rhodes) The proposed ordinance also would require that people who sell cigarettes be at least 21 years old and would set a fine of up to $5,000 for a business employing a clerk younger than 21 to sell tobacco. It also would increase fines from $2,500 to $5,000 for illegally selling loose cigarettes. And as city inspectors try to rein in illegal cigarette sales, the plan would increase from $2,000 to $10,000 the fines for retailers who don't cooperate in various ways with city inspectors who come to their stores looking for untaxed or illegally packaged smokes. The changes come as Emanuel has taken several bows for his self-proclaimed fight against big tobacco. He appeared at a City Hall news conference in 2013 with officials from the little-known African-American Tobacco Control Leadership Council to receive the group's Visionary Elected Leader Award for pushing the flavored tobacco restrictions. The Finance Committee also agreed Monday to pay more than $9 million to settle two lawsuits stemming from police shootings and a third in which a group of women challenged the fairness of the physical strength test for the Chicago Fire Department . The committee voted to pay $2.37 million to the family of Darius Pinex, a 27-year-old father of three who was shot during a traffic stop in 2011. Another $1 million would go to attorneys for Pinex's estate, according to sources. The attorneys' fees were not on the Finance Committee agenda Monday. And the committee also voted to pay $3 million to the mother of Cedrick Chatman, a 17-year-old whose fatal shooting in January 2013 was caught on video. Chatman was shot in the South Shore neighborhood after officers pulled over the Dodge Charger he was suspected of taking in a carjacking. A group of women who were blocked for several years from getting hired at the Fire Department when they failed a strength test that was found to be unjust would get $3.8 million in city pension payments they would have earned had they joined the department earlier. It's the latest settlement in decades worth of suits claiming gender or racial bias at the Fire Department that have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The full City Council is set to consider the tobacco change and the settlements Wednesday. ",

Matt Rourke/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Former Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., walks from the federal courthouse on Monday after his sentencing hearing in Philadelphia. Matt Rourke/AP A federal jury has sentenced former Rep. Chaka Fattah to 10 years in prison for 23 counts of conspiracy, fraud, bribery and money laundering in a series of elaborate schemes that misappropriated funds. Prosecutors say Fattah engaged in a \"white collar crime spree,\" as WHYY's Aaron Moselle tells our Newscast unit, and expect that Fattah will serve most of his 10-year sentence in addition to paying over $600,000 in restitution. \"For him, now, to be sitting in prison, that's a significant signal to those who are thinking of engaging in this conduct about what can happen if they do so,\" Zane David Memeger, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, told Moselle. Some of Fattah's crimes were connected to his failed bid to become Philadelphia's mayor in 2007, after which he was deeply in debt. Guilty: U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah Sr. Convicted Of Political Corruption \"In June, a federal jury found that Fattah stole hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars and charitable donations to help repay part of an illegal campaign loan,\" Moselle says. \"The panel also said Fattah accepted bribes from a friend who wanted to become a U.S. ambassador and used campaign cash to help his son pay off some of his college loan debt.\" Fattah's lawyers repeatedly denied the charges during the trial, saying that Fattah's associates were actually to blame, WHYY reports . They said that \"Fattah's name or signature couldn't be found on any documents\" and they plan to appeal. \"The investigation and the trial has been the most disappointing event in my now 60-year life,\" the 11-term lawmaker told U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III in court, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer . \"I've helped tens of millions of people and that has nothing to do with the fact that I have been found on the wrong side of these questions by a jury.\" Article continues after sponsorship But Bartle said he found the crimes \"astonishing\" and ordered Fattah to begin serving his 10-year sentence on Jan. 25, the newspaper reported. \"You abused the trust they placed in you time and time again,\" the judge said, according to the Inquirer. \"Your flagrant behavior undermines the confidence of the citizenry in all public institutions.\" Fattah's political career has crumbled as a result of this trial; he lost the Democratic primary race in April, and he resigned from Congress in June after he was convicted.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats have used the latest intelligence findings to renew their calls for an urgent inquiry. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, demanded on Monday that all information about Russia\u2019s meddling be declassified, and that the Obama administration explain what it knows about the hacking and when it knew it. \u201cWe now know that the C.I.A. has determined Russia\u2019s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. \u201cThis should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d Three Senate Democrats \u2014 Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont \u2014 called on Monday for the creation of an independent, nonpartisan commission to comprehensively investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of calling for a special select committee, saying that the Senate intelligence committee was \u201cmore than capable of conducting a complete review\u201d of the matter. While he stopped short of saying whether he agreed that Russia had interfered in the election in support of Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said, \u201cWe need to approach all these on the assumption the Russians do not wish us well.\u201d Mr. McCain was less equivocal, saying Monday that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking\u201d by Russian intelligence services. He called the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and related accounts \u201canother form of warfare\u201d in an appearance on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. For his part, Mr. Trump was dismissive of the intelligence findings and suggested that Democrats were simply stirring controversy. \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that the administration would support a congressional review. He also rejected the notion that the administration had failed to adequately highlight the Russian efforts before the election, and said that the administration had extensively briefed Congress all year about Russian electoral meddling. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere has been intensive cooperation between the intelligence community and other national security agencies, and members of Congress in both parties, both before and after the election,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThe briefings have been provided in a variety of settings, both classified and unclassified.\u201d Even beyond the conclusions of the intelligence community, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign had widely known and extensive ties to the Russian government, including a campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who had worked for the Russian-backed government in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who had consulted for a Russian-backed media group, Mr. Earnest noted. Mr. Earnest said that Congress had a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, because those connections were widely known before the election, adding that, for Capitol Hill Republicans, how to \u201creconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is something they\u2019re going to have to explain.\u201d Gardiner Harris and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.

Against all odds, in a city that embraced them, with fans who loved them, in a stadium that showcases them, the impossible has happened. The return of the Rams has officially become an embarrassment. A Hollywood reunion that couldn\u2019t go wrong has blown up in bits of carpeted red. A glittering homecoming... (Bill Plaschke) Special teams coach John Fassel was named interim head coach.\u00a0 Kevin Demoff, the Rams\u2019 chief operating officer and vice president for football operations, said the decision to fire Fisher was \u201csolely a performance-related issue.\u201d Demoff, during a 40-minute news conference at the team\u2019s training facility in Thousand Oaks, described the situation as an \u201corganizational failure\u201d and said the move was \u201cmore about direction and hope.\u201d The Rams\u2019 performance the last few weeks, \u201cthat really changed the barometer,\u201d Demoff said. He said he spoke at length with Kroenke on Sunday night and then revisited the discussion Monday morning before informing Fisher. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was certainly expecting it,\u201d Demoff said of Fisher\u2019s reaction, which he described as professional. Fisher spoke to assistant coaches and players before Demoff addressed the team and later organizational staffers. Demoff said the Rams would consider candidates from all ranges of experience. He said \u201cthis is going to be a very attractive opening.\u201d \u201cThe biggest mistake we can make is narrowing our search before it begins,\u201d he said. The future of General Manager Les Snead will be determined at the end of the season as the Rams evaluate all parts of their operation. Fisher was fired the day after the Rams suffered an embarrassing 42-14 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. After the game, running back Todd Gurley said the Rams had run \u201ca middle-school offense\u201d and said some players were not giving full effort. The Rams are 4-9 and have lost eight of their last nine games. They play at Seattle on Thursday night. Fisher, 58, was in the fifth and final year of a contract that paid him about $7 million a year. He received a two-year contract extension before or early in the season and is expected to receive a buyout. Fisher and Snead were hired by the St. Louis Rams before the 2012 season. The Rams went 7-8-1, 7-9, 6-10 and 7-9 in the four seasons preceding the Rams\u2019 move back to Southern California. Fisher coached the Houston Oilers in the mid-1990s and helped move the franchise to Tennessee, where it became the Tennessee Titans . Fisher has a career record of 173-165-1. He is tied with Dan Reeves for the most losses by a coach in NFL history. ",

Time Donald Trump (Photo: Ralph Freso) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Cybersecurity professionals respectfully disagree, President-elect Trump:\u00a0You can catch hackers even when they're not in the act. In tweets sent Monday morning discounting U.S. intelligence agencies' assertion that Russia was behind attempts to interfere with the U.S. presidential election,  Trump said it was almost impossible to determine who was actually behind a hack unless they were caught in the act. Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 Unless you catch \"hackers\" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 That's not a view embraced by the thousands who have made their job ferreting out hackers. \"Cyber criminals always leave evidence behind and forensic cybersecurity capabilities have advanced to the point where we can identify and analyze hacks faster than ever before,\u201d said Barak\u00a0Klinghofer, co-founder and chief product officer at Hexadite, a Boston-based company that does cyber-threat incident response. No less an authority that Kevin Mitnick,\u00a0a hacker who spent five years in prison for computer-related crimes, tweeted that Trump was wrong and that hackers can be caught\u00a0after the act. \"Take it from someone who knows this fact very well,\" said Mitnick, who now has his own consulting company, Mitnick Security. Some criminals are, indeed, caught in the act. Security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a hack attack in May, says it watched the hackers while they were in the system. The company was, \u201cable to watch everything that the adversaries were doing while we were working on a full remediation plan to remove them from the network,\" said the company\u2019s chief technology officer\u00a0Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike CTO. One clue: Time off for Russian holidays But hackers leave plenty of clues cyber security professionals can use to identify the perpetrators after the fact. Knowing who\u2019s behind an attack involves combining forensics, data and psychology, said Nick Rossmann, a senior production manager at FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. FireEye is often brought in to do post-attack forensics in large breaches. \u201cThreat intelligence is an art form,\u201d said Rossman. Analysts look at what software the attackers are using, what platforms and what address they\u2019re coming from. \u201cYou look at what tools they\u2019re using. Is it a certain kind of malware that requires skill to use? Was it custom-built to penetrate a specific network?\u201d he said. They also look at motivations, what information was stolen and who it might be useful to. Finally, timing is often a clue. In an investigation of one hacking group, FireEye observed that all the activity took place during the work hours in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and the attackers also took Russian national holidays off. Rossmann added that U.S. intelligence agencies are well-supplied with staffers who have the necessary\u00a0knowledge and background to do these types of investigations. \u201cWe hire people right from the government for a reason.\u00a0They have the skills to do this,\u201d Rossman said. Trump disagrees with U.S. intelligence community The CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump. Trump's transition team responded \u00a0t, \"these are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said\u00a0Monday that two Senate committees will investigate the CIA's allegations. Republican leaders join outrage at Russia, will investigate hacks President Obama on Friday \u00a0ordered\u00a0the nation's intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of attempts by foreign hackers to influence U.S. elections. The entire U.S. intelligence community, which includes 16 different agencies, as well as\u00a0at least three private computer security companies,\u00a0have independently investigated\u00a0security breaches associated with the U.S. presidential election, concluding that the Russian government was behind the hacks. In a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security released on October 7, U.S. intelligence agencies said they were \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\" The specific instances outlined in the statement included: \u25ba Emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. \u25ba Emails from that hack given to WikiLeaks. \u25ba Scanning and probing of state election-related systems. On Sunday, Trump dismissed\u00a0the link as\u00a0\"ridiculous,\" telling Fox News Sunday \"I think it's just another excuse,\" adding\u00a0\"I don't believe it ... Every week it's another excuse.\" ",

By Elise Viebeck December 12 at 6:47 PM Follow @eliseviebeck President-elect Donald Trump waves as he arrives at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in Bedminster, N.J., on Nov. 20, 2016. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) President-elect Donald Trump will wait until January to say\u00a0what role he will play in his business empire as president, delaying one of the most critical and highly anticipated announcements of the transition. Trump has been under significant pressure to step away from his various businesses since winning the election to avoid possible conflicts of interest. On Sunday, Trump repeated he will hand over day-to-day management of the Trump Organization to his three older children, but suggested he would not fully divest from the company. \u201cEssentially, I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the management,\u201d Trump told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWhen I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world.\u00a0I mean, I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. I\u2019m not going to be doing deals at all.\u201d The president-elect was scheduled to give a news conference Thursday to detail plans to separate himself from his business concerns. It was to be his first news\u00a0conference since winning the election Nov. 8. \u201cWhile I am not mandated to\u00a0do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\u201d Trump tweeted Nov. 30. \u201cHence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!\u201d A spokesman for Trump said the delay is taking place so Trump can continue to focus on building his Cabinet. \u201cWith so many iconic properties and successful entities, moving the announcement to January ensures the legal team has ample time to ensure the proper protocols are put in place so his sole focus will remain on the country and achieving his ambitious agenda,\u201d\u00a0Sean Spicer wrote in an email Monday evening. Neither Spicer nor another Trump spokesperson, Hope Hicks, gave a new date for the news conference when asked. Trump\u2019s assets and name recognition around the world create an unprecedented ethical maze as he prepares to enter the White House. As Trump often points out, presidents are not bound by the strict conflict-of-interest laws that govern most U.S. elected officials. Still, most modern presidents have chosen to sell or sequester their assets under independent management to prevent their private interests from influencing their actions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be doing deals at all. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a conflict. I mean, I have the right to do it. You know, under the law, I have the right to do it. I just don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Trump told Fox on Sunday. The decision to delay the news conference was first reported by Bloomberg News. So far, Trump\u2019s transition has been rife with ethical questions, particularly when it comes to his dealings with world leaders. At least 111 Trump companies have done business in 18 countries and territories across South America, Asia and the Middle East, a Washington Post analysis of Trump\u2019s financial filings shows, creating myriad potential conflicts. For example, Trump took a break from transition work in November for a brief meeting with the developers of a Trump project in Pune, India. He acknowledged to the New York Times that he \u201cmight have\u201d discouraged Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, from supporting offshore wind farms, which Trump believes mar the view from one of his coastal properties in Scotland. Trump has included his daughter Ivanka in his communications with world leaders, including a sit-down at Trump Tower on Nov. 17 with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Ivanka and her two brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, hold senior leadership positions in the Trump Organization and also have official roles with the transition, a situation that has also raised concerns with former government ethics officers. The Post's Rosalind S. Helderman explores the details behind the announcement that President-elect Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump says he has taken at least one step to protect himself from conflicts of interest: selling his stock portfolio in June. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I\u2019m making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively. So I just felt it was a conflict,\u201d told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show last week. The apparent transactions were not announced at the time, and a Trump spokesman did not provide documentation of the sales or additional detail when asked by The Post. Trump held his last news conference on July 27 and used the event to call for the Russian government to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and release her correspondence. The CIA has since concluded Russia did interfere with the election in order to push voters away from Clinton and toward Trump. Abby Phillip contributed to this report. powerpost ",

(Dec. 12) AP Get ready to return to a galaxy far, far away. Just not exactly the way you thought you were. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\u00a0revisits the world of Jedis, Stormtroopers and lightsabers, taking a side journey to a story removed from last year's box-office smash,\u00a0The Force Awakens. Despite the number of trailers and talk show appearances by the cast, the basic details of\u00a0Rogue One\u00a0are still hard to grasp for a casual Star Wars\u00a0fan. 'Rogue One' rebels against the 'Star Wars' mold What is\u00a0Rogue One? It's a Star Wars\u00a0movie that's\u00a0independent of the seven movies we've seen so far. The easiest way to describe it: \"Hey, remember the beginning of the very first\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0(1977)\u00a0movie? When they said a group of Rebels had stolen the plans to the Death Star? That's this movie.\" x Share The final trailer for 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,' starring Felicity Jones, Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn. Lucasfilm So\u00a0it's a prequel? Yes. It takes place just before the original\u00a0Star Wars. For those of you keeping track of the chronological order, it starts with the prequel trilogy:\u00a0Episode I: The Phantom Menace\u00a0then\u00a0Episode II: Attack of the Clones\u00a0then\u00a0Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Then there's a long time jump to\u00a0Rogue One, which is right before the original,\u00a0Episode IV: A New Hope. Then we get the rest of the \"Original Trilogy\" as fans call it,\u00a0Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\u00a0followed by\u00a0Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. A new trilogy started last year with\u00a0The Force Awakens, which is Episode VII. 'Rogue One' premieres to raves, relief and an X-wing What does this have to do with last year's movie? Absolutely nothing. It's just another movie in the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0universe, the way that\u00a0Doctor Strange\u00a0and Captain America: The First Avenger\u00a0are both set in the Marvel universe, but aren't directly connected. The cast of 'Rogue One.' \u00a0(Photo: Lucasfilm) Are there going to be more\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0\"stories\"? Yes, because Disney wants a\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0movie every year.\u00a0Episode VIII, which will pick up with Rey (Daisy Ridley), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the rest of the folks we met in\u00a0The Force Awakens,\u00a0hits theaters in 2017. Rogue One\u00a0is filling the gap this year. In 2018, we'll get another \"story\" about a young Han Solo (played by\u00a0Alden Ehrenreich). And then Rey and friends will return in\u00a0Episode IX\u00a0in 2019. We saw part of 'Rogue One': Here's what we learned If I want to see\u00a0Rogue One,\u00a0do I have to watch the other seven movies? You may want to watch\u00a0A New Hope, which will help you understand why the\u00a0heroes are risking life and limb to get the Death Star plans. It's also helpful to know the basics: The Empire is evil and a group called\u00a0the Rebel Alliance is trying to take them down. ",

    "text": "Republicans Are Grappling With How to Repeal Obamacare By MaryAlice Parks Dec 12, 2016, 2:26 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Obamacare Premiums Rising Sharply Next Year 0 Shares Email Republicans on Capitol Hill have begun both tamping down expectations and trying to allay fears about how fast they can and should dismantle key components of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law . House Speaker Paul Ryan in a television interview last week said that while Congress plans to vote to overturn and defund parts of the law as soon as possible, \u201cit's going to be years,\u201d before people who have access to insurance because of the law have to transition to a new program. When Will Obamacare Be 'Repealed' and What Does That Even Mean? Republicans have campaigned for the last six years on a pledge to repeal the law immediately and, since the presidential election , GOP lawmakers have doubled down on that promise. But details remain up in the air. Most likely, Republican lawmakers will in January vote on a special budget package to cut funding for programs in the law down the road. That is the \u201crepeal\u201d part. They would not need Democratic cooperation on this because certain budget bills can be passed with a simple 51-majority vote in the Senate under a process called reconciliation. But those bills must be limited in scope and cannot overturn regulatory rules or marketplace standards such as the law\u2019s ban on lifetime coverage limits. \u201cPeople don't understand that a \u2018repeal\u2019 doesn't mean that you pull the rug out,\u201d Ryan said during the interview on CNBC. He added that he did not want Americans \u201cgoing back to the emergency rooms,\u201d because they lost their health care. So, to protect the estimated 20 million Americans who gained health insurance from being left high and dry, it is likely that Republicans will write the budget bill so that funding cuts don't take effect for a year or two. \u201cI think now the line is more like \u2018repeal and delay,\u2019 Dr. Michael Chernew, director of the healthcare markets and regulation lab at Harvard Medical School told ABC News. \u201cIt is symbolically important for them to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but deleterious in terms of policy to stop it right now before they know what they want to do.\u201d Chernew said he expects that most public subsidies that allowed for states to expand coverage through Medicaid and establish marketplaces for consumers to buy individual insurance will remain through 2017 and perhaps even 2018 in order to maintain relative stability in the health care industry and the overall economy. Under this scenario, people would still be able to buy individual insurance through state-based marketplaces for another year or so. But again, Republicans say all details have yet to be ironed out. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters this week that replacing Obamacare may be a long-term project. \u201cIt took six years to get where we are now and demonstrate the failure of Obamacare, so it\u2019s going to take us a little while to fix it,\u201d he said. More Questions Than Answers The Affordable Care Act was drafted by Democrats with the aim of getting insurance companies on board with the law's new requirements and expanded coverage by also imposing mandates that consumers who can afford to buy insurance do so. The law also introduced public subsidies to make it easier for people to buy insurance if their employers do not offer it. Approximately 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage since the law went into effect, according to the Obama administration. Republicans on Capitol Hill have repeatedly said they want to maintain popular provisions of the law, such as prohibiting insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and requiring them to allow young adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 plans. However, as Democrats have been quick to note, Republicans have yet to offer specifics on how they would get insurance companies to fulfill these requirements without also continuing the mandate for consumers to buy insurance. The mandate is supposed to ensure that more people, especially the young and healthy, buy coverage, which can help keep overall premium costs down. Experts, including two major national hospital advocacy organizations as well as the American Actuary Group, wrote to Republicans recently warning that cutting funding for some parts of the law immediately without at least a blueprint for a future plan could send shockwaves through the health insurance industry and lead to the collapse individual insurance markets. In short, millions of Americans could lose insurance, and doctors and other health care providers could lose paying customers. \u201cThe [Affordable Care Act] was designed to solve a problem,\" Chernew said of the millions of Americans who were previously uninsured and now have coverage. \"You can debate whether or not it was a good way to solve that problem or whether it was successful -- and there were some successes and some not -- but the underlying problem remains\u201d of keeping people insured. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote to governors across the country seeking their input and advice and told reporters that Republican lawmakers were thinking and talking about these challenges. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing how we can solve the problem but nothing to report yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWait to see what we draft.\u201d Democrats, however, have pounced on the lack of details. \u201cThey said they want to start repealing Obamacare the first week \u2026 bring it on,\u201d incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"They don\u2019t know what to do. They know they can\u2019t just repeal it. They have nothing to put it in its place.\" \u201cJust repealing Obamacare will cause huge calamity,\" Schumer said. \"They are like the dog that caught the bus.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Some of the coldest weather this year is heading your way, and by the end of the week, wind chills in the Big Apple and much of the East Coast could be in the single digits, the National Weather Service warned. \"The big story over the next couple days will be the arctic air rolling in,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Pereira told NBC News. \"This could bring some the coldest air of the season. By Thursday, we could be looking at single digits across the Midwest, including Chicago.\" Along with the cold, \"we're going to see snow develop across the Great Lakes, Chicago included,\" Pereira said. By Friday, the frigid weather will reach the East Coast. Anthony Green, 9, left, throws a snowball Monday at Eric Babcock, 15, in Flint, Michigan. Mark Felix - MLive.com via AP \"Northern New York and New England have the best chances for receiving significant snow,\" Pereira said. \"It will be a messy, wintry mix to the south.\" And it will be super cold. \"We'll be lucky if the highs climb out of the low 20s,\" NWS meteorologist Carlie Buccola said of New York City. \"At night, we're looking at temperatures in the teens, and the wind chill will be lower than that.\" By contrast, they'll be baking in Alaska, with highs in the 30s forecast for Friday in places like Anchorage. So far, the coldest temperatures New York City has felt this year came on Saturday and Sunday nights, when the mercury hit 28 degrees, Buccola said. Play ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Donald Trump 2308 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 68 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Donald Trump is postponing a news conference designed to announce\u00a0plans on how to handle his business interests amid concerns that they pose conflict of interest problems for his presidency, Trump transition officials said Monday. While Trump had said he would speak to the matter on Thursday, aides said he will now wait until January to outline how he would pass control of his company to others. \"The announcement has been rescheduled for next month,\" transition spokesman Hope Hicks said. Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump has been focused on putting together his Cabinet and staff, \"With so many iconic properties and successful entities, moving the announcement to January, ensures the legal team has ample time to ensure the proper protocols are put in place so his sole focus will remain on the country and achieving his ambitious agenda with the help of the world-class cabinet he has built,\" Spicer said in a statement. Over the weekend, Trump said he would hand over his business interests to executive and family members. \"My executives will run it with my children,\" Trump said on Fox News Sunday. \"It's a big company, it's a great company.\u00a0 But I'm going to have nothing to do with management.\" Office of Government Ethics gushes over Trump in tweetstorm Ethics watchdogs have repeatedly called on Trump to divest his interests in his far-flung real-estate and branding empire to avoid potential conflicts with his presidency. \u201cLet's hope he takes the additional time to do the right thing, follow every president for the past four decades, and divest into a blind trust or the equivalent,\u201d said Norm Eisen, who served as President Obama\u2019s top ethics lawyer and has been among the leading voices calling for Trump to divest. Eisen has argued repeatedly that Trump\u2019s web of companies with interests from Turkey to India could ensnare the Trump administration in scandal. Last week, he and 28 other organizations and individuals,\u00a0including several Republicans, issued an open letter to the incoming president, renewing calls for him to stash his assets in a blind trust. Meredith McGehee, an ethics watchdog at the non-profit group Issue One, said she viewed Trump\u2019s delay as a \u201chopeful sign.\u201d \u201cIf he wanted to simply announce that \u2018my kids are taking over,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t require a lot of time and effort,\u201d said McGehee, whose organization has called on Trump to divest his holdings and allow an independent trustee to manage his assets. \u201cI would hope that this would indicate that he\u2019s going to actually work through this in a meaningful way,\u201d McGehee said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty complicated process.\u201d ",

Today, the ancient city lies in ruins. Salih tears up thinking about Nimrud's destruction \u2014 60 percent of what's been excavated now gone, according to her estimate. Seeing Nimrud as a schoolgirl inspired her to become an archaeologist; many of her colleagues are still trapped inside the city. \"It is a tragic thing \u2014 our culture, our history, our memories,\" she said, wiping her eyes. \"They tried to destroy the identity of Iraq. The only thing we can do now is document the damage so we can start thinking of how to rebuild again.\" Nimrud before ISIS wrecked it in March, 2015. A recent visit to Nimrud revealed the devastating scale of the destruction. Just the archway entrance to famed Northwest Palace, built by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II, remains, surrounded by piles of rubble. The fragments of its former winged guardians lie in a heap nearby. Related: ISIS Is Erasing Iraqi History by Destroying Antiquities, Officials Warn Although ISIS fighters have been pushed out, the site lies unprotected. Sheikh Khalid al-Jabbouri, a local tribal commander from Nimrud, said he wept when he first saw how little remained of the ancient city that generations of his family used to take care of. \"I wasn't as devastated when they destroyed my house or when they killed some of my relatives because this is life \u2014 all of us die,\" he said, surveying the damage. \"But Nimrud was like a part of our family. This heritage was part of our lives, part of all of Iraq.\" Leila Sallih became an archaeologist after she was mesmerized by the ancient city of Nimrud which she saw for the first time as a teenager. She spent many years excavating the site. Yuka Tachibana / NBC News Iraq has lost thousands of precious objects from its national museum and other \u00adarchaeological sites following the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. And Salih said that Nimrud needs immediate protection before archaeologists can fully assess the damage. She also hopes that the militants featured in the ISIS video would be found and prosecuted for war crimes, similar to what happened in Mali. While the ancient palaces and pyramid are gone for good, Salih said there is hope yet for Nimrud. Only 30 percent of the site has been excavated.

Iraq Historical artifact with intricate carvings lies on the ground in Nimrud. Yuka Tachibana / NBC News An Assyrian Christian whose family was driven from their home by ISIS two years ago, 17-year-old Ninous Thabit considers Nimrud to be the work of his ancestors. Over the past year, he's been sculpting intricate replicas of the priceless objects destroyed by ISIS. Related: ISIS Damages Iraq's Hatra Archaeological Site in Purported Video He said he made nearly 40 pieces over the past year \u2014 including replicas of the famed \"lamassu\" statues -- winged bulls with human heads. It's painstaking work, but Thabit said he feels a duty to protect his country's heritage. \"It is very hard to accept the destruction of a civilization that was built thousands of years ago so started sculpting Assyrian figures, especially those are connected to Nimrud to fight back,\" Thabit said. \"I wanted to let ISIS knows that we are people who love life, we love our civilization, and we will protect it in the future.\" Lucy Kafanov ",

The team hosted seven players for tryouts at Halas Hall. Five of them were wide receivers and five of them played this past season in the Canadian Football League. Derel Walker, the CFL\u2019s most outstanding rookie in 2015 and an all-star for the last two seasons for the Edmonton Eskimos, was part of the workout. The 25-year-old Walker (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) played at Texas A&M and is looking to get a shot in the NFL. He was second in the CFL\u00a0this season with 1,589 yards. Walker had a tryout for the Vikings last week and is expected to visit multiple teams. Other CFL standouts on hand were Greg Ellingson , a postseason star for the Ottawa Redblacks, who won the Grey Cup. Ellingson, 27, made 76 receptions for 1,260 yards this season. He\u2019s spent time previously with the Jaguars and Buccaneers . Kenny Shaw and Diontae Spencer, who both played for the Toronto Argonauts, got a look. Shaw made 77 receptions for 1,004 yards this year. He\u2019s spent time with the Browns , Jaguars and Raiders . Spencer, 5-8, 163 pounds, is a slot receiver and returner. He had 71 receptions for 706 yards this season and has spent time previously with the Rams. Guard Derek Dennis was also at the tryout. He spent time with the Bears in 2012 and 2013 and played this past season for the Calgary Stampeders. The Bears also looked at an indoor league standout, former Eastern Kentucky receiver Orlandus Harris. He has played for the Spokane Empire and Bloomington Edge. Fullback Malcolm Johnson, a sixth-round pick of the Browns in 2015 from Mississippi State, was also at the workout. Johnson was released by the Browns earlier this season and had a brief stay on the practice squad of the Seahawks . The Bears have signed a handful of CFL players over the years without a lot of success. However, linebacker Jerrell Freeman starred in Canada before signing with the Colts . ",

USA TODAY Sports Los Angeles Rams coach Jeff Fisher reacts during the game against the Atlanta Falcons at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) The Jeff Fisher Era is over for the Los Angeles Rams. The day after an embarrassing 42-14 home loss to the Atlanta Falcons \u2013 after which star running back Todd Gurley criticized the offense \u2013 the Rams fired Fisher. Fisher was 31-45-1 in nearly five seasons with the Rams. The Rams are 4-9 this season and play Thursday night against the Seattle Seahawks. Special teams coordinator John Fassel will take over as interim head coach. The Rams did not have a winning record in any of Fisher\u2019s years with the franchise. But he was able to last longer than many NFL coaches would without making the playoffs, in part because of years of quarterback injuries and futility, and, more recently, the challenge of moving the team from St. Louis to Los Angeles. Fisher was even given a contract extension this year, though word of the move did not come out until last week. But\u00a0drama within the front office and the losing \u2013 and the way the Rams were losing \u2013 might\u00a0have pushed\u00a0owner Stan Kroenke to take action. A report last week from The MMQB described the relationship between Fisher and general manager Les Snead as \u201ctoxic,\" though both parties dismissed any notion of a rift when asked. NFL Week 14 overreactions: Are Packers really back? Sunday\u2019s loss to Atlanta at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was the breaking point. The Rams, playing their fourth game with No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff at quarterback, trailed 42-0 until ending the shutout in the fourth quarter. That led Gurley, the reigning NFL offensive rookie of the year, to liken the Rams\u2019 offense to a \u201cmiddle-school offense\u201d after the game and said players were \"going through the motions.\" Gurley has no 100-yard games this year and is averaging just 3.3 yards per carry. The Rams\u2019 offense has been disappointing throughout Fisher\u2019s tenure, especially after the team lost quarterback Sam Bradford to knee injuries in 2013 and 2014. Moving up to the No. 1 pick this year to select Goff was supposed to be the blockbuster move to change that. But Goff wasn\u2019t deemed ready to start until late last month, when the Rams had already well behind in the NFC West race. His lack of development \u2013 while other rookies such as\u00a0the Dallas Cowboys' Dak Prescott and Philadelphia Eagles' Carson Wentz proved themselves ready to be Day 1 starters \u2013 was an indictment on both Fisher\u2019s coaching staff and the front office for giving up so much to draft him when he wasn\u2019t ready to play right away. Through Sunday, the Rams' offense ranks lowest in the NFL in scoring with 14.9 points per game. 40 things we learned in Week 14 of the 2016 NFL season Yet a bigger issue for Fisher lately has been the failure of the Rams\u2019 defense. That group, loaded with talent like defensive tackle Aaron Donald, defensive end Robert Quinn and linebacker Alec Ogletree, was supposed to carry the Rams while the Goff-Gurley offense developed. That the Falcons loss happened in front of a home crowd, with thousands of empty seats, surely didn\u2019t sit well with Kroenke so soon after moving the team from St. Louis. It\u2019s hard to sell a non-competitive franchise in the Los Angeles sports market. Now the Rams will start over. Los Angeles\u2019 new coach will inherit that talented defensive roster and an offense that has several intriguing pieces, most notably Gurley. But a new head coach and offensive coordinator will need to fix the offensive line, accelerate Goff\u2019s development and find a way to use Gurley, rather than waste his talents.

    "text": "<p>Despite the deaths of thousands, the killer fog largely remained a mystery for decades.</p> Close Courtesy of Texas A&M University London may be known for its drizzly weather, but in 1952 the city\u2019s quintessential fog cover turned deadly, and no one knew exactly why \u2014 until now. For five days in December 1952, a fog that contained pollutants enveloped all of London. By the time the\u00a0 dense fog cover \u00a0lifted, more than 150,000 people had been hospitalized and at least 4,000 people had died. Researchers now estimate that the total death count was likely more than 12,000 people, as well as thousands of animals. Despite its lethal nature, the exact cause and nature of the killer fog has largely remained a mystery. Recently, a team of researchers has determined the likely reasons for its formation. Researchers have for a long time connected emissions from burning coal with the killer fog, but the specific chemical processes that led to the\u00a0 deadly mix of pollution \u00a0and fog were not fully understood. To determine what turned the fog into a killer, an international team of scientists from China, the U.S. and the U.K. recreated the fog in a lab using results from laboratory experiments and atmospheric measurements from Beijing and Xi\u2019an, two heavily polluted cities in China. [ In Photos: World\u2019s Most Polluted Places ] Time lapse video shows Beijing smog lifting Study lead author Renyi Zhang, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University, said that sulfate was a big contributor to the deadly London fog. Sulfuric acid particles, which formed from the sulfur dioxide that was released from the burning of coal, were also a component of the fog. The question was, How did\u00a0 sulfur \u00a0dioxide get turned into sulfuric acid? \u201cOur results showed that this process was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning, and occurred initially on natural fog,\u201d Zhang\u00a0 said in a statement . \u201cAnother key aspect in the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfate is that it produces acidic particles, which subsequently inhibits this process.\u201d The natural fog contained larger particles, Zhang explained, with the smaller acidic particles evenly distributed throughout. When those fog particles evaporated, an acidic-haze was left covering the city. The 1952 killer fog led to the creation of the Clean Air Act , which the British Parliament passed in 1956. Researchers still consider it the worst air pollution event in European history. China's smog problem The air of cities in China, which is often heavily polluted, has a chemistry that\u2019s similar to the killer fog in London, Zhang and his colleagues found. China has battled\u00a0 air pollution \u00a0for decades, and it is home to 16 of the world\u2019s 20 most polluted cities, according to the researchers. For instance, air pollution in Beijing often far exceeds the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s acceptable air standards. The researchers said that the main difference between China\u2019s \u00a0 smog \u00a0and the killer London fog is that China\u2019s haze is made up of much smaller nanoparticles. Also, the formation of sulfate is only possible with ammonia, the scientists added. \u201cIn China, sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants. Nitrogen dioxide is from power plants and automobiles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and automobiles,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cAgain, the right chemical processes have to interplay for the deadly haze to occur in China. Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral.\u201d A better understanding of air chemistry is key to developing effective regulatory actions in China, Zhang said. \u201cWe think we have helped solve the 1952 London fog mystery and also have given China some ideas of how to improve its air quality,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cReduction in emissions for nitrogen oxides and ammonia is likely effective in disrupting this sulfate-formation process.\u201d ",

They previously had assessed that Russia was trying to undermine the U.S. presidential election, but after Nov. 8 they came to believe that Russian interference was ultimately designed to help Trump win. Related: CIA Concludes Russia Mounted Hacks to Help Trump Win This latest finding fed an already blazing public dispute between the U.S. intelligence agencies and the president-elect over Russian interference in the election. \"I don't believe it,\" Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday on Fox News, disputing the notion that the Russians wanted to help him. \"I think it's ridiculous.\" Play Donald Trump dismisses claims that Russia interfered in 2016 election 3:33 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161213013853if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/829781571807\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump and his aides reject not just the CIA's updated assessment about Russian intentions, but the earlier consensus reached by all 17 agencies, and released in a rare joint public statement by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and DHS head Jeh Johnson, that Russia was meddling in the election in the first place. The seriousness of the gulf can hardly be overstated: many foreign policy experts and lawmakers believe Russia's behavior was an attack on the nation. One former CIA leader, Hillary Clinton supporter Michael Morell, likened Russia's intrusion into U.S. politics Friday to \"the political equivalent of 9/11.\" Related: U.S. Intel Agencies Prepping Dossier to Prove Russian Hacks In fact, the CIA's latest take is not the unanimous view of the intelligence community. Clapper, who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, had enough confidence to relay the CIA's assessment to Congress in a secret briefing last week. But no similar assessment has leaked from any of the other 16 intelligence agencies. The FBI, for its part, assesses that Russia's main goal was to sow chaos and undermine American democracy, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News. Helping Trump served that purpose, the official said, but Russia didn't expect Trump to win the election.

Instead, it was the result of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial evidence more detailed than anything the public has seen. Human sources, communications intercepts and other intelligence have allowed analysts to piece together the identities of some of the players, and the steps they took to hurt Clinton's candidacy while boosting Trump's, officials said. The CIA also noted that while Russian hackers gathered information on Republicans, they didn't release any of it, the way they did with Democratic emails leaked to WikiLeaks. The Republican National Committee denies its systems were hacked, but the emails of individual Republicans were collected\u2014something NBC News reported in October. Related: Trump Was Told Russia to Blame for Hacks Long Before First Debate The FBI believes the Russians didn't find anything explosive in the Republican material they obtained, the official said, although it's not clear whether any U.S. agency knows the full extent of what data Russian hackers were able to steal. The CIA also tracked a campaign of anti-Clinton news stories amplified by social media, some of which originated with Russian state media outlets, officials told NBC News.

Other intelligence agencies have not endorsed the CIA view, but no entity is known to oppose it. However, the question of motive\u2014why the Russians allegedly meddled in the election \u2014 is entirely separate from the more basic question of whether the U.S. has strong evidence that the Russian government sponsored the covert campaign. On that score, every intelligence agency in the government agrees: The Russians did it. Related: Mitch McConnell Condemns Russian Breaches of U.S. Political Organizations In October, DNI Clapper and Homeland security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued an extraordinary joint statement that \"the U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\" One source familiar with the intelligence said it included profiles of some of the suspects with pictures, and could lead to eventual indictments of specific Russian actors, if the Justice Department decides to pursue them. The evidence on that score simply doesn't support Trump's recent comments that \"It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" That is why the two Trump supporters who lead the Congressional intelligence committees, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California, have each issued statements in recent days expressing concern about Russian hacking.

Nunes said Friday: \"Russia's cyber attacks are no surprise to the House Intelligence Committee, which has been closely monitoring Russia's belligerence for years.\" On Monday, the top Republicans in Congress \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 each issued statements pledging to investigate Russian meddling in the election. Related: Intelligence Agencies Distressed by Trump's Rejection of Findings on Russia Ryan called Russia \"an aggressor,\" and McConnell made a point of saying he has \"the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially the Central Intelligence Agency.\" On Monday, Sen. John McCain of Arizona renewed his call for a bipartisan hearing, but said he didn't believe Russians were trying to engineer a Trump victory: \"That's the reason we need a full investigation, but I have seen no evidence of that.\" It's unclear whether Trump has been briefed on the same evidence top Republicans have seen, because he has had only a handful of intelligence briefings since the election. Trump not only said he didn't believe the intelligence community's assessment \u2014 he suggested that the CIA was not to be believed in general, issuing a statement Friday night noting that \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Related: U.S. Publicly Blames Russia for Hacking Several intelligence officials told NBC News they were deeply disturbed by that statement. There is no historical precedent for a president-elect publicly maligning the intelligence agencies he is about to lead. One big question now is how Trump's pick as CIA director, Mike Pompeo, will bridge the acrimonious gap between his boss and the agency he leads. President Barack Obama does not intend to make it easy on Trump: He has ordered that a dossier be assembled on the evidence about the Russian covert operation. A senior Obama administration official told NBC News that portions of that will be made public before January 20th. Related: Hackers Target Election Systems in 20 States Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC News that can't happen soon enough. The way to thwart Russian information campaigns is to publicize them, he said. He warned, though, is that the U.S. Is not going to be able offer the sort of proof many skeptics are demanding. \"If you provide proof, you provide a roadmap to show the Russians how we caught them,\" he said, \"including intelligence sources and methods.\" Ken Dilanian ",

But he does not believe special panels are necessary to do so. Speaking to reporters at an end-of-the-year press conference, McConnell (R-KY) indicated that he'd like the regular Senate committees to lead an investigation into Russia's possible involvement in the election, seeming to reject bipartisan calls for a new special committee to be formed to investigate. He said he intends to \"follow the regular order,\" which is considered Capitol Hill-speak for letting the established committees, like Intelligence and Armed Services, lead hearings or investigations. He said the Intelligence Committee is \"more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter.\u201d Over the weekend, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said that he would like to see a select committee formed with the sole mission of investigating Russia\u2019s actions in the U.S. McCain also joined Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Jack Reed (D-RI) in a statement calling for Democrats and Republicans to work together and across committees to examine Russia\u2019s recent actions. But after McConnell\u2019s press conference Monday, Schumer released a statement saying he supported his participation. \"We welcome Leader McConnell\u2019s support for a deep and thorough bipartisan investigation into reports that Russia interfered with the 2016 election,\" Schumer\u2019s statement read in part. \"This issue should not and must not turn into a political football.\" Following reports over the weekend that the CIA believes Russia did actively seek to help Donald Trump get elected, McConnell would not comment on that allegation specifically, but did say he has the \"highest confidence\" in the intelligence community and the CIA. McConnell pointed to a statement from the U.S. intelligence community, released in October, which publicly accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election, but would not go further. \"That is what the intelligence community believes can be said in unclassified remarks,\" McConnell said. \"Anything else is irresponsible, likely illegal, and potentially for partisan political gain.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "MoneyWatch Dec 12, 2016 8:52 AM EST The GOP recently announced its proposal to eliminate Social Security\u2019s funding gap with large benefit reductions accompanied by tax cuts on affluent retirees, but with no rise in revenue to the system through tax increases. House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Sam Johnson, R-Texas, introduced the Social Security Reform Act of 2016 , a bill that intends to keep the system solvent for 75 years. Currently, Social Security faces a projected 21 percent across-the-board benefit reduction in 2034 if the system isn\u2019t reformed by legislation. The Social Security Office of the Actuary projects that Johnson\u2019s proposal would make the Social Security trust fund fully solvent for 75 years, eliminate the current-law unfunded obligation of $11.4 trillion and produce an increase in the funded status of $11.9 trillion. That\u2019s the net result of: a $2 trillion decrease in revenue to the system by eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits of affluent retirees, and a $13.9 trillion decrease in the total value of benefits paid, primarily due to changing the benefit formula, reining in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for retirees and increasing the normal retirement age (the age at which people can begin drawing their full Social Security benefits) for workers attaining age 62 in 2023 or later. The GOP proposals don\u2019t include any revenue increases to shore up the system. In fact, the proposal overshoots the current funding deficit with net benefit cutbacks of 122 percent of the current deficit in order to fund a tax decrease with a present value of 17.5 percent of the deficit. Where does Donald Trump stand on entitlements? By contrast, earlier this year, the Bipartisan Policy Center presented a package that would close the funding shortfall with a formula of 54 percent more revenue and 46 percent of adjusted benefits. The suggested changes in the GOP proposal are in stark contrast to the last time Social Security was reformed in 1983, when lawmakers approved a package that increased Social Security taxes, changed the benefit formula, subjected a portion of Social Security benefits to federal income taxes and increased the retirement age. At that time, Republican President Ronald Reagan signed the law passed by a Democratic majority in the House and a Republican majority in the Senate. A proposed increase in Social Security\u2019s normal retirement age is often justified by the gains theU.S. has made in life expectancy over the past 50 years. However, emerging research notes that these gains have been accrued mostly by higher-income and higher-educated workers. Therefore, GOP proposals to increase the retirement age will hurt lower-income workers who aren\u2019t living longer. Will Donald Trump keep his word? On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised not to cut Social Security benefits. The $12 trillion-dollar question: Will he keep his word and stand up to his fellow Republican lawmakers? The GOP proposal contains 15 provisions. These are the most significant of those features: Raise the normal retirement age for workers attaining age 62 in 2023, gradually increasing it from the current age of 67 to age 69 for workers attaining age 62 in 2030. Change the formula for calculating benefits for retirees and disabled worker beneficiaries becoming newly eligible in 2023, phasing in changes over 10 years. The changes would slightly increase benefits for below-average earners and slightly decrease benefits for above-average earners, and would also favor workers who have paid into the system for 35 years. In addition, provide minimum benefits for workers who have paid into the system for more than 10 years. Beginning with the December 2018 COLA for current retirees, use the chained-weighted CPI to calculate COLAs and provide no COLA if the retiree\u2019s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is above $85,000 for single tax filers and $170,000 for joint tax filers. Eliminate the earnings test beginning in January 2019. This test reduces benefits for beneficiaries who are younger than Social Security\u2019s normal retirement age (currently age 66), are currently receiving Social Security benefit payments and have income from wages or self-employment that exceed $16,920 per year in 2017. Under current law, the earnings test no longer applies once a retiree attains the normal retirement age. Eliminate federal income taxation of Social Security retirement and disability benefits in 2054 and later, phased in from 2045 to 2053. Currently, single tax filers with combined \u201cincome\u201d (adjusted gross income plus nontaxable interest income and one-half of their Social Security benefit) greater than $25,000 may pay income tax on up to 50 percent of their benefits. If combined income as defined above exceeds $34,000, up to 85 percent of the benefits may be taxable. These thresholds are $32,000 and $44,000 for joint tax filers. Provide an option for a worker to forgo a portion of the delayed retirement credit for postponing Social Security benefits beyond normal retirement age and instead receive a lump sum payment. Further developments on this life-or-death issue for millions of working Americans are sure to happen before any changes become law. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: David J. Phillip, AP) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Twitter has reinstated white nationalist Richard Spencer, one month after he and\u00a0others associated with the \"alt-right\" movement were booted from\u00a0the social media service. Spencer \u2014 whose account had been verified by Twitter with a blue check mark prior to the suspension \u2014 celebrated his return with a triumphant\u00a0tweet on Saturday.\u00a0\"I'm back,\" he wrote, posting a GIF of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the\u00a0Terminator movies. Twitter suspends alt-right accounts The return of the public face of a fringe white nationalist movement comes as\u00a0Twitter struggles\u00a0to strike a balance between protecting free speech and curbing abuse. The social media service rarely comments on why\u00a0individual accounts are suspended \u2014 and why some\u00a0are not. \u2014 Richard \uf438 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) December 11, 2016 \"I assume they flip a coin or roll dice,\"\u00a0said Pax Dickinson, who was suspended in November at the same time as Spencer but has not been reinstated. \"It's really the only way to achieve that level of arbitrariness.\" For years, Twitter billed itself as the \"free speech wing of the free speech party.\" But it's been under growing public pressure over its failure to stop hate speech and harassment, including the targeting of\u00a0Ghostbusters\u00a0actress Leslie Jones. Over the summer, Twitter suspended the account of Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos, who was accused of leading the harassment campaign against Jones. Twitter's head of safety, Del Harvey, told USA TODAY last month that Twitter is drawing the line at \"behavior that is intended to silence others.\" The alt right gained prominence during the presidential election for using social media to spread its ideology through\u00a0 racist viral memes \u00a0and anonymous attacks on users\u00a0 from pro-Donald Trump accounts . \"We do not know why Twitter allowed a hate-mongerer like Spencer back on its platform,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, in a statement posted to Twitter. He said his organization\u00a0\"will be monitoring his Twitter activity closely.\" Spencer's personal account as well as\u00a0accounts for his think tank and online magazine were suspended in November during an apparent purge of users associated with the alt right, just as Twitter cracked down on \"hateful conduct.\" Spencer is a white nationalist who coined the term \"alt right\" and cites Nazi propaganda, but his suspension was perplexing to some observers since he was not known for penning overtly racist tweets. Twitter's alt-right purge could backfire The lack of transparency into why Twitter suspended the\u00a0accounts in question fueled perception in some quarters that Twitter was arbitrarily stifling speech. Twitter said Monday that Spencer\u00a0was suspended on a technicality: for having multiple accounts with overlapping uses. Twitter bans that\u00a0practice to keep harassment in check. \"When we temporarily suspend multiple accounts for this violation, the account owner can designate one account for reinstatement,\" Twitter said in a statement. In a tweet Saturday, Spencer said he was working on getting his other accounts reinstated, too. Dickinson says he\u00a0appealed his suspension but, unlike Spencer, was told that his account would not be reinstated because it had violated\u00a0rules against \"participating in targeted abuse.\" \"My further requests asking for more details were not replied to,\" said Dickinson, founder and chief technology officer of Wesearchr.com. Defining alt-right is tricky in the wake of Trump's victory Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers, members of the \"alt right\" movement, were suspended at the same time as Spencer. Since then, Town and Rivers have been reinstated, Vaughn has not. The suspensions have led some, including Dickinson, to decamp to Gab, a start-up\u00a0social media service with fewer restrictions that's popular with Trump supporters. \"Gab is fine but at this point it's not really a full substitute, especially for someone running and marketing a start-up,\" Dickinson\u00a0said.

Rob Sherman was known as the \"atheist activist\" from Buffalo Grove , where he lived for many years. Whether it was the city of Zion or Waukegan , or challenging the state's Silent Reflection and Student Prayer Act of 2007, he was unafraid to file suit when he thought government had crossed the line... (Frank Abderholden) On Saturday morning, a passer-by spotted the wreckage of Sherman's plane in a field in rural Marengo. McHenry County authorities were unable to positively identify the remains until Monday. Sherman, who just this fall ran as the Green Party candidate for Illinois' 5th Congressional District, was 63. Sherman's plane \u2014 a fixed-wing, light sport aircraft of a type the National Transportation Safety Board once sought to ground amid safety concerns \u2014 is sold both ready-to-fly and in kits for home builders. Authorities said Sherman's plane, Zenair Zodiac CH-601 XL, was manufactured, despite an earlier report that it was home-built. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash and a preliminary report is expected by next week. Between 2006 and April 2009, there were six instances, four in the United States and two in Europe, in which a Zodiac CH-601 XL broke apart in midair, killing a total of 10 people, according to NTSB news releases from 2009. A\u00a0pilot, the sole occupant, died in a single-engine plane crash discovered early on Dec. 10, 2016,\u00a0in Marengo. (Joe Shuman / for the Chicago Tribune) The rash of fatal incidents led the NTSB to issue an \"urgent safety recommendation\" to the Federal Aviation Administration , asking the agency to ground the style of plane until the flight control issue was resolved. The FAA determined that it lacked \"adequate justification to take immediate certificate action to ground the entire fleet,\" according to the NTSB. After another fatal incident in 2009, the FAA issued a bulletin strongly recommending that all owners and operators of Zodiac CH-601XL and CH-650 aircraft comply with a safety directive from the manufacturer. The directive involved making structural modifications to the airplane and adding counterbalances to address suspected aerodynamic flutter. Manufactured planes that didn't get the safety fix were effectively prohibited from flight. Several friends and associates spoke of Sherman's enthusiasm for aviation. At Poplar Grove Airport, about 17 miles from where the plane went down, Sherman operated a \"builder assist center,\" called Rob Sherman Airplanes, where he offered use of his builder facilities and tools to those interested in building Zenith Aircraft Co. kits in exchange for a \"modest fee,\" according to his website. Sherman was active on an Experimental Aircraft Association's local chapter board and had worked with Young Eagles programs for youth interested in aviation. \"The interesting thing is that for him to be such a (well-known) activist politically and in atheism, I never knew about that,\" said Bob Meyers, a fellow EAA board member. \"He never discussed any of that. \u2026 He was a passionate aviator and that seemed to be another area of his life.\" Indeed, for decades, Sherman was mainly known for his political activism, mainly through legal challenges against school districts, libraries and other public institutions. David Silverman, president of American Atheists Inc., said the movement has lost an asset, and the country has lost a fighter for good. Sherman was a past state director and board member of the group. \"I've known Rob for all my 20 years as an activist. He was a proud fighter for religious freedom and the separation of church and state. He was a great activist and a great person,\" Silverman said in an email. \"I've flown with him in that very plane when he gave me a tour of Chicago. He loved that plane and loved flying it.\" Sherman ran for Congress for the Green Party on a platform appealing to secular voters, vowing to eliminate the words \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance and remove \"In God We Trust\" from U.S. currency. In a photo on his website, in an example of his often witty approach to issues, Sherman is pictured next to Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and is wearing an airbrushed T-shirt with his likeness on a penny inscribed \"In Rob We Trust.\" George Milkowski, 50th Ward committeeman for the Illinois Green Party, said Sherman will be remembered as an \"intensely passionate person who was not afraid\" to speak his mind. Sherman, who once described himself as \"175 pounds of walking, talking disbelief\" in a 1993 Chicago Tribune interview, was regarded as \"famous or infamous\" depending on people's viewpoints, Milkowski said. \"I think a lot of people felt his belief, or I should say lack of belief, really pushed him forward,\" Milkowski said. The office supply dealer turned atheist advocate sparked controversy in 1987 when he challenged the city of Zion over its seal, which contained Christian symbols of a cross, dove and crown and a banner reading \"God Reigns.\" Sherman assisted Clint Harris, a Zion resident and fellow atheist, with the litigation, which later involved Rolling Meadows as well. His exploits and bumper-sticker candor earned him appearances on numerous talk shows including \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" In 1992, the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed the lower court ruling to stand, and the towns were ordered to drop the religious symbols. Twenty-four years after the original suit, in 2011, the matter was brought back before a federal judge when Sherman and Harris claimed a city commissioner had paid for a newspaper ad using the old seal. Sherman's children were no strangers to his advocacy efforts and legal ventures. In 1997, Sherman's son Richard, who was 15 at the time, sued the Boy Scouts of America for denying him membership because he refused to pledge allegiance to God. The following year, Sherman was convicted of misdemeanor battery after he was accused of slapping his son. The elder Sherman was sentenced to two years of conditional discharge, a form of court supervision that included counseling. In 2007, Sherman and his daughter Dawn, then a 14-year-old freshman at Buffalo Grove High School, sued Township High School District 214 over the state's new law mandating a moment of \"silent prayer or silent reflection\" at the start of classes. Two years later, a federal judge overturned the law when he ruled that it amounted to an unconstitutional endorsement of religion intended to bring prayer into public schools. That victory for the Shermans was short-lived, however. A federal appeals court eventually revived the matter, opining that there is no harm in silence, which could be implemented for a practical purpose in calming students at the start of classes. Cooper, the District 214 board member, recalled that Sherman had talked about being born and raised in the Jewish faith and could speak some Yiddish. According to his website, Sherman also hosted a morning drive talk show on WJJG-1530 AM where topics ranged from politics to religion to pop culture. He chronicled every show on his website. In a 1986 Tribune profile of Sherman, he said, \"Life is getting involved.\" He complained that he was frequently called a Communist, when he considered himself a \"Constitution-thumping\" capitalist. Though his own son and daughter supported his causes when they were young, he conceded that even some of his own family members were not comfortable with his public battles, asking him to leave them out of it, saying he insulted their Jewish heritage. To protect his family, he kept an elaborate security system in his home and car. He said he evolved to his adult skepticism over years during adolescence, which he spent in the Highland Park area. Around 1970, he said, at the behest of his parents he spent much of a year in the psychiatric wards of two hospitals, which he blamed on his atheist beliefs. Ultimately, though, despite conceding it made him a \"social pariah,\" he stuck to his conclusion that God is \"make-believe.\" Freelance reporter Amanda Marrazzo contributed. ",

Monk was one of the lead plaintiffs in the $1 billion settlement with the NFL over brain injuries among former players. Doug Mills/AP hide caption toggle caption Doug Mills/AP Minnesota Vikings players bring down Washington wide receiver Art Monk during an NFL game in 1992. Monk was one of the lead plaintiffs in the $1 billion settlement with the NFL over brain injuries among former players. Doug Mills/AP The U.S. Supreme Court says it will not consider a challenge to the terms of a concussion-related settlement between the National Football League and more than 20,000 retired players. The deal settled a class-action filed by former players who accused the NFL of covering up what it knew about the link between playing professional football and the degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The settlement was given final approval by a judge in 2015. But the deal was later challenged by a small group of dissenting players who argued that it \"unfairly favored currently injured retirees and left thousands of former players who have not yet been diagnosed with neurological diseases without any recourse,\" NPR's Nina Totenberg reported. NFL Report: Concussion Diagnoses Increased 32 Percent Attorneys for those players also questioned whether the settlement should be renegotiated in light of comments made by the NFL's executive vice president for health and safety, who acknowledged during congressional testimony earlier this year that there is a connection between football and CTE, as The Two-Way reported . But a federal appeals court found the admission did not invalidate the deal, under which the NFL did not admit wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court upheld the lower court's decision. Now, with the final legal challenge over, payouts to individual players can begin. The settlement will pay medical and other benefits to players who suffered concussions and related injuries and could cost the NFL up to $1 billion over 65 years depending on how much the league ends up paying to each of the more than 20,000 former players covered, as we have reported . Article continues after sponsorship \u2014 Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 12, 2016 The Associated Press reported that the NFL estimates 6,000 former players, or nearly one-third, \"could develop Alzheimer's disease or moderate dementia,\" and that the average payout would be about $190,000. Here's our previously reported breakdown of the maximum financial awards related to different brain injuries diagnosed in former players. Level 1.5 neurocognitive impairment: $1.5 million Level 2 neurocognitive impairment: $3 million Parkinson's disease: $3.5 million Death with CTE: $4 million ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease): $5 million In an information page about the settlement , \"level 1.5 neurocognitive impairment\" is described as \"early dementia [with] moderate to severe cognitive decline.\" Level 2 is described as \"moderate dementia [with] severe cognitive decline.\" One of the lead plaintiffs in the class-action against the NFL was Kevin Turner , who died earlier this year at age 46. Turner played for both the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots; he was diagnosed with ALS six years before he died. Former NFL fullback Kevin Turner leaves a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging in 2014. He died earlier this year from severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

He died earlier this year from severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Win McNamee/Getty Images But that diagnosis was incorrect, according to researchers at Boston University. In November, the Boston Globe reported that \"Turner spent his excruciating final years stricken with a severe case of football-related chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, which caused a motor neuron disease similar to ALS.\" CTE can be diagnosed only through a brain autopsy after a person has died. In recent seasons, the NFL has changed some rules that it hoped would reduce the number and severity of helmet-to-helmet collisions, but as we reported , an NFL report released in January found the number of concussions last year was 32 percent higher than in the previous year.

    "text": "Another Pipeline Project Sparks Protests in US Heartland By Morgan Winsor Dec 12, 2016, 5:48 PM ET 0 Shares Star Tony Dejak/AP Photo Signs are posted on Jon Strong's property where a planned natural gas pipeline is scheduled to be built soon, Dec. 5, 2016, in Guilford Township near Wadsworth, Ohio. 0 Shares Email Medina County, Ohio, is more than a thousand miles from Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, where Native Americans, environmental activists and their allies have been protesting the Dakota Access pipeline project. But officials and residents of Medina and neighboring Summit counties in northeast Ohio are also taking a stand against the planned route of a new pipeline that they say would pose a safety risk to their communities. The 255-mile NEXUS pipeline would carry natural gas from Appalachia across northern Ohio and into Michigan and Canada. A NEXUS spokesman told ABC News that the pipeline has already been rerouted numerous times to accommodate landowners and that it is safe and will bring substantial economic benefits to the area. But some in the area say the pipeline would run too close to homes, schools and businesses in heavily populated areas. \u201cWe\u2019re not against pipelines; we\u2019re not against fossil fuels,\u201d Medina County landowner Jon Strong said in a Dec. 1 interview with WAKR radio station in Akron, Ohio. \u201cBut we can be considerate where we run the route.\u201d \u201cGo south, avoid the heavily populated areas and communities of Summit and Medina County and respect human life,\u201d he continued. Protesters against the pipeline route in Ohio are urging residents to sign petitions and attend demonstrations such as a protest organized by Sustainable Medina County over the weekend in the city of Medina. \"Residents of Medina are seriously concerned and want to stop this pipeline from being built because the pipeline, as well as the compressor station, will contaminate our water, our air and our soil,\" Sustainable Medina County spokeswoman Kathie Jones told ABC News in a statement. \"This is not acceptable to the residents of Medina County and never will be, and we will continue to fight the construction of this pipeline.\" Jones said supporters of Sustainable Medina County are refusing to allow surveyors onto their properties or to enter into easement agreements with NEXUS. The NEXUS Gas Transmission project is a partnership between Houston-based Spectra Energy and Detroit\u2019s DTE Energy , with construction expected to begin early next year. NEXUS spokesman Adam Parker said the company has spent more than two years developing a \"balanced plan\" for the pipeline route, with construction techniques and measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate any impact on residents and businesses. The route plans have changed hundreds of times, according to Parker. \"NEXUS has been evaluating proposed routes, design and construction methods and potential impacts on community members and the environment since August 2014,\" Parker said in a statement to ABC News. \"During project planning, NEXUS incorporated many route alternatives and variations into its original route. In total, NEXUS adopted 239 route changes totaling about 231 miles (91 percent of the pipeline route) for various reasons, including landowner requests, avoidance of sensitive resources, or engineering considerations.\" Parker added that the pipeline will generate estimated cumulative tax revenue of $412 million in its first five years of operation. About $125 million of that revenue will go directly to local school districts in Ohio and Michigan, he said. But officials in the city of Green in southern Summit County said the proposed pipeline route is \"unacceptable\" because it would be near neighborhoods, schools and city parks. \"The City of Green will not be signing any easements until required by law and the City has not authorized surveying of city-owned property,\" Green spokeswoman Valerie Wolford told ABC News in a statement. Wolford told The Associated Press that residents are worried about the danger of a natural gas explosion. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have to think about,\u201d Wolford said. \"You have to prepare for the worst.\" Construction of the pipeline is expected to begin once NEXUS clears its last regulatory hurdle of receiving a certificate of public convenience and necessity, expected in the first quarter of 2017. The company must also conduct surveys along the proposed route and pay property owners to bury the line on their land. Parker, the NEXUS spokesman, told ABC News that surveys have been completed for about 95 percent of the project area. \"NEXUS will continue to work with landowners, as we have over the past 2 years, to resolve any outstanding matters,\" he said. Strong, an organizer of the Coalition to Reroute NEXUS, said he won\u2019t let surveyors onto his property and won\u2019t sell NEXUS an easement without a fight. \u201cI will stand my ground, as everyone else is standing, until all of our resources and options are exhausted,\u201d he said.

Romney McDaniel is a niece of Mitt Romney , the former Republican nominee who was in the running to be Trump's secretary of state. Trump's support will almost surely clear the path for Romney McDaniel, but she still has to run for the position. A decision will be made by the RNC's 168-member executive committee in January. Romney McDaniel was long-favored for the position, with sources telling ABC News that she engendered strong support among her fellow RNC members and was a favorite of RNC Chair Reince Priebus , who has been tapped to be Trump's chief of staff. Romney McDaniel appeared at Trump's rally on Friday in Grand Rapids, Mich. She became a public backer of Trump's after he won the Michigan primary , urging Michigan Republicans to unite around him after he clinched the Republican nomination. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "US Defense Secretary in Israel as Country Gets F-35 Jets By robert burns, ap national security writer NEVATIM AIR FORCE BASE, Israel \u0097 Dec 12, 2016, 1:41 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter speaks to Iraqi and U.S. soldiers at the Qayara air base, that serves as a staging point for the Mosul battle, south of Mosul, Iraq, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2016. Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have killed or gravely wounded more than 2,000 Islamic State fighters in the battle for Mosul since October, Carter said Sunday. Recapturing the city, Iraq\u2019s second-largest, is crucial to the Iraqis' hopes of restoring their sovereignty, although political stability will likely remain a challenge afterward. (AP Photo/Hadi Mizban) 0 Shares Email The vanguard of Israel's new fleet of F-35 fighter jets roared onto the Nevatim air base Monday, ushering in a new era for Israeli air power and sharpening its military edge in a volatile Mideast. The arrival of Israel's first two F-35 stealth aircraft also highlighted the Obama administration's commitment to providing its ally with the latest U.S. military advances. An elaborate ceremony at Nevatim in southern Israel was delayed several hours because poor weather kept the F-35s from taking off from Italy for the flight to Israel. In attendance were U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking shortly before the planes landed, Netanyahu thanked Carter and President Barack Obama . \"We value this commitment to the alliance with Israel,\" he said. Netanyahu issued a warning to Israel's enemies. \"I want to also say clearly, anyone who thinks to attack us will be attacked, anyone who thinks to destroy us is positioning themselves to an existential threat. That is a vital condition to ensure our future. History teaches us a simple thing: weak states don't survive,\" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. Carter said the U.S. \"is more committed to Israeli security than ever before,\" and the F-35s are evidence of that. \"From its stealth technology to its fighter capabilities, the F-35 will allow pilots to evade detection and fly at supersonic speeds while conducting air defense; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; or ground attack missions,\" Carter said. The F-35 is considered to be the world's most sophisticated new warplane, equipped with stealth capabilities that allow it to evade or delay detection by the top radar systems. Israeli officials believe the plane will give them an advantage over their neighbors for years to come. They are committed to buying 50 of them. Earlier, the deputy commander of the Nevatim Air Force base in southern Israel said the new fighters will give Israel an upper hand over its neighbors for years to come. \"We are going to be very strong for a long time, having these airplanes. And Israel has to be strong in this region for its existence,\" said Col. Asaf, who could be identified only by his first name in line with military regulations. \"It's a message for everybody that Israel will keep on holding the high-end technology in this area.\" The purchase of the F-35 elevates the entire Israeli air force to a higher level, the colonel said, adding that four Israeli pilots have been trained to fly the planes and that more will be shown how to use them. \"This specific airplane is going to be a very good one for the next decades,\" he said. In recent years, Israel has reportedly carried out long-range airstrikes as far away as Sudan, and is believed to have struck Hezbollah-bound weapons shipments in neighboring Syria. Israel has also hinted in the past at making plans to strike Iran, some 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) away, if the Islamic Republic presses forward with its nuclear program. The threat of Israeli action in Iran has dropped since last year's nuclear accord. The Pentagon's F-35 program has been criticized by members of the U.S. Congress over testing problems, delays and cost overruns. International buyers include Britain, South Korea , Israel, Italy, Australia, Canada, Turkey and Japan. While the planes were stuck in Italy, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lashed out against the program. \"The F-35 program and cost is out of control,\" he tweeted. \"Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\" Jeff Babione, the executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program at Lockheed Martin, defended the cost, saying that as production ramps up the price of an individual jet will fall to $85 million, \"in the 2019 or the 2020 timeframe.\" \"When we get to $85 million dollars, the F-35 will be less expensive than any fourth-generation fighter in the world, and you'll have the premier fifth-generation fighter, so that's an incredible value for anyone operating the airplane,\" he told reporters at the base. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Nebi Qena at Nevatim Air Force Base, Israel, and Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Christine Pelosi, Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2019s daughter, who serves as an elector from California, spearheaded drafting the letter and referred to the request as a \u201cday pass\u201d so that electors could be fully read-in before they cast their votes next week. Nine of the ten signatories come from states that Hillary Clinton won, though Pelosi said the news media should \u201cstay tuned\u201d for additional backers. \"We further emphasize Alexander Hamilton\u2019s assertion in Federalist Paper #68 that a core purpose of the Electoral College was to prevent a 'desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.' The United States intelligence community has now concluded with 'high confidence' that a foreign power, namely Russia, acted covertly to interfere in the presidential campaign with the intent of promoting Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy,\" the letter states. \"The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,\" it reads. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta released a statement today saying that the letter \"raises very grave issues\" about the election. Christine Pelosi told ABC News that the information would be helpful for members of Congress ahead of cabinet confirmation hearings. \"Was this all just happenstance, happening around Donald Trump without any of his agents encouraging it, other than the statements he himself made, or whether there is in fact more information?\" she told ABC News. Podesta stressed that the intelligence community had made it known that they were \"confident\" that the Russian government played a role in the hacking as early as Oct. 7 but \"this matter did not receive the attention it deserved.\" \"We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American,\" Podesta wrote in the statement obtained by ABC News. \"Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy.\" Electoral College expert George C. Edwards III, a political science professor at Texas A&M; University, told ABC News that Podesta's public call for electors to be briefed is \"certainly not typical, that's for sure.\" \"The further action would be for electors to become faithless,\" Edwards said, meaning that the electors wouldn't vote for the candidate who won their state, as they are bound to do by state laws. Bev Hollingworth, a retired hotel owner and New Hampshire state elector who also signed the letter, said that she believed her role as an elector was \u201cnot just a ceremonial thing.\u201d \u201cThere is also a constitutional duty that we have to carry out and that is why I signed onto this letter,\u201d she added. \u201cI think this goes beyond politics. ... It should put us on guard for future elections.\" Hollingworth said she was also alarmed by President-elect Trump\u2019s favored pick for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2019s perceived close ties to Russia. She said the connection deserved \u201cserious consideration.\u201d \u201cI am overwhelmed in what has transpired in the last day or so and what I have read about that connection,\u201d she said. 0 Shares ",

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said, \"On November 17, 2016 you told the Committee during an open hearing that the IC (Intelligence Community) lacked strong evidence connecting Russian government Cyber-attacks and Wikileaks disclosures.\" In response to a question from ranking Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, Clapper had said, \u201cAs far as the WikiLeaks connection, the evidence there is not as strong and we don't have good insight into the sequencing of the releases or when the data may have been provided. We don't have as good insight into that.\u201d The Nunes letter continued, \u201cAccording to new press reports, this is no longer the CIA\u2019s position\u2026I was dismayed that we did not learn earlier, from you directly about the reported conflicting assessments and the CIA\u2019s reported revision of information previously conveyed to this Committee.\u201d Nunes is requesting a briefing from the CIA and FBI on the current assessment of alleged Russian involvement related to the U.S. election no later than Dec. 16. The Washington Post reported Friday that the CIA concluded in a secret assessment that Russia interfered in the race to boost Trump, not just undermine confidence in the system. Intelligence agencies reportedly found individuals connected to the Russian government gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, as well as from Hillary Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta \u2013 though the agencies did not have \u201cspecific intelligence\u201d showing Kremlin officials directed the activity. Trump has challenged the report, calling the assessment \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u00a0 Some Republican senators, though, have sought a bipartisan congressional probe to investigate further. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., endorsed those calls Monday morning, saying: \u201cThe Russians are not our friends.\u201d\u00a0 In a statement earlier Monday, Nunes said his committee will \u201cclosely oversee the production \u00a0of the report on these attacks requested by President Obama to ensure its analytical integrity\u201d \u2013 but he does \u201cnot see any benefit in opening further investigations, which would duplicate current committee oversight efforts and Intelligence Community inquiries.\u201d The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Trump and his allies for calling the intelligence community\u2019s work into question.\u00a0 \u201cEvery day the President-elect and his team continue to denigrate the work of the intelligence community, to the detriment of the agencies' important work and the success of his own presidency,\u201d he said in a statement.\u00a0 Fox News sent the letter to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and will update when a response is available.\u00a0 Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C. She covers intelligence, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security. Herridge joined FNC in 1996 as a London-based correspondent. Advertisement ",

    "text": "advertisement Victoria's Secret has been left red-faced after turning its cheek on one of its customers. The incident occurred on December 7th at a mall in Oxford, Alabama, when a store manager asked Kimberly Houzah, who is African American, to leave the store. \"I just need y'all to go,\" the manager is heard on a Facebook Live video telling Houzah and another black woman after a different black woman was allegedly caught shoplifting. None of the dozen or so white shoppers were asked to leave, Houzah said. Once the scandal emerged, Victoria's Secret apologized and quickly fired the employee \u2014 but not before Houzah's Facebook Live video had racked up over a million views. \"I already didn't need to be spending the money, but I'm like you know what, I'm going to treat myself,\" said Houzah, a 27-year-old nurse, in the video as she tearfully exited the mall. \"Why I gotta be put out just because I'm black in Victoria's Secret... and we just happened to be in the store at the same time.\" The company said it had reached out to Houzah and apologized for the incident. \"What happened at our store should not have happened and does not represent who we are or what we stand for,\" wrote Victoria's Secret in a statement posted on Facebook the next day. \"Victoria's Secret is adamant that all customers regardless of race be treated with dignity and respect at all times.\" The employee involved no longer worked for the company, the statement added. Houzah couldn't immediately be reached for comment. She returned on December 8th to the mall with 20 other supporters and received an apology from the store manager as security guards and plain-clothed policemen watched, according to The Anniston Star . The Quintard Mall directed requests for comment to Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret. Houzah said her goal was to be treated fairly. \"I don't want anything bad to happen to anyone,\" said Houzah in a followup message posted online. \"I'm an African-American female and I just want to be treated like everybody else.\" Ben Popken ",

Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. hide caption toggle caption Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and John Podesta arrive for a portrait unveiling ceremony for retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., last week. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc. Amid news of possible Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, a top Hillary Clinton adviser is publicly casting support for a push by some members of the Electoral College to receive an intelligence briefing ahead of their formal vote next week. \"The bipartisan electors' letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,\" Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said in statement Monday. \"Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed.\" CIA Concludes Russian Interference Aimed To Elect Trump It's the losing Democratic nominee's most public show of support yet for efforts to question the legitimacy of election results that gave Donald Trump the presidency. And it follows news over the weekend that the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the election to help the Republican win. The letter comes from 10 mostly Democratic electors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine and New Hampshire Rep.-elect Carol Shea-Porter. Only one signatory is a Republican, Texan Chris Suprun, who has already said he is refusing to vote for Trump despite his state's results. The electors point to the recent news about Russian involvement and argue that it's their role to best discharge their duties to \"prevent a 'desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils,'\" as Alexander Hamilton outlined in The Federalist Papers #68. Trump is challenging one of the Colorado electors, who signed the letter, in court. He's claiming that if the court overturns a state law binding electors to the statewide winner, it would undermine his election. Though Colorado did vote for Clinton, some electors are hoping it could be used to overturn other state laws where Trump did win. Article continues after sponsorship Contrary To Trump's Tweet, Russian Hacking Came Up Before Election (A Lot) In his statement of support for the electors' push, Podesta also claims that despite the Clinton's campaign's \"protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign,\" even though the issue was discussed many times by both candidates and reporters. \"We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American,\" Podesta continued. \"Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. This is not a partisan issue and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia's role. We believe that the Administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia's interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia's roles in the election and to make this data available to the public.\" Clinton's campaign also supported recount efforts in key Midwest states, like Wisconsin and Michigan, initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein, though the Democrats were skeptical they would alter the results. Trump and his aides have pushed back against reports of any Russian interference in last month's election, and the president-elect himself cast doubt on the accuracy of the CIA's intelligence. Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, reportedly under consideration for Trump's deputy secretary of state, questioned whether the reports were a \" false flag \" perpetrated by the Obama administration. McConnell, Differing With Trump, Says He Has 'Highest Confidence' In Intel Agencies But GOP congressional leaders are supporting an investigation into whether Russia did interfere. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he has the \"highest confidence\" in U.S. intelligence agencies. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also said in a statement that Congress \"must condemn and push back forcefully against any state-sponsored cyberattacks on our democratic process.\" Democratic congressional leaders have been far more direct in their criticism and accusations. Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blamed FBI Director James Comey's letter in the final weeks of the campaign for reigniting controversy around Clinton's private email server and costing her the election. And yet, Reid noted, Comey did not release more information about possible Russian involvement in the election. \"It's obvious he was a partisan in all this,\" Reid told CNN about Comey. \"There's information out there. He had it, I'm confident. And he ignored it.\" ",

Time A destroyed statue outside the damaged Palmyra Museum, in Palmyra city, central Syria in March. (Photo: AP) 41 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 41 COMMENTEMAILMORE The Islamic State's recapture of the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra on Sunday casts a new light on the destruction of treasured artifacts by extremist groups in both Syria and Iraq. Here is a quick explanation of why the Islamic State and other\u00a0militants\u00a0plunder such archeological icons. Extremists view\u00a0cultural treasures as offensive\u00a0 In Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, archaeologists estimate that many treasures have been damaged beyond repair, including 12 conical domes, 15 shrines and 31 priceless altars. Last year,\u00a0militants took sledgehammers to 2,000-year-old stone statues at the\u00a0Mosul Museum\u00a0and burned books and treasured manuscripts at the Mosul library. They\u00a0posted the destruction\u00a0in Internet videos and photos. The icons reportedly included collections of books from the Ottoman Empire, Iraqi newspapers from the early 20th\u00a0century\u00a0and other ancient texts, according to the Associated Press. Mosul treasures survived millennia, only to be destroyed by ISIL The reasoning? The Islamic State\u00a0said the books promote \"infidelity\" and \"call for disobeying Allah.\" \"They do it because they want to cultivate their reputation as ultra-pious Muslims, faithful to the Quran\u00a0\u2014 condemning idols is almost a leitmotiv. But it has a double bonus for the extremists, because it allows them to thumb their noses at the West and to all those who love art for art's sake,\" French historian Fran\u00e7ois Boespflug, a former Catholic priest, told the AFP last month . In 2001, the Taliban destroyed sandstone statues of Buddha with dynamite because of its harsh interpretation of Islam, which forbids historical objects that represent living things. The Taliban issued an edict that year in Afghanistan to destroy all un-Islamic statues,\u00a0which meant\u00a0all idolatrous images of humans and animals. Global demand\u00a0for stolen artifacts\u00a0 The Islamic State has\u00a0earned millions of dollars from the sale of antiquities looted throughout Syria and Iraq\u00a0by establishing an elaborate system to smuggle and sell the goods. In March, countless antiquities were\u00a0already on the market, which\u00a0has proved difficult to curb. Criminal cases are hard\u00a0to prosecute without evidence that\u00a0a dealer or broker knew an item had been\u00a0pilfered. ",

Kate Upton, above, starred in several commercials for \u0080\u009cGame of War, which eventually tries to get players to pay to advance. (Machine Zone) Veronica Rocha After stealing $4.8 million from his employers, Kevin Lee Co went a spending spree and bought everything from season tickets for the Sacramento Kings to plastic surgery. But his oddest expenditure was on the addictive smartphone game\u00a0\u201cGame of War.\u201d According to federal prosecutors, Co spent a lion\u2019s share of the embezzled funds \u2013 approximately $1 million \u2013 on the game. On Thursday, 45-year-old Rocklin, Calif., resident pleaded guilty to money laundering and wire fraud after he was accused of embezzling funds from his employer, Holt of California. Co\u00a0served as controller and was responsible for the construction equipment company\u2019s accounting department, according to plea agreement filed U.S. District Court. He was supposed to use the company\u2019s credit card to pay for operating expenses. Instead, he used the card to purchase luxury cars, a golf club membership, furniture for his home, surgery, season basketball tickets, season seats for the San Francisco 49ers and gaming purchases. According to Cracked , \u201cGame of War\u201d hooks players\u00a0by allowing them to play free for a few minutes and allowing them to progress. But eventually, players must start paying to play to beat others playing for free. One player, who dropped $9,000 on the game, wrote about his obsession. People spend an average of $87 on \"free-to-play\" mobile games, according to Slice Intelligence, a company that measures online sales. \"Game of War\" players, however, spent on average $550, the most of any mobile game, the company said. Co falsified records and \u201ctook steps to hide\u201d his charges, according to the federal court document. He was fired in April 2015. Federal prosecutors said\u00a0Co\u2019s scheme began around May 2008. According to the plea agreement, Co must now repay all of the stolen funds. He faces up to 20 years in prison for each charge.

USA TODAY NETWORK The new Trump International Washington D.C. hotel is located in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion. (Photo: USA TODAY) President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to testify under oath\u00a0at Trump Tower in January, just weeks before the inauguration, in lawsuits tied to his Washington D.C. hotel. His lawyers\u00a0are battling over special conditions Trump is seeking because of his new position. The deposition is tied to Trump's\u00a0$10 million lawsuit in the District of Columbia against Topo Atrio, the restaurant that was to be run by celebrity\u00a0chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s in the hotel Trump has developed in the Old Post Office building just down the street from the White House. Andr\u00e9s and the company cancelled the deal after Trump\u2019s presidential campaign announcement in June 2015, saying the candidate's rhetoric was \u201cwidely perceived as anti-Hispanic.\u201d Trump sued Andr\u00e9s and another famed chef who made a similar decision, citing breach of their contracts. The parties in the 2015 lawsuit had previously agreed that the upcoming deposition would be held the first week of January in Washington. Last week, however, Trump\u2019s attorney\u2019s emailed the restaurant group saying that\u00a0they disagreed with the length of the deposition \u2014 up to seven hours \u2014 as well as that the questions that could overlap with a previous deposition. Trump's team also objected to the location in Washington. Trump\u2019s attorneys argue the deposition needs to take place at Trump Tower in New York City, for \u201csecurity reasons\" in their request to the opposing lawyers. Monday, Trump's top\u00a0lawyer also cited cost and convenience for the President-elect. President-elect Donald Trump and retired Marine general John Kelly in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Nov. 20, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) While the restaurant group agreed to relocate the deposition in a filing last week, they protested about the time and topic limits. \u201cIt seems dubious that the President-elect cannot be afforded adequate security in the capital of the United States, but Defendants are willing to accommodate that demand,\u201d Andr\u00e9s\u2019 attorneys wrote to D.C. Superior Judge Jennifer A. Di Toro. \u201cDefendants cannot, however, accept Trump LLC\u2019s attempt to hamstring Defendants\u2019 questioning of the man who directed the bringing of this lawsuit.\u201d Given the deposition is just weeks away, the restaurant group asked a D.C. judge for an expedited decision requiring Trump comply with the deposition rules. \u201cWe think the deposition is completely unnecessary. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s any factual dispute that requires the President-elect\u2019s testimony, so we think it\u2019s unneeded,\u201d said Alan Garten, general counsel for Trump and his business interests.\u00a0\u201cSo we asked for there to be some reasonable limits. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, the issues that concern the President-elect are statements he made at the commencement of the campaign. There\u2019s no dispute about them. So we don\u2019t see what a deposition would accomplish.\u201d Trump's courtroom baggage follows him to White House Trump was previously\u00a0deposed this summer in a parallel lawsuit filed against CZ-National, another restaurant group headed by celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian. After failing to convince a judge the videotaped deposition should be sealed, it was released in September to media outlets. The battles over the restaurant at Trump\u2019s luxury D.C. hotel are among several outstanding legal entanglements. He had at least 75 pending on Election Day, civil lawsuits that will not go away after Inauguration Day. Also pending are cases brought by a Republican political consultant who said Trump defamed her; a class-action claiming his presidential campaign broke consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages to people\u2019s cellphones; and a suit by a golf club employee who says she was fired over complaining to her bosses about sexual harassment. Exclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee A U.S. District Court judge in Florida ruled last week that a suit against Trump\u2019s golf course in Jupiter could continue \u2014 despite another attempt by Trump to get it tossed before he takes the oath of office. Trump settled the Trump University lawsuits just days after the election for about $25 million to avoid the public trial that was scheduled to begin at the end of November. On the campaign trail, in recent months, Trump threatened additional lawsuits against journalists and several women who publicly accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances. Trump eased up on those threats in the waning days of the campaign. Some of the open lawsuits create potential conflict of interest for the President-elect, according to legal experts, presidential historians and others interviewed by USA TODAY during a months-long investigation that tracked more than 4,000 lawsuits involving Trump and his companies. Trump\u2019s attorneys have previously said that only a couple dozen of the active cases are significant and that they\u2019ll deal with those as any large company deals with them. Asked Monday if there were other depositions or lawsuit resolutions coming\u00a0before the inauguration, Garten said, \"Not that I know of.\" 4353 CONNECT TWEET 8 LINKEDIN 151 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hr29mI ",

Now abortion rights supporters are suing the state again over a new rule. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images An abortion rights activist holds a sign outside the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year before the court struck down a Texas law placing restrictions on abortions. Now abortion rights supporters are suing the state again over a new rule. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Abortion rights groups filed suit Monday to stop the state of Texas from enacting a rule on Dec. 19 that requires fetal remains to be buried or cremated after miscarriages or abortions. The lawsuit calls the rule \"politically motivated\" and says it aims to shame women. The Texas Department of Health went ahead with the measure despite objections from medical groups. Supporters, however, say its purpose is to provide dignity for \"unborn infants.\" \"What we're saying is, it needs to be humane, and the mother needs to be given the opportunity to have a say and be informed with what's happening,\" says Kristi Hamrick of Americans United for Life. The group has created model legislation intended for other state, similar to the Texas regulation. But the Center for Reproductive Rights says it would be costly to require burials or cremation \u2014 a cost that may be passed on to women \u2014 and would provide no health benefit. \"These regulations are an insult to Texas women, the rule of law and the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared less than six months ago that medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion access are unconstitutional,\" says Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the center. Article continues after sponsorship The Texas regulation is part of a wave of such laws that followed last year's undercover videos targeting Planned Parenthood . The maker of the videos, an anti-abortion activist, accused the women's health organization of unlawfully selling fetal tissue. Ohio Legislature Moves To Ban Abortion As Early As 6 Weeks After Conception The deceptively edited videos sparked congressional hearings and a dozen state investigations. None found any evidence of wrongdoing. But Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine called a news conference to announce something else he had found. \"Fetuses from abortions are being cooked and then put into landfills and mixed in with all other garbage that's out there,\" he said. \"I think it's just wrong.\" By \"cooking,\" he meant sterilized with steam. It turned out there was no legal violation there, either. But it helped spark a different kind of protest against abortion providers \u2014 this time behind clinics, where medical waste is picked up. Mark Harrington, of Created Equal , helps organize these protests. He wants to pressure disposal companies into canceling their contracts, and \"shut down abortion clinics around the country.\" But as long as abortions happen, Harrington supports mandating burial or cremation. He pushed Ohio lawmakers to do that this year. The bill didn't pass, but Harrington thinks it would have had a big impact on women. \"It goes without saying, if she's given the option to cremate or bury she's going to maybe wonder that this isn't just some kind of blob of tissue,\" he says. \"That this actually may be a child and she may choose not to abort.\" ",

Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35 is the most expensive weapons program ever, and is intended to replace four aircraft. James F. Peltz, Samantha Masunaga Memo to Corporate America: Be ready to be Donald Trump \u2019s next target. Defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp. found that out Monday when the president-elect again used Twitter to blast the F-35 fighter-jet program for costs he termed \u201cout of control.\u201d The stock prices of Lockheed Martin, the project\u2019s prime contractor, and of one of its suppliers\u00a0quickly dropped. It was the same scenario that hit Boeing Co. last week when Trump tweeted that the development of new Air Force One jets was too expensive. Never mind that Trump championed building up U.S. defense as part of his presidential bid. The F-35 contractors learned that any company can suddenly find itself on Trump\u2019s bad side, especially those that do business with Uncle Sam. \u201cThe clear message that\u2019s being sent is that the president-elect is going to fight to save taxpayer money at every turn,\u201d said Trump spokesman Jason Miller. \u201cI would expect this to be wide reaching and impact all of government as we look to come up with better deals.\u201d Presidents have leaned on big companies in the past in hopes of enacting change. But what\u2019s happening with Trump is novel, public-relations experts and business analysts said, because he\u2019s using the lightning-fast communication tool of social media to spread his complaints to millions of people, with no prior warning. And he\u2019s yet to take office. \u201cIt\u2019s a PR nightmare for the companies involved because you don\u2019t want the president of the United States shining a spotlight on a practice that the public might find dubious,\u201d said David Shulman, senior economist for the forecasting program at UCLA\u2019s Anderson School of Management. \u201cWhat\u2019s really unprecedented is that he\u2019s not even president yet,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cIf this becomes a weekly event, it\u2019s going to have a negative impact on the business climate\u201d even if Trump correctly points a finger \u201cat the legitimate issue of the high cost of [defense] procurement,\u201d he said. Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands. The aircraft used by President Obama , built by Chicago-based Boeing Co.,\u00a0have\u00a0been... President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Air Force One on Tuesday, criticizing the cost of the iconic 747 jumbo jet that has served as the president's flying White House and projected America's might wherever it lands. The aircraft used by President Obama , built by Chicago-based Boeing Co.,\u00a0have\u00a0been... (W.J. Hennigan) Trump\u2019s habit of identifying companies and programs that displease him has corporate PR departments trying to figure how best to respond, if at all. Companies often settle for an initial \u201cno comment,\u201d then perhaps a carefully worded press release days after being criticized. That might no longer suffice, analysts said. \u201cImagine if he suggests boycotting a company\u2019s products,\u201d Stan Steinreich, president of the public relations firm Steinreich Communications Group, wrote Monday on Fortune.com. \u201cWhat if he casts aspersions about an executive\u2019s comments? \u201cWith Trump as president, corporations are going to have to move with the times and join the social media discussion much more rapidly than they generally have,\u201d Steinreich wrote. Or at least respond in some way quickly, as Lockheed Martin did Monday. Jeff Babione, executive vice president and general manager of the\u00a0F-35 program at Lockheed Martin, said the company and its partners \u201cunderstand the importance of affordability for the F-35 program.\u201d \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,\u201d he said during remarks at Nevatim Air Base in Israel before an F-35 delivery ceremony there. In his tweet, Trump did not identify Lockheed Martin or the other defense firms by name. \u201cThe F-35 program and cost is out of control,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBillions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\u201d Lockheed Martin stock fell $6.42, or 2.5%, to close at $253.11 a share. Northrop Grumman, a big subcontractor on the F-35, fell $6.36, or 2.7%, to $232.07 a share. Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35 is designed to be largely invisible to radar, fly faster than the speed of sound and incorporate advanced sensors, linking data with ships, planes and drones. The new fighter would replace four aircraft, with three design variations to meet the unique requirements of the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy. More than 3,000 planes eventually would be built for the U.S. and 11 other countries. The program has been repeatedly criticized over the years for cost overruns and lengthy delays, though its cost has been declining recently. With a total estimated cost of $379 billion, it is considered the most expensive weapons program ever.\u00a0 Although companies will keep feeling the pressure to respond to Trump, they shouldn\u2019t always feel compelled to answer his complaints directly while remaining neutral and open to discussion, said Eileen Koch, chief executive of the public relations firm EKC PR in Los Angeles. \u201cIf he\u2019s just making a comment, sometimes it\u2019s better not to get into a war of words with him;\u00a0it\u2019s better to take the high road,\u201d Koch said. \u201cYou might be getting a minute of his thoughts and then he\u2019s on to something else.\u201d Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst for the research firm Teal Group, said Trump\u2019s tweets about companies and programs are an appeal to his base. \u201cHe\u2019s got this real contradiction, which is he\u2019s throwing money at defense\u00a0but he\u2019s told his base he\u2019s draining the swamp,\u201d he said. Defense stocks had been on a tear before Monday; the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF, which tracks the industry, was up nearly 12% from just before the election through Friday. \u201cOne of his very top promises is to \u2018rebuild\u2019 the military and everyone\u2019s talking about more money, and the upward trajectory in their share prices reflects that in anticipation,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough to institute reforms and go after very big programs in this kind of upward budget environment.\u201d In the meantime, what should contractors do if they\u2019re called out by Trump on Twitter? \u201cIt\u2019s best not to respond,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election , the Ghost Ship fire has brought scrutiny to warehouses and unconventional living spaces , a massive office, residential and hotel development is being proposed for L.A.'s Arts District , and the Golden Globes nominations are in .

    "text": "Former Bear Rashaan Salaam had 'all' the symptoms of CTE, his brother says Photos of Rashaan Salaam, who was the Bears' first-round pick in the 1995 draft. Des BielerThe Washington Post When news broke last week that former Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam had committed suicide at age 42, some wondered if brain injuries were to blame. Salaam was not given an autopsy, so we won't know if he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), but his brother said that the 1994 Heisman Trophy winner displayed \"all\" the symptoms of the disease. Jabali Alaji told USA Today, in a story published Sunday, that he looked up the effects of CTE in the wake of Salaam's death. Referring to signs such anxiety, depression, apathy and memory loss, Alaji said, \"He had all those symptoms.\" \"When I opened the house [of Salaam], I expected to go into a house of somebody who was on drugs or find alcohol in the trash can,\" Alaji said. \"But when I walked into the house and saw how clean the house was, it shocked me. I went through his trash can. I went through hiding spaces expecting to find pill bottles, or bottles of liquor. None of that was there. He didn't even take Motrin, you know what I mean?\" Salaam was found dead in a Boulder, Colorado, park Monday. Authorities said that \"foul play\" was not suspected and that a note and a gun were found near his body. Alaji said that he spoke with Salaam about an hour before his death and was given no indication that anything was amiss. \"It was a very positive conversation,\" Alaji, an Atlanta-area resident, told USA Today. \"We made plans for the future.\" A look at Rashaan Salaam\u2019s career Former Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam rushed for 2,055 yards his junior season at Colorado. Former Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam rushed for 2,055 yards his junior season at Colorado. See more videos However, Alaji said that he \"would guarantee they'd find\" CTE in his brother's brain if it were studied. Their family's Muslim faith mandated that Salaam be buried quickly after his death, with no desecration of the body. In recent years, former NFL stars such as Junior Seau and Dave Duerson have committed suicide at around the same age as Salaam (43 and 50, respectively). In both cases, they shot themselves in the chest to preserve their brains for study, and both were found to have had CTE. A friend of Salaam's, Riley Hawkins, told the Denver Post that the former first-round pick \"had become more of a recluse\" recently. He added, \"That's when the demons took over.\" According to the Hawkins, Salaam maintained a sense of guilt about not fulfilling his athletic potential. He won the Heisman after rushing for over 2,000 yards in his final season at Colorado, but he lasted just four seasons in the NFL and pointed to partying and marijuana use as partly to blame. But Salaam also suffered his share of injuries while in the NFL, and Alaji said that the back had hidden a fractured elbow during his rookie season with the Bears. \"He was banged up,\" Alaji said, noting that Salaam had undergone over a dozen surgeries. \"He was a running back. Who gets hit more on the field than a running back?\" Whatever was happening with Salaam, it led to him becoming more distant from some who were close to him. \"Over the last five or six years, it was a bit of a journey trying to figure out where he was and what was going on and what direction his life was taking him,\" Chad Brown, a teammate of Salaam's at Colorado, told the Denver Post. \"He was trying to save a few lives,\" said Hawkins, who worked with Salaam at a mentoring program for at-risk youth. \"But he had trouble saving his own.\" ",

Hershey's Chocolate World Chicago on North Michigan Avenue is scheduled to close in January, the company said Dec. 12, 2016. The interactive candy store was Hershey's second outpost outside of Hershey, Pa. (Elise Amendola / AP) Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune There will be one less spot to sate a chocolate craving on the Magnificent Mile next year: Hershey's is closing its Chicago flagship. Hershey's Chocolate World Chicago, just off North Michigan Avenue behind the old Chicago Water Tower, will close in January, Hershey's spokeswoman Anna Lingeris said Monday. The exact date has not been set. When the interactive candy store, where visitors can make a candy mix as a Hershey's \"factory worker\" or have a photo printed on a candy bar wrapper, opened in Chicago in 2005, it was Hershey's second outpost outside its headquarters in Hershey, Pa.. Hershey's is focusing on bigger stores \"that allow for more experiential interactions between our consumers and our beloved and iconic brands,\" Lingeris said in an email. A West Coast flagship that opened in Las Vegas in 2014 is more than 13,000 square feet \u2014 more than three times the size of the Chicago store. Hershey also is moving its Chocolate World store in New York's Times Square to a nearby location that's triple the size late next year. Although there are no plans to relocate in Chicago, Hershey's hasn't ruled out returning, Lingeris said. Hershey's exit will add another empty storefront to the northern stretch of North Michigan Avenue, which had nearly 197,000 square feet of real estate sitting vacant as of July, or about 6 percent of all Michigan Avenue retail space between the Chicago River and Oak Street, according to real estate firm CBRE. That doesn't include stores widely expected to come on the market, such as the Apple Store's space at 679 N. Michigan Ave., which Apple will leave for a new flagship along the Chicago River that is under construction. Loyola University Chicago said the property is being marketed to prospective tenants. ",

Tabulator Claudette Moll, right, from Farmington, looks over a ballot during a statewide presidential election recount Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, West Bend, Wis. (John Ehlke / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Republican Donald Trump 's victory in\u00a0Wisconsin\u00a0has been reaffirmed following a presidential\u00a0recount\u00a0that showed him defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 22,000 votes. Trump picked up a net 162 votes as a result of the\u00a0recount\u00a0that the\u00a0Wisconsin\u00a0Elections Commission certified Monday. Green Party candidate Jill Stein requested and paid for the\u00a0recount\u00a0that began Dec. 1. But after\u00a0recounting\u00a0nearly 3 million ballots, little changed. The final results changed by fewer than 1,800 votes. Stein has also tried to get statewide\u00a0recounts\u00a0in Michigan and Pennsylvania, but courts have stopped them. The federal deadline to certify the vote is Tuesday. Wisconsin's\u00a0recount\u00a0uncovered no widespread problems or hacking as Stein had suggested, without evidence, that there might be.

Kenley Jansen pitches for the Dodgers against the Chicago Cubs during Game 3 of the National League Championship Series on Oct. 18. (Sean M. Haffey / Getty Images) Andy McCullough Contact Reporter On Saturday evening, inside the Santa Barbara Beach & Golf Resort in Curacao, four members of the 2016 Dodgers gathered with their spouses for a photograph. In the center of the shot, wearing a bow-tie, sat Kenley Jansen . To his left was Justin Turner , his collar unbuttoned, with Scott Van Slyke and Yasiel Puig rounding out the group. They had flown to the island to attend Jansen\u2019s wedding, and so they beamed for posterity.\u00a0 Two days later, there would be more to celebrate. The Dodgers completed a significant portion of their off-season shopping on Monday, reaching an agreement to re-sign Jansen, while approaching the final stages of an agreement with Turner, according to people familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because neither contract had been finalized. Jansen spurned a more lucrative offer from the Washington Nationals to stay in Los Angeles with a five-year, $80-million deal. Turner was close to reaching a four-year contract believed to be worth $64 million. When the off-season began, the Dodgers identified a trio of their own players as primary targets in free agency: Jansen, Turner and left-handed Rich Hill . After inking Hill to a three-year, $48-million deal last week, the team debated a variety of trade scenarios and contingencies in case they could not afford the other two. In the end, the Dodgers ponied up the necessary cash, an expected bill of $192 million for the three. \u201cIf you\u2019re always rational about every free agent, you will finish third on every free agent,\u201d president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said last week at baseball\u2019s winter meetings. The statement looked prophetic on Monday. Each contract represents a gamble, and the spending surprised rival executives who predicted an off-season of frugality from the Dodgers as the team attempted to avoid luxury-tax penalties. But the splurge also demonstrated the team\u2019s internal belief in its roster. By effectively getting the band back together for 2017, Friedman\u2019s front office delivered a vote of confidence to a group that finished two victories shy of the World Series in October. Corey Seager ? Julio Urias? Joc Pederson ?\u00a0 The Dodgers have held onto all three, despite plenty of chances to trade them. The Dodgers believe \u2014\u00a0and they are not alone \u2014\u00a0that the best chance for long-term success is to retain their very best prospects and blend them onto the major league roster. ... Corey Seager ? Julio Urias? Joc Pederson ?\u00a0 The Dodgers have held onto all three, despite plenty of chances to trade them. The Dodgers believe \u2014\u00a0and they are not alone \u2014\u00a0that the best chance for long-term success is to retain their very best prospects and blend them onto the major league roster. ... (Bill Shaikin) The Dodgers still seek an upgrade at second base. The team continued discussions with Minnesota about second baseman Brian Dozier and maintained dialogue about a reunion with Chase Utley . Dozier clubbed 42 homers in 2016, posted an .800 on-base plus slugging percentage the last three seasons and is only owed $15 million through 2018. The team also needs a bullpen in front of Jansen, which is one of the reasons the club has engaged with former All-Star closer Greg Holland , who missed last season after undergoing elbow ligament replacement surgery. The presence of Jansen provides security for the team as it searches for the other members of the relief corps. Jansen, 29, will earn the second-largest free-agent contract ever given to a reliever. He finished shy of the $86-million package Aroldis Chapman received from the New York Yankees last week. Jansen can opt out of his contract after the 2019 season, according to a person familiar with the situation. The Dodgers won a bidding war for Jansen that included the Miami Marlins as well as the Nationals. Miami offered a five-year, $80-million deal, according to Yahoo Sports, but rival executives speculated the contract would involve significant deferred money and little no-trade protection. The offer was likely \u201cincredibly back-loaded,\u201d one official said, and would have exposed Jansen to the likelihood of being traded elsewhere. \u00a0\u00a0 Unlike Miami, the Dodgers offered\u00a0stability in addition to financial security. Washington could also provide both components. The Nationals made an offer that was \u201cexceptional and generous and for more money,\u201d according to Jansen\u2019s agent, Adam Katz. \u201cAt the end of the day, Kenley loves Los Angeles, his Dodgers family, the fans here, and although money was a factor, it wasn\u2019t the most important thing,\u201d Katz said. \u00a0 The history of long-term contracts for free-agent relievers is not positive. But Jansen did not become a pitcher until 2009, has no history of arm issues and wields an elite weapon in his cut fastball . During the last three seasons, he ranked fourth among relievers in FanGraphs\u2019 version of wins above replacement. During the playoffs, he demonstrated his willingness to be utilized whenever necessary. Like Jansen, Turner displayed his importance to the club in October. During the season, he hit 27 homers, posted an .832 OPS and played in a career-high 151 games. He established himself as an every-day star and a leader within the clubhouse. His prominence within the organization only grew during his three seasons as a Dodger. Justin Turner hits a home run during Game 3 of the NLCS. Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times Justin Turner hits a home run during Game 3 of the NLCS. Justin Turner hits a home run during Game 3 of the NLCS. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Cut loose by the New York Mets after 2013, Turner agreed to a major-league contract with the Dodgers, the team he rooted for while growing up in Bellflower. But Turner flunked his physical because of an issue with his knee. Concerned about his fragility, the Dodgers countered with a minor-league offer and an invitation to camp. Turner hit his way into a permanent spot on the big-league roster. Turner underwent microfracture surgery on his left knee last winter. He turned 32 last month. But he has reshaped his physique under the tutelage of Dodgers strength and conditioning coach Brandon McDaniel, a process that has improved his dexterity in the field while increasing his power at the plate . He offers right-handed balance for a lineup stocked with left-handed hitters. The off-season has not ended for the Dodgers. But with Monday\u2019s activity, the team fortified its position as one of the Chicago Cubs\u2019 primary challengers for supremacy in 2017. Like those four men in Curacao on Saturday, the club\u2019s fans can smile.\u00a0 ",

Stein pushed for recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, states where Hillary Clinton was thought to have an edge but ended up in Trump's column last month. The Wisconsin Elections Commission certified that the Republican actually picked up 162 votes during the recount, resulting in a more than 22,000 vote victory over Clinton. The final tally changed less than one percent from the original count of the November 8 election. In Pennsylvania, a judge rejected Stein's recount effort, clearing the way for the state to certify Trump's victory there. And last week the Michigan Supreme Court denied Stein's appeal to restart the recount there. Trump beat Clinton by 10,704 votes in the Wolverine State and 44,292 votes in Pennsylvania. Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in the three states where she pushed for recounts. Andrew Rafferty ",

Wade in 1973 0 Shares Email A coalition of national advocacy groups has sued to block Texas ' soon-to-be-implemented rules mandating the burial or cremation of fetal remains. The lawsuit filed Monday by the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights is the latest legal battle in a state whose tough anti-abortion laws were already largely voided this summer by the U.S. Supreme Court . Texas had been set to bar abortion facilities from disposing of fetal remains as biological medical waste beginning Dec. 19. Earlier legal challenges blocked similar measures in Louisiana and Indiana. Advocates call the rules unnecessary and Texas funeral home operators worry about interment and cremation costs. The revisions were first proposed in July, four days after the Supreme Court voided much of a larger Texas abortion law. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The bill\u2019s proposals are common in many states and accepted by many supporters of school choice, like a provision to stop failing charter operators from creating new schools. But Ms. DeVos argued that this kind of oversight would create too much bureaucracy and limit choice. A believer in a freer market than even some free market economists would endorse, Ms. DeVos pushed back on any regulation as too much regulation. Charter schools should be allowed to operate as they wish; parents would judge with their feet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Detroit Public Schools, she argued, should simply be shut down and the system turned over to charters, or the tax dollars given to parents in the form of vouchers to attend private schools. \u201cShe is committed to an ideological stance that is solely about the free market, at the expense of practicality and the basic needs of students in the most destabilized environment in the country,\u201d said Tonya Allen, the president of the Skillman Foundation , a nonprofit that works with Detroit children, and a co-chairwoman of the coalition that produced the report that became the basis for the legislation last spring. \u201cIf she was showing herself present in places and learning from the practitioners, that\u2019s a fine combination,\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cBut Betsy never showed up in Detroit. She was very eager to impose experimentation on students that she has not spent time with and children that she does not have consequence for.\u201d Ms. DeVos has a long career as an education philanthropist and lobbyist, but not as an educator. She and her husband, Dick, an heir to the Amway fortune, are considered the most powerful Republicans in Michigan. In the debate over Detroit schools, Republican lawmakers say, Ms. DeVos withheld her financial support until they agreed to kill the bill. And they were rewarded well when they did: Ms. DeVos\u2019s family began a flood of donations to Republicans that totaled $1.45 million in seven weeks. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed. But her allies say her views have been misinterpreted. \u201cShe\u2019s never said choice and choice alone is the panacea for public education,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, the lobbyist who leads the Great Lakes Education Project , which Ms. DeVos founded to advance charter schools in Michigan in 2001 after her family had spent nearly $5.8 million on a losing initiative to establish statewide school vouchers. \u201cIt\u2019s choice, quality and accountability.\u201d Hers was a different version of choice, quality and accountability, however, than the one envisioned by those who drafted and supported the legislation: a broad coalition of charter school and teachers\u2019 union leaders, the Detroit chamber of commerce and some of the city\u2019s most prominent Republican philanthropists and politicians, its Democratic mayor and the state\u2019s Republican governor. \u201cThe misinformation campaign was horrendous,\u201d said Thomas Stallworth III, a former state legislator who lobbied on behalf of the coalition. And the sway of her contributions was too much to overcome. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could compete with that. We don\u2019t have those kinds of resources.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. DeVos and her husband had lobbied hard for the state law that established charter schools in 1994. It allowed an unusually large number of organizations to start charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. But it created little oversight. Even charter school supporters now criticize Detroit as one of the most unregulated markets in the country. About 80 percent of the state\u2019s charters are operated for profit, far higher than anywhere else. Photo Cody Academy of Public Leadership is a public school in Detroit. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times In 2011, the DeVoses and the Great Lakes project lobbied successfully to lift a cap on the number of charter schools, fighting off a provision that would have blocked failing schools from expanding. In Detroit, which now has a greater proportion of charters than any city but New Orleans, the result was a glut of schools as more charters opened but the city\u2019s population continued to decline. Yet while there are too many seats in schools downtown, there are not enough in the poorest, most remote neighborhoods, where most students live. Traditional and charter schools alike compete with televisions, laptops and bicycles for students \u2014 and the taxpayer dollars that follow them. More than 150 schools have opened or closed in the last seven years, and it is not unusual to find students who change schools every year, and teachers more often than that. With more than a dozen organizations issuing charters, it is hard for parents to get the information they need to inform their choices. And, in a city of 140 square miles, the highest-performing schools usually remain out of reach to the poorest students, because most schools do not offer transportation, and the city bus service is unreliable. Most charters have failed to improve on the dismal performance of the traditional public schools. High-performing national charter networks have stayed away because of the instability of the market. The Walton Foundation, which has committed $1 billion over the next five years to expanding charters and choice, similarly withdrew its money from Detroit earlier this year. The legislation proposed earlier this year by Goeff Hansen, a Republican state senator, would have paid off the debt of the city\u2019s traditional public schools, which were on the brink of bankruptcy, and returned control of those schools from the state to a locally elected school board. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the provision that proved most controversial to the DeVoses would have established a Detroit Education Commission , appointed by the mayor. With three members from charter schools, three from the traditional public schools and one an expert in educational accountability, the commission was to come up with an A-to-F grading system for all schools, and evaluate which neighborhoods in the city most needed schools. School operators that earned below an A or B could not expand without the commission\u2019s signing off on their location. Schools that earned an F three years in a row could be closed. Ms. DeVos and her husband wrote legislators urging them to reject any legislation that included the commission. Why, they argued, should residents have choice in where they shop for food and travel, but not in schools? She wrote a Detroit News op-ed arguing to \u201cretire\u201d Detroit Public Schools and \u201cliberate all students\u201d to use tax dollars to attend public or charter schools of their choice. Leaders of 20 charter schools in Detroit, including some of the highest-performing, made a last-ditch effort to urge the legislature to adopt the commission. \u201cWe have to be looking at every possible way to expand the choices and the opportunities in the neighborhoods for families,\u201d Clark Durant, a onetime Republican candidate for the United States Senate and the co-founder of a network of schools, said at a news conference alongside Mayor Mike Duggan. \u201cAnd I believe this is the beginning of that effort.\u201d The legislation passed the state senate. But in the house of representatives, support fell away, as leaders of the Republican caucus reminded the members of how much financial support the DeVoses could withhold. They warned that the DeVoses would finance primary challenges against Republicans who defied her, as they had done to one who voted against the bill to lift the cap on charter schools five years earlier. The DeVoses, said Representative Dave Pagel, a Republican who supported the commission, \u201cmade arguments that were strongly heard, and they prevailed.\u201d Another Republican, declining to comment for fear of alienating Ms. DeVos when she is poised to become a cabinet secretary, sent a link to an article detailing the DeVos\u2019s financial contributions to Republicans after the vote, saying it explained all there was to explain. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The house passed a bill that never included the language establishing the commission. The bill paid off the debt of Detroit Public Schools and returned the city\u2019s traditional public schools to local control. And it will allow the state to close the schools at the bottom of existing state rankings, which Mr. Naeyaert said was proof that Ms. DeVos supported measures to ensure quality. But that will mean shutting down mostly traditional public schools, which in Detroit serve the neediest students, and further desert students in neighborhoods where charters have largely declined to go. \u201cMy complaint around this is not that you disagree,\u201d said Ms. Allen, at the Skillman Foundation, \u201cbut that you never could come up with another solution to deal with the practical issues of poor public policy that is not only eroding a traditional school system, but eroding all schools.\u201d Noam Scheiber contributed reporting.

The president-elect is just the latest in a long line of critics in both parties who have beat up on the 15-year project, only to see it survive thanks to deep political support across the country. Lockheed has spread work on the F-35 to hundreds of subcontractors in most of the 50 states, and members of Congress typically oppose any cuts that would cost jobs in their states or districts. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is unclear what alternative the president-elect could embrace if the military turns away from the F-35 this late in the jet\u2019s development; the government has spent about $100 billion on the project, and 204 planes have been built. The Pentagon, under Robert M. Gates, the secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011, canceled a different fighter jet, the F-22 , leaving nothing but the F-35 to replace aging fighters used by the Air Force, Navy and Marines. Once in office, Mr. Trump could try to shrink overall costs by trimming back plans to buy more than 2,400 planes. But doing so simply pushes up the price of each jet. And that in turn could provoke diplomatic incidents with American allies who have contracted to add F-35s to their militaries. Higher costs per plane could exceed their budgets, as well. In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s public criticism of the plane may be about sending a warning message to private companies that contract with the military. While Mr. Trump said throughout the campaign that he would rebuild the nation\u2019s military, his Twitter post on Monday signaled to contractors that they should not try to fleece the federal government. The immediate impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on Monday was financial: After it was published, shares of Lockheed Martin had fallen by 4 percent around midday, reducing the company\u2019s market value by about $4 billion, before rebounding somewhat. Lockheed shares ended the day down about 2.5 percent, closing at $253.11 a share. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter just as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was in Israel to welcome the arrival of two F-35s, the first of a new-generation fleet meant to help maintain Israel\u2019s air superiority in the region. Speaking at the ceremony, Mr. Carter described the F-35 as \u201cthe most advanced aircraft in history\u201d and said, \u201cIsrael is our first and only friend in the region that is flying\u201d it. Lockheed Martin\u2019s program manager for the F-35, Jeff A. Babione, who was also in Israel for the planes\u2019 arrival, said, \u201cI certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question the president-elect would have about the program.\u201d Mr. Babione added that Lockheed had invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane. Lockheed said that if the government stuck to plans to increase production, it could reduce the average price for each F-35 by 2020 to $85 million, about the same as less sophisticated fighters cost. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The F-35 was designed as a state-of-the-art aircraft for all of the branches of the United States military, with the goal of overwhelming adversaries with technological superiority. The jet would be able to evade radar and dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles while giving pilots a better picture of enemy threats advancing toward them. But despite initial promises that the all-in-one plane would save taxpayer money, costs have veered sharply higher over 15 years of development. Mr. Trump has not said how he will seize control of the project\u2019s costs, which have risen despite repeated attempts over more than a decade to restrain spending and fix costly mistakes. In an interview on Sunday, and in a speech to supporters in Michigan on Friday, the president-elect accused military officials of failing to negotiate good deals with private-sector contractors because they know they might be hired by the companies after their military service ends. \u201cThe people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cYou know, they make a deal like that, and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal.\u201d Mr. Trump said military officials who were in charge of negotiating multibillion-dollar deals like the F-35 project should be barred for life from employment with the companies that they worked with, though he did not cite any examples involving the fighter plane. That would be an expansion of the president-elect\u2019s proposal that people who work for his administration be barred from lobbying for five years. In a hearing this year, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, demonstrated the dilemma for members of Congress and others who worry about the ballooning cost of the project. He hailed the plane as a needed part of the country\u2019s arsenal even as he criticized the program\u2019s inability to deliver on time and within budget. \u201cThe full capabilities this aircraft will eventually provide are critical to America\u2019s national security,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cBut at the same time, the F-35 program\u2019s record of performance has been both a scandal and a tragedy.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The technology in the F-35 and other weapons systems is increasingly complex, and politics tend to exacerbate the problems. To lock in congressional support, the Pentagon often starts building the weapons before testing is complete. Cutting funding in the middle of programs can increase costs in the long run if it reduces the economies of scale in the manufacturing plants. Pentagon officials said recently that they needed an extra $500 million to finish development of the planes. They have also been wrangling with Lockheed over the price of the latest batch of planes. The F-35 program is also sensitive diplomatically, and as costs per plane increase, the overruns affect the ability of other countries to buy the jets. Israel, for example, has ordered 33 of the stealth fighters at a cost of more than $5.5 billion, to come from the assistance Israel receives from Washington, and the Israeli cabinet decided recently to increase the number of planes to 50. Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, Christopher Drew from New York and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. ",

Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed,\" Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Monday, responding to a request for briefings by a group of electors. Related: CIA Concludes Russia Mounted Operation to Help Trump Win: Source Podesta's strongly worded statement signals a clear shift in strategy from Clinton and her team, who have until now shown no interest in questioning the legitimacy of last month's election. And it could crack the door to further challenges or give succor to some Democrats' long-shot hope that Trump's election could be upended when the Electoral College convenes December 19.

Trump defeated Clinton in the general election by an electoral vote margin of 306-232. Since then, Clinton has pulled ahead of Trump by a popular vote margin of nearly 3 million. Experts say electors' ability to reverse the November 8 results remains virtually impossible, but mainstream Democrats have felt emboldened to raise doubts about the outcome following news this weekend that the CIA formally concluded the Russian government worked covertly not just to disrupt the election, but to help Trump win. Four powerful senators \u2014 two Democrats, two Republicans \u2014 released a statement calling for a joint probe into Russia's actions. \"We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American. Never before in the history of our Republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. This is not a partisan issue and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia's role,\" Podesta said in his statement. Related: McConnell Backs Senate Investigations of Russian Hacking Trump and his campaign have vehemently denied any Russian intervention on their behalf, accusing the intelligence agencies he will soon head of being politicized and misinformed. Some allies, including John Bolton, a potential senior Trump State Department nominee, have even accused the Obama Administration without evidence of hacking the Democratic National Committee and Podesta's personal Gmail account in a \"false flag\" operation. Earlier Monday, a group of 10 Electors, including some well known Democrats and one Republican, sent an open letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, requesting briefings on alleged Russian meddling in the election. \"The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election,\" their letter reads. \"We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States.\" The signatories include Christine Pelosi, a California Democratic strategist and daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, New Hampshire Representative-elect Carol Shea Porter, Washington, D.C. Councilwoman Anita Bonds, along with other respected Democrats, all of whom are members of the Electoral College. The Democratic signatories were joined by Republican Chris Suprun of Texas, who wrote an op-ed explaining why he won't cast his Electoral College vote for Trump. Play ",

Got it At a news conference, Dec. 12, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) slammed Republican lawmakers who \"are reluctant to either review Russian tactics or ignore them.\" \"The Russians are not our friends,\" McConnell told reporters. (The Washington Post) By Karoun Demirjian , Paul Kane and Ed O'Keefe December 12 at 6:18 PM Follow @karoun Follow @pkcapitol Follow @edatpost Republican lawmakers are increasingly at odds with Donald\u00a0Trump across a range of \u00adhigh-profile domestic and national security issues, an early sign that the GOP-led Congress might resist some elements of the \u00adpresident-elect\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox agenda. Although Trump maintains enthusiastic backing in many corners of the party, key members of the Senate and House have been outspoken in challenging his views of Russia and its interference in the U.S. election, warning of potential conflicts of interest arising from Trump\u2019s far-flung business interests if he does not fully divest from his company, and criticizing the tough approach that he has taken to some companies, including his threat to impose a stiff tariff on firms that move jobs overseas. There is also friction over Trump\u2019s consideration of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state \u2014 with GOP advisers warning that a growing number of Republican senators may be unwilling to vote to confirm Tillerson because of his ties to Russia. Trump tweeted Monday evening that he would announce his choice for secretary of state on Tuesday morning. No issue has so clearly divided Trump and top Republicans lawmakers as much as his dismissal of U.S. intelligence agencies that attributed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political targets to Russian operatives. The tensions were exposed over the weekend, as Trump belittled the CIA following a Washington Post report that the agency believed that Moscow favored Trump in the election while several Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), joined with Democrats to call for an investigation into the matter. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cThe Russians are not our friends,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Monday, voicing his support for an inquiry. McConnell stopped short of endorsing a special select committee investigation, as some lawmakers have suggested, but said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is equipped to take on the matter. \u201cThis simply cannot be a partisan issue,\u201d he said. McConnell also appeared to break with Trump in his assessment of the CIA, saying that he has \u201cthe highest confidence\u201d in the intelligence community and that the CIA is \u201cfilled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people.\u201d McConnell, meanwhile, declined to defend Tillerson against accusations that he is too close with Russia, telling reporters that he would not comment on a hypothetical \u201cphantom nominee.\u201d McConnell\u2019s reluctance to engage on Tillerson came after some of his allies on national security issues, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), raised doubts about the ExxonMobil chief\u2019s background. Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013, two years after ExxonMobil won a contract to explore for oil in a Russian-controlled area of the Arctic Ocean. The agreement has been frozen since the United States imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia\u2019s 2014 incursion into Ukraine. Some senior GOP advisers fear that the Tillerson-Putin relationship will make Republicans reluctant to support the nomination. One adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said as many as seven might now be unwilling to vote to confirm him as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. McCain said he would give Tillerson a fair hearing if the oil executive is nominated, but on Monday the senator questioned his judgment for being close to the Russian president. Putin \u201cis a thug and a murderer,\u201d McCain said on CNN, \u201cand I don\u2019t see how anybody could be a friend of this old-time KGB agent.\u201d D.J. Jordan, a spokesman for Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), said Monday that the lawmaker \u201chas a lot of questions about Mr. Tillerson and his ties to Russia,\u201d though he added that Lankford is \u201chopeful that those questions will be addressed in the days ahead.\u201d A big test for Republicans Taken together, the tensions between the president-elect and fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill reflect a major test for how the GOP congressional majorities will handle the unusual circumstances of the Trump era. Republicans, many of whom opposed Trump during the presidential primaries, want to work with him in many areas and avoid alienating his enthusiastic voter base. Yet some in the GOP are also assessing how to fulfill their constitutional duties as a check on a businessman-president who is unaccustomed to the public scrutiny inherent to a democratic system and unconcerned with past traditions of transparency, particularly when it comes to his personal finances. They also must prepare for the potential that Trump, who has effectively harnessed Twitter to skewer his critics, could turn his ire toward them. Democrats, for their part, have little power to investigate Trump or thwart his nominations. In 2013, Democrats \u2014 angered by what they described as years of Republican obstruction \u2014 voted to scrap the rule requiring at least 60 senators to overcome a procedural hurdle and move to a final confirmation vote. Now, all of Trump\u2019s nominees for the executive and judicial branches, with the exception of picks for the Supreme Court, can be confirmed on a simple majority vote. With 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats in that chamber need to win over only a handful of Republicans to block a nominee, though doing so requires a degree of Democratic unity. That could be difficult, with 10 of the party\u2019s senators facing reelection in two years in states that Trump won. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his leadership team have urged senators set to serve as ranking Democrats on top national security, financial and \u00addomestic-policy committees to focus on hiring professional investigators able to quickly dive into the personal and financial backgrounds of Trump\u2019s nominees, according to a senior Democratic aide. The hope is that Democrats will be able to dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s nominees just as Republicans did to some of President Obama\u2019s high-profile nominees in the early days of his administration. The larger drama is likely to take place among congressional Republicans, who will face pressure to help Trump. So far, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) has demonstrated a reluctance to challenge the \u00adpresident-elect on some of the issues that have animated his GOP colleagues. On Monday, Ryan dismissed calls for a probe into Russian meddling in the election, saying the House Intelligence Committee is \u201cworking diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations.\u201d He also appeared to criticize suggestions that Russia favored Trump, saying in a statement that \u201cexploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes national security,\u201d and \u201cwe should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\u201d Ryan also has waved off concerns about Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest related to his global real estate and branding empire. Asked last week by a CNBC interviewer how he hoped the president-elect would handle his business after he takes office, Ryan said, \u201cHowever he wants to.\u201d \u201cThis is not what I\u2019m concerned about in Congress,\u201d he said. Trump had planned a news conference Thursday to reveal how he will handle the business while he is in office, but his transition team said Monday that he will do it next month. Trump has hinted that he will retain an ownership stake while putting his adult children in charge of the company\u2019s operations, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \u201cessentially I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the management.\u201d Ethics experts and lawmakers in both parties have warned that if Trump retains his stake, he will face congressional hearings and, potentially, investigations into whether he has a direct and personal financial stake in the decisions he is supposed to be making in the public interest. They say that Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns has left the public largely in the dark about the full extent of the potential conflicts. \u201cTurning it over to his family and him still being a recipient of fruits of their labor does create conflicts in my mind,\u201d said Graham, the GOP senator from South Carolina. \u201cIt will cloud his presidency if he doesn\u2019t find a solution that puts it behind him.\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the House Oversight Committee and the new chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, told The Post last week that he expects Trump to divorce himself from the business \u201cas much as you can have a blind trust and fully divest.\u201d \u201cHe has more counselors around him, with plenty of law degrees, that will give him great counsel on how to stay out of trouble,\u201d Meadows said. He added that he expected Trump to build the proper firewall, but that \u201cwe have an oversight function that would be appropriate, and from my standpoint I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the Oversight Committee to look at everything without a partisan lens.\u201d \u2018Vigorous oversight\u2019 The chairman of the oversight panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), said it was premature to consider any sort of investigation, but he said the committee would provide \u201cvigorous oversight\u201d of the new president. \u201cHe\u2019s still a private citizen at this point, though he needs to get his affairs in order,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cGive him a little breathing space, I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Ethics experts have called for Trump to appoint an independent trustee, unconnected to his family, to lead an effort to sell his assets and reinvest the proceeds without his knowledge. Trump has appeared to brush off concerns about conflicts, noting that there is no legal requirement that he separate. \u201cWhen I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace in an interview that aired Sunday. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not going to have anything to do with the management of the company. You know, when you sell real estate that\u2019s not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time. . . . I\u2019m going to have nothing to with it. And I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2014 I don\u2019t care about it anymore.\u201d Trump said he was \u201cturning down billions of dollars of deals\u201d as he prepares to take office. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be doing deals at all,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that would be \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a conflict. I mean, I have the right to do it. You know, under the law, I have the right to do it. I just don\u2019t want to do it. I don\u2019t want to do deals, because I want to focus on this.\u201d Several lawmakers who would be responsible for probing potential conflicts of interest said in recent interviews they are willing to give the incoming president time and space to figure out how he will deal with the situation. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started the next Congress and we haven\u2019t seen exactly how President-elect Trump is going to handle all this,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who leads the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over investigations. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him and his administration time to figure out what, quite honestly, is a very difficult situation.\u201d In other corners of the GOP, lawmakers say the calls to investigate Trump are coming primarily from his political opponents. \u201cThere are going to be detractors from Trump [who] are going to try to make it sound like all the conflict of interest and all of that, and I don\u2019t think people are really concerned about that except just the activists you run into on the Hill,\u201d said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be those who just hate Trump and are looking for something to do him in or lessen his effectiveness \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he added.

(Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Remember \u201cunseasonably warm?\u201d Forget it. After getting pelted with waves of snow over the weekend, the Chicago area could see the season's first subzero temperatures this week, followed by more snow and even freezing rain this weekend. The groaning of winter has begun: The parking spots claimed by lawn chairs, the sidewalks polished with ice and the long-jumps over gray slush. And of course crushing cold. \u201cOur big story that we\u2019re promoting right now is the cold. It\u2019ll be well below normal, with wind chills at 16 below zero,\u201d said Amy Seeley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service based in Chicago. The weather service forecast warns of \"bitterly cold conditions\" all through the week from a high pressure front moving across the country from Canada. Monday's high is expected to be 25 degrees, dropping to a low of 15. On Tuesday, the high is expected to be 18, the low 7.\u00a0 Wednesday, 14 and 2.\u00a0 Thursday, 7 and 2, then a reprieve Friday with a high of 22 and a low of 21.\u00a0 Wednesday night into Thursday will likely be the coldest period.

    "text": "CBS/AP December 12, 2016, 11:54 AM Young DREAMer immigrants warned not to be abroad when Trump's sworn in A family fills out an application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), at a workshop on February 18, 2015 in New York City.\u00a0 John Moore, Getty Images Email NEW YORK - Immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, but were protected from deportation by President Barack Obama, are being warned by some advocates to make sure they are not traveling abroad when Donald Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Some advocates, lawyers and universities are concerned that Trump might immediately rescind the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act , an Obama program that had allowed these young immigrants to work and travel for humanitarian, educational or employment purposes. That could lead, they fear, to some people traveling abroad being barred from re-entering the U.S. \u201cWe are recommending all travel be completed by or before Jan. 20 in the event laws or procedures experience a drastic change,\u201d said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to expose them to an uncertain situation should they not be allowed back to the U.S.\u201d Colleges and universities across the country are trying to convince President-elect Trump not to deport more than 1 million students who came to ... Mr. Trump made illegal immigration the cornerstone of his campaign, promising to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people living in the country illegally. His actual plans, though, have yet to be revealed . Recently, Mr. Trump has said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes. During a recent Time magazine interview, Trump expressed sympathy for the 741,000 people in Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which started in 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d President-elect Trump said. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in never-never land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Complicating matters, the president-elect\u2019s advisers worked to walk back his comments almost as soon as they were published, with one transition aide demanding anonymity to deny that Trump intended to set any new policy. \u00a0 Advocates are still being cautious. Over one million college students could be deported in the upcoming Trump administration. CBS News correspondent Carter Evans spoke to one of tho... Nancy Lopez-Ramirez, a 20-year-old student born in Mexico who is planning a trip there as part of a City College of New York class, said she is glad the group is returning by Jan. 15. \u201cMy mom is like \u2018I am concerned with you not coming back, I want you to be able to come back,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt is nerve-wracking but I think that at the end it is going to be worth it,\u201d said the political-science student, who was brought to the U.S. when she was 4. City College, part of the City University of New York, is one of the institutions advising students in the DACA program to return before Inauguration Day. So is California State University, which told administrators to tell participants in the program \u201cthat if they are outside of the United States as of January 20, 2017, there is no assurance they will be allowed to return to the U.S.\u201d Mr. Trump can rescind the promised protection right away through an \u201coperational memo\u201d because Obama implemented it through one, said William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. He said the program\u2019s participants should not consider traveling overseas unless they absolutely need to. U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Anthony Bucci said his agency \u201ccannot speculate\u201d when he was asked how long would it take for CBP officers to deny entry to the U.S. to program participants if Trump eliminated the protection. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records said that as of Dec. 31, 2015, about 22,340 people in the DACA program were approved for the \u201cparole\u201d that allows them to travel outside the U.S. Trump called the program an \u201cillegal amnesty\u201d during his campaign. Tatyana Kleyn, an associate professor at City College who organized the upcoming Mexico trip, said interest in it actually surged among students after the presidential election. \u201cSo right now our bus fits 18 and we are bringing 20,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like a last chance.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

'Moonlight' David Bornfriend / A24 The diverse slate of film acting nominees included two from \"Moonlight\" -- Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris. The diverse slate of film acting nominees included two from \"Moonlight\" -- Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris. (David Bornfriend / A24) Glenn Whipp With really good marketing and sheer force of will, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. \u00a0has, over the last decade, turned the Golden Globes from a scandal-riven booze fest into a highly rated, influential awards ceremony, a metamorphosis\u00a0that has never been clearer than this year.\u00a0 The diverse slate of film acting nominees it announced on Monday sent a clear, early message to Oscar voters dogged by the #OscarsSoWhite label: There can be no excuses this year. Last year, when faced with criticism for yet another\u00a0all-white slate of acting nominees, some members of the Academy of Motion Picture\u00a0Arts and Sciences argued that there simply had been too few nonwhite choices.\u00a0 With \u201cSully\u201d and \u201cSilence,\u201d they also have a couple of the most buzzed-about movies of the year. Yet when the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. announced its annual nominations Monday morning, both films were... Between the two of them, Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese have 23 Golden Globe nominations. With \u201cSully\u201d and \u201cSilence,\u201d they also have a couple of the most buzzed-about movies of the year. Yet when the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. announced its annual nominations Monday morning, both films were... (Steven Zeitchik) This year, the\u00a085 voting members of the HFPA identified an array of possibilities that included\u00a0nominating\u00a0six black actors \u2014\u00a0 Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for \u201cFences,\u201d Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Ruth Negga for \u201cLoving\u201d and Octavia Spencer for \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d\u00a0Also nominated: \u201cLion\u2019s\u201d Dev Patel, British-born to Indian parents. Beyond that, Globes voters also took the opportunity to recognize a wide range of stories,\u00a0\u00a0saluting movies driven by women, such as \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d\u00a0which tells the true story of a New York socialite whose inability to sing didn\u2019t stop her from trying, and \u201c20th Century Women,\u201d a poignant look at a free-thinking, independent mother raising her son beyond the bounds of convention. \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d a drama about the black women mathematicians who helped launch John Glenn into space, scored two nominations, including a nod for supporting actress  Spencer. \u201cIt is nice to have more inclusion \u2014\u00a0and inclusion across the board,\u201d said \u201cMoonlight\u201d writer-director Barry Jenkins, whose coming-of-age drama received six nominations. \u201cLooking at the types of movies nominated in the best picture categories, especially in this post-election world, it\u2019s really this beautiful snapshot of what America is right now. And it\u2019s not just a monolith. I think that\u2019s the biggest statement.\u201d Full coverage: 2017 Golden Globes Awards \u00bb By casting its net wide, the Globes continued a trend.\u00a0 In the wake of January\u2019s Oscars So White controversy,\u00a0.  the SAG Awards and Emmy Awards ceremonies practically flaunted their inclusive sets of winners and nominees. \u201cHere in Hollywood, the only thing that we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity,\u201d Emmys host Jimmy Kimmel joked in his opening monologue at the September show. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, the Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are now telling people we\u2019re one of their closest friends.\u201d Now\u00a0the question is: Will film academy members\u00a0follow suit?\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not like voters are going to have to go out of their way to look for worthy names,\u201d said veteran awards consultant Tony Angelotti. \u201cThere are a lot of\u00a0 bona fide candidates, not just fringe people who, if you vote for them, it might look like you\u2019re just responding to the controversy. Every one of these people are great actors delivering strong performances.\u201d The Jan. 24 Oscar nominations will also be the first since the academy invited its largest and most diverse set of new members ever \u2014\u00a0 683 industry professionals, 46% of them female and 41% people of color. What effect\u00a0those newcomers might have on this year\u2019s nominees remains to be seen, though many new members think that a shift in sensibility is inevitable. \u201cThere\u2019s a real art-house sensibility to this new class,\u201d says German director Maren Ade, who joined this year. \u201cThey invited a lot of European filmmakers, as well as Asians too, people who see things and value things a bit differently, simply because they come from a different life experience.\u201d Sharing \u2014 and illuminating \u2014\u00a0 that distinct life experience was the impetus for such films as \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the drama depicting three periods in the life of a young black man as he struggles\u00a0with, and\u00a0ultimately\u00a0learns\u00a0to accept, his gay identity. Made for a pittance, the film has grossed nearly $11 million, a figure that will likely balloon with the Globes and (potential) Oscars nominations.\u00a0 I do think it\u2019s one of these movies that has the ability to change the way people look at life and each other.\" \u2014 Naomie Harris \u201cI do think it\u2019s one of these movies that has the ability to change the way people look at life and each other,\u201d said \u201cMoonlight\u201d actress  Harris, Golden Globe-nominated for playing the film\u2019s drug addict mother. Her \u201cMoonlight\u201d castmate,  Ali, also a Globe nominee, added: \u201cI just hope that that\u2019s something that is the norm moving forward, where there are people from all walks of life and different cultures and communities in some way, shape or form being represented on screen, and their work being appreciated and recognized.\u201d The academy\u2019s diversity push also heightened\u00a0the way that movies like \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cFences\u201d and \u201cLoving\u201d were marketed and discussed. \u201cI feel like there is a stronger interest in our movie\u2019s subject matter right now,\u201d said director Jeff Nichols of his movie \u201cLoving,\u201d which tells the story of Mildred and Richard Loving, the couple who fought the state of Virginia to recognize their interracial marriage. \u201cThere\u2019s a hunger for stories about another kind of hero.\u201d Whether this year\u2019s inclusiveness, which has yet to appreciably extend to Latino, Asian and other minority filmmakers, becomes the new normal or is a one-and-done aberration is open to debate. The 2017 release schedule is littered with traditional, older-white-male-friendly titles like Christopher Nolan \u2019s World War II epic, \u201cDunkirk,\u201d and Joe Wright\u2019s Winston Churchill drama, \u201cDarkest Hour.\u201d But there\u2019s also a drama about the 1967 Detroit riot directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who won the Oscar for \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d And there are likely a handful of smaller movies, like \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d \u2014 the high-profile Sundance sensation about Nat Turner\u2019s slave revolt that flamed out early \u2014 that are currently hidden in plain sight. Having spoken to his indie filmmaker friends since the release of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and its subsequent success, Jenkins said he has heard whispers that studios and financiers might be increasingly open to distinct, diverse stories. \u201cI think that there\u2019s an informal mandate that everyone is feeling right now,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAnd I think great work \u2014 work that is needed -- is going to come out of it.\u201d Times staff writer Tre\u2019vell Anderson contributed to this story.\u00a0 See the most-read stories this hour \u00bb Caption 'La La Land' is a lovely and lovingly crafted tribute to classic musicals Jusin Chang reviews 'La La Land,' directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.

    "text": "Dec 12 2016, 3:51 pm ET Want to Go Electric but Can't Afford a Tesla? This Could Be the Answer by Paul A. Eisenstein At an EPA-estimated 238 miles per charge, the Chevy Bolt will deliver almost three times the range of most first-generation battery-electric vehicles. Paul A. Eisenstein Share advertisement Slow, boring, small \u2014 and expensive? If that's your image of a battery car... you could be in for a surprise. The company that's set to start redefining what it means to go electric isn't some high-tech California start-up, but that icon of the Rust Belt, General Motors. At a plant in the northern suburbs of Detroit \u2014 a factory that nearly shut down when GM entered bankruptcy six years ago \u2014 the automaker has begun to ramp up production of the new Chevrolet Bolt EV. Bolt has already won a string of high-profile awards, including Motor Trend Car of the Year. But the real test will begin in the coming days, when the first retail customer is handed the keys. Related: Chevrolet Bolt Named Green Car of the Year Think of it as battery-car 2.0. At an EPA-estimated 238 miles per charge, the Chevy hatchback will deliver almost three times the range of most first-generation battery-electric vehicles. But at a starting MSRP of just $37,495 \u2014 or less than $30,000 after applying $7,500 in federal tax credits \u2014 the Bolt is less than half the price of the current mileage champ, the Tesla Model S. Spacious and Fast True, it's smaller and less lavish, but despite its small exterior footprint, Chevrolet designers and engineers took advantage of the fact that most of the powertrain, including the 60 kilowatt-hour battery pack, has been tucked under the floor. That let them carve out some extra space from what in a regular vehicle would have been an engine compartment. So, subcompact body but nearly midsize interior. The new Chevrolet Bolt EV has already won a string of high-profile awards, including Motor Trend Car of the Year. Paul A. Eisenstein That battery pack is heavy \u2014 around 800 pounds \u2014 but because it's under the floor it actually means a lower center of gravity which, in lay terms, means surprisingly good handling. And the 200-horsepower electric motor can launch the five-door Bolt from 0 to 60 in just 6.5 seconds, or about as fast as a turbocharged Ford Mustang. But will consumers plug in? That's the big question, says David Sullivan, automotive analyst with AutoPacific, Inc. Hot Competition Tesla has already lined up more than 400,000 reservations for the similarly priced \u2014 albeit slightly lower-range \u2014 Model 3 it hopes to bring out about 8 to 12 months after Bolt. Chevrolet isn't offering sales forecasts, but LG Chem, the South Korean supplier of lithium-ion batteries, recently said it expects sales of around 30,000 Bolts in 2017. At GM's battery-car plant in Orion Township, Michigan, production of the Bolt is now running nearly 15 cars an hour on the line it shares with the conventional, gas-powered Chevrolet Sonic subcompact, or around 100 a day on a single eight-hour shift. Related: Lucid Motors is the Latest to Take on Tesla \"And there's more capacity at this plant if we need to tap into it,\" says Yves Dontigny, the Bolt Launch Manager, during a tour of the plant. By some observers' estimates, GM spent more than $1 billion to develop the Chevy Bolt EV. The figure could have been substantially higher \u2014 likely pricing the car out of the mainstream \u2014 if the maker hadn't figured out how to produce Bolt and Sonic on the same line. A Chevrolet Bolt on the assembly line in Detroit. Paul A. Eisenstein Dontigny pauses at one of more than 100 work stations along the serpentine assembly line. As a Chevy Sonic moves into position, two workers maneuver a cart into place that carries the hatchback's gas tank. In a process as carefully choreographed as a ballet, they slip the tank into the vehicle, then firmly bolt it into place before the partially completed car moves onto the next workstation. Moments later, a Bolt swings into place, hanging from a claw-like carrier. As it does, an automated cart rolls into place beneath the EV carrying an 800-pound battery pack. The same workers trigger the cart to rise up, marrying pack and body. Six bolts later, the process is complete. The battery car rolls on. Eventually, as the all-but-completed Bolt reaches the end of the assembly line, it rolls into a blindingly bright booth, special lamps designed to reveal even the slightest of exterior flaws. A specially trained crew pours over the car determined to make sure all the sheet metal and chrome fit together as planned, and that there are no nicks or scratches to its paint. Quality Controlled Surveys by J.D. Power and other independent analysts have found Chevy making significant jumps in quality in recent years, but all-new models pose unique launch problems, especially when you're introducing a completely new electric drivetrain. GM can't afford to make even the smallest of mistakes. The good news for Chevy is that Bolt is already receiving strong kudos. Among other things, it has been named both Motor Trend Car of the Year and Green Car of the Year. And it is one of three finalists for North American Car of the Year, that winner set to be announced on January 9. Such awards will certainly draw attention to the Chevy Bolt, but it will likely be word of mouth that really makes a difference. And that will only begin when the first of the battery-cars start rolling out of dealer showrooms before the end of this year. Paul A. Eisenstein ",

    "text": "Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images WATCH War of Words Over Russian Hacking Claims 0 Shares Email In an unprecedented public display of acrimony, President-elect Donald Trump and the CIA are engaged in a war of words over the extent and details of Russian efforts to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. \u201cThere must be big smiles this morning at the Kremlin,\u201d said former White House cybersecurity official Richard Clarke, now an ABC News consultant. \u201cIt's unprecedented that a president-elect should be denigrating CIA, refusing to read their intelligence and disagreeing with them on a major substantive issue even before he is inaugurated.\u201d Trump used his Twitter account this morning to continue his effort over the weekend to discredit the CIA and its reported conclusion that the Russians hacked into Democratic Party computers in an effort to help elect Trump. Trump tweeted, \u201cCan you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\u201d His Twitter rant followed a statement issued by a U.S. intelligence official this morning denouncing the pushback against the intelligence community\u2019s assessment. Responding to Trump\u2019s comments over the weekend, an intelligence official told Reuters , \u201cIt is concerning that intelligence on Russian actions related to the U.S. election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan.\u201d \u201cThe inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country,\u201d the official said. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images PHOTO:The seal of the Central Intelligence Agency is displayed in the foyer of the original headquarters building in Langley, Va., Sept. 18, 2009. Weekend of Words The dispute between the incoming administration and the intelligence community began in earnest last week. On Friday, the presidential transition team released a short statement saying, \u201cthese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d It was not clear which agency the statement was referring to. However, one senior career U.S. official told ABC News today that Trump\u2019s \u201cnot just taking a shot at an old CIA assessment from 14 years ago, he\u2019s disparaging and insulting every analyst currently in the intelligence community working hard to protect the United States.\u201d \"Who is the President-Elect going to trust and rely on?\" the official asked rhetorically. And by today, the anger and frustration within the intelligence community was apparent. Speaking to ABC News, former CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the war of words was a \u201creally ugly situation\u201d and noted that it was \u201cunprecedented to have a president so frontally assault\u201d the intelligence community. \u201cI would advise that he find a way to turn down the rhetoric and focus on hearing from them [the intelligence community], what they believe and why they believe it,\u201d Harlow said. Harlow\u2019s sentiments were echoed by John Cohen, an ABC News consultant and former acting under secretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWhat is laughable and ridiculous is that you have individuals with no law enforcement, national security or intelligence experience calling into question the credibility and integrity of career intelligence professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cCreating a dispute and undermining the trust between the incoming administration and these intelligence officials is problematic because this administration will rely on these professionals as they seek to make critical decisions in the future.\u201d Clarke agreed, adding that as Trump takes power, \u201cthere's the potential here for a great deal of tension on on-going basis between the career CIA intelligence officers and the president.\u201d Hackers Cast a Wide Net U.S. intelligence officials have maintained since October that Russian hackers targeted both Republicans and Democrats. But the hackers were far more successful in their cyberattacks on the Democrats \u2014 stealing thousands of emails between party officials and other data \u2014 than they were with Republicans, whose official party systems had better defenses against cyberattacks. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security said in October , \u201cThe U.S. intelligence community (USIC) is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\u201d In selecting their targets, the hackers cast a wide net. Among those attacked was a former Republican Party employee whose computer was not connected to the Republican National Committee \u2019s computer system. Over the weekend, Reince Priebus , who is the RNC chairman and has been selected to be White House chief of staff in the Trump administration, told ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d that the RNC\u2019s systems were \u201cabsolutely not hacked.\u201d \u201cWe contacted the FBI months ago when the [hacking of the Democratic National Committee ] issue came about. They reviewed all of our systems. We have hacking detection systems in place, and the conclusion was then, as it was again two days ago when we went back to the FBI to ask them about this, that the RNC was not hacked,\u201d he said. Officials conceded that the committee was a target of the Russians. Disagreement Within the Intelligence Community The news of the attack on the former RNC employee\u2019s computer comes amid widespread disagreement within the intelligence community over the broader extent of Russia\u2019s election-related hacking. Sources said that the agencies are deeply split over the CIA\u2019s conclusion that the hacking was done with the intent to get Trump elected. The agency declined to comment for this story. While the CIA has championed this view, other agencies believe that the Russians expected Hillary Clinton would win and therefore their cyber efforts were made with the hope to weaken her when she was in office. On Sunday, Trump flatly rejected reports that the CIA has concluded the Russian hacking was done with the aim of getting him elected. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told Fox News on Sunday. Rejecting the notion that the CIA might be trying to overturn the election, Trump said, \u201cOnce they hack, if you don\u2019t catch them in the act, you\u2019re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it\u2019s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea.\u201d He called into question media reports about the CIA\u2019s conclusion and alleged that the stories were floated by his political opponents. \u201cI\u2019m not sure [the CIA] put it out. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,\u201d he said. Speaking broadly about the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the Russians were involved in hacking related to the election, Trump said, \u201cTake a look. They\u2019re not sure. They\u2019re fighting among themselves. They\u2019re not sure.\u201d His comments stood in contrast to statements made by some in his party. Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., told CBS that there was \u201cno doubt about the hacking \u2026 The question is about the intention,\u201d but that he did not have information on whether the RNC was hacked. And on ABC News\u2019 \u201cGood Morning America\u201d today, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said he did not want \u201cinterference into our politics\u201d or for \u201cpolitics [to] interfere with our intelligence.\u201d \u201cPeople are trying to politicize our intelligence because they do not like the election result,\u201d she said. And on Monday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) appeared to denounce Trump\u2019s handling of the situation, saying in a statement, \u201cexploiting the work of our intelligence community for partisan purposes does a grave disservice to those professionals and potentially jeopardizes our national security.\u201d But, Ryan added: \u201cAs we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\u201d Vasily Maximov//AP Photo Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks at a joint news conference with Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan after their meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Aug. 10, 2016. Russian Denial Whatever the hackers' motives, there is no doubt among U.S. officials that the Russians\u2019 goal was to interfere with the U.S. election. Responding to this accusation, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for the Russian government, said, \u201cIt looks [like an] absolutely unfounded, unprofessional, unqualified statement and accusation that has nothing to do with reality.\u201d And while there is broad consensus on this point, officials said that, as of the beginning of this month, Barack Obama\u2019s administration has not been able to agree on what \u2014 if any \u2014 retaliatory action to take to show that there will be consequences for the interference.

    "text": "Though the United States officially ended relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains an unofficial embassy there called the American Institute in Taiwan. It has also sold Taiwan advanced military equipment and has worked to promote its democracy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that American support for Taiwan was negotiable. \u201cTaiwan is not a source of leverage,\u201d Mr. Earnest said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a close partner of the United States.\u201d The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, put the matter more bluntly, saying Mr. Trump was \u201clike a child in his ignorance of foreign policy.\u201d It added: \u201cThe One China policy cannot be bought and sold. Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price.\u201d Here are five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration: Trade and Investment Chinese analysts say China has plenty of leverage to retaliate against Mr. Trump. One prominent target is Boeing, whose Seattle plant Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, visited in September 2015 . In 2016, Boeing is expected to complete plane deliveries to China worth $11 billion, mostly 737s that have become the workhorse of China\u2019s rapidly expanding airlines. The Global Times warned that it would be easy for China to switch orders to Boeing\u2019s European competitor, Airbus. \u201cOn economic issues, China has more and more leverage,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, the director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. \u201cIf we feel he is still pushing the Taiwan issue, we will take action. If he wants to keep it up on Taiwan, it will only backfire.\u201d American trade officials worry that China could intensify its discrimination against American technology firms by using the country\u2019s antimonopoly laws. Last year, the Chinese government slapped a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, a San Diego-based chip maker, for what it said were licensing infractions. A few years ago, there were worries that China might suddenly dump a large portion of its holdings of Treasuries, pushing up interest rates in the United States. Those fears ebbed as China pared its holdings gradually. Its holdings of Treasuries peaked at $1.65 trillion in March 2014, declining to about $1.3 trillion, said Brad Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations. Experts say that even if the country sold more, it may not have much effect because interest rates are already low, global demand for Treasuries has been strong, and the Federal Reserve could buy more bonds if needed to offset action by China. Advertisement Continue reading the main story China could also weaken its currency, something Mr. Trump has argued it already does to make its products cheaper. But that could also result in more Chinese taking their money out of the country, as well as inflation for a nation that increasingly buys what it needs from abroad, like oil, because a weak currency means China must pay more for imported goods. Finally, China could order its state-owned companies and private enterprises to slow their investments in the United States. A recent study by the Rhodium Group, a New York-based economic policy outfit, showed that since 2015, the amount of Chinese direct investment in the United States has outweighed the amount of American investment in China. North Korea Mr. Trump said on Sunday, \u201cAnd frankly, they\u2019re not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201d China has in fact cooperated with some American initiatives on curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, specifically backing United Nations economic sanctions last month aimed at checking the North\u2019s foreign exchange earnings from coal, its biggest export earner. China could switch from being a reluctant ally of North Korea to a friendly neighbor. China is already angry at Washington for the recent decision to deploy a defense shield in South Korea, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, which China argues is aimed at limiting its military capabilities. Photo A newspaper headline with an illustration of Mr. Trump, next to images of the flag of China, top, and that of Taiwan in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, on Monday. Credit Ritchie B. Tongo/European Pressphoto Agency Among the tools China could use would be improved trade, aid and investment to strengthen the North\u2019s rudimentary economy, said John Delury, an American analyst in Seoul, South Korea. As a longstanding ally, China could conduct joint military exercises with the North, he said. In return for promises by North Korea not to proliferate, Mr. Delury said, China could go beyond improved trade, and provide substantial economic backing in a Marshall Plan-style initiative. Climate Change President Obama spent much of his political capital with China ensuring that Beijing would agree to the international climate change agreement that committed the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters to lower greenhouse gases. Critics of Mr. Obama say he failed to force China to open up its markets, stood by while China fortified islands in the South China Sea and remained largely silent while Mr. Xi carried out repressive human rights policies in order to save the climate change accord. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Moreover, China\u2019s agreement to the international deal was less a concession to American pressure than a restatement of its own goals. It was relatively easy for Mr. Xi to agree to a reduction in emissions given the outcry among the Chinese public about air pollution and contaminated food. The accord calls for China\u2019s carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline \u201caround 2030\u201d but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States. Mr. Xi would be unlikely to touch the climate accord because of the popularity of the prospect of cleaner air among the Chinese public. But if he did decide to ignore it, Mr. Trump would probably not care. At one point, Mr. Trump said climate change was a \u201c hoax \u201d invented by China to hurt American trade. Later, he said he was joking. Taiwan If Mr. Trump supports Taiwan, China\u2019s first response may be to punish Taiwan rather than the United States, in an attempt to diminish its value to Washington. It could begin by intensifying efforts to persuade the 22 small sovereignties around the world, including the Vatican, that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to sever them and recognize China instead. China might then take aim at Taiwan\u2019s economy by restricting Chinese investments and limiting the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan. Taiwan already has de facto independence, but China has warned that it will go to war to prevent it a formal separation from the mainland. Advertisement Continue reading the main story From Beijing\u2019s perspective, the fear is that Mr. Trump\u2019s moves could encourage Taiwan to declare independence or that other nations might follow the United States in recognizing Taiwan. If President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan declared independence, \u201cand the whole world says Taiwan is independent,\u201d then China \u201cwill take military action,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that is Tsai\u2019s intention,\u201d he added. Iran China was a signatory to the nuclear accord reached with Iran in 2015 that lifted sanctions in return for Iran\u2019s getting rid of 98 percent of its nuclear material. China now has unfettered access to its longtime friend\u2019s economy. Through Iran, Beijing will seek to enhance its influence in the Middle East, with the goal of weakening American prestige in the region. But if the deal is scrapped and renegotiated, as Mr. Trump has called for, China would keep trading with Iran, isolating the United States, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow for energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. About one-third of Iran\u2019s oil exports go to China, and China is Iran\u2019s top importer of goods. Thus China is Iran\u2019s top trading partner, a position that would not change in the event of Mr. Trump\u2019s renouncing Washington\u2019s participation in the nuclear deal. \u201cIf anything, China would redouble trading and investment in Iran now that Trump has started on the Taiwan front,\u201d Mr. Chow said.

Photo right: Brendan McDermid/Reuters) Weeks before he takes the oath of office, President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled for another kind of oath \u2014 he\u2019s set to face lawyers\u2019 questions during\u00a0a deposition in the $10 million breach-of-contract lawsuit he filed against Washington-based celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. In filings last week, attorneys for Trump and Andr\u00e9s\u2019s company argued\u00a0over the details of the session slated to take place the first week of January. Trump wanted the deposition to take place in New York, where he lives and where his presidential transition is based, not in Washington, for security reasons. Andr\u00e9s\u2019s lawyers agreed. But Trump\u2019s team has other objections: The real estate executive\u00a0wants to limit questioning to two hours and prohibit questions covered in a previous deposition. \u201cIt seems dubious that the President-elect cannot be afforded adequate security in the capital of the United States, but defendants are willing to accommodate that demand,\u201d Andr\u00e9s\u2019s attorneys wrote in a filing. \u201cDefendants cannot, however, accept Trump LLC\u2019s attempt to hamstring defendant\u2019s questioning of the man who directed the bringing of this lawsuit.\u201d D.C.-based super-chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s says he is backing out of a deal to launch a restaurant in the hotel Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is building in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion. (WUSA9) The Trump-Andr\u00e9s legal battle began when the chef backed out of a deal to open a restaurant in Trump\u2019s luxury hotel complex located in the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue. Andr\u00e9s cited Trump\u2019s derogatory comments on the campaign trail about illegal immigrants, saying they made it impossible for him to run a successful eatery. Trump promptly sued. Trump was deposed in June in a similar lawsuit against restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian, who was also slated to run a restaurant in Trump\u2019s Washington hotel and \u2014 like Andr\u00e9s \u2014 scrapped the plan after Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric created controversy.\u00a0Zakarian\u2019s case is apace, too: His attorneys on Monday set a hearing date of Jan. 3 in D.C.

Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that the so-called Merry Christmas law adopted in 2013 means schools can\u2019t \u201csilence a biblical reference to Christmas.\u201d He said Thursday that the decision by officials in Killeen, north of Austin, is an \u201cattack on religious liberty.\u201d But CBS Waco affiliate KWTX-TV reports that Killeen administrators argue school employees are not permitted to impose their personal beliefs on students. A staffer had placed the poster on a school door. It shows Linus and the line from the gospel of Luke: \u201cUnto you is born this day in the city of David a savior.\u201d \u201cUpon review, it is clear that this display was not in keeping with the Merry Christmas Bill (House Bill 308), which requires that a display not encourage adherence to a particular religion,\u201d the KISD said Friday. \u00a0 One section of the law reads: \u201cA display relating to a traditional winter celebration may not include a message that encourages adherence to a particular religious belief.\u201d \u00a0 With the \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d law, then-Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, attempted to codify educators\u2019 ability to decorate schools - as long as there\u2019s a secular symbol next to each religious one, or two religions represented. The law also legalized lessons about the \u201ctraditional winter celebrations\u201d as well as wishing each other a happy holiday, Hanukkah or Christmas. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a shame that a bill like the one I\u2019m signing today is even necessary, I\u2019m proud we are standing up for religious freedom in our state,\u201d Perry said at the bill-signing. \u201cFreedom of religion doesn\u2019t mean freedom from religion.\u201d Though the bill is named after the Christian holiday, Perry said the law is not meant to protect one religion over another. \u201cPeople of faith often feel like they can\u2019t express that faith publicly and, if they dare display it, they can find themselves under attack from individuals and organizations that have nothing to do with them or their communities,\u201d Perry said. \u201c[The law] ensures freedom of expression where - for many students, teachers and administrators - it\u2019s most important.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Sunday in an interview on Fox News. Some top Republican congressmen have said the same, although with less bombastic language, arguing that there is no clear proof that the Russians tried to rig the election for Mr. Trump. Yet there is a loud chorus of bipartisan voices, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, going public to accuse the Russians of election interference. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the public evidence alone made it clear that Moscow had intervened to help the \u201cmost ostentatiously pro-Russian candidate in history.\u201d \u201cIf the Russians were going to interfere, why on earth would they do it to the detriment of the candidate that was pro-Russian?\u201d Mr. Schiff asked. The dispute cuts to core realities of intelligence analysis. Judgments are often made in a fog of uncertainty, are sometimes based on putting together shards of a mosaic that do not reveal a full picture, and can always be affected by human biases. Video Donald Trump\u2019s Russian Connections Donald J. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin have exchanged many compliments over the past year. We looked at the basis of the mutual respect between the two men who have never met. By NATALIA V. OSIPOVA and STEVEN LEE MYERS on Publish Date July 27, 2016. Photo by From left; Todd Heisler/The New York Times, Yury Kochetkov/European Pressphoto Agency. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cThis is why I hate the term \u2018we speak truth to power,\u2019\u201d said Mark M. Lowenthal, a former senior C.I.A. analyst. \u201cWe don\u2019t have truth. We have really good ideas.\u201d Mr. Lowenthal said that determining the motives of foreign leaders \u2014 in this case, what drove President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to order the hacking \u2014 was one of the most important missions for C.I.A. analysts. In 2002, one of the critical failures of American spy agencies was their inability to understand Saddam Hussein\u2019s goals and motives. At the same time, Mr. Lowenthal said, intelligence agencies have always been loath to be seen as taking sides in disputes about American politics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis is the one place you don\u2019t want to be as an intelligence officer: the meat in someone\u2019s partisan sandwich,\u201d he said. Both intelligence and law enforcement officials agree that there is a mountain of circumstantial evidence suggesting that the Russian hacking was primarily aimed at helping Mr. Trump and damaging his opponent, Hillary Clinton . In July, the infiltration of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers produced embarrassing emails and other internal party documents, the publication of which caused a backlash that led to the resignation of the committee\u2019s chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and her top staff. Just weeks before the election, hacked emails from the account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top campaign manager, were made public and produced numerous stories about the internal dynamics of the campaign. That hack also produced the text of speeches Mrs. Clinton had given to Wall Street banks. American intelligence officials believe that Russia also penetrated databases housing Republican National Committee data, but chose to release documents only on the Democrats. The committee has denied that it was hacked. Beyond the specific targets of the hacks, American officials cite broad evidence that Mr. Putin and the Russian government favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton. After demonstrators marched through Moscow in 2011 chanting \u201cPutin is a thief\u201d and \u201cRussia without Putin,\u201d Mr. Putin publicly accused Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, of instigating the protests. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d he said. More generally, the Russian government has blamed Mrs. Clinton, along with the C.I.A. and other American officials, for encouraging anti-Russian revolts during the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. What Americans saw as legitimate democracy promotion, Mr. Putin saw as an unwarranted intrusion into Russia\u2019s geographic sphere of interest, as the United States once saw Soviet meddling in Cuba. By contrast, Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have had a very public mutual admiration society. In December 2015, the Russian president called Mr. Trump \u201cvery colorful\u201d \u2014 using a Russian word that Mr. Trump and some news outlets mistranslated as \u201cbrilliant\u201d \u2014 as well as \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201cabsolutely the leader in the presidential race.\u201d Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin \u201ca strong leader\u201d and further pleased him by questioning whether the United States should defend NATO members that did not spend enough on their militaries.
