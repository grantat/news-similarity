    "text": "2 Girl Suicide Bombers Die in Blasts Near Market in Nigeria By ismail alfa abdulrahim and michelle faul, associated press MAIDUGURI, Nigeria \u0097 Dec 11, 2016, 9:52 AM ET 0 Shares Email Two girl suicide bombers died when they exploded Sunday in a crowded area near a market in Nigeria's northeastern city of Maiduguri, injuring 17 people, rescue officials said. Survivor Abubakar Musa said he also saw among the victims the bodies of soldiers, who were guarding a nearby electric power installation. Officials blamed the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group that has staged numerous attacks in Maiduguri, the birthplace of the insurgency. One bomber appeared no older than 7 and the second about 8 years old, said Abdulkadir Jabo, a civilian self-defense fighter who stopped them from going into the market. \"I asked the older girl where she was going but she could not speak Hausa or Kanuri ... and appeared very unsettled, so I turned her back,\" he told The Associated Press. Seconds later, she detonated, followed by the younger girl, Jabo said. Police Commissioner Damian Chukwu identified the bombers as teen-aged girls. Earlier, officials said they were a man and a woman. There was no way to resolve the discrepancies. Boko Haram has used scores of women and girls in suicide bombings, prompting suspicions that some are among the many thousands that they have kidnapped over the years. In a particularly horrific instance, a woman suicide bomber carrying a baby on her back was shot by soldiers at a checkpoint on Nov. 28. The shot detonated her explosives, killing the woman and the baby. Sunday's blasts occurred near Maiduguri's Monday Market, just weeks after the state government reopened the roads leading to the market. They had been closed for nearly two years over security concerns following previous bombings at the market that killed dozens of people. On Friday, two women suicide bombers exploded in a market at Madagali, 150 kilometers (95 miles) southeast of Maiduguri, killing 57 people and wounding 177 including 120 children. Since Nigeria's military has dislodged insurgents from towns and villages this year, Boko Haram has been attacking soft targets. Suicide bombings and attacks on military camps continue, though Nigeria's government claims it has the insurgents on the run. President Muhammadu Buhari declared the Islamic uprising \"technically defeated\" a year ago. On Friday, he vowed Nigeria's military is working \"at slamming the final nail in the coffin of Boko Haram.\" The seven-year insurgency has killed more than 20,000 people, forced 2.6 million from their homes and created a massive humanitarian crisis. Boko Haram, which has one branch allied to the Islamic State group, wants to install an Islamic state in Nigeria, West Africa's oil giant of 170 million people divided almost equally between a mainly Christian south and predominantly Muslim north. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Faul contributed from Lagos, Nigeria. 0 Shares ",

Jennifer Jolly for USA Today The Star Trek communicator is designed to look exactly like the original prop from the show, and it pairs via Bluetooth to his smartphone. (Photo: Think Geek) You know the old saying: Men are from Mars, women are from wherever has the best shoes \u2014 that\u2019s how it goes, right? Whenever you\u2019re shopping for the opposite sex, things can get confusing in a hurry, and throwing gadgets into the mix can make things even more complicated. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve rounded up some of the most-desired gadget gifts for men \u2014 for all kinds of guys and in every price range \u2014 to help you get it just right this year. For His Inner Geek: My good friend Mike recently told me, \u201cIf it seems like all men are secretly nerds, it\u2019s because they are.\u201d His words, not mine. There\u2019s no better way to show him you embrace his dorky nature than with this fantastic fully functional Star Trek communicator ($129.99). It\u2019s designed to look exactly like the original prop from the show, and it pairs via Bluetooth to his smartphone, so he can actually use it to phone home. Flipping the cover answers calls, and it has a huge range of more than 100-feet, just in case he feels the urge to explore. Gamer Guy: If he\u2019s a gamer, he probably owns a PlayStation 4. It\u2019s the most popular game console of the past few years, and the PlayStation VR headset ($399) is the ultimate add-on. The core bundle comes with everything he needs to dive into all the fast-paced, neck-twisting virtual reality games he craves. It works with every version of the PlayStation 4, including the all-new PlayStation 4 Pro, so you can buy one worry-free. You can also give your gamer guy a GameStop gift card so he can continue to add the latest releases to his gaming collection. The Ultimate Hipster: Give the guy on your list a taste of yesteryear with Sharper Image\u2019s hilarious \u201cMr. Hipster\u201d smartphone stand ($27.00). It\u2019s just like one of those old rotary phones, but instead of a circular dial there\u2019s a slot for his smartphone. Plug it in and he can even make phone calls with the old plastic banana handle. It\u2019s quirky but functional, which is a great combo for gift giving. The best gadget gifts for women For His Mancave: Gamers, graphic artists, movie-lovers \u2014 and anyone who appreciates stellar picture quality will love LG\u2019s gorgeous 38-inch UltraWide curved monitor ($1,499.99). Movies, games, and sports look amazing on it, and the curve pulls him into the action. The built-in Bluetooth speakers blast rich sound to all corners of his cave, and the extra-wide screen is perfect for multitasking, so he can watch his favorite team on one side and work on the other. The Rock Fan: He loves his music loud, and that\u2019s just what he\u2019ll get with the Megaboom\u00a0($299.99) or UE Boom2 ($199.99)\u00a0Bluetooth speakers from Ultimate Ears. It\u2019s only nine inches tall, but it blasts out some seriously impressive sound, no matter where he puts hit. The Megaboom will rock his socks for up to 20 hours on a single battery charge, and since it\u2019s also waterproof, it can go to the beach, the shop, the trail, and everywhere in between. Also, UE\u2019s Party Up app update lets him wirelessly connect two to fifty UE speakers within seconds so he can truly rock out in epic ways. UE Boom2 ($199.99) Bluetooth speakers from Ultimate Ears. \u00a0(Photo: UE Boom 2 bluetooth speaker) The Gear Guy: Samsung\u2019s trio of mobile gadgets are the perfect combo for the ultimate gear guy. It starts with the Galaxy S7 ($694.99); one of the fastest, sleekest, and most powerful Android phones available. Then add the Galaxy 360 camera ($349.99), an awesome little ball of tech which shoots 360-degree video of anywhere, and combine it with the Galaxy Gear VR headset ($99.99). The Gear VR uses the S7 as its screen, just slide it into the place and dive into a world of VR, including the 360-degree videos from the Galaxy 360. Forget a fancy camera that takes snapshots, with this combo he can relive entire moments as though he\u2019s there. Buy this, not that: 10 popular gifts to avoid this year Retro Game Junkie: Nintendo\u2019s NES Classic Edition ($59.99) is the ultimate gift for any old-school gaming fan \u2014 if you can still find one to buy. It\u2019s packed with 30 of the original Nintendo\u2019s most stellar titles, like all three Mario Bros. adventures, Tecmo Bowl, Mega Man 2, and many, many more. The bummer about this gadget is that\u2019s it\u2019s so popular, it\u2019s sold out virtually everywhere. If you run into a snag on your usual shopping trips try scoring one on Walmart.com and sign up for notifications on Amazon so you\u2019ll know as soon as they get a new shipment. I\u2019ve seen a few going for top-dollar ($170-$300+) on eBay lately too, so there is hope if you really, really want to get it for him. The Audiophile: If you type \u201cwireless speaker\u201d into Google you\u2019re going to see literally thousands of options, but if you want the absolute best boom money can buy, Devialet\u2019s Phantom speakers (starting at $1,990) are in a league of their own. They\u2019re more expensive than my first car, and they\u2019re probably more powerful than it, too. With 4,500 watts of ear-tickling power, these speakers are packed with patented technology that give them a sound that is simply second to none. Devialet\u2019s Phantom speakers offer the best boom money can buy. \u00a0(Photo: Devialet) DIY Dude: He\u2019s Getting Hotter: If he\u2019s the kind of guy that has every tool you could possibly imagine, you can really surprise him with this. Thermal imaging tech is just finally creeping into the affordable range, and Seek\u2019s Compact thermal imager ($249.00) plugs right into your smartphone. He just snaps it into place and boots up the Seek app to see the world in a whole new way. The Seek Compact only sees heat, which makes it great for hunting, wildlife spotting, or even pinpointing where that nasty draft in the living room is coming from. Seek\u2019s Compact thermal imager plugs right into your smartphone. \u00a0(Photo: Seek) The Live-It Live Guy: If he loves streaming live video of his latest culinary classics, unboxing antics, or epic adventures, smartphone cameras are alright at getting the job done, but they\u2019ve got nothing on Mevo. Mevo ($399.99) is like a little professional recording rig shrunk down to the size of a soda can. The huge 12.4 megapixel lense can capture photos and video in up to 4k resolution, and videos can be edited on-the-fly with the Mevo app for iOS. It runs on a wall plug or battery power, and can even stream live video to Facebook, making it one of the most powerful video gadgets you can buy.

Elgin Clark, left, and Edgar Palma, from Sunrun home solar company, install a solar panel on a home in Van Nuys. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Ralph Vartabedian Contact Reporter Californians are\u00a0likely to pay more for gasoline, electricity, food and new homes \u2014 and to feel their lives jolted in myriad other ways \u2014 because their state broadly expanded its war on climate change this summer. The ambitious new goals\u00a0will require complex regulations on an unprecedented scale,\u00a0but were approved in Sacramento without a study of possible economic repercussions. Some of the nation\u2019s top energy, housing and business experts say the effort may not only raise\u00a0the cost of staples, but also slow the pace of job and income growth for millions of California families. California is doing something no other state has done. \u2014 Gov. Jerry Brown And now that Donald Trump, who has dismissed climate change, is headed for the White House, Californians may find themselves making sacrifices while the residents of other states are missing in action. Two key laws this summer kicked California\u2019s climate change fight into high gear. \u00a0 Senate Bill 32 requires the state to cut greenhouse gases 40% below their level of 1990 \u2014 based on evidence that a global reduction at that level\u00a0would limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above the temperature levels of a few decades ago. Senate Bill 1383 requires similar reductions in methane, refrigeration gases and black carbon. Before signing SB 32 , Gov. Jerry Brown said he didn\u2019t expect problems. \u201cCalifornia is doing something no other state has done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bringing into law real measures backed up by the real power of the state of California. It will take some balance that we don\u2019t overdo it, but I am not afraid we are going to get to that point.\u201d It is dubious as to whether the California goal will be achieved without large economic costs. \u2014 James Sweeney, director of Stanford University\u2019s Precourt Energy Efficiency Center But nobody really knows what\u2019s in store for the state. The Legislature\u00a0relied\u00a0on years of\u00a0sophisticated computer modeling to understand how staying the course on the use of fossil fuels\u00a0will disrupt Earth\u2019s climate. No one, however,\u00a0can point to detailed economic study of\u00a0how the new goals will affect the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy.\u00a0 A preliminary analysis just released by the California Air Resources Board, which has sole authority to impose the new rules,\u00a0projects a potential reduction of 25,000 to 102,000 jobs and the loss of $7 billion to $14 billion in gross state economic output. The board said those impacts are\u00a0small relative to the state\u2019s economy. Other experts, however, note that too little is known to make solid predictions, while industry groups project severe consequences. \u00a0 Although California\u00a0set a goal of reducing\u00a0greenhouse gases by 40% below 1990 levels, for example, the state did not collect greenhouse gas data before 1990. So no one can say how far back in its history as a state with cars and industry California will have to go to hit that emission level.\u00a0 That benchmark\u00a0could, however, require the state to emit no more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases than it did as far back as the 1960s, based on national data that do not take into account California\u2019s faster growth and more energy-efficient economy. Individual industry sectors always overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits and assume that you will implement it in the dumbest possible way. \u2014 Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board \u201cIt is dubious as to whether the California goal will be achieved without large economic costs,\u201d said James Sweeney, director of Stanford University\u2019s Precourt Energy Efficiency Center.\u00a0 He added\u00a0that the enhanced climate change fight will likely lead to a less diversified and more fragile state economy. \u201cMeeting the requirement will require severe restrictions, far beyond those seen to date.\u201d Exactly what restrictions are not clear, because the rules have yet to be adopted. But Sweeney\u2019s analysis shows that the reduction in greenhouse gases will need to be eight times faster than the state has accomplished under the first climate change effort that started in 2006 \u2014\u00a0and the rate of reduction is twice as fast as what U.S. agreed to under the Paris climate agreement.\u00a0 California is already digging deep into state resources for the climate battle. It spends about $2 billion on energy efficiency and renewable-energy programs, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. And its regulatory trading systems redistribute several billion dollars a year. In total, the state allocates more on the climate battle than on state support for the University of California system. Mary Nichols, the longtime chairwoman of the air board, acknowledges that the scale and breadth of the ramped-up\u00a0regulatory effort to curtail greenhouse gases surpasses past programs. Risky is what's happening to the climate. \u2014 Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate change activist group 350.org \u201cIt is the biggest thing we have done yet in sheer volume,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires a level of coordination between different agencies that we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d Nichols added\u00a0that every past era of environmental regulation prompted similar concerns of economic Armageddon, which proved to be unfounded. \u201cIndividual industry sectors always overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits and assume that you will implement it in the dumbest possible way,\u201d she said. It actually doesn\u2019t much\u00a0matter to the climate\u00a0whether California hits its goal of\u00a0cutting emissions by 40%,\u00a0because the state accounts for only 1% of worldwide emissions, said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley business professor and expert on renewable energy. \u00a0\u201cMore important is the technology and practices that can be exported to the rest of the world.\u201d Environmentalists\u00a0are quick to point out that if Earth\u2019s weather patterns continue\u00a0to go\u00a0haywire, it won\u2019t just be California\u2019s economy that comes unglued. \u00a0 \u201cRisky is what's happening to the climate,\u201d said environmentalist and author Bill McKibben. \u201cEverything else is just a challenge, which once upon a time Americans were good at stepping up to.\u201d\u00a0 A Nissan Leaf is plugged into an electric-vehicle charging station at the Malibu Country Mart. Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times A Nissan Leaf is plugged into an electric-vehicle charging station at the Malibu Country Mart. A Nissan Leaf is plugged into an electric-vehicle charging station at the Malibu Country Mart. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Critics, however, say that consigning Californians\u2019 economic well-being to untested regulatory systems is reckless, and the hit on wallets has already begun. Gasoline prices, for example,\u00a0are headed up under several very complex regulatory systems,\u00a0including the state\u2019s low-carbon fuel standard and the cap-and-trade auction market. And electricity prices will likely go up. At least half\u00a0of California\u2019s electricity must come from renewable sources by 2030, and though solar panel costs have dropped sharply and are subsidized by a 30% federal tax credit, existing long-term contracts already signed by utilities will likely continue to drive up the price of electricity, Borenstein said.\u00a0 The state\u2019s shift to natural gas for 60% of its in-state electricity generation could also lead\u00a0to higher electricity prices. Gas prices have spiked 115% since March, though the impact has not yet filtered down to consumers. Not once did anybody ask how we could do this. \u2014 Roger Isom, president of the California Cotton Growers and Ginners Assn. When gasoline or electricity prices go up, people tend to use less. Manufacturers, however, may leave the state. \u201cOver the long term, manufacturers will be choosing to put their money elsewhere,\u201d said Dorothy Rothrock, president of the California Manufacturing and Technology Assn. In 2000, California accounted for 5.6% of U.S. manufacturing investment. Today, it accounts for 1.8%, she said. A study by NERA, an economics research firm working for the manufacturers association, asserted that the climate goal could cost California households an average of $3,000 annually. The California Energy Commission and the Public Utilities Commission have their own extensive regulatory programs to reduce energy consumption, and the climate change legislation\u00a0will give them more legal backbone. We are at the point where we have to ask does agriculture fit into California\u2019s future. \u2014 Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno Farm Bureau The Energy Commission, for example, has a goal that by 2020 all new homes will have to meet a net zero energy mandate, meaning solar roofs will have to supply all the home\u2019s power while large amounts of insulation lower energy demand. Other rules apply later to government and commercial buildings. \u201cIt means buildings will be part of the solution,\u201d said energy commissioner David Hochschild. But Dave Cogdill, president of the California Building Industry Assn., said the goal\u00a0will add $45,000 to the average cost of a 2,500-square-foot home in California. The higher cost is likely to lead to fewer new homes, exacerbating the state\u2019s housing and employment\u00a0problems. And a slowdown in construction could\u00a0potentially reducing gross state product by $7.5 billion and employment by 75,000 jobs, said Brad Williams, an economist at Capitol Matrix Consulting who studied the legislation for the building association. An analysis by Jeff Greenblatt, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory expert on energy efficiency,\u00a0projects that significant improvements\u00a0of existing buildings will be necessary, but on a scale 30 times faster than the current rate of improvement. \u201cIt would be a huge lift. You could incentivize it, but I don\u2019t know how you would pay for it,\u201d he said. The effects of the new rules on California agribusiness could be even more significant.\u00a0 Martine Ledesma operates a \"crustbuster\" that compresses cotton into giant modules for handling at the Stone Land Company in Stratford, Calif.

(Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) \u201cWe are not saying we shouldn\u2019t do anything for the climate,\u201d said Roger Isom, president of the California Cotton Growers and Ginners Assn. \u201cBut it would be great if somebody was on the playing field with us. Not once did anybody ask how we could do this.\u201d Isom said the cotton industry is already in free fall.\u00a0 Dairies are also bracing for a difficult future, said Anja Raudabaugh, executive director of the Western Dairymen\u2019s Assn. Just this year, 53 dairies have gone bankrupt, left the state or simply closed their doors, a trend likely to accelerate, she said. \u201cThere is no way we can manage the reductions they want,\u201d she said. Dairy herds produce roughly 10 million metric tons of the greenhouse gas methane each year, a consequence of cow flatulence, burping and manure. Under SB 1383, that has to change. At a heated meeting in June, dairy officials pleaded with the Air Resources Board that they already reduced methane emissions.\u00a0Air board scientist Ryan McCarthy suggested that new technology could help, and the discussion turned to an experimental system from Argentina that would capture gas in a backpack on each cow through a hose inserted into their digestive system. \u201cAll of our jaws hit the floor,\u201d\u00a0recalled Raudabaugh. \u201cIt is an outlandish scheme.\u201d Dairy worker Guillermo Sanchez tends to milking cows at Tom Barcellos' dairy farm in Porterville, Calif.

Dairy worker Guillermo Sanchez tends to milking cows at Tom Barcellos' dairy farm in Porterville, Calif. (Tomas Ovalle / For The Times) Many other agriculture sectors will be facing new challenges that will drive up costs, according to Daniel A. Sumner, a UC Davis professor and director of the\u00a0University of California Agricultural Issues Center.\u00a0\u201cAgriculture will be smaller along with the rest of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at the point where we have to ask does agriculture fit into California\u2019s future,\u201d said Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno Farm Bureau. \u201cWe can\u2019t take anything that happened this year and say this Legislature and this governor want the agriculture industry here.\u201d\u00a0 And as the economy changes, so will\u00a0people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 State law, for example,\u00a0requires development of denser urban communities, where residents will drive less. \u201cPeople need to stop driving around and stop buying throw-away merchandise,\u201d said Greenblatt, the Lawrence Berkeley scientist. That goal may\u00a0prove tough, given that Californians drove more than ever this summer, up 6% from last year. A 20% reduction in travel miles, currently about 190 billion annually, could be needed by 2030 to meet the state\u2019s climate goals,\u00a0according to estimates by the Air Resources Board. The agency says the public can walk, bike, ride share and use transit. \u201cIt is not draconian,\u201d McCarthy said.\u00a0 Many, in fact, say that the changes California\u2019s climate goals will spur are long overdue and will make Californians\u2019 lives better. Californians, said Nichols of the Air Resources Board, could have had cleaner air, more walkable, bikeable cities, and a head start on a vibrant green economy years ago. What impeded that, she said, is that \u201cthe entrenched power of the status quo wouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d ::: Regulations the air board is considering\u00a0 The Air Resources Board is in the early stages of formulating new regulations and reinforcing existing ones to achieve massively reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The agency released a draft of its ideas in early December, representing \u00a0the largest and most comprehensive regulatory effort in state history. Here are some of the possible approaches: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions at refineries by 20%. Electrify boilers. Increase renewable electricity by more than the existing 50% statewide requirement. Cut greenhouse gas emissions at oil and gas fields by at least 25%. Work with ports to develop \u201csuper-low emission efficient ships.\u201d Increase use of low-emission diesel fuels. Reduce the amount of driving across the state. Use fertilizers with lower nitrogen content. Cut organic waste going into landfills by 75%. Increase landfill fees. Improve freight transportation efficiency by 25% by 2030. Deploy more than 100,000 zero-emission freight vehicles by 2030. Have 4.3 million zero-emission vehicles operating by 2030. Develop zero-emission rail vehicles. Alter environmental rules to increase density in residential neighborhoods. Accelerate replacement of residential gas furnaces. Increase the large-scale storage of electricity. Develop new pipeline systems to transport renewable natural gas from farms and landfills to urban users. Modify the cap-and-trade auction system so that it covers the entire energy sector. Implement rules to require state pension funds to sell holdings in coal producing companies. Modify streets for more bicycle and foot travel.

    "text": "Lesley Stahl: Saudi Arabia? Benjamin Netanyahu: No comment. Lesley Stahl: I have to ask you, because it\u2019s the most fascinating of all: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are you actually developing an anti-Iran alliance in the Middle East? Benjamin Netanyahu: Doesn\u2019t have to be developed. It\u2019s there anyway. Israel is developing a whole skein of new alliances, in some cases with countries that have been challenging the U.S. around the world like Russia which has placed its troops in Syria, Israel\u2019s next door neighbor. Lesley Stahl: How would you describe your relationship with Russia right now? Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s amicable. But the minute Mr. Putin decided to put his military forces in Syria, I went to see him.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLook, here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \u00a0I\u2019m not intervening in Syria. But at the same time, if Syria tries to intervene with us, if Iran tries to use Syria to attack us, we\u2019ll stop it. Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re telling Mr. Putin that you will attack if you\u2019re attacked? Benjamin Netanyahu: I said, \u201cWe should avoid this.\u201d\u00a0 And he said \u201cI agree.\u201d\u00a0 So we coordinated between our militaries because no one wants an inadvertent Israeli-Russian clash. Lesley Stahl: You have a friendship with Mr. Putin, and a friendship with China. You seem to be inching toward an anti-American bloc. Benjamin Netanyahu: God, no.\u00a0 Let me tell you something\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Well, talk about that \u2018cause I think there\u2019s an impression of that. Benjamin Netanyahu: That\u2019s a false impression.\u00a0 First of all, there is, there is an irreplaceable ally.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the United States of America. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but here you are making friends with our adversaries\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: So no. You have relations with Russia and you have relations with China. We can have relations, economic relations, trade relations with other countries as you do.\u00a0 Why not? He has used economic and trade relations to improve Israel\u2019s standing in the world by selling and in some cases giving away its high-tech inventions. Israel boasts of more start-ups per capita than anywhere in the world, many based in Be\u2019er Sheva, and nations have lined up to buy drones, as India has, and cutting-edge agricultural technology, as China has. There\u2019s excitement about a new innovation that extracts drinking water out of air.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So this is Israeli diplomacy through technology? Benjamin Netanyahu: Exactly right. Lesley Stahl: Countries that used to vote against you regularly at the U.N., are now your clients. I mean African nations - . Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s a revolution there.\u00a0 We can\u2019t keep up. What\u2019s surprising is that he\u2019s making progress with all these countries without making any progress with the Palestinians, who\u2019ve lived under Israeli occupation in the West Bank for half a century. Lesley Stahl: What about the quality of Palestinians\u2019 lives. You know, it\u2019s 50 years since what people call \u201cthe occupation.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s 50 years. You still have checkpoints.\u00a0 People have to be cleared. Soldiers everywhere in their lives.\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Actually, I\u2019ve lifted checkpoints quite a bit and we\u2019re trying to create bridges and thoroughfares and so on so we can have freer movement. Palestinians know-- they look at Aleppo in Syria, and they look at Yemen, and they look at Libya, and they look at other places, and they know that our intention is coexistence. Lesley Stahl: You told us that Israel is less isolated today than it has been in many years in the past. And yet, at the same time, you\u2019re losing support in-- in Western Europe. Benjamin Netanyahu: Isolated?? All these countries are coming to Israel and it\u2019s a fantastic change. Lesley Stahl: But not Western Europe.\u00a0 Not you, your natural allies, or your older allies yet. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, they\u2019re coming\u2014 Lesley Stahl: They call you colonials. Benjamin Netanyahu: They\u2019re coming around too. Lesley Stahl: But they call you occupiers. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well they call us a lot of things but I think they\u2019re coming around too, I have to tell you. But criticism has spread, on U.S. campuses too. Lesley Stahl: There\u2019s a movement called BDS, to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel and its products, because of the Palestinian issue, the unresolved Palestinian issue. And this is the playbook that they used, you know, against Apartheid in South Africa\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s not about this or that issue. It\u2019s against the very existence of the State of Israel. Lesley Stahl: You know what they want? I know what they want.\u00a0 They want you to stop expanding and building settlements. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yea, well, we did. We stopped. We stopped in Gaza. We tore out the settlements and gave the Palestinians Gaza.\u00a0 And what happened?\u00a0 Did we get peace?\u00a0 We got 20,000 rockets on our heads and terror tunnels. Still, his critics argue that\u2019s not a justification. For the steady expansion of the settlements in the West Bank. Those settlements are smothering Palestinians\u2019 hope for their own separate state. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think the obsession, the focus on settlements as though this were the issue and this is the obstacle to peace, I disagree with that. Lesley Stahl: But it is an obstacle. I mean\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it\u2019s not an obstacle. Lesley Stahl:\u00a0 Well, you say that, but they don\u2019t say that. \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, but I\u2019ll say something else. The real reason we haven\u2019t had peace is because of a persistent refusal of the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state in any border. \u201cYou ask us to recognize you, I\u2019m willing to do that. I ask you to recognize us. Recognize the Jewish state, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d And if they do, this thing will begin to correct itself very quickly.\u00a0 It\u2019s a condition he doesn\u2019t put on his new friends.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Have any of the Arab states said they accept Israel as a Jewish state? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah they say a lot of things in various forms. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: And never actually said they accept you. Benjamin Netanyahu: Do they say it publicly at this point?\u00a0 Not yet.\u00a0 He acknowledges that the Arab states want to see movement on the Palestinian issue. \u00a0 But despite Washington\u2019s call for a halt, settlement expansion has continued, even after the U.S. gave Israel a $38 billion military aid package. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas recently greeted each other at the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres. But the two have not held open, direct negotiations in over six years, for which they blame each other.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: What kind of a state is it going to be if you just, you know, don\u2019t do anything? Benjamin Netanyahu: I\u2019m not going to just not do anything. I\u2019m going to do something. Lesley Stahl: Well, if you don\u2019t negotiate with the Palestinians\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019m willing to negotiate with them at any moment. Lesley Stahl: And if it doesn\u2019t happen? Benjamin Netanyahu: I haven\u2019t reversed my position.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said, \u201cLook, we will solve this because we want two nation states at peace and with the proper security arrangements. Lesley Stahl: You would be pushing for a two-state solution if that\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Two states for two peoples. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m focused.\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019d like to have President Trump, when he gets into the White House, help me work on that.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see if the Arab states can help me achieve that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new reality.\u00a0 A new possibility.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Paul Sancya / AP The president-elect has attended only a handful of intelligence briefings in the past month, and says it's no big deal \u2014 but Donald Trump and future White House Chief Strategist Steven Bannon's far-right-wing media arm once criticized President Obama for the same. Trump opined on Twitter (stated as \"Fact\") in September 2014 that Obama \"does not read his intelligence briefings...\" and mocked the president as \"Too busy I guess!\" Fact--Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD. Too busy I guess! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2014 Not only was Trump's claim without merit , it was based on a dubious report from the conservative Government Accountability Institute \u2014 which was co-founded by Bannon. The GAI report claimed that Obama had only attended 42 percent of his briefings between Jan. 20, 2009 and Sept. 29, 2014, pulling its data from the president's public schedule as reported by WhiteHouse.gov and Politico. The president-elect also shared a Washington Post op-ed written by former Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen that used the GAI's report's data and questioned Obama's priorities. Priorities--while fundraising and campaigning on our dime, Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefings http://t.co/IhiIaKPa \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2012 The Washington Post's fact-checkers later investigated Thiessen and the Government Accountability Institute's claim and awarded it \"Three Pinocchios\" \u2014 meaning that it contained significant factual errors and/or obvious contradictions. Nevertheless, Breitbart \u2014 the alt-right-leaning news outlet which offered Trump resounding support before and after the site's executive chair, Bannon, left to run Trump's campaign in August 2016 \u2014 called the report \"alarming\" in a 2014 article and said it signaled a \"lack of engagement and interest\" by the president. The Breitbart piece noted that the Presidential Daily Briefings would \"allow the Commander-in-Chief the chance for critical followup [sic], feedback, questions, and the challenging of flawed intelligence assumptions.\" Related: Intelligence Agencies Distressed by Trump's Rejection of Findings on Russia Now, two years later, Trump has changed his tune and told Chris Wallace in a \"Fox News Sunday\" interview that he does not need the daily briefings. \"You know, I'm, like, a smart person,\" the president-elect said. \"I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Could be eight years \u2014 but eight years. I don't need that. But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know.'\" Phil McCausland ",

Throughout the war, black troops were an essential component in a war effort marked by razor thin margins of victory. By the time the Battle of Yorktown commenced, nearly one quarter of the rebel forces on hand were slaves. These troops prove essential to victory, the surrender of the British, and the American independence that, ironically, they were not able to share in. This special \"Forgotten Heroes\" installment is part of the 10-episode \"Legends & Lies\" series that dispels historical exaggerations and falsehoods that have developed over the years.

Rand Paul: I'm an 'Automatic No' on John Bolton 0 Shares Email Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President-elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money. The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News' \"This Week\" that he \"won't vote for a budget that never balances\" and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him. \"The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we're for the balanced budget amendment , and yet the budget we're going to introduce, that we're going to repeal Obamacare with never balances?\" Paul said. Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare. Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible. \"All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget,\" Paul said. \"I don't know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won't vote for a budget that never balances,\" he said. Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is \"going to reserve judgment on Tillerson.\" But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state. \"I'll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive,\" Paul said. \"He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War . He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran . He wants to do regime change in Iran.\" \"John Bolton doesn't get it,\" Paul said. ",

Similar conditions are forecast for parts of the upper Midwest and the Northeast. (Dec. 10) AP Pittsburgh Steelers fans sit in snow covered seats prior to an NFL football game between the Buffalo Bills and the Steelers, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2016, in Orchard Park, N.Y. (Photo: Adrian Kraus, AP) A winter storm's unrelenting march across the nation's northern tier brought snow to a handful of states Sunday and promised plunging temperatures that could drive frost\u00a0as far south as Atlanta by week's end. \"It may not set records, but it will be really, really cold,\" Bruce Sullivan, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, told USA TODAY. \"The thing is,\u00a0it's not even winter yet.\" Parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin were among states blasted Sunday by a band dumping up to eight inches of snow more than a week before winter officially begins. A few areas, such as Granite Falls, Minn., are reaching double-digit accumulations. At Detroit's Metro Airport, a Delta flight from Buffalo slid off a snow-covered runway, but no injuries were reported.\u00a0Detroit was bracing\u00a0for up to 10 inches of snow Sunday and Monday. Chicago faced almost as much. Airlines grounded more than 1,800 flights nationwide.\u00a0Chicago's O\u2019Hare was the hardest-hit airport; more than 1,200 flights had been canceled as of 7 p.m. ET,\u00a0 according to flight-tracking service FlightAware . On Monday, the snow is\u00a0forecast to roll into Upstate New York and parts of New England. A wide swath of the region could see up to six inches, with more in the mountains. New York City was bracing for snow Sunday night that was expected to turn to rain by Monday, the National Weather Service said. Snow grounds 1,500 flights in Chicago, Midwest Next up:\u00a0an Arctic blast. Blame the Polar Vortex, similar to the one that rocked the U.S. in January 2014, which is poised to drive\u00a0demand for wool hats, mittens and leggings. The Polar Vortex, lest we forget, is a massive area of high pressure and cold air that lingers around the North Pole. Sometimes it expands, allowing it to leak down over North America via the jet stream, the weather service explains. The translation for North Dakota and Minnesota will be temperatures that in some areas fail to reach 0 degrees\u00a0\u2014 for daytime highs. In Washington D.C., temperatures could fail to bounce above freezing Thursday or Friday. Cleveland will rock a high of\u00a017 degrees Thursday. Even Atlanta could see temperatures dip below freezing Thursday night. But before that, there is snow in the Midwest to contend with. Chicago is Chicago, and snow is part of life. The airport may be struggling, but city streets and sanitation chief Charles Williams was not intimidated by the storm. \"We anticipate a normal morning rush on Monday,\" Williams told the\u00a0 Chicago Tribune . \"Everybody goes to work. No excuses to take off. The streets will be clear.\" Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh ",

AP hide caption toggle caption AP An image posted online Saturday by supporters of the ISIS militant group purports to show a gun-mounted vehicle operated by the group firing at Syrian troops north of Palmyra in Homs Provence, Syria. AP Months after ISIS was pushed out of Palmyra, the extremist group is again fighting for the Syrian city in the face of heavy air strikes by Russia's military. After early reports that ISIS had retaken the city, activists are now reporting that ISIS elements withdrew to escape air raids. From Beirut, NPR's Alice Fordham reports: \"Russia's defense ministry says its warplanes along with the Syrian army repelled all attacks on Palmyra. In a statement carried in Russian media, Russia said it conducted 64 airstrikes and killed 300 militants. It also said ISIS were using car bombs and rockets. \"The U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition says it also conducted a huge attack on ISIS close to Palmyra last week. Still, the offensive by the extremists is in itself a surprise. They were pushed out of Palmyra in March and are under intense pressure in their strongholds of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq.\" In addition to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site, Palmyra is situated near large oil fields in central Syria that have been a key objective for both ISIS fighters and Syria's government. Article continues after sponsorship On Saturday, members of the Syrian army fled from ISIS attacks and withdrew south of the city, according to a Voice of America report citing the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Today, the Britain-based monitoring group says Russian warplanes have continued an intense bombing campaign in the city, forcing ISIS fighters to move north and west of Palmyra. ",

    "text": "Email Former Attorney General Janet Reno, the first woman to hold the top Justice Department job who died last month, never took the easy way out when making the tougher decision was the right thing to do, ex-President Bill Clinton said at a memorial service Sunday. Clinton, who appointed Reno in 1993, told several hundred friends, family and colleagues that she didn't believe in political expediency or cutting corners. \"I don't believe Janet Reno ever cut a corner in her life. Not as a prosecutor and not as a person,\" Clinton said. The service was held at a Miami-Dade College campus not far from the Reno family home, where Reno died Nov. 7 at age 78 from complications from Parkinson's disease . She had battled the disease for 20 years, including most of her time as attorney general. Current U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch says Reno was a trailblazer for women and minority lawyers, recalling a conference early in her tenure as attorney general for African-American lawyers that proved pivotal for Lynch. In those days, Lynch recalled, \"main Justice\" \u2014 as the department's headquarters is widely known \u2014 was the territory of mostly older white men. \"She made us feel valued. She made us feel that we could do anything. And that was her gift,\" Lynch said. \"I was inspired by her. I wanted to be like her.\" Reno was involved in many major and controversial 1990s issues, including the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, the controversial return to Cuba of 5-year-old Elian Gonzalez and the Clintons' Whitewater probe. She also led the department through many major prosecutions, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case, the capture of \"Unabomber\" Theodore Kaczynski and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Clinton said the 1993 standoff in Waco was one of the most difficult moments of his young presidency when, with Reno leading the way, the decision was made to storm the compound amid allegations that children there were being abused during a 51-day standoff. The buildings caught fire and burned to the ground, killing 76 people including many children. Reno, Clinton said, never wavered in taking responsibility. \"She didn't wait. She knew it was a disaster. She went out and said 'I made the decision. It's my responsibility,'\" Clinton said. \"That's what she did for eight years. Up and down and up and down, she was there.\" President Barack Obama sent a letter of condolences and former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham of Florida also attended, with Clinton recalling that Graham was the first person to suggest Reno for the attorney general's position. The audience included many current and former state and federal prosecutors who worked with Reno over the years. Reno was Miami-Dade County's top prosecutor before she was elevated to attorney general by Clinton, and after leaving Washington she ran unsuccessfully for governor of Florida. Many people may also remember Reno as the subject of a recurring \"Saturday Night Live\" skit in which comedian Will Ferrell poked fun at her admittedly awkward style with \"Janet Reno's Dance Party.\" Reno appeared on the skit after leaving the Justice Department in 2001. Family and friends said in person Reno was warm, funny and compassionate, and she died in bed at home surrounded by people who loved her, said Rabbi Judith Siegel, who was there. \"She was surrounded by a circle of friends and family. We all sang and we all prayed together,\" Siegel recalled. \"She was a leader in her family, in her community, and in our nation.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/miamicurt 0 Shares ",

    "text": "<p>Tight end Jimmy Graham #88 of the Seattle Seahawks scores a touchdown against the Carolina Panthers at CenturyLink Field on Dec. 4, 2016 in Seattle, Washington.</p> Close Jonathan Ferrey, Getty Images A new proposed amendment to the\u00a0 Revised Code of Washington \u00a0would change laws currently prohibiting a private company, such as the Seattle Seahawks, from banning guns from stadiums on public land, CBS Sports\u2019 Will Brinson reports . It is not currently illegal to carry a firearm into a game under Washington law, but CenturyLink Field, as well as Safeco Field and any other stadium, are allowed to prohibit folks from bringing certain items, including firearms, into said stadiums. House Bill 1015, proposed by three Republican members of the state House of Representatives, would eliminate the stadiums\u2019 ability to \u201cprohibit persons with a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in any facility or on any grounds of a facility.\u201d CenturyLink, like Safeco, is located on public property. But it\u2019s run by a private enterprise -- one that prohibits people from bringing in guns. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2.\u00a0 A new section is added to chapter 36.102 RCW to read as follows:\u00a0 (1) A public stadium authority may not prohibit persons with a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in any facility or on any grounds of a facility that is owned, operated, managed, administered, controlled, or maintained by the public stadium authority, or leased or rented to a private or public entity by the public stadium authority. (2) A private entity that operates, manages, administers, controls, maintains, or leases or rents a facility from a public stadium authority may not prohibit persons with a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in the facility or on the grounds of the facility. \u00a0 Additionally, the law seeks to prohibit \u201cany local government\u201d from stopping folks from carrying guns into stadiums or convention centers, etc. \u00a0 A local governmental entity may not, whether by law, ordinance, regulation, rule, policy, or contractual agreement, prohibit persons with a valid concealed pistol license from carrying a concealed pistol in any stadium, convention center, arena, or similar facility, or on the grounds of any such facility, that is owned, operated, managed, administered, controlled, or maintained by the local governmental entity, or leased or rented to a private or public entity by the local governmental entity. The logistics of bringing a pistol into a stadium legally would be tricky to say the least, particularly when you consider the current restrictions on items allowed into NFL games. The league doesn\u2019t allow most\u00a0bags\u00a0in games, requiring fans to utilize clear plastic bags to bring items into games. It would be a stunning turn if the league suddenly allowed people to bring firearms into the stadium. And there\u2019s the whole matter of fan safety, of course. We saw in Raiders-Chiefs that people aren\u2019t afraid to fight in the stands of a football game following a couple of beers and a heated rivalry in a frigid night football game. Fighting in these situations is far from uncommon -- adding bullets and guns to these situations literally has deadly potential. The\u00a0 NFL \u00a0is hardly afraid to utilize its leverage in certain political situations, typically behind the scenes more than outright, and it would hardly be surprising to see the league cough loudly and inform local politicians that the passage of such a law would be greatly frowned upon. In the wake of\u00a0 the terror attacks in Paris , where a suicide squad targeted a major soccer match, police unions asked the NFL to reconsider its policy of barring off-duty and retired police officers from carrying guns inside stadiums. The NFL said no.\u00a0 The NFL implemented a stadium gun ban in 2013.\u00a0 The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports \u00a0an appeals court upheld the league\u2019s right to do so in August of 2015, after they were sued by Minnesota police organizations. In\u00a0 a letter defending the ban , Goodell said: \u201cIf permitted to carry concealed weapons, they create deconfliction issues for working law enforcement officers and increase the potential for \u201cblue-on-blue\u201d response confrontations. ... Moreover, off-duty law enforcement officers are not included in the on-site law enforcement chain of command or bound by department or agency-on-duty policies that that [sic] restrict their use of alcohol or subject them to other on-duty behavior standards.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports) Denver Broncos defensive players called Tennessee Titans wide receiver Harry Douglas dirty after a controversial hit in the Titans' 13-10 win Sunday. Douglas took a low shot at Broncos cornerback Chris Harris\u2019 knee in the second quarter. One play later, fellow Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib started a brawl when he tackled Douglas on the Titans\u2019 sideline. Talib received a personal foul, but clearly did not regret it. \u201cIt was a dirty play by a sorry player,\u201d Talib told reporters after the game. \u201cHe tried to do something dirty, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to beat his ass.\u201d Harris wrote on Twitter that he believed Douglas was trying to \u201cend my career\u201d and that he hoped the Titans receiver would be fined. Harris, who suffered an ACL injury in 2013, was able to return to the game. \u201cThank God for covering me cuz I thought my knee was gone,\u201d Harris wrote.

More than 1,390 flights were canceled in Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports \u2014 about half arrivals and half departures, flight-tracking website FlightAware reported. O'Hare recorded 3.9 inches of snowfall and Midway recorded 3.7 as of noon on Sunday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said. By Sunday afternoon, 213 flights had been cancelled at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, according to FlightAware. Across the United States, more than 2,000 flights were delayed on Sunday, according to FlightAware, although not necessarily all of them were due to weather. Additional snowfall was forecast from Minnesota across the Great Lakes on Sunday, heading into parts of the Northeast by evening, Frank Giannasca, senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel, told NBC News. As much as 5 to 8 inches of additional snowfall was expected across the lower Great Lakes towards parts of the interior Northeast, he said. The storm had dumped more than half a foot of snow on parts of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin by early Sunday afternoon, according to the Weather Channel .

Airport (@fly2ohare) December 11, 2016 People traveling across the Great Lakes and parts of the Midwest, and from Pennsylvania and up through Michigan and Chicago would be \"dealing with periods of snow and probably some snow covered roads\" in areas where it may be hard for crews to keep up, Giannasca said. Chicago could see a total of 7 to 12 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said, and it and the region was under a winter storm warning through Sunday night. The city was bracing for plunging temperatures that are expected to send the thermometer to around 8 degrees next week. Post by NBC News . \"This is certainly going to be the coldest air this year,\" Weather Channel meteorologist Kelly Cass said. Map depicting snow cover from light to heavy across the U.S. at 1:10 a.m. ET on Sunday. The Weather Channel A swath of the country from South Dakota to Vermont was under a winter weather advisory early Sunday, the weather service said. The storm could bring up to 7 more inches of snow to the coast of Lake Erie in Ohio. In Kirtland, Ohio, east of Cleveland, nearly 33 inches of snow had fallen over the course of the storm as of Saturday morning, the weather service said. An additional 5 to 8 inches of snow was also expected in Detroit, the Weather Channel said, and close to five inches were forecast in Cleveland. A plane slid off the runway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport Sunday at around 11:30 a.m., Delta Air Lines said in a statement. The flight landed and was turning from the runway onto the taxiway \"when it left the pavement, stopping in the snowy grass,\" Delta said. No injuries were reported and the aircraft was towed to the maintenance hangar for inspection, the airline said. A Federal Aviation Administration source told NBC News the incident looked like the result of \"poor braking conditions,\" noting that the runway was wet and snowy.

The city's fire and rescue service said it responded to 378 emergencies into Friday evening, and on Saturday it rescued around 100 people trapped on a darkened train after a high voltage line was downed.

Snow was expected to continue falling in the Northeast Monday through the evening, impacting a swath from northern Pennsylvania to New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, according to the Weather Channel. While New York City could get snow early Monday, it is more likely to turn into rain, forecasters said. Around 3 inches could fall north of the city, throughout Connecticut and in Boston by the time it's all over, forecasters said. Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., were also expected to see rain into Monday morning. Another round of snow was in store for the Pacific Northwest and the Plains this weekend. By Monday, snow totals will reach as much as 2 feet in some parts of Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, The Weather Channel reported. There was some good news for commuters for the rest of the week, Giannasca said. \"By tomorrow really the worst of the storm will be over, except for Maine,\" he said. \"It'll be winding down everywhere else after the morning.\" But the storm's departure was set to bring frigid temperatures afterward to the Midwest and Northeast by mid-week, according to the Weather Channel, with some areas featuring temperatures up to 30 degrees below average.

Time President-elect Donald Trump, center, speaks with members of the military in a box in the stands during the Army-Navy college football game at M&T; Bank Stadium, Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016, in Baltimore. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) Donald Trump says\u00a0it's \"ridiculous\" to believe Moscow helped him win the presidency and he rejects\u00a0intelligence findings that Russia intervened in the U.S. election. \"I think it's just another excuse,\" Trump said in an interview aired on\u00a0Fox News Sunday. \"I don't believe it ... Every week it's another excuse.\" During the interview, Trump also appeared to reject the idea of setting up a blind trust to manage his assets during his presidency, saying that his \"executives\" and his children would run his companies in his absence. Democrats and some Republicans have called for hearings and investigations into the CIA's conclusion that Russia authorized hacking and other tactics in order to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., issued a joint statement Sunday with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling for a bipartisan effort to explore the allegations and defend the nation against cyber attacks. The two were joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Sen, Jack Reed, D-R.I., the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"For years, foreign adversaries have directed cyberattacks at America's physical, economic, and military infrastructure, while stealing our intellectual property,\" their statement said. \"Now our democratic institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American.\" In his Fox interview, Trump said Democrats are pushing the idea of Russian involvement in an effort to explain their surprise election loss. He also said there's no way to know if Russia was behind the hacking of e-mail accounts belonging to Democratic and Clinton campaign officials. \"Once they hack if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them,\" Trump said. \"They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place.\" Russia is believed to be a topic of presidential intelligence briefings, though Trump does not receive them every day.\u00a0He told Fox News Sunday that he receives the briefing \"when I need it,\" because it tends to the same information day-to-day. \"I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\" Trump said, noting that Vice President-elect Mike Pence is receiving frequent briefings. Trump told Fox that \"very good people\" do the briefings, and he has told them: \"'If\u00a0something should change from this point, immediately call me.\u00a0 I'm available on one-minute's notice.'\" In other parts of the interview, Trump said: \u2022 Executives and his children will run his various companies. The New York City businessman said liquidating his assets and placing the proceeds in a blind trust would be impractical and time-consuming because so much his business involves real estate. \"You know, when you sell real estate that's not like going out and selling a stock,\" Trump said. \"That \u00a0takes a long time.\" Said Trump: \"My executives will run it with my children. \u00a0It's a big company, it's a great company. \u00a0But I'm going to have nothing to do with management.\" Trump dismissed suggestions that foreign governments and others would try to buy influence by buying into Trump products, such as staying at his new hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. His focus is on being president, Trump said, and he has rejected business deals in the wake of his political campaign. \"I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest,\" Trump said. \u2022 He is \"open-minded\" about human impact on climate change, and what can be done about it. \"Look, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows,\" Trump said. \"It's not something that's so hard and fast.\" While he is \"studying\" the Paris climate change agreement with other countries, Trump indicated he would re-start the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines after he takes office Jan. 20. The Obama administration blocked both pipelines. \u2022\u00a0He is \"getting very close\" to naming a secretary of state. Aides have identified ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as a leading candidate for the State Department post. Asked about Tillerson, Trump said that he's \"much more than a business executive,\" and knows government officials around the world. \"He knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\" Trump said. \"He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company \u2014 not for himself \u2014 for the company.\" Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to say he has not made a final decision: \"Whether I choose him or not for 'State'- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!\" \u2022 Said the president of Taiwan called him to congratulate him, and that it would have been \"disrespectful\" to have turned down the offer. Given China's objections to the call, Trump suggested he is not necessarily bound by the decades-old\u00a0\"one China\" policy in which the U.S. recognizes only the government of mainland China. \"I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\" Trump said. 14124 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 568 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hA7YNo ",

By Chris Cillizza December 11 at 1:14 PM Follow @thefix The election of Donald Trump was a through-the-looking-glass moment in American politics. As in, everything that we \u2014 the collective political horde \u2014 thought was conclusive about how you win an election (outspend your opponent, build a better organization, lead in polling, run more TV ads) was disproved in one fell swoop on Nov. 8. Trump did everything wrong \u2014 by these traditional standards \u2014 and he won. And it wasn\u2019t the first time. The traditional rules of the road would have meant that Trump never rose beyond the 1 percent of the vote with which he started the Republican primary-season fight. The idea that a candidate could bully and insult his way to the Republican nomination over 16 (largely) serious candidates was simply unthinkable. The\u00a0\u201crules\u201d said it couldn\u2019t happen. Trump, to his immense credit, understood that a) flouting the rules actually endeared him to a big swath of voters and b) there just might not be any real rules at all. That insight allowed him to play a totally different game in both the primaries and the general election. While the political establishment was tut-tutting over Trump\u2019s fight with a Gold Star family or his comments about the weight of a former Miss Universe, the real\u00a0estate mogul was in the process of remaking how political campaigns are won.\u00a0Through a combination of a massive social-media presence, his celebrity and the belief \u2014 disproved by facts, but no matter! \u2014 that he was a straight shooter, Trump took every rule of the game and not just broke it but smashed it. The Fix's Callum Borchers explains the history of the \u201cprotective pool\u201d of reporters that traditionally follows the president, and recounts a few times when a protective pool ended up being critical. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) All of which meant that on Nov. 9, the political establishment was left to look at the shards of conventional wisdom scattered everywhere to try to find meaning. How did we do it? In most cases, by falling back on the very same assumptions and analytical points that led us to miss\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump, president\u201d so, so badly. \u00a0 [10 Post reporters look back on chronicling an unconventional campaign] How could Trump chat with the Taiwanese president, breaking decades of protocol and potentially endangering our fragile detente with China? How could he pick \u2014 or be on the verge of picking \u2014 the chief executive of ExxonMobil as secretary of state? Or Ben Carson, a doctor, to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development? Or, more parochially for reporters but no less hidebound by tradition, not agree to have a protective press pool follow him wherever he goes? Or a hundred other smaller breaks with\u00a0\u201cthe way things are done\u201d that Trump has engineered over the past month or so? The simple truth is that Trump\u2019s transition process has been a logical continuation of the campaign he ran: a total disregard for the established methods and the rules governing those methods. If you back Trump, you are undoubtedly thrilled with these moves, believing that he promised radical change in a broken Washington and is delivering on it. If you oppose Trump, you see his flouting of the established order as not only risky, but also deeply dangerous. I take no side in that fight. But I do think that it\u2019s absolutely necessary to avoid using the old measures of success or failure to assess Trump. He has proved, repeatedly, that those metrics simply do not apply to him. To continue to analyze him and his moves as we would, say, President Jeb Bush or President Hillary Clinton, is to ignore the fact that any traditional analysis of the campaign Trump ran would never have put him anywhere near the White House. [\u2018I will give you everything.\u2019 Here are 282 of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises.] Two major questions remain: 1. Is Trump\u2019s ability to innovate in the political campaign space \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what he has done, whether you like it or not \u2014 something that can carry over to his time in the White House? Do voters want something different in a president than they want in a presidential candidate? If so, Trump\u2019s unwillingness to change could badly damage his presidency. 2. Is Trump an exception in politics or the new rule? Is it his unique combination of celebrity, social media and brashness coupled with these deeply anti-political times a one-off? Or does he represent a new normal in politics? Will the 2020 campaign be filled with Trump takeoffs \u2014 Mark Cuban, Howard Schultz, Kanye West(?) \u2014 or will it be the usual assortment of governors, senators and House members? I don\u2019t know.\u00a0What I do know is that Trump is like nothing else we\u2019ve ever seen in modern American politics.

    "text": "Do the McCaskeys need a consultant to tell them how bad their team and coach are? Photos of John Fox, the Bears'\u00a015th head coach. Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Shortly before the Bears proved to be less miserable than the 49ers, the Rams gave Jeff Fisher a two-year contract extension even though he hasn\u2019t been over .500 in seven seasons, including this one, and I\u2019m thinking, man, the death-spiraling Bears just have to switch to the NFC West . But then I looked it up, and you won\u2019t believe this. Or maybe you will. Either way, here goes: Fisher is a miserable 11-17 the last two seasons, while John Fox is worse at 9-19 even after the Bears\u2019 win over Prairie View A&M last week. Go back a little more, and Fisher is a pathetic 24-36 in the last four seasons, while Fox and Marc Trestman are a combined 22-38 in that time. Yes, the last two Bears coaches are worse than one of the most overrated and overpaid coaches of all-time. Maybe the McCaskeys could hire a consultant to tell them they\u2019re doing a lousy job running a football organization. John Fox having to talk about a reported rift with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and Fangio\u2019s possible exit after this season: The story assumes Fox will come back next season. Seriously? Why is that such a sure thing? Has anybody watched this team? Somebody should address... Here\u2019s the problem with John Fox having to talk about a reported rift with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and Fangio\u2019s possible exit after this season: The story assumes Fox will come back next season. Seriously? Why is that such a sure thing? Has anybody watched this team? Somebody should address... (Steve Rosenbloom) Yet again, Fox was being questioned about yet another clock management decision. That\u2019s the second week in a row, and at least the third of the season, I believe. Somehow somewhere in his answer, Fox said he was trying to \u201ceducate\u2019\u2019 Bears fans. I have no idea how he connected those dots, but I know this: Getting clock management tips from Fox is like getting a leadership lecture from Rajon Rondo. Adrian Amos was inactive last Sunday because of a left foot injury, meaning the Bears had a void at safeties who couldn\u2019t intercept a pass. Receiver Marquess Wilson came out of the game injured. Because that\u2019s what he does. In the remaining part of a season that devolved into being useful only for evaluating young players, the Bears made rookie defensive lineman Jonathan Bullard inactive on merit, or lack of it. After watching center Hroniss Grasu, I guess we should wonder whether Ryan Pace goes on walkabout during the third round of the draft. In comparing this year\u2019s lousy Jets team with his last lousy Bears team,\u00a0 Brandon Marshall said the Bears locker room was \"100 times worse because their locker room was divided.\" Yeah, dude, because of you. The locker room was divided because of you. You were so bad, you dumped on the kicker. But hey, congratulations on extending your career-long streak of missing the playoffs to 11 seasons. The White Sox traded the dim and tiresome Adam Eaton to the Nationals for three prospects who likely have the good sense not to think 14-year-old Drake LaRoche is a leader.

Here's a look at who they are. Yoan Moncada Positions: Second base, third base. Prospect ranking: No. 1 in baseball by Baseball America and MLB.com last year. Highest level achieved:... The White Sox acquired four Red Sox prospects in exchange for five-time All-Star Chris Sale on Tuesday. Here's a look at who they are. Yoan Moncada Positions: Second base, third base. Prospect ranking: No. 1 in baseball by Baseball America and MLB.com last year. Highest level achieved:... (Colleen Kane) It\u2019s curious the way the Sox landed Lucas Giolito . He reportedly was the big name in the package the Nationals offered for Chris Sale , which is totally understandable. If you\u2019re going after a Cy Young candidate, you\u2019re giving up the No. 3 prospect in baseball. But after Sale went to the Red Sox , the Nationals put Giolito in the deal to acquire Eaton, a corner outfielder whose value the Nationals plan to lower by playing him in center. Which makes me wonder whether one of these two things could be true: Nationals GM Mike Rizzo is trying to get fired or the Nationals have self-scouted Giolito enough to know his arrow is pointing down and they\u2019re selling at his peak value. The Dodgers reportedly have talked to the Sox about Todd Frazier and asked the Twins about Brian Dozier. I assume the Sox would be happy with either guy getting traded. You Sox fans unhappy with the trade of Sale: Would it make you feel better if Sale helped the Red Sox beat the Cubs in the World Series ? Cubs manager Joe Maddon , on new closer Wade Davis : \u201cYou\u2019re going to love him.\" Especially if he can hold a three-run lead late in Game 7 of the World Series. The Cubs will raise ticket prices by an average of almost 20 percent. The good seats are going up by more than 30 percent. The good new is, ticket increases can\u2019t be bigger after their next few World Series championships. Jed Hoyer said he envisions that Maddon and catcher Miguel Montero will kiss and make up. Montero said he was frustrated by not being told his role. Isn\u2019t a player\u2019s role to play when the manager tells him to and prepare as if he\u2019ll play even when he\u2019s not in the lineup? New Eaton teammate Bryce Harper reportedly wants a 10-year, $400 million contract extension from the Nationals, and I\u2019m thinking, pretty soon Major League Baseball will have to change the rules to start allowing player-owners. Yeah, sure, now that he has somehow earned entry into the Hall of Fame, former commissioner Bud Selig thinks \u201cmaybe I should\u2019ve said more about steroids.\u2019\u2019 I assume he will be inducted in the Enabler Wing. The Diamondbacks tweeted that former Cub Dan Haren was hired as pitching strategist. Haren then tweeted: \u201c*will also teach young pitchers how to tweet*\u2019\u2019 Beating the best teams and losing to the NBA \u2019s detritus tells you the Bulls are mentally and emotionally weak. If we\u2019re not quite sure what kind of team these Bulls are so far, we know they\u2019re at least that right now. And now the Bears head to Detroit to protect their playoff tiebreaker over the Lions . What\u2019s up, Wayne Fontes? ",

Puskar / AP Former Coltsp resident and general manager \u00a0Bill Polian delivers his speech during an induction ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Canton, Ohio. Former Coltsp resident and general manager \u00a0Bill Polian delivers his speech during an induction ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Canton, Ohio. (Tom E. Puskar / AP) The best news for the Bears on Sunday happened somewhere other than their game in Detroit and it might not turn out to be much more than a rumor.\u00a0 But hey, it has to be more worthwhile than waiting for the Bears to commit another penalty. And so, the story goes that legendary executive Bill Polian would consider returning to an NFL front office under the right circumstances, according to a CBSSports.com report , and the Bears are expected to get into the bidding.\u00a0 Yes, Polian has been out of the day-to-day business of winning football games for a while, but then, so have the Bears. When Polian was active, he put together Buffalo\u2019s four straight Super Bowl teams in the early 1990s and then the Colts \u2019 Super Bowl champion that beat the Bears in 2006.\u00a0 In between, Polian put together the Carolina expansion team that nearly went to the Super Bowl in its second year of existence. Even at 74 and five years removed as Colts GM, Polian still brings more gravitas and institutional knowledge of the league than any random McCaskey or Ted Phillips. The Bears had a chance to hire Polian years ago, but it never happened. Perhaps it was a random McCaskey\u2019s unwillingness to cede power. Perhaps it was cash. That\u2019s always a favorite. Perhaps it was something else equally lame. But whatever the reasons, those reasons have to go away. Polian would be the football boss with the right to fire anyone. None of this cockamamie stuff about being forced to keep a coach or being forced to keep a GM. I couldn\u2019t imagine Polian taking the job any other way.\u00a0 And another thing: This wouldn\u2019t some kid GM. Let\u2019s see John Fox try to co-opt Polian\u2019s power. Yeah, I know, it\u2019s just a rumor, but hey, Bears rumors are far more interesting than Bears football. Photos from the Bears-Lions game in Detroit on Dec. 11, 2016, at Ford Field. So, basically, Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc\u2019s\u00a0pick-six only gave Matthew Stafford the chance to direct yet another game-winning drive in the fourth quarter. Matt Barkley \u2019s TD pass\u00a0to Cam Meredith down the right sideline was brilliant. In stride. Led the receiver to the end zone. Gave him a chance to beat the best cornerback on the opponent. Why can\u2019t Barkley do that before halftime? On their opening drive,\u00a0the Bears drove to the Lions 10, then Ted Larsen false-started, and before the next snap, the Bears were flagged for delay of game. Bearsness is mobile.\u00a0 The game ended\u00a0with Leno Jr. and Larsen costing the Bears 70 yards with holding penalties on huge completions that twice would\u2019ve left the Bears inside the Lions 20 in the last 90 seconds of a three-point game. Bearsness is not just mobile, it\u2019s indefatigable. But hey, at least\u00a0the Bears get a red zone participation ribbon. If you hadn\u2019t seen\u00a0CBS\u2019 graphic, would you have guessed that Lions offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter went to Tennessee? How bad is the NFC North if the Lions offense is the best part of the division leader and that unit is penalty-prone? Speaking of penalty-prone,\u00a0it will be easier to list the Bears cornerbacks who didn\u2019t commit pass interference. I can\u2019t figure out\u00a0if Bryce Callahan is making a lot of plays because he\u2019s good and getting better or that it just looks that way because he\u2019s in a fallow Bears secondary. Oops, no, wait,\u00a0Callahan PI. Never mind. The Bears were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs Sunday. Of course, they were realistically eliminated in September. ",

Mr. Renzi stepped down last week after the defeat of a referendum on constitutional changes that he had hoped would streamline Italy\u2019s government. He staked his seat on the outcome , and failed. In a brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni, 62, said he had accepted the challenge of forming a new government out of a \u201csense of responsibility.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m aware of the urgency to give Italy a government in the fullness of its powers, to reassure the citizens and to face with utmost commitment and determination international, economic and social priorities, starting with the reconstruction of the quake-hit areas,\u201d Mr. Gentiloni said. In coming days, Mr. Gentiloni is expected to form a government using the same majority, led by the center-left Democratic Party, as his predecessor, and to then face a confidence vote before Parliament, perhaps as early as Tuesday.

For those reasons, the opposition, anti-establishment Five Star Movement has already called Mr. Gentiloni \u201cRenzi\u2019s avatar.\u201d Mr. Gentiloni, a journalist, has long worked in center-left parties. A communications minister in Romano Prodi\u2019s government until 2008, he has been in charge of Italy\u2019s foreign affairs for two years. He has advocated international support to stop violence in Libya and help for migrants who gather on those shores before risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean. This year, he lobbied with the Egyptian government to find out who was responsible for the death of a young Italian researcher in Cairo. In his brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni said he would work to clarify Italy\u2019s new electoral rules \u201cwith the necessary promptness.\u201d Disputes over the laws are a central obstacle to the country\u2019s holding a new election. In late January, Italy\u2019s Constitutional Court is scheduled to issue a much-awaited verdict on the current system, which may face an overhaul. Most of the opposition parties are calling for elections soon after, a year ahead of the due date in spring 2018. But Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, noted at the end of his consultations with Italy\u2019s political leaders that the Democratic Party still held a parliamentary majority. The decision whether and when to call elections, then, will rest in the hands of Mr. Mattarella. Mr. Renzi has all but vanished from Italy\u2019s political scene. Soon after moving boxes of \u201cbooks, clothes and notes\u201d out of Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister\u2019s residence, Mr. Renzi repeated that he had kept his promise to step aside if he lost the referendum, writing in a long Facebook post from his hometown in Tuscany. He also pledged to try again to reunite the country. \u201cOnly those who change can help a country as beautiful and difficult as Italy,\u201d he said, acknowledging his mistakes. ",

    "text": "Bomb Kills 25 at Egypt's Main Coptic Christian Cathedral By mariam fam and hamza hendawi, associated press CAIRO \u0097 Dec 11, 2016, 2:22 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Security forces secure the area outside St. Mark Cathedral in central Cairo, following a bomb blast, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2016. Egypt's official news agency says a blast at Cairo's main Coptic Christian cathedral has killed a few people and wounded others. (AP Photo/Nariman El Mofty) 0 Shares Email Sunday morning Mass was drawing to a close at the chapel next to St. Mark's Cathedral, the seat of Egypt's ancient Coptic Orthodox Church, when Magdy Ramzy said there suddenly was a \"shattering explosion like nothing I had ever heard before.\" A bomb ripped through the chapel in the cathedral complex in central Cairo, killing 25 people and wounding another 49, mostly women and children, one of the deadliest attacks on the country's Christian minority in recent memory. \"It felt like the world has turned upside-down,\" said the 59-year-old Ramzy, who was wounded behind the ear by shrapnel. He frantically searched the wrecked chapel, and then outside, for his wife, Sabah Wadie, Only later did he learn that she was killed, and his daughter-in-law and three of his grandchildren were wounded. Ramzy sobbed uncontrollably at the hospital as he leaned on relatives for support. \"This is one of the acts of terror that we used to watch on television. Now, we saw it with our own eyes,\" he told The Associated Press. The bombing of the Boutrossyia chapel \u2014 and another one Friday that killed six police \u2014 were grim reminders of Egypt's struggle to restore security and stability after nearly six years of turmoil. Egypt has seen a wave of attacks by Islamic militants since 2013, when the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi, a freely elected leader and a senior Muslim Brotherhood official. Many of his supporters blamed Christians for supporting his ouster, and scores of churches and other Christian-owned properties in southern Egypt were ransacked that year. Since 2013, authorities have waged a sweeping crackdown, outlawing the Muslim Brotherhood, jailing thousands of mostly Islamist dissidents and killing hundreds in street clashes. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's attack. One of the worst previous attacks against Christians by Islamic militants was a 2011 bombing at a church in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria that killed 21. The Islamic State group also has targeted Christians in the Sinai Peninsula, where it primarily goes after security forces. Most IS attacks in Egypt have been confined to security personnel and judicial officials. Friday's police bombing was claimed by a group that authorities say is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. That group \u2014 called \"Hasm,\" or \"Decisiveness\" \u2014 distanced itself from Sunday's attack in a statement that said it does not as a principle kill women, children, the elderly or worshippers. The Brotherhood, in a separate statement, condemned the attack. The bombings are almost certain to undermine the modest recovery in recent months by the vital tourism sector after years of slumping that followed the 2011 popular uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak . They also could bolster the argument used by the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi that stability and security are top priorities if Egypt is to prosper economically and avoid sliding into the kind of chaos and violence now seen in countries like Libya, Syria and Yemen. Sunday's bombing was condemned by government and religious leaders, and drew calls for unity between Egypt's Muslim majority and Christians, who account for about 10 percent of the country's 92 million people. Witnesses said the blast probably was caused by a bomb planted in the chapel. Bishop Moussa, a senior cleric, said there were unconfirmed reports of a woman posing as a worshipper leaving a bag in the women's section before slipping out. AP reporters who went in the chapel noted that the side where women are routinely seated suffered the worst damage. Pews were smeared with blood and stained glass windows and wooden cabinets were blown out. A broken pair of glasses lay next to a girl's boots with leopard spots and a pink ribbon. A chandelier dangled precariously and a wall clock was stopped at 9:57 a.m. \"I found bodies, many of them women, lying on the pews. It was a horrible scene,\" said church worker Attiya Mahrous, who rushed to the chapel after the blast. His clothes and hands were stained with blood and his hair was matted with dust. Men and women wailed and cried outside. \"I saw a headless woman being carried away,\" Mariam Shenouda said as she pounded her chest in grief. \"Everyone was in a state of shock.\" \"There were children,\" she added. \"What have they done to deserve this? I wish I had died with them instead of seeing these scenes.\" Pope Tawadros II, spiritual leader of Egypt's Orthodox Christians, cut short a visit to Greece to return home. State TV broadcast appeals by hospitals for blood donations, and el-Sissi declared three days of mourning. \"The pain felt by Egyptians now will not go to waste, but will instead result in an uncompromising decisiveness to hunt down and bring to trial whoever helped \u2014 through inciting, facilitating, participating or executing \u2014 in this heinous crime,\" a presidential statement quoted him as saying. Several hundred angry people gathered outside the cathedral, chanting anti-government slogans and calling for the firing of the interior minister, who is in charge of security. \"We sacrifice our soul and blood for the cross,\" some chanted. Others sang hymns and, raising their hands, shouted, \"Lord, have mercy.\" Scuffles broke out when protesters tried to push police lines to move closer to the cathedral, but there were no immediate reports of arrests. Police in full riot gear arrived later. Egypt's Christians have long complained of discrimination, saying they are denied top jobs in many fields, including academia and security forces. The church and many Christians have rallied behind el-Sissi, although there have been growing voices of dissent in the community. They say little has changed under his rule, with authorities failing to halt attacks on their churches and property. \"This government must resign, and if the president insists on keeping it, then he'd better resign as well,\" said Gerges Wadie, the brother of Ramzy's wife. He said he initially supported el-Sissi but now sees him as a \"failure.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Dec 11 2016, 4:09 pm ET GOP Opposition to Potential Trump Cabinet Nominees Grows by Liz Johnstone Concerns rising over secretary of state pick 6:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161211223721if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/830319171866\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Donald Trump's unified wall of partisan support has shown a few cracks over Cabinet appointments that run counter to both campaign promises and traditional Republican foreign policy ethos. Breitbart, the normally pro-Trump, right-wing website formerly run by top Trump adviser Steve Bannon, accused the president-elect putting foreign labor ahead of American workers by choosing fast food CEO Andrew Puzder to lead the Department of Labor. The Conservative Review, meanwhile, called Puzder an \"open border zealot.\" Meanwhile, Erick Erickson, a staunch Trump critic who applauded him for picking Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, wrote for his conservative website The Resurgent that nominating former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnunchin would mean the ratification of the \"status quo.\" But it was perhaps the news that Trump intends to tap ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson , who has ties to Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, that has engendered the most vocal opposition from elected officials within his party. Marco Rubio was one of the first Republicans to take a shot a Tillerson, with the Florida senator tweeting, \"Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState .\" Being a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState - MR \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 11, 2016 Sen. John McCain told NBC News on Saturday that Tillerson's ties to Russia would be the subject of any Senate confirmation hearing. On Fox News, he said the relationship was a \"matter of concern.\" \"You want to give the president of the United States the benefit of the doubt because the people have spoken. But Vladimir Putin is a thug, a bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying,\" McCain told Fox News. Tillerson, who has spent his entire career with the energy company that has dealings with dozens of foreign nations, was awarded the Order of Friendship from the Kremlin in 2013. Tillerson openly criticized the Obama Administration for imposing sanctions against Russia for invading Crimea in 2014, since those sanctions negatively affected ExxonMobil's lucrative oil deals in the country. To some, the news of Tillerson's expected nomination is the strongest indicator yet of how Trump intends to approach the United States' policy with regard to Russia. New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, which vets candidates, called Tillerson's potential nomination \"alarming and absurd.\" But blocking Tillerson \u2014 or any of Trump's nominees that require Senate confirmation \u2014 will be impossible without Republican support. Filibuster is no longer an option. Now, thanks to their deficit in the Senate, 48 seats to Republicans' 52 seats, the Democrats need at least three Republican senators to defect against partisan lines. I am a no on John Bolton for ANY position in the State Departement and will work to defeat his nomination to any post. \u2014 Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) December 11, 2016 Meanwhile, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he would be an \"automatic no\" vote against former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who sources told NBC News Trump will name as Tillerson's deputy secretary of state. Bolton argued forcefully in 2002 that Iraq had hidden weapons of mass destruction and continued to defend his position even after it was discovered that Iraq harbored no such weapons. \"John Bolton doesn't get it. He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran,\" Rand said. Trump, appealing to anti-interventionists on the campaign trail, repeatedly made the false claim claim that he was against the Iraq War ahead of the invasion. The news of Tillerson's expected nomination came a day after the CIA concluded that Russia interfered with the U.S. election with the intent of helping Trump win . In response to the CIA's analysis, McCain, along with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed, issued a joint statement. \"For years, foreign adversaries have directed cyberattacks at America's physical, economic, and military infrastructure, while stealing our intellectual property. Now our democratic institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\" they said . \"This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country.\" Liz Johnstone ",

Trump during a \u201cthank you\u201d rally on Friday in Grand Rapids, Mich. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he did not believe American intelligence assessments that Russia had intervened to help his candidacy, casting blame for the reports on Democrats, who he said were embarrassed about losing to him. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He also indicated that as president, he would not take the daily intelligence briefing that President Obama and his predecessors have received. Mr. Trump, who has received the briefing sparingly as president-elect, said that it was often repetitive and that he would take it \u201cwhen I need it.\u201d He said his vice president, Mike Pence, would receive the daily briefing. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years.\u201d He added that he had instructed the officials who give the briefing: \u201c\u2018If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I\u2019m available on a one-minute\u2019s notice.\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming dismissal of the importance of that daily interaction with intelligence agencies, as well as his claims of politically tainted intelligence reports on Russia, widened a breach between a president-elect and the agencies he will have to rely on to carry out priorities like fighting terrorism and deterring cyberattacks. His stance on the issue is also putting him increasingly at odds with senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including members of his own party, who say that the evidence of Russian interference is clear and warrants a congressional investigation. The Obama administration reached a consensus months ago that Russia was trying to meddle in the election. After initially believing that Russia\u2019s goal was to undermine American democratic processes, the intelligence agencies concluded a week after the vote that the Russian efforts had been intended, at least in their latter stages, to help Mr. Trump. The president-elect said those new reports were politically motivated. \u201cI think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,\u201d he said in the interview, recorded on Saturday. During the campaign, he also dismissed suggestions of Russian meddling. Pressed about why he did not believe the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions, Mr. Trump said there was disagreement among intelligence agencies about the extent and the origin of the hacking.

    "text": "Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Is Now Over 2 Million, But Don't Expect Big Changes A statement from his transition team on Friday in response to reports of the CIA assessment said, \"The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history.\" Trump also said in his Fox interview, \"I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country.\" The Short Answer Trump contends that the size of his victory was historic, which is not borne out by the results. Trump won 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232. That comfortably puts him above the required 270 electoral votes. But it's hard to argue this represents a landslide of historic proportions, given that out of 58 presidential elections, the winner has received more electoral votes in 37 contests. The Long Answer Trump's win is historic, but mainly because it was so unexpected. He was outpaced by Hillary Clinton on nearly every conventional metric applied to how a successful campaign is run. Trump was counted out by nearly every political professional, and most of the media. Even his own campaign allies were expecting a loss. So the voters delivered a truly historic upset on Election Day. By that measure, Trump's statement about \"one of the greatest defeats\" holds up. Comparing Trump's 306 electoral votes to recent history, he falls between the 2000 and 2004 razor-thin margins of George W. Bush, and Barack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012. 2000 \u2014 Bush 271, Gore 266 2004 \u2014 Bush 286, Kerry 251 2008 \u2014 Obama 365, McCain 173 2012 \u2014 Obama 332, Romney 206 2016 \u2014 Trump 306, Clinton 232 Article continues after sponsorship So on the historic score, Trump's margin is pretty average for recent elections, and way down the list if you go all the way back to the beginning of the nation. Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, recently calculated the electoral college margins in all 58 U.S. presidential elections, and showed Trump coming in 46th. Separately, there's the question of whether Trump's victory is a \"landslide.\" President Obama is sometimes said to have achieved \"electoral landslides,\" but that is even stretching historical standards. Clear landslides came most recently in the 1980s. Ronald Reagan won 489 electoral votes to Jimmy Carter's 49 in the 1980 election. Four years later, Reagan won 49 states, delivering him a 525 to 13 victory of Walter Mondale. In 1988, George H.W. Bush succeeded Reagan with a total of 426 electoral votes to Michael Dukakis's 111. Each of those Reagan and Bush victories came with an 8 to 9 percent margin in the popular vote, as icing on the cake. Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton by about 2.8 million votes. There have been five presidents who lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College. Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections hide caption toggle caption Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections To be certain, Trump's win the Electoral College is what matters. But his loss in the popular vote to Hillary Clinton is itself historic. At 2.8 million votes, Trump's deficit is by far the largest for any candidate who won the Electoral College and lost the popular vote. ",

    "text": "info <p>In this Thursday, April 3, 2008, file photo, former West Virginia congressman and Secretary of State Ken Hechler, left, discusses his novel \u201cWorking with Truman,\u201d with filmmaker Russ Barbour before watching an advance screening of the documentary about Ken\u2019s career in public office at the Marshall University Drinko Library, in Huntington, W.Va.&nbsp;</p> Close Mark Webb, AP CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- West Virginia statesman and author Ken Hechler, whose seven-decade career included stints in the Truman White House and Congress, has died. He was 102. Hechler\u2019s wife, Carol Hechler, said Sunday her husband died Saturday night at their home in Romney. In a statement Sunday, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin called Ken Hechler \u201ca true West Virginia treasure.\u201d Hechler served nine terms in Congress, where he championed civil rights legislation and fought for coal mine safety, strip mine regulations and black lung compensation. He later served four terms as West Virginia\u2019s secretary of state, becoming a common sight driving around Charleston in his trademark red Jeep. \u201cKen was a man of his word - a fierce advocate for West Virginians who was always willing to help any person in need,\u201d U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a statement. An Army combat historian in Europe during World War II, Hechler interviewed generals and front-line soldiers. He later was assigned to interview key German Third Reich leaders before they were charged and tried for war crimes. After President Harry S. Truman\u2019s 1948 re-election, Hechler landed research projects for the White House and eventually became a special assistant to Truman. He helped compile the official papers of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Truman. Among his writings included \u201cThe Bridge at Remagen,\u201d a 1955 nonfiction best-seller about a key Allied victory that became a 1969 film. Born Sept. 20, 1914, in Roslyn, New York, Hechler graduated from Swarthmore College and earned a master\u2019s degree and a doctoral degree in history and government from Columbia University. Drafted into the Army in 1942, Hechler trained to become a tank commander, although a violation of base regulations at Fort Knox, Kentucky, pushed his career in a different direction. In a 1985 interview with the Truman Presidential Museum and Library, he said the camp general caught him writing an autobiography after lights\u2019 out. \u201cI was using a flashlight under my blanket in bed,\u201d Hechler recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is the most remarkable autobiography. I don\u2019t think you ought to be a tank commander. I think we ought to assign you to something a little bit more useful in the Army.\u2019\u201d Hechler helped chronicle the 1944 Normandy invasion, the liberation of France, the Battle of the Bulge and the drive into Nazi Germany. In the thick of all but the D-Day landings, Hechler was awarded five battle stars as well as a Bronze Star. As a captain, Hechler recalled getting a tongue-lashing from Gen. George Patton for smearing the shiny officer\u2019s insignia on his uniform with grease to deter snipers. After the German surrender, Hechler interviewed field marshals Albert Kesselring and Wilhelm Keitel, Gen. Alfred Jodl, Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and supreme marshal Hermann Goering, among others. Hechler often recounted how Goering offered to lead Germany\u2019s remaining military alongside U.S. forces to \u201cknock hell out of the Russians.\u201d Hechler returned to teaching at Princeton following his discharge. After Truman\u2019s 1948 re-election, Hechler landed some White House research projects and eventually became a special assistant to Truman, writing speeches and other tasks, including helping the president tailor his whistle-stop train speeches. In 1957, Hechler landed a teaching job at Marshall University in Huntington and won the district\u2019s U.S. House seat the following year. While in Congress, Hechler marched to Selma, Alabama, with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965. He was re-elected eight times before a 1976 failed run for governor. He was elected secretary of state in 1984. As West Virginia\u2019s chief elections officer, his office helped uncover evidence that then-Mingo County Sheriff Johnie Owens arranged to sell his office for $100,000. Owens was convicted in 1988. Outspoken on environmental issues, Hechler ran in the 2010 special U.S. Senate race in West Virginia, largely so foes of mountaintop removal mining could register their opposition. He attracted more than 16,000 votes in the Democratic primary.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "Privacy Policy He has promised hearings, saying the Russian activity was \u201ca call to action,\u201d as has Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the few senators left from the Cold War era, when the Republican Party made opposition to the Soviet Union \u2014 and later deep suspicion of Russia \u2014 the centerpiece of its foreign policy. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said there was little doubt that the Russian government was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee . \u201cAll of the intelligence analysts who looked at it came to the conclusion that the tradecraft was very similar to the Russians,\u201d he said. Even one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, said on Friday that he had no doubt about Russia\u2019s culpability. His complaint was with the intelligence agencies, which he said had \u201crepeatedly\u201d failed \u201cto anticipate Putin\u2019s hostile actions,\u201d and with the Obama administration\u2019s lack of a punitive response. Mr. Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the intelligence agencies had \u201cignored pleas by numerous Intelligence Committee members to take more forceful action against the Kremlin\u2019s aggression.\u201d He added that the Obama administration had \u201csuddenly awoken to the threat.\u201d Like many Republicans, Mr. Nunes is threading a needle. His statement puts him in opposition to the position taken by Mr. Trump and his incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has traveled to Russia as a private citizen for RT, the state-controlled news operation, and attended a dinner with Mr. Putin. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Nunes\u2019s contention that Mr. Obama was captivated by a desire to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia is also notable, because Mr. Trump has said he is trying to do the same \u2014 though he is avoiding that term, which was made popular by Mrs. Clinton in her failed effort as secretary of state in 2009. There are splits both within the intelligence agencies and the congressional committees that oversee them. Officials say the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. have not always shared their findings with the F.B.I., which they often distrust. The question of how vigorously to investigate also has a political tinge: Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, for example, are pushing hard for a broad investigation, while some Republicans are resisting. Intelligence can also get politicized, of course, and one of the running debates about the disastrously mistaken assessments of Iraq that Mr. Trump often cites is whether the intelligence itself was tainted or whether the Bush White House read it selectively to support its march to war in 2003. But what is unfolding in the argument over the Russian hacking is more complex, because tracking the origin of cyberattacks is complicated. It is made all the harder by the fact that the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. do not want to reveal human sources or technical abilities, including American software implants in Russian computer networks. This much is known: In mid-2015, a hacking group long associated with the F.S.B. \u2014 the successor to the old Soviet K.G.B. \u2014 got inside the Democratic National Committee \u2019s computer systems. The intelligence gathering appeared to be fairly routine, and it was unsurprising: The Chinese, for instance, penetrated Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mr. McCain\u2019s presidential campaign communications in 2008. In the spring of 2016, a second group of Russian hackers, long associated with the G.R.U., a military intelligence agency, attacked the D.N.C. again, along with the private email accounts of prominent Washington figures like John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Those emails were ultimately published \u2014 a step the Russians had never taken before in the United States, though the tactic has been used often in former Soviet states and elsewhere in Europe. That moved the issue from espionage to an \u201cinformation operation\u201d with a political motive. One person who attended a classified briefing on the intelligence said that the investigators had explained that the malware used in the cyberattack on the D.N.C. matched tools previously used by hackers with proven ties to the Russian government. That sort of \u201cpattern analysis\u201d is common in cyberinvestigations, though it is not conclusive. But the intelligence agencies had more: They had managed to identify the individuals from the G.R.U. who oversaw the hacking efforts. That may have come from intercepted conversations, spying efforts, or implants in computer systems that allow the tracking of emails and text messages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In briefings to Mr. Obama and on Capitol Hill, intelligence agencies have said they now believe that what began as an effort to undermine the credibility of American elections morphed over time into a much more targeted effort to harm Mrs. Clinton, whom Mr. Putin has long accused of interfering in Russian parliamentary elections in 2011. But to hedge their bets before the election, according to the briefings, the Russians also targeted the Republican National Committee, Republican operatives and prominent members of the Republican establishment, like former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. However, few of those emails have ever surfaced, save for Mr. Powell\u2019s, which were critical of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign for trying to draw him into a defense of her use of a private computer server. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Sean Spicer, disputed the report in The Times that the intelligence community had concluded that the R.N.C. had been hacked. \u201cThe RNC was not \u2018hacked,\u2019\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThe @nytimes was told and chose to ignore.\u201d On Friday night, before The Times published its report, the committee had refused to comment.

(Photo: Winslow Townson, AP) Louisville football players James Hearns and Henry Famurewa were among three people shot near the school's campus early Sunday morning, according to WHAS-11 . Louisville spokesman John Karman would not confirm if any victims are student-athletes at the school. He said the university is not releasing any\u00a0names at this time. Yusuf Shakir, who coached Hearns at Lincoln High School in Tallahassee, Fla., said Hearns, who plays linebacker, told him he had been shot in the elbow and\u00a0that \u201che\u2019s OK,\u201d and, \u201cHe knows it could have been a lot worse.\u201d \u201cIf you go through something like that, you\u2019re happy to be alive,\" Shakir said. A 19-year-old student who attends Jefferson Community Technical College said he witnessed the shooting. He said he was at a party with Louisville athletes who were celebrating quarterback Lamar Jackson winning the Heisman Trophy. The JCTC student said he told police an argument ensued at the door before it eventually continued into the street. \u201cA few minutes later I heard chaos,\u201d said the JCTC student, who asked his name not be shared. \u201cIt was five or six guys just going at it, fighting on one side and then I see a flash come from the other side. Then I just took cover.\u201d Police\u00a0responded to a call of a shooting around 2 a.m. Sunday in the 1000 block of Manor Park Drive, an off-campus housing facility called The Retreat, close to the Louisville campus. When officers arrived, they located a male and female that had been shot. Both were taken to University Hospital with non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries. A third victim arrived a short time later to Jewish Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries from a gunshot wound. Police determined that all three injuries occurred at the same location. Louisville\u00a0sophomore Jayvon Smith\u00a0 told WHAS11 \u00a0he lives two doors down from the scene where students were gathering and celebrating Jackson being awarded Heisman into the early morning hours. Smith said people\u00a0started knocking on his door, saying people were shooting. \"It\u2019s always someone who comes from out in the city that usually have weapons or that mean to do any type of harm or violence,\" Smith told WHAS-11, \"but I just think the city of Louisville is really dangerous right now. Crime is just happening, and it's sad that is has to be involved on campus too.\" Shakir said Hearns told him the party had taken place in a track athlete\u2019s apartment. \u201cSome local guys decided to crash the party,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cOne of the guys started shooting into the crowd.\" Chelsea Roy, leasing and marketing manager at The Retreat, said the apartment complex is cooperating with Louisvllle Metro Police Department in the investigation and referred all other questions to police. Roy would not confirm the time of incident or any other details. The LMPD Major Crimes Unit is investigating. There are no suspects at this time. Nearly 500\u00a0people have been shot in Louisville through November this year, according to Police Chief Steve Conrad, which is an all-time record for the city. ",

    "text": "AP Last Updated Dec 11, 2016 3:40 PM EST BEIRUT - Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) militants re-occupied Palmyra on Sunday, taking the ancient central city from government troops in a major advance after a year of setbacks in Syria and neighboring Iraq, a Syrian government official and the group said. In retaking Palmyra, the extremist group appeared to be taking advantage of the Syrian and Russian preoccupation with Aleppo, timing its attack to coincide with a massive government offensive to capture the last remaining opposition-held neighborhoods in the northern city. Palmyra, with its towering 2,000-year-old ruins, holds mostly symbolic meaning in the wider Syrian civil war , although its location in central Syria gives it some strategic significance as well. ISIS militants re-entered the city on Saturday for the first time since they were expelled by Syrian and Russian forces amid much fanfare nine months ago. The government\u2019s first important win against the ISIS in the internationally renowned ancient city gave Damascus the chance to try to position itself as part of the global anti-terrorism campaign. The militants had spent 10 months in Palmyra , during which they dynamited a number of temples and destroyed other artifacts. View Gallery Syrian army soldiers drive past the Arch of Triumph in the historic city of Palmyra, in Homs Governorate, Syria in this April 1, 2016, file photo. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki/File Photo Sunday\u2019s takeover came hours after government troops and Russian air raids pushed the group out the city\u2019s parameters. ISIS militants then regrouped and attacked the city from multiple fronts, forcing government troops to retreat. Palmyra opposition activists said the militants were going door to door in the city, looking for remnants of government forces. Homs Province Governor Talal Barazi told the pan-Arab Mayadeen news channel that the IS attack on Palmyra is a \u201cdesperate\u201d reaction to the Syrian government military \u201cvictories\u201d on the ground.\u00a0 He said the forces that support terrorism including western countries, Saudi Arabia and Qatar wanted to \u201crealize some type of gain\u201d and chose Palmyra because of its international reputation. Scores of Syrian troops have reportedly been killed in fighting around Palmyra in the last few days. While the battles are a distraction from the fight in Aleppo, they are unlikely to affect the government\u2019s final push on the last rebel-held Aleppo neighborhoods. By Sunday evening, there was no sign that the army was shifting significant resources away from Aleppo for the fighting in central Syria. The government and its allies have reportedly mobilized some 40,000 fighters for Aleppo. \u201cI don\u2019t think the regime would withdraw forces from Aleppo to Palmyra and risk losing Aleppo,\u201d said Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the opposition monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \u201cI think the regime\u2019s priority now is to finish the battle for Aleppo before the end of the month for sure. As for Palmyra, the whole international community would stand by it against ISIS.\u201d Over the last year, ISIS has suffered a string of defeats in both Syria and Iraq, losing several towns and cities it had captured in 2014. It is now under attack in Mosul, the last major urban center it controls in Iraq. A Kurdish-led Syrian force, backed by the U.S., is also pushing toward Raqqa, the group\u2019s de-facto capital in Syria, from the north. Meanwhile, Turkey is backing Syrian opposition fighters who have reached the outskirts of al-Bab, the IS stronghold in northern Syria. In going for Palmyra, ISIS picked a soft target to demonstrate that despite its battlefield losses, it retains the ability to carry out large attacks. Mohammed Hassan al-Homsi, a native of the city who runs Palmyra News Network, said ISIS is steering away from north Syria where the anti-ISIS international coalition and Turkey have focused their fight. With its losses in Iraq and elsewhere in Syria, the militants are eyeing new terrain. They chose Palmyra for its desert terrain linked to Iraq\u2019s and its surrounding oil and gas fields, al-Homsi said. State news agency SANA, quoting an unnamed military official, reported that the militant group received reinforcements from Raqqa, enabling it to attack with \u201clarge numbers\u201d against military checkpoints around the city. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry laid some of the blame at the feet of the U.S.-led coalition, saying it had scaled down its operation against Raqqa and allowed thousands of ISIS fighters to escape from Mosul. The ministry statement said more than 4,000 ISIS fighters have been deployed for the Palmyra takeover, implying that the militants attacking Palmyra had recently left Mosul. The Observatory and the Palmyra Coordination group said ISIS militants fought their way into the city in a multi-pronged assault, forcing government forces to retreat to the south. A map distributed by the Observatory shows the areas controlled by ISIS to extend east, south and north of Palmyra, encompassing a number of strategic hills around the city and expanding the group\u2019s presence in rural Homs. Palmyra lies in Syria\u2019s largest province, Homs, which is mostly under government control. Osama al-Khatib, of the activist-run Palmyra Coordination group which keeps in touch with residents in the city, said remaining government and allied troops were escaping from the southwestern edge of the city where the ancient ruins are. He said the few remaining families in the city are also attempting to escape. Al-Homsi\u2019s Palmyra News Network said intensive airstrikes followed the ISIS takeover of the city. The group said ISIS fired on fleeing civilians while the group expanded its presence in rural areas around Palmyra. In a video by the ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency, ISIS fighters were shown roaming a main square in the city that appears deserted at the foothills of the citadel that overlooks the ruins and the Palmyra Museum. Russia had earlier claimed to have repelled an IS attack on Palmyra, saying it had launched 64 airstrikes overnight that killed 300 militants. But hours later, the activists said ISIS had seized a castle just outside the town that overlooks its famed Roman-era ruins. Palmyra was a major tourist attraction before the civil war broke out in 2011 and is home to world-famous Roman ruins. The capture of Palmyra last year by Syrian troops and Russia air force was seen as a major triumph for the government, which had previously had little success in battling the extremist group. After taking Palmyra, the two states turned their attention to wiping out the internal opposition in Damascus and Aleppo. After tightening the siege on the eastern part of Aleppo city, the most prized urban stronghold for the opposition, government and allied troops have been steadily carving into the besieged enclave in a ground offensive that began in late November. Syrian media reported Sunday that of the original 17 square miles rebel-held enclave, only 4 square miles remain in opposition hands. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Time An F-15E Strike Eagle (Photo: GS-6 Josh Plueger, XXX) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon\u00a0tracks every Islamic State fighter it kills and\u00a0reports\u00a0the body count regularly to\u00a0the highest levels, but refuses to discuss the toll publicly, USA TODAY has learned. A senior Defense official said last week that the total of 50,000 militants killed since the U.S.-led air war began in 2014 is likely a conservative estimate.\u00a0 Killing large numbers of enemy combatants affects their ability to fight and hold territory, said the official who, like other Defense officials\u00a0interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the body counts. Officials at the Pentagon and Central Command, which oversees combat against the group also known as ISIL, had agreed in November to release more detail on enemy killed-in-action figures and how they are tabulated to USA TODAY. But those officials backed out of the agreement.\u00a0The numbers are not classified, but military officials now refuse to talk about them, or to explain why. By contrast, the British military\u00a0releases estimates not only of enemy killed but also\u00a0those wounded and the type of weapon used. Commanders and officials at Central Command and at the Pentagon have received regular, sometimes weekly, updates of the number of ISIL fighters killed in U.S.-led attacks, a senior officer said. The Pentagon's refusal stems from its longstanding credo, echoed by top commanders like retired general\u00a0David Petraeus that it\u2019s impossible \u201cto kill or capture our way out\u201d counterinsurgencies like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their reticence also has roots in Vietnam when daily news briefings in Saigon, derided as the \u201c5 O\u2019Clock Follies,\u201d boasted body counts to show the war was being won, according to a second senior official\u00a0familiar with the reports and military analysts. \u201cPeople see such numbers as harkening back to Vietnam\u00a0when we misdiagnosed progress based on body counts,\"\u00a0said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution. The counts \"effectively turned field commanders into leaders incentivized to kill more in order to prove their merits,\u201d Another reason for the reticence: the killing only keeps pace with Islamic State recruiting. Despite 50,000 or more Islamic State fighters, the militants continue to field a force between 20,000 and 30,000, said the senior officer. Scott Murray, a retired Air Force colonel and intelligence expert who helped lead efforts to develop ISIL targets in the first part of the war, said counting the dead\u00a0has\u00a0been largely discredited as a tool to evaluate progress in war. \"It's that simple,\" Murray said. \"Body counts are part of the narrative of how to lose a war.\" But privately \u2014\u00a0and on rare occasion in public \u2014\u00a0senior battlefield commanders admit that killing and counting\u00a0Islamic State dead\u00a0matters. A lot, as it turns out. Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who led the allied war effort until this summer, tracked the number of enemy killed as one measure of progress. He told reporters at his last briefing in August that 25,000 ISIL fighters had been killed in the previous 11 months, an increase in the pace of lethal attacks. \u201cThe numbers are a best estimate \u2014\u00a0not exact, although the team tries hard to get it right,\u201d MacFarland said in an email.\u00a0\u201cThe best proof of their basic accuracy is the increasing momentum of the campaign. The enemy is unable to put fighters in the field in the same quantity and quality of a year ago.\u201d How they\u2019re counted The Pentagon has deployed a dizzying array of spy planes and other technology\u00a0to the Middle East to track enemy combatants, develop plans to attack targets and to assess what\u2019s been blown up and who has\u00a0been killed. Reaper and Predator drones loiter relentlessly in the skies over Iraq and Syria, providing video footage for commanders. Imagery also streams in from other warplanes tracking their bombs, missiles and rounds of ammunition from their cannons. Central Command and the Pentagon are quick to claim credit \u2014\u00a0down to the individual item \u2014 for ISIL equipment and materiel destroyed\u00a0in airstrikes. For instance, a news release Friday boasted of blowing up 168 oil tankers on Dec. 8 near Palmyra, Syria. The attack deprived ISIL of $2 million in revenue, the military said. Yet neither Central Command nor the military headquarters in Iraq responded to a query about whether truck drivers are considered fighters, and if any were killed in the airstrikes. Pentagon acknowledges riskier airstrikes, more civilian casualties Virtually every attack against ISIL\u00a0is documented by video cameras or infra-red devices that can peer through smoke or clouds, the second official\u00a0said. A missile that hits a motorcycle carrying two militants is scored as two enemy dead, the officer said. Infra-red devices can also detect the heat from dead bodies even hours\u00a0after an attack. The British military is more forthcoming about the human toll of its attacks.\u00a0It\u00a0estimates that British\u00a0warplanes have killed our wounded 1,915 ISIL fighters from Sept. 2014 to Nov. 2016, according to Ministry of Defence figures. Each attack, the type of weapon used and the number of \u00a0killed and wounded\u00a0has been made public. A Hellfire missile attack on May 1 of this year, for example, killed eight and wounded three ISIL militants. The significance of body counts Commanders\u00a0look at several measures to gauge progress against ISIL.\u00a0Across the map of Iraq and Syria, allied ground forces, assisted by U.S. commandos and advisers, have driven ISIL fighters from huge blocs of territory and are cornering them in the holdout cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told allies in Bahrain on Saturday that targeted attacks have decimated ISIL's leadership. Destruction of oil wells, another source of revenue, or banks that finance ISIL operations, is another benchmark. But the volume of enemy dead is still seen as a key metric, the second official\u00a0said. Top commanders in the field and in Washington are briefed, often daily, on the results of attacks by U.S. and allied warplanes on Islamic State targets and how many fighters perished in them. At first glance, the arithmetic doesn\u2019t add up to success, the second official\u00a0said. Despite killing 50,000, ISIL appears to replace fighters as quickly as it loses them. It has done so by aggressive recruiting that seems likely to continue. New rules allow more civilian casualties in air war against ISIL Would you rather have 80,000 ISIL fighters? this source asked. Or 30,000? Killing 50,000 has made a marked difference in their ability to fight and made recruits aware of the cost of joining, the second official\u00a0said. The military is left in a quandary when it comes to discussing the figures, O\u2019Hanlon said. Damned if they discuss them, damned if they don't. \u201cA reduction in body counts suggests the war isn\u2019t going so well,\u201d He said. \u201cAn increase means either there are more enemy than you thought or you are killing more innocents than you were before.\u00a0 It\u2019s just, from military leadership\u2019s point of view, a no-win proposition, especially in insurgencies where the supply of potential new recruits is often nearly limitless \u2014 so more attrition to the enemy, even if genuine, may not mean net progress in the campaign.\u201d 23 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hdGlNg ",

By Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell December 11 at 6:39 PM Follow @mikedebonis Follow @kelsey_snell Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President-elect Donald Trump is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law\u2019s insurance would go away. Hard-liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast. While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years. \u201cI\u2019d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,\u201d said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d efforts. \u201cWe have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats won\u2019t help with anything.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. 3. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Hatch and other high-ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections. Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the 84,000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two-thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy,\u201d Collins said. But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues \u2014 many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti-Obama waves of 2010 and 2014 \u2014 who see little reason to dawdle. \u201cThe history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that it\u2019ll never get done,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), elected recently as the new chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. \u201cRepublicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?\u201d Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot-dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a \u201cterrific\u201d replacement that will provide \u201cgreat health care at a fraction of the cost.\u201d The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare\u2019s sunset. But other fights loom \u2014 over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition. The battle lines, however, are familiar, with \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to retire. Come Jan.\u00a020, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health-care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan.\u00a03. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets. So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute. \u201cWe\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. \u201cThe number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people.\u201d Hard-liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill \u201cwith all deliberate speed\u201d but pledged only to then \u201cset into motion a process to replace it.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Republicans would move \u201cas well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people.\u201d Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing. \u201cThe idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace,\u201d he said. Conservative activists who pushed a take-no-prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited. \u201cWhen Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you don\u2019t wait,\u201d said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. \u201cI\u2019m a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. That\u2019s it.\u201d Democrats and many health-care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12\u00a0million Americans are covered under those policies. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed-door meeting. \u201cDelayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states,\u201d Burwell told reporters after the meeting. Republicans want to end Obamacare\u2019s system of penalties and subsidies. But many \u2014 including Trump \u2014 want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick. Experts warn that \u201crepeal and delay\u201d under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3\u00a0billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated. \u201cThat $3\u00a0billion is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Blumberg said. \u201cWith all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get.\u201d Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers. \u201cThe insurance industry should understand that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cThey signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, they\u2019re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free-market insurance industry.\u201d The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic. There will be a slim 52-to-48 Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes. Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan \u2014 and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so. \u201cWe all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all,\u201d Hatch said. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, has rejected that strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it,\u201d he told The Washington Post recently. But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well-organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction. One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal-and-replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11,000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks that you\u2019re going to flip a switch . . . but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done.\u201d Brandon was even blunter: \u201cThis is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies],\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? It\u2019s hard. \u201cThe political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place,\u201d he added. \u201cThe old excuses of having divided government, they\u2019re gone.\u201d A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. \u201cThey have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully they\u2019ll recognize that it\u2019s not quite so simple,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave. But many others are not. \u201cLiterally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), a first-termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to act on it.\u201d John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump last week in Columbus, Ohio. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump , defending his recent phone call with Taiwan\u2019s president , asserted in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States was not bound by the One China policy, the 44-year diplomatic understanding that underpins America\u2019s relationship with its biggest rival. Mr. Trump, speaking on Fox News, said he understood the principle of a single China that includes Taiwan, but declared, \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\u201d \u201cI mean, look,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201d Mr. Trump is not the first incoming Republican president to question the One China policy, but his suggestion that it could be used as a chip to correct Chinese behavior sets him apart, several Asia experts said. While Mr. Trump has been praised by some Republicans for taking a new look at China policy, his stance could risk a backlash by Beijing, the analysts said. Not since 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon and Mao Zedong enshrined the One China principle in the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9, has an American president or president-elect so publicly and explicitly questioned the agreement, which resulted in the United States\u2019 ending its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Chinese government issued no immediate response to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. But the comments are likely to reignite a debate that erupted nine days ago when he took a congratulatory phone call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan. At first, Mr. Trump played down the implications of the call, saying he was just being polite. Later, his aides said he was well aware of the diplomatic repercussions of speaking to Taiwan\u2019s leader. Lobbyists for Taiwan, including the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas , spent months laying the groundwork for the call. On Friday, China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has designated as his national security adviser, according to a person told about the meeting. It was not clear what the men had discussed. Some Republican foreign policy experts \u2014 including John R. Bolton, who is believed to be a front-runner for the post of deputy secretary of state \u2014 have praised Mr. Trump for shaking up a decades-old diplomatic agreement. As a candidate, Ronald Reagan criticized the decision to abrogate recognition of Taiwan; after his election, he invited a delegation from Taiwan to attend his inauguration, antagonizing Beijing. In 1982, as president, Reagan pushed for the so-called Six Assurances, one of which was a reaffirmation that the United States did not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, he abided by the terms of the 1979 joint communiqu\u00e9 that established relations between the United States and China. Photo President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan speaking on the phone with Mr. Trump this month at her office in Taipei, Taiwan. Credit Taiwan Presidential Office But Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the policy could be wielded as a chip in a broader negotiation with China has implications not just for Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing, several experts on Asia said, but also for America\u2019s support for Taiwan. \u201cBy putting One China up for grabs, Trump will suck all the oxygen out of the U.S.-China relationship, and it risks eventually trading away U.S. support for Taiwan for another U.S. interest,\u201d said Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere are good reasons why eight presidents since 1972 have relied on the One China policy,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is one area where the Trump team would do well to heed the lessons of history instead of bucking them in the uncertain hope of getting something.\u201d Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Medeiros\u2019s predecessor in the Obama administration, said the One China policy had \u201calways been seen as a foundation of the relationship.\u201d \u201cNow Trump apparently sees it as part of a broader set of new transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cMixing trade with an issue seen by Beijing as involving sovereignty is likely to produce an angry Chinese backlash and worsen both issues.\u201d An editorial on Monday in The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, said that Mr. Trump was \u201clike a child in his ignorance of foreign policy.\u201d \u201cThe One China policy cannot be bought and sold,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cTrump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price.\u201d Mr. Trump, however, did not appear worried about inflaming Beijing. He repeated in the Fox News interview many of the criticisms he has made about China, emphasizing what he said was its unwillingness to help curb the nuclear ambitions of its neighbor North Korea \u2014 an issue that foreign policy experts believe could confront Mr. Trump as the first geopolitical crisis of his presidency. The president-elect said he would not tolerate having the Chinese government dictate whether he could take a call from the president of Taiwan. He reiterated that he had not placed the call, and described it as \u201ca very short call saying, \u2018Congratulations, sir, on the victory.\u2019\u201d The Chinese government, which once viewed Mr. Trump favorably as an alternative to the hawkish Hillary Clinton, has struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach. China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, initially played down the significance of the phone call, calling it a \u201cpetty action by the Taiwan side\u201d that he said would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But as Mr. Trump has repeated his campaign criticisms of China \u2014 and as his statements about Taiwan have rippled throughout the region \u2014 Beijing has noticeably hardened its tone. It warned him last week, in a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People\u2019s Daily, that \u201ccreating troubles for the China-U.S. relationship is creating troubles for the U.S. itself.\u201d Advertisement In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. Trump, the editorial said that pushing China on Taiwan \u201cwould greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again.\u201d Christopher Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.

    "text": "Bears need reality check concerning futures of Vic Fangio and Matt Barkley Photos of John Fox, the Bears'\u00a015th head coach. David Haugh Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune For every Buddy Ryan in Bears lore there is a Bob Babich, for every Josh McCown a Jonathan Quinn, for every revelation a regret. You have to admit, Bears defensive coordinators and backup quarterbacks tend to endear themselves to Chicago easier than most McCaskey employees. And so it was again last week at Halas Hall as the civic fascination over the futures of defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and quarterback Matt Barkley held our attention longer than any Bears- Lions hype or NFL draft gibberish. In order of importance, let's start with Fangio, the schematic genius potentially gone at the end of the season according to a Tribune report citing friction with Bears coach John Fox . Chances are general manager Ryan Pace didn't have to read the paper to see the signs of a Fox-Fangio rift that sparked the whisper campaign around the league. Two assistant coaches on different teams, reached separately, shared similar stories of a growing divide Fox awkwardly dismissed Wednesday. This crisis cries out for an intervention whether it involves Pace, Chairman George McCaskey, President Ted Phillips or Dr. Phil . Every coaching staff experiences conflict and the Bears will be better preserving a bickering Fox-Fangio marriage than dealing with a divorce that only will make it harder to achieve football bliss. John Fox shot down a story Wednesday that the Bears could be headed for a split with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio . But the coach has been more adamant denying other media reports that ultimately proved accurate. Just last month, Fox questioned the authenticity of reports that quarterback Jay... John Fox shot down a story Wednesday that the Bears could be headed for a split with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio . But the coach has been more adamant denying other media reports that ultimately proved accurate. Just last month, Fox questioned the authenticity of reports that quarterback Jay... (Brad Biggs) If Fox hopes to maximize growth in his third year, a season he should feel fortunate to coach for the Bears, he needs Fangio calling defenses and confusing opposing quarterbacks. He needs Fangio grooming rising pass-rusher Leonard Floyd and nose tackle Eddie Goldman and the next defensive impact player the Bears likely will draft in the top five. He needs to find a way to coexist with the member of his staff who has made the biggest difference of any coach on the payroll since January 2015, Fox included. This isn't Mike Ditka quarreling with Ryan during the 1985 season or even Lovie Smith wrangling for power with Ron Rivera in 2006 \u2014 at least those Bears staffs squabbled their way to Super Bowl berths. These Bears are 9-19 under Fox, who really shouldn't want to ask his bosses if they value him more than Fangio. Maybe the next time Fox discusses Fangio publicly, he can help matters by saying Fangio's name out loud, which the Bears head coach neglected to do during Wednesday's non-denial denial. All Fox needed to do was cite an example of their healthy relationship or offer a fun anecdote. Fox didn't. He didn't even state unequivocally that Fangio would return if he wanted, the only issue that mattered. He never convinced anybody of anything, except that he has become a pathological evader. As B.S. artists go, Fox is a football Picasso. (Dan Wiederer) \"I want our whole staff back,\" Fox said. \"Now, whether that proves to be a reality or not, things happen.\" Instead of offering coachspeak, Fox should have called Fangio one of the NFL 's best defensive coordinators, pointed out how he engineered a defense ranked seventh despite the attrition and underscored the importance of continuity for a young, improving defense. Ideally, the Bears want to create more turnovers than they have, sure, but this is the major takeaway from 2016: In terms of talent and style, the Bears have reason to believe they have a defense worthy of leading them back to the playoffs. If Fox wanted to leave a coordinator hanging, he picked the wrong one. What has offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains done to deserve a reprieve? Only two teams in the league have scored fewer points than the Bears, who have yet to break 30. Injuries explain part of the problem but not all, except to those looking to throw Loggains a lifeline. Truth is, the Bears offense remains in search of an identity after 12 games and the play-calling has been more curious than creative. Running back Jordan Howard emerged, but accidentally. Disciplined isn't a word often associated with the Bears offense. Predictable is. When former offensive coordinator Adam Gase left to become the Dolphins coach, Fox put faith in the offensive system. But it looks like the operator of that system had as much to do with it as we thought. Photos of Bears quarterback Matt Barkley. Which brings us to Barkley, an impressive competitor making the best of being thrust into an unenviable situation. Unfortunately \u2014 and understandably in a city still confused over what a starting NFL quarterback looks like \u2014 Barkley's modest success has been overstated. He has managed games more than determined them. He has completed 51.7 percent of his passes and thrown four interceptions and three touchdowns, playing winning football in probably three of the last eight quarters. Yet Matthew Caleb Josh Hoyer Barkley, a polished compilation of previous backups who infatuated Chicago, has much more to prove before considering him a legitimate option to start beyond this season. The best Bears starting quarterback option for 2017 isn't on the roster yet. Barkley earned the right to report to Bourbonnais as the backup he is, a guy who can finish games or start short stretches \u2014 but not return the Bears to the playoffs next season. The playoffs must be the goal in Fox's make-or-break third year \u2014 and it's realistic unless the Bears do something silly and let pettiness impede progress by bidding Fangio farewell. ",

Some are based on Trump\u2019s mixed signals about illegal immigration, while others seem aimed at a more generalized sense of unease. One effort that launched this week, called \u201cWhatDoIDoAboutTrump.com,\u201d is depicted by its organizers as a non-partisan \u201cwebsite [that] turns Trump angst into action \u2013 online and off.\u201d \u201cNot sure how to protect yourself if some of Trump\u2019s campaign promises become reality?\u201d the San Francisco-based site asks. It provides links to websites of organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which advise people about what steps to take or what they may face if Donald Trump follows through on some of his promises. One link leads to \u201cWelcome to the OH CRAP! WHAT NOW? SURVIVAL GUIDE,\u201d which describes itself as \u201ca crowdsourced collection of health, legal, and safety plans and resources + social, digital and economic security related resources urgent now as an outcome of the recent US election.\u201d Related Image Expand / Contract Hundreds of Rutgers University students march last month to protest some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies. (The Associated Press) Experts say scaring consituencies about politics is standard operating procedure for activist groups, but what's different this time are the intensity, and the fact that it has started well before Jan. 20, 2017, when Trump will be sworn in. Corinna Kester, one of the founders, says the group, which includes a former national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, is not pushing an agenda. \u201cIf people are upset about the election, we encourage them to figure out how to get involved and work with that, from donating to petitions to protests.\u201d We can say, in one sense, it is intensifying divisions in America. - Fred Siegel, senior fellow, Manhattan Institute Organizations and, in many cases, lawyers, are urging people and groups they deem at-risk under a Trump presidency to take action now to protect themselves. School administrators are assuring students concerned about immigration raids that they won\u2019t be spirited away, some city officials are vowing to provide a sort-of buffer to any federal attempts to strip benefits or programs. On Monday, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that it was setting up a hotline and \"support sites\" in response to the deep anxiety among students about Trump as president. The Rev. Al Sharpton is organizing a rally of black activists and lawmakers in Washington D.C. days before Trump\u2019s inauguration in mid-January to, as he told The Hill, \u201cput the Democrats on notice to use the confirmation hearings to really go after\u201d Trump\u2019s nominees. One of the most high-profile efforts aimed at creating preemptive buffers against Trump policies are so-called sanctuaries for immigrants who are here illegally. Students at various colleges are pushing their campuses to be designated sanctuaries. Some cities are moving toward declaring themselves safe zones for such immigrants, saying they will not report them to immigration authorities if they come across them during the course of providing a service. On Tuesday, the Santa Ana City Council voted to designate the municipality a sanctuary, a non-binding action that they may make enforceable through an ordinance, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Times noted that \u201cthe move is in direct defiance of President-elect Donald Trump, who was critical of illegal immigration and sanctuary cities during his campaign.\u201d \u201cThe day after Donald Trump got elected, our kids were falling apart emotionally,\u201d the Times quoted Councilmember Sal Tinajero, who is a high school teacher, as saying. \u201cThey thought their parents would be deported.\u201d \u201cThe reason you\u2019re seeing this push now is that us leaders ... want to tell them they are going to be protected. If they are going to come for them, they have to come through us first.\u201d Trump has denounced such efforts as divisive and the people who have protested his election as \u201ccrybabies.\u201d His supporters, as well as some who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton or third party candidates, say it behooves everyone to accept the results of the election and work to be united. \u201cThis sounds like a large group therapy session,\u201d said Fred Siegel, a historian who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and professor at Saint Francis College. \u201cThere\u2019s a way in which this is all good and right in democratic terms.\u201d Siegel said the trend to organize in advance of Trump assuming the presidency is intriguing, and more in line with the kind of actions taken against policies and governments that are seen in Europe, particularly France. \u201cWe can say, in one sense, it is intensifying divisions in American society,\u201d Siegel said to FoxNews.com, \u201cWhat that represents is President Obama\u2019s success in Europeanizing American politics.\u201d \u201cIn France, the argument has always been when something occurs in Parliament that is unacceptable to you, you take to the streets. These [actions] are occurring in advance of \u2013 not in response to \u2013 policy being initiated.\u201d Louis DeSipio, a political science professor at the University of California-Irvine, said that the patchwork efforts to organize against Trump and his expected policies reflect an already-divided nation. \u201cPresident-elect Trump set out broad principles, and wasn\u2019t specific about some policies,\u201d DeSipio said. \u201cThere will always be people who are unhappy about an election. In any election, you can see a complete reversal of fortunes. The challenge for any president in this situation is to build bridges to some of his former opponents.\u201d President George W. Bush did so in response to concerns \u2013 among those who did not support his election \u2013 over how he would handle education and Medicare prescription costs, DeSipio said. \u201cHe worked with Democrats, with Sen. Ted Kennedy, on both of those issues,\u201d he said. DeSipio expressed misgivings about efforts underpinned by a refusal to accept Trump as president, a movement that has a hashtag -- #notmypresident. \u201cPhilosophically, I don\u2019t accept it,\u201d DeSipio said. \u201cHe was accepted by rules in place before the election.\u201d The approach of some groups to try to influence policy and laws at the local level can be both healthier and more practical in many cases, he added. \u201cWe may get some criticism from Trump supporters,\u201d said Kester. \u201cBut we\u2019re all getting involved in a democracy.\u201d Elizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

(AP Photo/Mike Groll) 0 Shares Email A century after the first commercial dam was built on the St. Regis River, blocking the spawning runs of salmon and sturgeon, the stream once central to the traditional culture of New York's Mohawk Tribe is flowing freely once again. The removal of the 11-foot-high Hogansburg Dam this fall is the latest in the tribe's decades-long struggle to restore territory defiled by industrial pollution, beginning in the 1980s with PCBs and heavy metals from nearby General Motors , Alcoa and Reynolds Metal plants, a cleanup under federal oversight that's nearly complete. The St. Regis River project is the first removal of an operating hydroelectric dam in New York state and the nation's first decommissioning of a federally licensed dam by a Native American tribe, federal officials say. Paired with the recent success of North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux in rerouting a pipeline they feared could threaten their water supply, the dam's removal underscores longstanding concern over the health of tribal lands. \"We look at this not only as reclaiming the resources and our land, but also taking back this scar on our landscape that's a constant reminder of those days of exploitation,\" said Tony David, water resources manager for the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, which the Mohawks call Akwesasne. The former industrial site will become a focal point in the Mohawks' cultural restoration program, funded by a $19 million settlement in 2013 with GM, Alcoa and Reynolds for pollution of tribal fishing and hunting grounds along the St. Lawrence River. The program partners young apprentices with tribal elders to preserve the Mohawk language and pass on traditional practices such as hunting, fishing, trapping, basket-making, horticulture and medicine. Standing on the rocky edge of a shallow, rushing river that was stilled by a 330-foot-long concrete dam until backhoes demolished it in September, David said a new park will be built to showcase Mohawk artwork where the powerhouse once hummed. On the opposite bank, a nature park will replace a treacherous tangle of industrial equipment, decrepit structures and trash. \"We're transforming it from a dangerous no-go zone to someplace that's inviting and beautiful,\" said Eric Sunday, an apprentice in the cultural restoration program. \"It creates opportunities to get people together, showcase skills, get more knowledge about our traditional ways and just appreciate nature.\" The dam, on former Mohawk land adjacent to the sprawling reservation, was in the early stages of federal relicensing five years ago when owner Brookfield Renewable Energy decided it wasn't economically feasible to make necessary upgrades. Seizing an opportunity to recover some treasured territory, the Mohawks became a co-licensee and took the lead in the decommissioning, working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state Department of Environmental Conservation and Trout Unlimited. The dam removal re-established the river's connection with the St. Lawrence River and opened nearly 275 miles of stream habitat to migratory fish, including American eel, lake sturgeon, Atlantic salmon and walleye. \"The next town upstream was known by the Mohawks as 'Place of the Salmon,'\" David said. \"Before salmon were extirpated from this river, people would be out in the shallows netting or spearing them to feed their families.\" The project is part of a larger movement that has dismantled almost 250 dams across the country since 2012, according to the conservation group American Rivers. Most have been small dams no longer useful, but environmental groups and Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest are pressing for removal of large hydroelectric dams to restore salmon runs. The Mohawk dam removal was not without controversy in the tribal community. Will Clute, a Mohawk fishing guide, said he and some other fishermen worried spawning grounds downstream would be buried in sediment from behind the dam. When a dam was removed on the nearby Salmon River 10 years ago, some downstream habitat was buried under several feet of muck. \"We will be monitoring the impact on downstream habitat,\" David said. \"What we've learned from all the dam removals across the country is that a lot of the negative impacts are short-term. The river will flush and fix itself. You need at least five to 10 years to see how it will end up.\" 0 Shares ",

It\u2019s from the provocatively titled album \u201cNazi Hologram.\u201d The verses pound one chord into fuzz-toned drone ecstasy; the bridges jump around but come back to that drone. \u201cAs I lay there dying/She cruised up to me/she had something she was hiding/It looked sinister and green/She stuck it in me/she stuck it in me!\u201d Then the drums crash harder and Andrew Katz sings, \u201cTurn on your TV sets!\u201d J.P. Post Malone, \u2018Cold\u2019 Sure, there\u2019s plenty of gimmickry in pop music, but it\u2019s admirable when someone leans in to it as convincingly as Post Malone does. He\u2019s a hip-hop-influenced singer with a singer-songwriter background; his music is both pointedly hybridized and abstract enough that it can be interpreted many different ways. On \u201cCold\u201d \u2014 a standout from his major label debut album, \u201cStoney,\u201d which was released today \u2014 he ups the ante even further. The singing is spectral, the cadence is practically spoken, and, as a bonus, the beat is ghost-EDM, with thumps that flicker on and off. The result is unusual and impressive: \u201cCold\u201d flirts with everything, and commits to nothing. J.C. Advertisement Hurray for the Riff Raff, \u2018Rican Beach\u2019 Hurray For the Riff Raff - \u201cRican Beach\u201d (Official Music Video) Video by Pitchfork Hurray for the Riff Raff hasn\u2019t had to pivot to become part of the resistance. But on its new song, the band sharpens its aim and agenda, aligning with protesters at Standing Rock and in Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico. Alynda Segarra, the songwriter at the helm of Hurray, sings of cultural theft and systemic oppression, naming no names but making her opposition clear: \u201cNow all the politicians, they just squawk their mouths They said \u2018We\u2019ll build a wall to keep them out\u2019\u201d The song, which rides a percussive Afro-Caribbean groove (and has some fine guitar playing), is an early taste of \u201cThe Navigator,\u201d due out on March 10. Ms. Segarra\u2019s touchstones on the album range from Fania Records to Bowery punk-rock to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, with an animating conviction that\u2019s summed up in this song\u2019s closing refrain: \u201cI\u2019ll keep fighting \u2018til the end.\u201d N.C. Kodie Shane, \u2018Sad\u2019 Kodie Shane - \"Sad\" ft. Lil Yachty Video by KodieShaneVEVO This charming song is many months old, but has finally received a vivid video, thanks to its inclusion on Kodie Shane\u2019s new EP, \u201cZero Gravity,\u201d her first major label release. Kodie Shane is a member of Lil Yachty\u2019s Sailing Team, and sing-raps in Daliesque fragments similar to the boss. \u201cSad\u201d is a duet between them, with Kodie Shane lamenting her romantic lot, followed by Lil Yachty coming in to offer succor, and more. The climactic scene in the video is both comic and sweet. They sing face to face in a therapist\u2019s office \u2014 their voices digitized, their emotions very raw. J.C. David Virelles, \u2018Antenna\u2019 David Virelles \u2013 \"Rumbaku\u00e1\" Video by ECM Records The Cuban pianist David Virelles is a brilliant hybridist, but until recently he generally released music with acoustic dimensions, approachable from the vectors of postbop or Latin-jazz. \u201cAntenna\u201d \u2014 recently released in digital form and as a 10-inch vinyl EP \u2014 sounds like something else entirely, even as it carries on an inquiry that has always been at the center of Mr. Virelles\u2019s work. A track called \u201cRumbaku\u00e1\u201d has electronic textures, hip-hop splicing and versifying by the Cuban rapper Eti\u00e1n Brebaje Man. The EP is worth seeking out, and so is a performance by Mr. Virelles at Le Poisson Rouge on Friday evening, with partners like the guitarist Rafiq Bhatia and the drummer Marcus Gilmore. N.C. ",

    "text": "Trump faces first significant post-election pushback from Republicans over CIA report on Russia Donald Trump Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas in 2015. Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas in 2015. (John Locher / Associated Press) Sarah D. Wire Contact Reporter As President-elect Donald Trump \u00a0dismissed\u00a0intelligence\u00a0reports about Russian interference in the presidential\u00a0election as \u201cridiculous,\" calls for a government investigation  from lawmakers, including some in his own party, grew louder Sunday. It marked the first\u00a0significant post-election pushback Trump has encountered\u00a0from a Republican Party that only belatedly and reluctantly embraced the unconventional nominee, whose\u00a0views often clash with traditional GOP ideology. In a rare joint statement Sunday, four high-profile Republican and Democratic senators called for a government investigation\u00a0into the matter and\u00a0urged colleagues not to allow the issue\u00a0to become partisan. \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d read a\u00a0statement from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), committee member Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.); incoming Senate Minority Leader leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.). \u201c Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.\u201d The statement came in the aftermath of a Washington Post report late Friday that a secret CIA analysis found that the Russian government\u2019s hacking of Democratic Party emails this year was a deliberate effort to damage Democratic nominee\u00a0 Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances. The Trump transition team responded by mockingly comparing the CIA assessment to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgment\u00a0on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. On \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump called the assessment \u201cridiculous,\u201d and suggested it was an excuse Democrats put forward to rationalize\u00a0their loss. \"I don\u2019t believe it,\u2019\u2019\u00a0Trump told host Chris Wallace. \u201cI think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country .\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Trump also defended his decision to skip some of his daily intelligence briefings, saying he gets them \u201cwhen I need it\u201d and complaining\u00a0they are repetitive. \u201cI'm, like, a smart person. I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\u201d Trump said. The Trump\u00a0transition team\u2019s resistance to\u00a0calls for an investigation into Russia's actions and refusal to accept\u00a0the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies appears rooted in a fear that it may undercut the legitimacy of his victory. \u201cThe Russians didn\u2019t tell Hillary Clinton to ignore Wisconsin and Michigan, OK?\u201d said\u00a0Reince\u00a0Priebus, who is to become Trump's chief of staff, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\u00a0\u201cShe lost the election because her ideas were bad.\u201d Trump tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of the\u00a0CIA analysis\u00a0on \u201cFox New Sunday.\u201d \u201cThey have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place,\u201d Trump said. But in October, the\u00a0U.S. intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security said publicly that\u00a0they were \u201cconfident that the Russian government\u201d was behind the\u00a0hacking of U.S. political groups and individuals in an attempt \u201cto interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d \u00a0At the time, they did not say whether the efforts were aimed at helping one candidate or the other. During the final weeks of the campaign, thousands\u00a0of embarrassing emails, many stolen from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta , were released by WikiLeaks on nearly a daily basis. On Friday, the White House said President Obama had\u00a0ordered the CIA and other intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of foreign-based digital attacks aimed at influencing the election.\u00a0Obama ordered the review completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Since the election, Republicans have worked hard to move beyond the divisions caused by Trump\u2019s candidacy and unite behind the new head of their party. Several high-profile GOP leaders continued to voice support for Trump over the weekend. The No. 2 Senate Republican, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) downplayed the news on Twitter, saying \"All this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news.\u201d House Speaker Paul D.\u00a0Ryan (R-Wis.) stopped short of calling for a congressional investigation Sunday in a statement to Politico. \"Speaker Ryan has said for months that foreign intervention in our elections is unacceptable,\u201d spokeswoman\u00a0AshLee Strong\u00a0said. \u201cThe speaker cannot comment on or characterize the content of classified briefings but he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters.\" But Trump\u2019s attempt\u00a0to undercut public trust in the\u00a0the CIA assessment, his willingness to break with the\u00a0intelligence community\u00a0and his conciliatory approach toward\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared\u00a0to be too\u00a0much for some Republicans. McCain told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Trump should acknowledge Russia may have influenced the election. ",

(Fox 13 Tampa) An internal report blames staffers at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Florida for leaving the body of a deceased veteran to decompose in a shower for nine hours and then trying to cover it up. The 24-page report concluded that hospice staffers at the Bay Pines VA hospital failed to provide appropriate post-mortem care to the veteran\u2019s body, Fox 13 Tampa reports. The report found hospice staff put the veteran\u2019s body in a hallway and left it there for an unspecified time, the station reported. Staff then put the veteran\u2019s body in the shower room and did not \u201ccheck on the status of the decedent\u2026for over nine hours.\u201d The report also found that a staff member then \u201cfalsely documented\u201d the incident, Fox 13 reported. The investigative report said that leaving the body unattended for so long increased the chance of decomposition. WISCONSIN VA DENTIST FAILED TO MEET PROPER CLEANING STANDARDS \"The report details a total failure on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs and an urgent need for greater accountability,\" Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., told the station. \"Unsurprisingly, not a single VA employee has been fired following this incident, despite a clear lack of concern and respect for the veteran. The men and women who sacrificed on behalf of our nation deserve better.\" The unnamed veteran died in February after spending time in hospice care. The hospital's Administrative Investigation Board ordered retraining for staff. Hospital spokesman Jason Dangel told the Tampa Bay Times hospital officials view what happened as unacceptable. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

A man was arrested Saturday after a stabbing in Simi Valley. Matt Stevens Contact Reporter A 29-year old Simi Valley man has been arrested and booked on suspicion of committing a hate crime after authorities say he stabbed an apparent worshiper near a mosque. At about 11:15 p.m. Saturday, Simi Valley police received multiple reports about people fighting in a shopping center\u2019s parking lot on the 1800 block of Erringer Road, said Sgt. Adam Darough. The shopping center is \u201cadjacent\u201d to a mosque, Darough said.

So that's the first thing. The second thing I would tell you is that you don't have any proof that the outcome of the election was changed. Forget about who did the hacking,\" Priebus said. He then went on to say that, despite the conclusion of intelligence officials, he still doesn't know who did the hacking. \"Look, someone hacked. We don't like that. I don't like it. No one wants it. We want to protect American interests. It's America first. I don't want the DNC hacked. I don't want anybody hacked. But I don't know who did the hacking. That's my point.\" Whether or not Trump would investigate the hacks as president, Priebus said he didn't know that, either. U.S. intelligence agencies previously concluded that Russia was behind the hacks of Democrats' email accounts, including the account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta. The U.S. publicly blamed Russia for the hacks in October, citing the agreement of all 17 intelligence agencies. The goal, they said then, was \"to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" However, a Congressional official with knowledge of the CIA's assessment told NBC News, new intelligence suggests that Russia intervened in order to help Trump get elected. \"What is really striking about the last 48 hours .. is that now the intelligence community is starting to directly give us news about the way these dots are connected,\" Mike McFaul, former ambassador to Russia under President Obama, told Todd. \"We knew some things, like, we were pretty certain about the DNC hacking by the Russians. What we didn't have reported before was evidence that they gave that data to WikiLeaks. And we also didn't have the data ... that they have hacked the RNC, the Republicans. Those are pretty big new facts, and I think they demand real attention in terms of some kind of investigation.\" Play ",

Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Updated at 1:05 p.m. ET President-elect Donald Trump is leaning towards choosing Rex Tillerson as his nominee for Secretary of State, according to multiple news reports this weekend. NPR has not independently confirmed those reports. The potential pick is already drawing scrutiny for the Exxon Mobil CEO's close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images Though he has no government experience, the 64-year-old Tillerson oversees a company that has operations in 50 countries around the world and has worked closely with Putin. In 2011, he struck a deal with a Kremlin-controlled oil company to drill in the Arctic, but the project was put on hold after the U.S. and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, according to the Wall Street Journal . Tillerson has opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia, telling his company's shareholders in May 2014 that \"we don't find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively and that's a very hard thing to do,\" according to NBC News . The prospect of Tillerson as secretary of state sparked a round of criticism from Democrats, and even pushback from Republican senators who would vote on his nomination. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which conducts hearings for secretary of state nominees, and tweeted on Sunday, \"Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState.\" Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., pledged that Tillerson will get a fair hearing in the Senate during at interview with CBS's Face The Nation, but added, \"It's a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin.\" Article continues after sponsorship Trump and his transition team insist that no final decision has been made and that an announcement is coming this week. Whether I choose him or not for \"State\"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2016 Trump praised many of the candidates he has interviewed for the job in an interview on Fox News Sunday, where he was asked to make the case for Tillerson. \"He's much more than a business executive. I mean, he's a world class player,\" Trump said of the Exxon Mobil chief. \"It's been a company that's been unbelievably managed,\" Trump continued. \"And to me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company, not for himself, for the company.\" Tillerson represented his company in Russia during Boris Yeltsin's administration, and in 2013 the Kremlin awarded him Russia's \"Order of Friendship.\" ",

Boeing shares moved lower yesterday after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that the government should cancel its order of a new Air Force One 747 jetliner, which he says could cost $4 billion. He also said the costs are \"out of control.\" Video provided by TheStreet Newslook In this June 2003 file photo, a Boeing 747 of Iran's national airline is seen at Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran. Iran said Sunday it has finalized a $16.8 billion deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes, a deal made possible by last year's landmark nuclear agreement. (Photo: Hasan Sarbakhshian, AP) Boeing has government approval to fill Iran Air's $16 billion aircraft order, but it may still be grounded by Congress. And President-elect Trump, who has criticized the Iran nuclear accord that allowed the deal to take off, could eventually have a say, too. The Chicago-headquartered Boeing said Sunday that it will sell 80 jetliners worth $16.6 billion to Iran Air. Boeing got approval to sell planes in Iran in September\u00a0but had to wait for a license for the Iran Air deal from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. This would be the largest business deal that a U.S. company had done with Iran since President Obama signed an executive order lifting sanctions against the country. That\u00a0order came after Iran agreed to end its pursuit of nuclear weapons under an accord reached in July 2015 with\u00a0the United Nations Security Council members \u2014\u00a0the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014\u00a0and Germany. Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One But Boeing's deal could face opposition in Congress and the White House. \u201cWe will aggressively fight this deal in next Congress, though we probably won't even need new legislation to do it,\u201d said David Pasch, communications director for Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill.\u00a0\u201cThe incoming appointees at Treasury and State will no longer report to a White House willing to bend over backward\u00a0and ignore national security concerns (in order) to keep Iran from walking away from the nuclear deal.\u201d In May, Roskam, along with fellow\u00a0Illinois Republican\u00a0Reps. Robert Dold and Randy Hultgren, sent a letter to Boeing asking the company not to do\u00a0business with Iran until it renounces support for terror groups.\u00a0Last month, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would prevent the\u00a0Treasury Department from giving U.S. banks the licenses to help Boeing complete the transactions. Since\u00a0Obama would likely veto the bill, it hasn't moved in the Senate. \"Congress will have a lot to say, particularly working in concert with an administration that has a fairly low view of this deal,\" Roskam told USA TODAY. He also said the\u00a0deal depends on financing.\u00a0Any bank that would get involved \u201chas to ask itself is it worth the reputational risk to be complicit with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism?\u201d Congressional opposition to the Iran nuclear accord has gained momentum with the victory of Trump, who has called\u00a0the accord \"the stupidest deal of all time.\" He and\u00a0Vice President-Elect Mike Pence have suggested they will consider renegotiating the deal when they take office. Trump's transition staff did not respond to requests for comment. Joe Lieberman, the former Independent senator from Connecticut who's now chairman of United Against\u00a0Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group, said the Iran deal faces a hostile\u00a0future in Washington. While it's not clear Congress or the new Trump administration will try to overturn it, \"there will at least be demands for stricter enforcement of the nuclear deal,\u00a0an expansion of non-nuclear sanctions on Iran,\u00a0and for companies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like Boeing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to cease efforts that reward the regime with lucrative business opportunities when it continues to be the leading state-sponsor of terrorism worldwide,\" Lieberman said. Boeing itself\u00a0has also\u00a0been in the news recently with Trump's call for the cancellation of the manufacturer's deal to build the next Air Force One planes because of\u00a0cost overruns on the project.\u00a0\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted last week. Boeing, which also said the Iran deal will help support nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs, expects to begin filling Iran Air's shopping list, which includes 50 737s, in 2018. The planes will be delivered over a 10-year period, Farhad Parvaresh, the managing director of the Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Iran's official news agency IRNA\u00a0 on Sunday. Boeing signs deal to sell aircraft to Iran Boeing isn't the only company looking to cash in in Iran. Competitor Airbus is also breaking into the market, and last week Royal Dutch Shell, the world's second-largest energy company, said it would begin developing oil and gas in Iran. At United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that advocates against the normalization of business dealings with Iran, retired Capt. Michael Pregent\u00a0advised against Boeing's sale due to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps'\u00a0use of \"civilian airliners to support terrorism.\" A founding member of UANI's veterans advisory council, Pregent said, \"It is inexcusable for Boeing to enter into business dealings with the regime when they are fully aware it is responsible for deaths and maiming of our men and women in uniform.\" Before last year's nuclear accord to curtail Iran's nuclear program, the U.S. had not had diplomatic ties with the country since 1980. The year before a revolution overthrew the U.S.-backed shah of Iran and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days. The State Department had considered Iran as a\u00a0\u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\" for funding U.S.-targeted\u00a0militant groups around the world, including Palestinian terror groups.

Citizen-Times 8:26 p.m. EST December 11, 2016 x Share In a chilling confession to police, the accused shooter laughs as he details walking into a historically black church on a mission to kill. The video was played to jurors in Roof's trial. USA TODAY NETWORK Dylann Roof faces 33 federal charges related to nine deaths in the June 2015 shootings. (Photo: Associated Press) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 With his opening statement just finished, in those long moments when a crowded courtroom trickles into the hallway for lunch recess, one of the nation\u2019s most respected death penalty lawyers turned to his colleague and exhaled heavily. His lips fluttered and his eyes widened in that universal gesture of exasperation that conveys,\u00a0I don\u2019t know what else I could have done.\u00a0 What attorney David Bruck tried to do Wednesday in his 24-minute opening address to jurors hearing the case against Dylann Roof is to nudge that panel toward a sentence of life \u2013 one with no chance of release, he stressed \u2013 instead of death. The nine black parishioners shot to death at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015 were noble, he said. Then he gently asked jurors to think about what might have driven his client to end those lives. In response to a damning outline of the case delivered by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson, and his promise to prove those facts, Bruck conceded the question of guilt in statements that followed the prosecution. \u201cWhat you just heard really did happen,\u201d he said. But as the trial marches forward, Bruck and the defense team representing the 22-year-old admitted white supremacist will soon find themselves unable to perform their most critical job. Roof, in court filings, has said he will represent himself in the sentencing phase, when jurors will consider whether he should live in prison or die by execution. Roof has entered a not guilty plea, but has also offered to plead guilty if capital punishment is taken off the table. Prosecutors, pursuing convictions on 33 federal charges, have declined. In a case where the looming question has always been one of life or death, Roof\u2019s attorneys are legally hamstrung, unable to submit evidence of mitigating factors that could swing jurists toward a sentence of life. In chilling video, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof laughs, confesses to murders The defense team has declined comment, but court filings indicate they had planned to argue Roof suffers from a mental defect or similar condition. That evidence almost always comes by way of witnesses who testify in the sentencing phase, notably, psychologists who have evaluated a client and people like friends and family who can speak to a defendant\u2019s behavior. A broken trust is one primary reason capital defendants fire attorneys, though Roof seems engaged with his counselors. . Experts look to another reason Roof might want to take control of sentencing: He does not believe he is mentally ill and is blocking his attorneys from presenting evidence that might show otherwise. That is a classic symptom of people suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, said Xavier Amador, a psychologist who has offered more than 70 evaluations in capital cases, including \u201cUnabomber\u201d Theodore Kaczynski and Zacarias Moussaoui, sentenced to life as part of the Sept. 11, 2011 attacks. In his book, I Am Not Sick I Don't Need Help!\u00a0he notes half of people living with those illnesses deny they have an ailment, a condition known as anosognosia. \u201cWhy do people not believe? The same reasons they have hallucinations and delusions. They have a broken brain. We use our brains to evaluate ourselves,\u201d said Amador, who has no connection to the Roof case. \u201cWhen you have schizophrenia, the research is abundantly clear, there is so much scientific consensus, anosognosia is lifelong. Once you have it, you never learn you are ill and these are the defendants who end up firing their attorneys.\u201d Roof, in his own words \u201cYou are going to want to understand who on Earth this person was,\u201d Bruck, 67, told jurors in his opening statement as part of a delicate attempt to signal the panel should consider the many unknowns about his client. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel reminded Bruck to limit his statements to guilt, rather than sentencing. The defense attorney also had noted that Roof does not have a best friend, has few friends at all, in fact, implying that Roof\u2019s life is full of lines to be read between.\u00a0 Jurors on Friday heard writings from a journal Roof authored, one that reflects a four-page manifesto filled with racial hatred, most of it directed toward black people, but also Hispanics and Jews. Roof had published that manifesto online shortly before the attack at Mother Emanuel, and to read it is to learn of a young man who champions a segregated South, is disappointed that the Ku Klux Klan is not a dominate force and opted to target Charleston, once the country\u2019s most bustling slave port, for its place in black history.

    "text": "(David Lazarus) When Zeldes heard about Makaeff\u2019s call to her firm \u2014 a four-person operation in 2010 \u2014 her ears perked up. \u201cI thought, \u2018Trump University. Is there a university I hadn\u2019t heard of? Is this a real university? Do people really think this is a university?\u2019\u201d she recalled. As luck would have it, a\u00a090-minute Trump University preview seminar was being held in San Marcos. Zeldes decided to check it out. \u201cMy heart broke,\u201d Zeldes said. \u201cI thought, wow, this is really a dog and pony show. You walk in and there\u2019s these big life-sized posters of Donald Trump. I got to hear the pitch and see people really compelled by the pitch they were making.\u00a0\u2026 They\u2019d say \u2018How many people lost equity on their homes? How many want to leave that legacy for their children? How many of you want to learn how to make that money back?\u2019\u201d The attendees were encouraged to pay $1,500 for a three-day seminar to learn more, which led to pitches for a $35,000 yearlong program promising real estate riches, according to former students. Makaeff claimed to have spent about $60,000 in all. Zeldes\u2019 firm took the case on a contingency, but before filing\u00a0the complaint in San Diego federal court the attorneys brought on Robbins Geller, which had more staff and resources. Once the lawsuit was filed on April 30, 2010, the phone calls started coming in. \u201cI probably personally spoke to almost 400 people who took Trump University courses,\u201d attorney Amber Eck recalled. \u201cThese are devastating stories.\u201d From seniors to business people to real estate entrepreneurs, the students\u00a0had similar stories of being encouraged to max out one, two or\u00a0three credit cards to pay for Trump University courses, Eck said, or to take out retirement savings, inheritances or home equity credit. The attorneys\u2019\u00a0big break in the case came when they began hearing from former Trump University employees. They\u00a0leaked playbooks and scripts used by instructors long before the items were released in discovery. The documents detailed the room layout\u00a0during seminars, the temperature the thermometer should be set at (\u201cno more than 68\u00a0degrees\u201d), the many comebacks that employees could use when students were reluctant to put down money. \u201cThey specifically set up the room so the exit would be blocked so it\u2019d be difficult to get past a Trump University person,\u201d Eck said.

Attorney Jason Forge, of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, speaks to the media after a Trump University court hearing in San Diego. (Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune) Early on in the case, Trump delivered a counterpunch, suing Makaeff for defamation. \u201cThere was no grace period where there was smooth sailing,\u201d said\u00a0Jensen, of Robbins Geller. \u201cThis case always had challenges by virtue of who the defendant is.\u201d Trump\u2019s suit made its way to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Makaeff prevailed. Jensen questioned Trump during his first deposition in 2012 at Trump Tower in New York\u00a0and described the encounter as confrontational. \u201cHe threatened to sue me and my firm. There was bullying and intimidation going on,\u201d she said. Trump aggressively defended his program. He and his legal team\u00a0said Makaeff and other disgruntled students didn\u2019t put in enough effort to succeed in business and partly blamed the downturn in the real estate market for their troubles. \u201cThe student evaluations received throughout the courses of Trump University were extraordinarily positive,\u201d Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said in an interview. \u201cPeople sought out this program because they wanted to better their lives, supplement their income, change jobs, reach out and try something new and different in their lives to challenge themselves, and that\u2019s much of what the courses and instruction offered people.\u201d Forge, from Robbins Geller, was brought on as a lead litigator in the case in 2013. He\u2019d gained a reputation as a hard-charging assistant U.S. attorney and\u00a0was part of the team that prosecuted Rep. Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham in the largest bribery scandal in congressional history. He also brought his experience prosecuting white-collar criminals under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\u00a0to the Trump case. \u201cThe more I thought about it the more I thought this could be a pretty good RICO case,\u201d Forge said. \u201cThe allegations in this case are not that different from the kind of Ponzi schemes I worked on at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\u201d The lawyers tried to add a RICO cause of action to the lawsuit, but it was denied. So they filed a separate class-action lawsuit using RICO. Art Cohen, a Northern California businessman and former student who had contacted the attorneys with offers to participate in the case, became the class representative. Trump University 101 Students allege they paid up to $35,000 to attend\u00a0seminars and learn\u00a0inside secrets to success in real estate from mentors who were \u201chandpicked\u201d by Trump. Instead, they claim the program was nothing more than an infomercial trying to squeeze more money out of students and that they did not learn what was promised.

Marco Rubio injected Trump University into the national conversion in February when he leveled a series of attacks against Trump during a televised Republican presidential debate. \u201cI was at the gym.\u00a0I\u2019m on the elliptical and the guys next to me are talking about, \u2018Hey, did you hear about Trump University?\u2019\u201d Zeldes recalled. \u201cThe Republicans were using our case to try to get rid of Trump, then it became a household word.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer said the case suddenly became a \u201cpolitical football.\u201d \u201cThe case was used, unfairly so,\u00a0with enormous distortions by political opponents to try to take shots at Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump handled himself deftly when asked about it. \u2026 His opponents were searching for anything they could to undermine his popularity with the public and used the case as a political weapon, and ended up obviously failing,\u201d Petrocelli said. He called the press coverage on the case overwhelmingly biased. \u201cThat was probably the biggest challenge, overcoming the negative publicity that portrayed the case in a very unfair and inaccurate light,\u201d Petrocelli said. That\u2019s also when Trump lashed out at the judge overseeing the case, calling U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel a \u201cMexican\u201d who was biased against him for his views on immigration.\u00a0Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants. But Trump\u2019s rise politically did little to change the inner workings of the case, other than present logistical scheduling challenges, the attorneys said. The intense media scrutiny had its effect on\u00a0Makaeff, who\u2019d been suffering from health problems and family issues and decided she couldn\u2019t take the stress of being a class representative any longer. The judge allowed her to step back from the case. That left as named plaintiffs Sonny Low, 75, a retired foreign service officer in Chula Vista who works at\u00a0 Home Depot \u00a0to pay off his Trump University debt, John Brown in New York, and J.R. Everett in Florida. Trump gets deposed Attorneys found a more cooperative, engaged\u00a0Trump in his final two depositions, in December 2015 and January 2016. \u201cHe would give much more candid responses than typical of a real polished CEO who knows how to smile and shine you on without really answering questions. That\u2019s not his style,\u201d said Forge, who did the questioning. \u201cHe gave answers to a lot of questions, and I would not question the sincerity at all. I respected him for giving us very real answers. \u201cIt ties back into the persona he has, not as if his persona is a fake one. He wants to be seen, and it\u2019s well earned. He\u2019s somebody who calls it as he sees it.\u201d Eck, who was at the depositions, attributes Trump\u2019s candor to the strong evidence that was piled up against him by that point. \u201cOnce you have someone in a box it\u2019s easier to get the testimony,\u201d she said. She also thinks Trump was anticipating the transcripts of the depositions would be made public \u2014\u00a0which they were. The final deposition, at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, included friendly chit-chat. \u201cHe was downright charming. He was very nice,\u201d Forge said. \u201cHe asked me on break, \u2018Are you surprised how I\u2019m doing in the polls?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I have to say, I am.\u2019 \u201c\u2018That\u2019s OK, so am I,\u2019\u201d Trump responded, according to Forge. The conversation surrounding Trump\u2019s campaign continued. \u201cI said, \u2018A lot of things you are saying are really great. Other things are really scary,\u2019\u201d Forge said. Trump didn\u2019t appear to take offense at the comment, he said. The stunning downfall of San Diego Congressman Cunningham also came up. \u201cI said [Trump]\u00a0was right on the money about how corrupt the system was, not just the rank corruption that [the Cunningham]\u00a0case involved, but that so many people told us over the course of that investigation that if Cunningham would have been smarter, he would have worked the system to get just as much money without breaking the law.\u201d Both sides get ready for the trial ",

Richard Drew/AP hide caption toggle caption Richard Drew/AP President-elect Donald Trump is interviewed by Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday at Trump Tower in New York. Richard Drew/AP President-elect Donald Trump suggested Sunday that he will not sell off his business operations to avoid conflicts of interest during his presidency. He said he will instead allow his grown children to manage them. \"My executives will run it with my children. It's a big company. It's a great company. But I'm going to have nothing to do with management,\" Trump told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Trump's Businesses And Potential Conflicts: Sorting It Out Trump said recently that he will take steps to separate himself from his business operations and will announce details at a major press conference this coming Thursday. That announcement led to speculation about whether Trump planned to divest himself from his businesses by selling off his vast network of hotels, golf courses and licensing agreements. But the comments Sunday suggest nothing has really changed since Trump first began addressing the issue during the campaign, and that Trump has no intention of selling. \"You know, when you sell real estate, that's not like going out and selling a stock. That takes a long time,\" Trump said. Former government ethics officers say that by continuing to own businesses while president, Trump allows himself and his family to profit from his office and opens himself up to numerous conflicts of interest. Article continues after sponsorship Not A Hack: U.S. Office Of Government Ethics Tweets At Trump Trump's comments Sunday do little to address those conflicts, says Meredith McGehee, chief of policy, programs and strategy at Issue One , a nonprofit group dedicated to removing money from politics. \"Let's be clear: This is not divestment of foreign holdings. And it's not any kind of blind trust. The bottom line is that, with his children in charge of operations, no way meaningful firewall can exist,\" McGehee said. \"Rather this arrangement enables him to enrich himself and his family through his administration's policies and actions,and will be interpreted by many across the world as a signal of how to gain access and influence with his administration,\" she added. Norm Eisen, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution , said Trump had not come close to addressing the issue. \"His children and his executives and his businesses are going to become a magnet for improper influence in the United States and around the world,\" Eisen said. \"Quids are constantly going to be dangled, and how long will it be before a quo follows?\" During the interview Wallace pressed Trump about the conflicts of interest, noting that \"foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump Hotel in D.C. You've got business operations, deals with foreign countries.\" Trump replied that he has no interest in making money while in the White House. He said he had \"turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest.\" \"If I were going to do new deals right now, I am turning down billions of dollars of deals. I will tell you, running for president, the money I spent is peanuts compared to the money I won't make. And that's OK because this is so important. What I'm doing is so important.\" When Wallace noted that allowing his children to manage the company was \"the same thing,\" Trump replied: \"They're not making deals. And they're going to run my company. I have a lot of property and great stuff. They're going to run it. They're going to run it. Hopefully they're going to run it properly. I'm sure they're going to run it properly. But I'm not going to do deals. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be good.\" But Eisen said that arrangement would not resolve conflicts, unless Trump signs over everything to an independent trustee immediately. \"Although it is of course important that Mr. Trump have no involvement in Trump business operations, in order to avoid conflicts, he must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent. Otherwise he will have a personal financial interest in his businesses that will sometimes conflict with the public interest, and constantly raise questions and legal issues,\" Eisen said. \"For example, unless he divests ownership, he will have an interest in the foreign government payments and benefits that flow to his businesses daily,\" he said. \"That creates such a serious conflict of interest that the framers of the constitution prohibited it for the president in the emoluments clause. Far smaller potential conflicts led every president for four decades to do a blind trust or the equivalent, and so should Trump.\" When Wallace pointed out that Trump had \"hammered\" his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, over \"pay to play\" conflicts involving the Clinton Foundation, Trump insisted the two situations were different. \"She's taken in massive amounts of money from foreign countries and other things,\" he said.

    "text": "AP December 11, 2016, 1:11 PM Boeing seals $16.6 billion deal with Iran Air An Iran Air Boeing 747 passenger plane sits on the tarmac of the domestic Mehrabad airport in the Iranian capital Tehran on January 15, 2013.\u00a0 BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty Images Email TEHRAN, Iran - Iran\u2019s flag carrier finalized a major deal with U.S. plane maker Boeing Co. to buy $16.6 billion worth of passenger planes Sunday in one of the most tangible benefits yet for the Islamic Republic from last year\u2019s landmark nuclear agreement . Iran Air\u2019s deal for 80 jetliners is the biggest agreement Iran has struck with an American company since the 1979 revolution and U.S. Embassy takeover. It has the potential to transform Iran\u2019s creaking and accident-prone aviation industry, which has been hobbled by years of sanctions. Those curbs have prevented the country from buying new planes from Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus, and in many cases made it difficult for Iranian airlines to secure much-needed spare parts. The deal covers 50 single-aisle 737 Max 8s, a soon-to-be-introduced version of Boeing\u2019s existing narrow-body 737 line. It also includes 30 777s, a wide-body, twin-engine plane typically used on long-haul routes that is popular with other Persian Gulf carriers such as Dubai-based Emirates. Half of the order will cover the 777-300ER version, while the rest will be of the 777-9 model still under development. Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency said the planes would be delivered over the next decade. The first will start to arrive in 2018, Boeing said. In September, Washington granted permission to Boeing and Toulouse, France-based Airbus to sell billions of dollars\u2019 worth of aircraft to Iran. Airbus needed U.S. approval because at least 10 percent of its planes\u2019 components are of American origin. The U.S. and other world powers agreed last year to lift crippling sanctions on Iran in exchange for it curbing its nuclear activities. The U.S. still maintains extensive sanctions on Iran for activities unrelated to its nuclear program. President-elect Donald Trump and several Republican lawmakers have criticized the nuclear deal , but it\u2019s unclear whether they would scrap the agreement, which was reached with Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. Iranian Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi, who attended the signing ceremony, said it was a \u201chistoric\u201d day for Iranian aviation and that the deal would create 8,000 jobs for Iranians. \u201cThe deal has a clear message for the world: we support peace and security as well as the growth of Iran based on a win-win policy,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cWe hope that despite changes in the U.S. administration, the country will remain loyal to its commitments. The Republican-led House of Representatives last month voted to bar commercial aircraft sales to Iran in a move that could block the Boeing deal. That legislation must still pass the Senate, where it will likely face opposition from Democrats. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will veto the bill if it reaches his desk before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Boeing made a point of saying it worked closely with the U.S. government throughout the deal-making process and will continue to \u201cfollow all license requirements.\u201d The Iran Air deal \u201cwill support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs\u201d linked to the 777s alone, it said. The plane maker said the deal value was based on list prices, though in practice customers typically negotiate discounts for bulk orders. Most of Iran\u2019s aging fleet of 250 commercial planes was purchased before 1979, and as of June only 162 were operational, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists a fleet of 43 planes, offers direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

They were crucial to his November victory. But the challenges those voters face is about more than just economics and government policy, it cuts all the way to the physical health of their communities. People who live in Trump's most supportive communities feel they are not as healthy as the nation as a whole and people in their communities are more likely to die from a drug or alcohol overdose, according to data from the Gallup and the Centers for Disease Control analyzed by the American Communities Project . Meet The Press merged data from three groups of counties that Trump won by more than 20 points - Graying America, Evangelical Hubs and Working Class Country. Those counties carry some common traits. They are more rural than the other places and tend to have lower incomes and lower college education rates. There are 1024 counties in that merged group. Trump won 986 of them. And they look very different from the country on some key health measures. Related: Donald Trump Talks Policy, Conflicts, Calls Idea Russians Helped Him 'Ridiculous' More than 28% of the people in those counties said they have health problems that prevent them from doing things people their age normally can do. In some of those places that was much higher, well over 30%. That's compared to a national average figure of roughly 22%, according to Gallup surveys conducted in the 3rd quarter of 2016. Those are self-diagnoses, of course, and respondents could be referring to anything from hard knee or back pain to diabetes. But the \"health problems\" question is fairly consistent across the counties Trump won. The counties Clinton won tended to have fewer than average people citing \"health problems\" that affected their lives. Play ",

Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images Iran Air has finalized its historic purchase of 80 U.S.-made passenger jets, signing a deal with Boeing that's the first of its kind since the overthrow of Iran's shah in the 1970s. U.S. officials approved the deal in September , months after Iran emerged from sanctions. The sale of 50 737 planes and 30 wide-body 777 airliners will support nearly 100,000 jobs, Boeing says . The first planes are slated for delivery in 2018, with more jets following over the next 10 years, Iranian officials say. As NPR's Jackie Northam has reported : \"Iran and Boeing go a long way back. Boeing was the largest supplier of civilian aircraft to Iran before the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

In his words: \u201cI\u2019m sure the farthest thing from Shakespeare\u2019s mind was: \u2018Is this literature?\u2019\u201d Dylan said he too focuses on \u201cmundane matters\u201d such as recording in the right key, not on whether his songs are literature. He thanked the Academy for considering the question and \u201cproviding such a wonderful answer.\u201d Despite his absence, the crowd still gave Dylan a standing ovation after a Swedish Academy member praised his work in a speech. An awkward moment ensued as American singer-songwriter Patti Smith, performing Dylan\u2019s \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall,\u201d forgot the lyrics midway through. \u201cI apologize. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so nervous,\u201d Smith said, asking the orchestra to start over, as the formally dressed audience comforted her with gentle applause. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

The worst overall problems were at Chicago O\u2019Hare, where more than 1,200 flights had been canceled as of 7:50 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware . The cancellations represented more than half of the airport\u2019s entire daily schedule. Flights that were still operating were faced delays as long as 4-\u00bd hours earlier Sunday, though they had moderated by afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s flight-delay map . Delta jet slides into grass at snowy Detroit airport Nationwide, about 2,370 flights had been delayed by 7:50 p.m. ET, according to FlightAware. Chicago O\u2019Hare is a hub for both United and American airlines, meaning disruptions could ripple out to other airports as planes and crews get knocked off schedule by the weather problems there. Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport also was seeing weather-related problems. More than 170 flights \u2013 or about a third of the day\u2019s schedule \u2013 had been canceled there as of noon ET, according to FlightAware.\u00a0Southwest is by far the busiest carrier at Midway. In Detroit, no one was injured when an arriving Delta Air Lines MD-80 jet slid into the grass just before noon ET there. The FAA ground stop issued for Detroit after the incident, listing snow, ice and \"braking action\" as causes.\u00a0Both delays and cancellations spike in Detroit during the afternoon, but it was unclear if that was fallout from the Delta incident or it was because of deteriorating weather conditions. As of 7:50 p.m. ET, more than 220 flights -- about 20% of the day's schedule -- had been canceled and another 440 delayed, FlightAware counted. Several other airports in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions were being affected by the storm. Among other airports in the region seeing higher than average numbers of delays and cancellations were Cleveland; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Columbus, Ohio;\u00a0Indianapolis; St. Louis; Milwaukee; Grand Rapids, Mich.; South Bend, Ind.; Lansing, Mich., among others. In Canada, Toronto Pearson -- that country's busiest airport -- also was seeing significant weather-related flight disruptions. Photo tour: Planespotting at San Francisco International (SFO) New York City's big airports were thrown into the delay mix Sunday evening. Newark Liberty, New York JFK and New York LaGuardia -- three of the nation's most delay-prone airports that suffer delays even in moderate weather events -- were seeing a mix of low clouds and wintry precipitation Sunday evening. \u00a0As of 7:50 p.m. ET, delays and cancellations were running above typical levels at Newark and LaGuardia. The FAA was reporting delays averaging up to 2 hours at the airports. Back to the Midwest, all big airlines flying to the region had waived change fees to customers scheduled to fly through many of the region\u2019s big airports Sunday. The nation\u2019s three biggest carriers \u2013 American , Delta and United \u2013 each had enacted such policies. Generally, the they allowed\u00a0customers with tickets to fly through the region on Saturday or Sunday to make one change to their itineraries without paying the customary change fees, which can cost $200 or more per traveler. United\u2019s waiver also covered fliers scheduled to fly through O\u2019Hare on Monday. Photo tour: Behind the scenes at Los Angeles International Airport JetBlue , Frontier , Spirit \u00a0and Virgin America also waived changes fees for fliers at several of their airports in the Great Lakes region. The exact details of the waivers varied by airline. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Video Blasts Near Stadium in Istanbul A pair of explosions occurred outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul on Saturday night. Two explosions in Istanbul killed dozens and wounded more than a hundred, and officials said police officers appeared to have been targeted. By THE NEW YORK TIMES on Publish Date December 10, 2016. Photo by Murad Sezer/Reuters. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed ISTANBUL \u2014 Thirty-eight people were killed and 136 were wounded here on Saturday in two explosions, and officials said one of them was a car bomb outside a stadium that targeted police officers on duty for a soccer game. Turkey \u2019s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, speaking from Ankara in comments carried by local media, said the second explosion appeared to be in a nearby park, and may have been a suicide bomb. The explosions set off activity around central Istanbul, with rushing ambulances, helicopters hovering, and a large plume of smoke rising over the city, scenes that were as familiar as they were frantic. Like last summer\u2019s attempted coup and a devastating attack at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, the bombs on Saturday came in the late evening, when this megacity\u2019s streets, bars and restaurants were packed. Shortly after the bombings, Mr. Soylu said that 20 police officers had been wounded. Turkish media later reported that more than a dozen police officers had been killed. Updated casualty numbers were later reported by The Associated Press. Once the news ricocheted around town, revelers hurried home, glued to their mobile phones, amid the sound of sirens. Those closer to the stadium heard screams and the sounds of gunfire. Photo Initial reports said that 20 police officers had been wounded in the attack outside Vodafone Arena Stadium in Istanbul. Turkish media later reported that more than a dozen officers had been killed. Credit Sedat Suna/European Pressphoto Agency \u201cI heard a large explosion and immediately turned around and then there was a second explosion,\u201d said Sheri Cavazos, an Istanbul resident who was at a nearby hotel. \u201cI immediately thought it was a terrorist attack. I wasn\u2019t surprised. I was expecting it.\u201d Images shared on social media showed fires, several cars destroyed and police hats scattered on the ground. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But within a couple of hours it seemed clear that a major attack against civilians had not transpired. The bombings occurred after the game was over and most fans had left the area around the stadium. Local media reported that the attack targeted a riot police bus, not a gathering of civilians. Turkey faces numerous security threats, including the Islamic State, which Turkey is fighting in Syria and Iraq as part of an American-led coalition against the terrorist group, and Kurdish militants who are at war with the Turkish state in the southeast. No group immediately took credit for the attack, although the choice of target \u2014 the police, rather than civilians \u2014 was in line with the types of attacks that have been carried out by Kurdish militants. Over the last four years, Turkey has evolved from a country of stability and prosperity that was trying to lead the Middle East at a time of great turmoil to one that is increasingly consumed by violence and political problems within its own borders. Istanbul, a city of 14 million residents that has thrummed with tourists in recent years, has become a frequent target, with attacks over the last year in the old city and on Istiklal Avenue, the most famous street. Tourism has collapsed, businesses have fled the city center to go to the suburbs, and many trendy restaurants and shops have closed. \u201cThis is the new norm now,\u201d said Ozan Tas, a taxi driver who was working near the stadium. Ceylan Yeginsu and Safak Timur contributed reporting.

As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats' last best hope to block some of Trump's selections that they view as unacceptable and outside of the political mainstream. Even if they don't have the votes to shoot down any of Trump's nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to publicly shame them \u2014 all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they need to kill a nominee or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick. Related: ExxonMobil CEO Expected as Secretary of State Pick Not all of Trump's picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in active duty military means he'll need a special waiver that requires 60 votes in the Senate. But some of Trump's picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they've been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs. Betsy DeVos Carolyn Kaster / AP There's Trump's reported secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There's Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing that agency. There's Andy Puzder, Trump's choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots. There's Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there's Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti-immigration hardliner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments. Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks pouring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump's most polarizing cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird, both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process.

He side-stepped linebacker John Timu at about the 4-yard line. \u00a0 The Bears (3-10) forced the Lions to come from behind by intercepting Stafford twice in the fourth quarter. In the process, they ended their streak of 18 quarters without an interception or fumble recovery. \u00a0 On the second interception, rookie Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc was physical against veteran Anquan Boldin, then undercut an out route. Le\u2019Blanc raced 24 yards to the end zone, holding the ball above his head and high-stepping the last 10 yards. It gave the Bears a 17-13 lead with 7:07 to play. \u00a0 The Bears tried to drive from their 25 into field goal range. Holding penalties against Charles Leno, then Ted Larsen, negated back-to-back completion of 27 and 23 yards into Lions territory. That set up a climactic fourth-and-11 from the Lions\u2019 44. Barkley through deep down the middle. The ball got into Josh Bellamy\u2019s body, but with Darius Slay on his hip, Bellamy couldn\u2019t catch it.\u00a0 \u2014Rich Campbell ",

As for whether the questionnaire violates any laws, however, Zuckerman does not think it has crossed that threshold. \"I think we're probably not there yet, but the real issue will be, what will they do with that information?\" Tom Divine is the legal director of the Government Accountability Project and says he's represented thousands of whistleblowers over the years. He says the questionnaire has all the \"symptoms\" of trying to pin down employees' personal views. \"This type of action is designed to create the infrastructure to create an enemies list or a menu of federal workers who will be targeted and also to lay the foundation to engage in surveillance against potential whistleblowers,\" Divine says. Divine also says information gleaned from the survey could potentially violate federal workers' rights afforded to them by the First Amendment. \"The First Amendment has a first principle, which includes freedom of association. And it means who you associate with, the organizations that you participate in, those are your business \u2014 not the federal government's.\" Civil rights attorney Debra Katz agrees. While Katz says federal workers are more limited in their speech compared to those who work in the private sector, there may be grounds for employees at the Department of Energy to take preemptive legal action against the incoming administration. \"If in fact there is an effort to determine if individuals not only did climate change activity in the course of their professional duties, but did this in other areas of their life \u2014 were environmentalists, participated in other groups, and decisions were being made to weed them out on that basis \u2014 that is clearly a First Amendment violation,\" Katz says. So what about the employees faced with the question: Should they or shouldn't they fill out the questionnaire? Zuckerman, the former Office of Special Counsel adviser, says employees at the agency don't have many easy options. \"One has to be very careful about this. In the U.S. government you don't want to engage in insubordination. If you are asked to do something that's reasonable and it's legitimate, you have to do it.\" He adds that if there's evidence that certain employees get marginalized or have their responsibilities altered as a result of the information on the survey, then there may be grounds for action. \"At that point there would be a violation and those employees might be able to bring a claim.\" ",

Many in the timber Washington timber industry voted for Donald Trump for president. William Yardley / Los Angeles Times A logging truck is parked in front of a mural in Aberdeen, Wash. Many in the Washington timber industry voted for Donald Trump for president. A logging truck is parked in front of a mural in Aberdeen, Wash. Many in the Washington timber industry voted for Donald Trump for president. (William Yardley / Los Angeles Times) William Yardley Before coal became king and the Rust Belt rusted, the Pacific Northwest began building an economy based on timber. The Oregon Country shipped its first load of logs to China in 1833. A century later, as national politics and the Great Depression intruded, this remote and rainy corner\u00a0of the country became an early West Coast battleground for worker rights, with bitter strikes silencing lumber mills for months. It also became a stronghold for the Democratic Party, a place where immigrants and their children embraced President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and his promise of solid wages for timber workers. The region defied\u00a0the Republican landslides that swept Eisenhower and Reagan into office in 1952 and 1980. It even stayed Democratic after Bill Clinton and later President Obama sharply reduced logging in old-growth forests to save an endangered bird, the northern spotted owl. Then came 2016. For the first time since Herbert Hoover won the White House\u00a0in 1928, Aberdeen and the other small outposts that make up Grays Harbor County here\u00a0on the Washington coast did not vote for a Democrat for president. This year, they chose Donald Trump. (Nigel Duara) \u201cWe could sense that there was a change happening in the harbor,\u201d said Steven Puvogel, who was chosen earlier this month as the new chairman of the Grays Harbor Democrats at their \u201creorganizational\u201d meeting, which doubled as an election postmortem. \u201cTrump signs were popping up everywhere, but I didn\u2019t see a Hillary sign until I put one up myself. They were hard to even get around here.\u201d Throughout the Northwest, from Washington to Northern California,\u00a0historic timber-producing counties voted for Trump. Some had been Republican for years, while others had swung back and forth. Some, like Grays Harbor and its neighbor to the south, Pacific County, had not voted Republican in decades. (Pacific fell for Eisenhower in 1952 but quickly returned to the Democrats in 1956.) And while they did not generate a single electoral vote for the president-elect, who lost by substantial statewide margins in Washington, Oregon and California, they did send a defiant message that coal country and the declining manufacturing core of the Midwest are not the only \u201cold\u201d economic regions where many working-class families feel that the Democratic Party has forgotten them and the role they played in building the country. Can Trump restore the timber industry to its former glory? As with coal mining and manufacturing jobs, market forces create long odds. But he has helped revive a fierce political voice deep in the evergreens. If the vote for Trump here was striking in a historical context, it was not surprising given the loss of economic power the area has seen under Democrats. \u201cAll the jobs are in the cities now,\u201d said Dale Rutherford, 91, who grew up in Pacific County and worked in the woods until he was 83. \u201cI think people just wanted change.\u201d Dale Rutherford, 91, of Lebam, Wash., said he voted for Donald Trump in part because he hopes the president-elect will create jobs building infrastructure. William Yardley / Los Angeles Times Dale Rutherford, 91, of Lebam, Wash., said he voted for Donald Trump in part because he hopes the president-elect will create jobs building infrastructure. Dale Rutherford, 91, of Lebam, Wash., said he voted for Donald Trump in part because he hopes the president-elect will create jobs building infrastructure. (William Yardley / Los Angeles Times) Southwest Washington once produced stunning amounts of lumber \u2014 for sailing ships in the 19th\u00a0century, for the war effort in the 1940s and for the housing boom that followed. Timber harvest in Grays Harbor peaked in 1988 at nearly a billion board feet. Last year, more than two decades after the first logging restrictions imposed under President Clinton\u2019s Northwest Forest Plan, Grays Harbor harvested just 252 million board feet. Complicating things further, much of the timber harvested in Washington is now shipped to China and milled there, meaning fewer jobs in mills here. Washington had about 500 mills in the late 1960s. Now it has fewer than 100, and the most successful ones are becoming highly automated, requiring fewer employees. The powerful employment engines at work in other parts of Washington state, companies like Microsoft and Amazon.com and Boeing, have no outposts here. Unemployment in Grays Harbor is more than 8%, more than twice what it is in the Seattle area. Household income last year was $44,000, unchanged from a decade ago. To many people, the stage for political change has been set for a long time, and Trump was not its only beneficiary. Grays Harbor and Pacific also voted Republican in the governor\u2019s race for the first time in decades, and a libertarian Republican, Jim Walsh, a book publisher who moved from Los Angeles with his family almost 15 years ago, narrowly won an open seat in the state house district that includes the county. But the shift right was not necessarily inevitable. This spring, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders trounced rival Hillary Clinton in the Democratic caucus in Grays Harbor and Pacific counties. Sanders, like Trump, talked about blue-collar workers being overlooked. He also was seen as holding more nuanced views on gun control, while Clinton was portrayed, inaccurately, as ready to repeal the 2nd Amendment in a region that likes to hunt and believes strongly in the right to bear arms. A home in Aberdeen, Washington William Yardley/Associated Press A home in Aberdeen, Washington A home in Aberdeen, Washington (William Yardley/Associated Press) \u201cWhat was Secretary Clinton offering these existing timber workers?\u201d said Brian Blake, a Democrat who has represented the area in the state Legislature since 2002 and was reelected by a wide margin in November. \u201cIn the minds of these timber workers, the Northwest Forest Plan has been devastating. They don\u2019t see jobs in their communities,\u00a0and they see a candidate saying we don\u2019t think you have a constitutional right to have a gun in your home.\u201d \u201cAs a party, we\u2019ve got to craft strategies that speak to rural voters who are hurting,\u201d added Blake, who spent a decade working in the timber industry. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be scaring them, saying if Trump wins he\u2019s going to take away the social programs that maintain you in poverty.\u201d One Trump supporter, a relief operator at the Sierra Pacific Industries mill here, said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know how Democrats can go on with daily life sometimes. \u201cThey want everything given to them,\u201d he added, declining to give his name for fear of\u00a0putting his own job at risk.\u00a0\u201cThey don\u2019t want to work.\u201d The idea that Democrats do not want to work flies in the face of what made this place a political power in the 1930s. People demanded work back then \u2014\u00a0and many still remember what FDR\u00a0did for them. Blake, recalling campaigning door to door in his first race, said it was not uncommon to see framed pictures of Franklin Roosevelt in the entry halls of older residents. \u201cThere\u2019s still an allegiance there,\u201d Blake said. \u201cBut those voters are getting older.\u201d Many towns in the Pacific Northwest like Aberdeen, Wash., seen here, began building an economy based on timber in the 1800s. William Yardley / Los Angeles Times Many towns in the Pacific Northwest like Aberdeen, Wash., seen here, began building an economy based on timber in the 1800s. Many towns in the Pacific Northwest like Aberdeen, Wash., seen here, began building an economy based on timber in the 1800s. (William Yardley / Los Angeles Times) Rutherford, the lifelong timber worker, said he did not expect his industry to grow in the future, in part because so much has been logged already. He said he, too, had been drawn to Trump, partly because the candidate talked about government making major new investments in infrastructure, roads and bridges. Rutherford, whose wife of more than 50 years died a few months ago, recalled being a teenager in the late 1930s and early 1940s and having friends who worked for Roosevelt\u2019s Civilian Conservation Corps, some in nearby Olympic National Park. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to do what President Roosevelt did,\u201d he said, taking a break from writing Christmas cards in perfect cursive. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to make jobs.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Who\u2019s to blame for one of the worst fires in California history , Dakota Access pipeline opponents have claimed a big victory for now , Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , how will Hollywood speak to Trump\u2019s America , meet Wilbur Ross, the man Trump has tapped him to lead the U.S. Department of Commerce , and John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 .

The White House petition to commute Manning's sentence surpassed the 100,000 signatures required late Saturday, meaning her supporters could get an official response within 60 days. The petition was created on November 14. \"We did it! Thank you so much for your love and support. =),\" Manning said in a post of her official Twitter account on Saturday. We did it! Thank you so much for your love and support. =) \u2014 Chelsea Manning (@xychelsea) December 11, 2016 \"I don't know what to say. I am just grateful that I am not forgotten,\" she said in another post on Twitter Sunday morning. Related: Military Doctor Denies Chelsea Manning's Request to Have Records Reflect Gender Imprisoned U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning US Army - AFP - Getty Images Manning was arrested in 2010 for leaking more than 700,000 military and State Department documents to Wikileaks and sentenced to 35 years in 2013 in military court. At the time she was known as Bradley Manning and has been held in a men's prison facility. President Obama and his administration have 39 more days in office before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. The American Civil Liberties Union has lobbied President Obama to commute the transgender woman's remaining sentence to the time she has already served, saying in a statement last week that her 35-year-sentence was unprecedented. \"The sole relief that Ms. Manning is seeking is to be released from military prison after serving over six years of confinement \u2014 longer than any whistleblower in the history of our country,\" the ACLU said in the letter which was co-signed by more than a dozen gay-rights groups. Manning's lawyers formally petitioned President Obama to commute her sentence in November, according to a statement provided to The New York Times , seeking better medical care for her gender dysphoria, a condition of potentially severe distress or anxiety that some transgender people experience. A military doctor treating Manning denied her request to have her female gender reflected in her military records, according to Reuters. Manning attempted suicide for the second time in recent months this October after the start of her stay in solitary confinement after an earlier suicide attempt in July, according to The Associated Press.

    "text": "Bears QB Matt Barkley eager for Alshon Jeffery's return Photos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Sunday marked the final day of Alshon Jeffery 's four-game suspension, a punishment that went into effect Nov. 14 after Jeffery was busted for violating the NFL 's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Jeffery is expected to be reinstated Monday and is expected to rejoin the team for meetings at Halas Hall. Quarterback Matt Barkley acknowledged after Sunday's 20-17 loss to the Lions at Ford Field that he's eager for Jeffery's return. \"The more guys, the better,\" Barkley said. \"Especially Alshon, who has been in the system for so long and is a dynamic playmaker. He can help in the ways that he can. Hopefully he doesn't miss a step and he goes right back into game speed and we'll be able to utilize him.\" On Sunday, with Jeffery suspended, Kevin White on injured reserve and Eddie Royal (toe) and Marquess Wilson (groin) inactive, the Bears again were operating with a depleted receiving corps. Together, that quartet of receivers has missed 27 games this season. On Sunday, Cameron Meredith led the Bears with six catches for 72 yards. Still, it's easy to be intrigued by how Barkley's play may elevate with the team's top receiver coming back for the final three games. Emergency exit: Cornerback Tracy Porter left the game for good with a little more than a minute left in the first half, immediately after committing an illegal-contact penalty. It was Porter's second flag on the series. The veteran cornerback motioned for a sub and urgently jogged to the locker room, bothered by an illness. Bears coach John Fox said he hadn't anticipated Porter's ailment being a game-ending issue. Bears on Sunday happened somewhere other than their game in Detroit and it might not turn out to be much more than a rumor.\u00a0 But hey, it has to be more worthwhile than waiting for the Bears to commit another penalty. And so, the story goes that legendary executive Bill Polian... The best news for the Bears on Sunday happened somewhere other than their game in Detroit and it might not turn out to be much more than a rumor.\u00a0 But hey, it has to be more worthwhile than waiting for the Bears to commit another penalty. And so, the story goes that legendary executive Bill Polian... (Steve Rosenbloom) \"That caught us a little bit off guard,\" Fox said. \"But it was very real. He was very sick quickly.\" Added Porter: \"I tried to make it to halftime, but I couldn't. Once I got the second penalty, I was like, 'I'm doing more damage than good. So let me go take care of myself.'\" Making a run for it: The first thing Matthew Stafford saw on his game-winning touchdown run? \"A lot of white jerseys,\" the Lions quarterback said. Still, Stafford found a way to elude all the Bears in pursuit. Stafford's 7-yard score with 3:17 left came as he escaped pressure in the pocket from Mitch Unrein and Pernell McPhee. As Stafford took off, Leonard Floyd was unable to catch him from behind. Near the goal line, Stafford juked enough to get past linebackers John Timu, Nick Kwiatkoski and safety Deon Bush. \"Once I decided to run, I was getting in,\" Stafford said. That touchdown capped a seven-play, 76-yard drive. Stafford suffered a finger injury early in Sunday's game with ESPN reporting he had a dislocation and torn ligaments in the middle finger of his throwing hand. But he fought through it and scored another win. Stafford and the Lions have recorded eight of their nine victories with go-ahead drives in the fourth quarter or overtime. Extra points: Anquan Boldin 's three receptions, including a 16-yard second quarter TD, gave him 1,064 catches for his career, moving him into 10th all time. ... The Bears have lost four consecutive games at Ford Field, their longest skid in Detroit since dropping six in a row at the Pontiac Silverdome between 1994 and 1999. ",

    "text": "advertisement This was originally published by the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting. Editor's note: The following account is based on dozens of police reports, court documents and testimony spanning nearly 20 years. The details and events described throughout this article, including recollections of specific situations, are derived from these records. Dig deeper Avelino Tamala's green Ford Bronco cut through the crisp desert night, headlights revealing glimpses of scattered creosote bushes along the shoulders of State Route 238. He knew the sparsely traveled highway southwest of Phoenix from his days as a patrol deputy with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, before he became a detective. Anna Reyes, shown here in an undated police mug shot, the mother of Crystal Reyes. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Tamala still carried a gun, but no longer wore the badge \u2014 he abandoned that two years earlier for a romance with one of his confidential informants, Anna Reyes, the woman in the passenger seat that night. His knowledge of law enforcement and her connections to Mexican drug cartels now afforded the couple a lucrative career selling drugs smuggled into the United States. The green Bronco provided an ideal transport for bundles of marijuana. But that night the cargo in the trunk was much lighter, and to them, seemingly less valuable: Reyes' 3-year-old daughter lay lifeless behind them, wrapped in a white bed sheet, a shovel next to her tiny body for what would follow. The Bronco slowed as they passed milepost 26. Tamala maneuvered the vehicle about a mile along an unpaved passage intersecting the highway, surrounded by little more than flat, undeveloped desert. Opening the back hatch, Tamala removed the shovel and clutched its red handle. He drove the blade into the earth. Reyes watched Tamala dig, holding a flashlight as she illuminated the unmarked grave. She broke the silence to utter two final words before they placed her daughter into the earth: \"Dig deeper.\" Crystal Reyes, the 3-year-old girl buried that cold April evening in 1997, would have turned 23 this year. Her short life, marred by abuse at the hands of those who were supposed to care for her, is a brief chapter in a tangled narrative of crime and love, deceit and heartbreak. Hers is a case that stirred, for years, in the minds of those who investigated it, the details cemented in their memory after the initial investigation went cold, after it stagnated for more than a decade, after it was reopened in 2013 \u2014 still today as the investigation continues nearly 20 years later. 'Whispered Secrets' In 1991, Darren Stockwell worked as a detention officer at the Maricopa County Durango Jail. He was 23, and one of his responsibilities was to oversee the hour of outdoor recreation allowed each day to inmates, including Anna Reyes, then 25 and serving a three year sentence for trafficking marijuana. Darren Stockwell in an undated photo believed to have been taken in the 1990s. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Reyes had thick, black hair, brown eyes and full lips that hid her perfect teeth. \"She was an attractive lady,\" Stockwell said years later in court. Official records, deposition transcripts and court proceedings described Reyes as a woman who wielded her beauty to manipulate the men around her. She took a special liking to Stockwell, a tall, good looking man with a light complexion and muscular build. The two played games of HORSE on the basketball court at the county jail, just the two of them because, for safety reasons, Reyes was separated from other inmates. Flirtation made its way into their brief interactions. Yet beyond the amorous poem \"Whispered Secrets\" that Reyes had passed along to Stockwell, they avoided crossing boundaries. The flirtations had to stay just that. Reyes was granted parole on March 26, 1992, just four days before her 26th birthday. \"It wasn't too long after she was released, I got a call at the jail,\" Stockwell said. \"It was Anna.\" The purpose of the call came as no surprise \u2014 Reyes wanted to meet up, but jail policy bound Stockwell to wait a year before interacting with former inmates. They spared no time after the year had passed. For several months, they spent nearly every day together. \"Yeah, I fell in love,\" Stockwell said during trial testimony. \"I was young and dumb, but I did.\" They discussed moving in together, which made even more sense to Stockwell the day Reyes came to his apartment with news. \"I was overwhelmed, but sort of happy. I wanted us to get together,\" he said. \"She was pregnant \u2014 I wanted to do it right.\" Reyes had other plans. She was still legally married to another man with whom she had three children, and her parole dictated that she live in a stable home. Stockwell said Reyes told him she wanted to have sex with her husband one last time, to mislead him into thinking the pregnancy was his, divorce him and then request money for child support. \"I was devastated,\" Stockwell said. \"So I walked away.\" Unwanted Crystal was born Nov. 26, 1993, at a clinic in Nogales, Mexico \u2014 where her mother grew up, where her grandmother still lived. Sergio Cazares introduced Anna Reyes to Avelino Tamala while he worked for Tamala as a confidential informant. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Within days, Reyes brought her newborn daughter back to the U.S. and immediately tried to give Crystal away. Reyes' longtime friends Sergio Cazares and his girlfriend Mayda Diaz were interested. They knew Reyes from Nogales, but had since moved to Tempe. Mayda, barely able to speak in court as she fought back tears recalling the interaction, said she thought Reyes was joking when \"she asked if I wanted her.\" \"Of course, she's beautiful,\" Mayda replied. Mayda and Cazares had many children already, but they agreed to take Crystal as long as Reyes followed through on making the adoption official. They kept Crystal for about a week, and by then Reyes hadn't taken action on the adoption paperwork, so the couple gave the girl back to her mother, thinking Reyes simply didn't want to raise an infant. \"I knew she would eventually try to take her back,\" Cazares said. \"That's why I wanted the (adoption) papers.\" Mayda Diaz. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Reyes took Crystal to Mexico, where she would live with Reyes' mother. Reyes returned to Arizona in December 1993, but less than a year later, she was sent back to jail for violating her parole. Records detailing her violation have since been purged. Reyes wanted a way out. She called on her friend Cazares, who was working as a confidential informant for a narcotics detective at the MCSO Special Investigation's Division. The detective's name was Avelino Tamala. A detective and his informant Avelino Tamala began his law enforcement career as a transportation officer with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in 1985, when he was 22. Most people called him \"Al.\" He moved up quickly within MCSO, working first as a detention officer, then patrol officer. By 1990, he had risen to the rank of detective within the agency's narcotics division. Tamala's superiors considered him a hard-working, effective lawman who kept to himself and produced results. \"He was the guy doing it all,\" said Sgt. Richard Rosky, Tamala's then-lieutenant. \"He was one of my best detectives at the time.\" Avelino Tamala was convicted of murder on Nov. 8, for his role in the death and burial of 3-year-old Crystal Reyes. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Cazares told Tamala about his friend, Anna Reyes, who was in jail but wanted to cooperate with law enforcement in exchange for a reduction to her sentence or charges. Tamala met with Reyes in 1993, and she told him about her family \u2014 the Somozas \u2014 and their heavy involvement in the Mexican drug trade. Darren Stockwell said years later that he remembered seeing Tamala visit Reyes in jail in 1991, but MCSO supervisors said they weren't aware of any visits. Investigators acknowledged there were conflicting accounts regarding when Tamala and Reyes first met. Still, the information Reyes gave Tamala in 1993 resulted in arrests and sizable drug seizures, which proved to Tamala's superiors that Reyes might be more useful out of custody. Capt. Steve Werner led the Special Investigations Division at the time and oversaw Reyes' release from jail. Their agreement stipulated that Reyes would work as an informant for MCSO, as well as several local, state and federal agencies. MCSO records detail Werner's arrangement, which addressed one notable characteristic of Reyes that he thought could lead to problems. \"Werner said that [Reyes] had a reputation of becoming sexually involved with officers and that she was considered by many to be very attractive,\" records state. \"To avoid problems of this nature Werner ordered that two officers be assigned to [Reyes] at all times.\" A second detective, Gary Eggert, was assigned to work with Reyes and Tamala. But Eggert quickly became frustrated by the arrangement, because most of the tips Reyes provided fell flat. One of those instances took place in October 1994, after Reyes told detectives about a sale of 200 pounds of marijuana. They arranged an undercover deal and made an arrest, but the drugs they seized came in 140 pounds light. Reyes later told Tamala she had \"skimmed\" the load and sold the rest herself. At the time, the payout would have been worth tens of thousands of dollars. \"Everybody in the office, I think, was expecting some, you know, us to bring down the Colombians or something,\" Eggert said at the time. \"And it just wasn't happening.\" The results were warning signs to Eggert. He started noticing Reyes and Tamala were becoming close. \"I just kind of felt uncomfortable about the situation and I didn't ... if something happened bad, I didn't want to be a part of it,\" Eggert said. \"You have a sixth sense that hey, you know, stay clear of something. And this could be something bad.\" Eggert went to Rosky, Tamala's then-lieutenant, asking to be reassigned and told him about Tamala's slipping performance and closeness with Reyes. Rosky questioned Tamala about Reyes, but Tamala assured him nothing was happening between them. Other co-workers eventually started speculating about Tamala's relationship with his informant. It became an \"office joke,\" according to records. In 1995, the sheriff's office opened an internal affairs investigation. The resulting report accused Tamala of \"fraternizing\" with Reyes. Tamala admitted to investigators that since September 1994, just months after Reyes became an informant, he'd been periodically living with her. Werner, the investigation's division captain, brought Tamala into his office and gave him a direct order to end the relationship. Tamala refused, so Werner asked for his badge and resignation. In a subsequent letter to the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board advocating that Tamala never again be hired into law enforcement, Werner wrote, \"The tragedy of this affair lies in the fact of his blatant, uncaring attitude and lack of remorse which was displayed to Sergeant Rosky and myself at the time when I accepted his resignation.\" An office secretary, Rosanna Galindo, lamented Tamala's downward spiral, telling internal affairs investigators, \"I just think it's kind of sad what happened to him, because he's a real nice guy. And I don't know, you know, what's going to happen to him. \"I guess love can make you do anything.\" Shadow Rock Although Tamala had walked away from his career and income, his relationship with Reyes brought a job prospect far more lucrative than the salary of a detective. Anna Reyes, left, poses with her niece, Annette Rodriguez, in this undated photo. Rodriguez witnessed parts of Crystal's abuse while living with Reyes and Avelino Tamala in the late 1990s. Maricopa County Attorney's Office By August 1995, Tamala and Reyes started selling smuggled marijuana. Tamala logged their transactions \u2014 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 in a ledger he kept in a storage locker. The couple could now afford to rent a two-story, five-bedroom house in a gated Ahwatukee community. It had a pool, and the backyard abutted a small mountain called Shadow Rock. The rent was $3,000 a month. The home had plenty of space for Reyes' three adolescent children \u2014 Juliana, Thalia and Luis \u2014 who had lived with Reyes since her most recent release from jail. Reyes hired a live-in housekeeper to clean and care for the children while she and Tamala were away on trips to Mexico, Nevada or elsewhere in Arizona. The 21-year-old housekeeper, Maria Gutierrez-Diaz, had recently moved to Arizona from Sinaloa, Mexico, and knew very little about America. It was easy for Tamala and Reyes to convince her that Tamala was still an undercover detective. Reyes' niece, Annette Rodriguez, believed the same when she moved to the home in September 1996. She was a sophomore in high school and had been going through a rough patch with her mother. She wanted to finish high school while living with her aunt. Nearly 20 years later, Diaz and Rodriguez would testify in court that they thought Tamala and Reyes, the three children and the big house in a wealthy Phoenix suburb indicated a stable family, normalcy. They didn't know about the double life Tamala and Reyes were living. The illusion of a suburban household evaporated when Reyes' youngest daughter, Crystal, came to live with them. Crystal Crystal had just turned 3 when her grandmother brought her back from Mexico to live in the U.S. with Reyes and Tamala in November 1996. Anna Reyes and her daughter Crystal. Crystal appeared happy, smiling often, Diaz said. She had a light complexion, amber hair in ringlets and blue eyes \u2014 traits from her father. She seldom talked. When she did, she only spoke Spanish. \"She was a beautiful girl,\" Diaz recalled years later. \"Very, very pretty little girl.\" Rodriguez thought the same, as did most who had met Crystal. But Rodriguez and Diaz thought it was strange that Crystal ate alone at the dinner table, only after everyone else had finished. Stranger still, without a bed of her own, the child slept in a closet, just sheets and pillows laid out on the floor. Diaz told police that Reyes once hauled the child into a bathroom after she heard Crystal bragging about being prettier than her sisters. Tamala and Reyes used a pair of hair clippers to shave off her curls, laughing as they did it. The other children joined in, Diaz remembered. \"Maybe they thought it was a joke or game,\" Diaz said. \"But it seemed weird to me that someone would do that to a little girl.\" For Christmas that year, Reyes and Tamala rented a condominium in Colorado for a family skiing trip. During a snowball fight between cousins, Tamala and Reyes brought Crystal outside to join. She was barefoot and wore nothing but pajamas, Rodriguez later testified in court. The other children started throwing snowballs at Crystal. So did Reyes and Tamala. Rodriguez eventually went inside to shower and change. She then heard Tamala and Reyes yelling at each other. They were in another bathroom, with Crystal under a hot shower \u2014 her skin blue, her body shaking uncontrollably. Reyes and Tamala were arguing because they thought Crystal was going to die, Rodriguez said. The shower revived her. Several weeks after the Colorado trip, Rodriguez decided to move back home with her mother. She was scared of living in the Ahwatukee house \u2014 scared of Tamala and Reyes. She didn't see the abuse escalate. Diaz, the housekeeper, did. \"It was awful,\" Diaz said. Tamala and Reyes started binding Crystal's hands and feet, sometimes from one doorknob to another in the small utility room that provided access to the garage. Abrasions formed around the child's wrists and ankles. Her cries would go ignored by the family and, Diaz said, Tamala once stepped on the child, still bound, as he passed by. Crystal was soon confined to a small plastic dog crate, the inside just 20 inches wide. Sores began to develop on her body because she couldn't move away from the excrement and urine that soiled the floor. The crate was too small for Crystal to fit comfortably, forcing her to live in a perpetual bent position. Dark green bruises spotted her frail arms. Sometimes, Reyes and Tamala took Crystal and the kennel to the backyard so they could hose her down. They would spray the inside of the kennel, too, before putting the girl back inside to lie on the hard surface without a blanket or pillow. Crystal's cries, muffled slightly by the confines of the crate, soon turned to whimpers. They became softer as hours of captivity turned to days, then weeks. She stopped eating and, eventually, stopped urinating and defecating, Diaz recalled. Crystal's once-plump body had withered, her skin now clinging to her tiny bones. She began to starve. 'Bury her' One chilly afternoon in April 1997, the sun began to take cover behind South Mountain, casting a shadow over the Ahwatukee Foothills neighborhood where Tamala and Reyes lived. According to witness testimony and police reports, 3-year-old Crystal Reyes was confined to this dog kennel for weeks before she died in 1997. Phoenix Police Department That evening marked the final act of Crystal's abuse, detailed to investigators years later during an interview with Tamala. His words would become the only account of Crystal's death. As the sun began to set and the three older children played in the driveway, Tamala and Reyes retrieved their bicycles for an evening ride. From her kennel inside the garage, wearing nothing but a pair of underwear, Crystal called out to her siblings. \"C\u00e1llate,\" Reyes yelled in Spanish as she pulled the child from the kennel. According to Tamala, Reyes placed a bath towel over the girl's head, then used clear packing tape to wrap her up, securing the towel around her face and binding Crystal's arms to her sides. \"Don't do this,\" Crystal pleaded, promising that she'd be quiet. But Tamala said Reyes then placed the starving child \u2014 bound and gagged \u2014 into a tall cardboard box. With Crystal silenced, Tamala and Reyes left the children at home while they rode their bikes for more than an hour. It was dark when they returned. Reyes went into the house. Tamala went straight to the box in the garage. Crystal was still standing, though slumped against one side. He frantically pulled her out, Tamala later told investigators, ripping away the tape and unwrapping the towel. The girl's arms and legs had turned blue \u2014 her eyes wide open even though she was already dead. \"There's something wrong,\" Tamala told Reyes after running inside to usher her downstairs and into the garage. Once there, Tamala said he knelt beside Crystal's body to revive her. Several minutes passed before he stopped the chest compressions, giving up. \"There's nothing else I can do for her,\" Tamala said. Reyes stared, expressionless, and told him to keep going. \"No, she's alive,\" Reyes said. \"She's alive.\" Tamala said they argued over whether to call 911, but Reyes didn't want police and paramedics to come. \"Bury her,\" Reyes said in Spanish. An investigation opens By the summer of 1998, the once-cozy life for Tamala and Reyes was unraveling. The couple left the Ahwatukee home in June for Tucson, but after a short time, Tamala moved in with his mother in Phoenix. Mile marker 27 along State Route 238 is near the intersecting dirt roadway where Crystal Reyes was buried. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Reyes, along with her three other children, moved to Tempe with her friend Sergio Cazares, the informant who worked with Tamala in 1993. Cazares and his girlfriend, Mayda Diaz, having met Crystal just weeks after she was born, asked about the little girl. Reyes lied. She told them Crystal was living in Mexico. Reyes and her children moved out a few weeks later. But shortly after that, Tamala came looking for them. Cazares asked him about Crystal. \"From what I understood, he told me that she was no longer alive,\" Cazares said, adding that Tamala told him Crystal's body was in the desert \u2014 that it couldn't be found. \"If there's no body, there's no death,\" Tamala told him. Cazares told a detective with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. That information was given to Phoenix Police Department Detective Don White, who was assisting several federal agencies in an ongoing narcotics investigation into Tamala and Reyes. White, along with the lead investigator in the federal drug case, Special Agent Joe Slatalla of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, had been close to securing indictments for Tamala and Reyes. The possible homicide case was handed off to another Phoenix Police detective, Michael Meislish, in February 1999. Meislish said his investigation was \"somewhat unusual\" compared to other homicides he had worked. For the first several months, he relied on secondhand, after-the-fact information brought to him from detectives on the federal drug case. \"I was kind of secondary to what was going on in the other investigation,\" Meislish recalled during Tamala's trial. His first hands-on work in the case came Dec. 16, 1999, two days after federal investigators interviewed Tamala under an agreement that protected him against prosecution for anything said during the interview. Tamala told federal investigators, in explicit detail, about Crystal's life at the home in Ahwatukee, her death and the night he and Reyes buried her in the desert. Meislish and a group of other officers and detectives went to the site Tamala described. They came up empty-handed. But a call in January 2000 to the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office revealed that fragments of an unknown child's cranium were found more than a year earlier. In November 1998, 19 months after Crystal was buried, a quail hunter stumbled across what he suspected were pieces of human bone . He contacted police, who confirmed the fragments were human remains, but investigators didn't have any leads, and they didn't yet know of Crystal's death. By the time Meislish linked those fragments to Crystal, Tamala and Reyes had been indicted on federal crimes for conspiring to distribute and possess, with intent to distribute a controlled substance, making it easy for him to obtain a sample of Reyes' DNA. Without the father's DNA, however, the bones couldn't be positively identified as Crystal's. To bring charges against Reyes and Tamala, Meislish needed to prove that fact. He knew about Crystal's abuse, but only through interviews protected under the federal agreement with Tamala. Meislish tried to contact Maria Gutierrez-Diaz, the housekeeper who lived with the family in Ahwatukee, but he couldn't find her. Official records didn't detail why the biological father, Darren Stockwell, wasn't contacted or asked to provide DNA. The case went cold. Once silent ATF Special Agent Joseph Slatalla, the former lead agent who helped convict Tamala and Reyes on drug charges, was about to retire. He knew about Crystal's murder \u2014 that the investigation into her death had gone dormant \u2014 and contacted cold case Detective Dennis Olson with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in 2013. Maria Gutierrez-Diaz was a paid housekeeper for Avelino Tamala and Anna Reyes while they lived in the Ahwatukee home in Arizona. Diaz witnessed Crystal's abuse. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Olson agreed to revisit the case and started reading through dozens of police and investigative reports about Crystal's murder. He learned that no one ever talked with Diaz. New advances in law enforcement databases made it easier for Olson to find Diaz, who was living at her sister's home in Phoenix. Olson and a Spanish-speaking detective spoke with Diaz at her sister's home that year. It was the first time Diaz had talked with law enforcement officials about the case. But after a brief conversation, Diaz told the detectives that she hadn't witnessed Crystal's abuse. Again, the case stalled. A year passed before Diaz called the detectives. \"(Diaz) requested to speak with me about what happened to Crystal, because it was time for the truth to be known,\" Olson stated in his report about the call. Diaz told Olson about what she saw at the Ahwatukee home, explaining first why she didn't tell him the full story when they first met: She was afraid of speaking up \u2014 afraid of Tamala and Reyes. She thought the couple may have had something to do with an incident that hospitalized Diaz for several weeks in April 1997 \u2014 the same timeframe that Crystal was believed to have been murdered. Diaz recounted that evening on April 12, 1997, when Reyes dropped her off at a nightclub, on her weekend off, to meet her then-boyfriend and her sister. After a night of dancing, they left the club to find the window of her boyfriend's vehicle shattered. Nothing was missing from the car. While driving home, a car pulled up next to them. The people inside had guns. \"They started shooting and everything happened so fast. I bent down but they had already hit me,\" Diaz later recalled at Tamala's trial, barely able to speak through her tears. \"I didn't realize at that moment that (my boyfriend) was dead.\" Diaz was shot in the neck and spent two weeks recovering in the hospital. She returned to the Ahwatukee home to continue working for Reyes and Tamala. Crystal wasn't there. Fragments of Crystal Reyes' cranium were found by a hunter in 1998 in a remote section of desert near Mobile, Arizona. Maricopa County Sheriff's Office After several weeks, Diaz quit. She said \"it didn't feel right being there.\" She moved in with her sister. More than 15 years after her boyfriend was killed, after she was shot in the neck, after she moved in with her sister, Diaz told Detective Olson her full story. She detailed the abuse in Ahwatukee. She told detectives about the time Tamala visited her sister's home, after she had quit, subtly telling Diaz that her shooting wasn't random, warning her about Reyes. Diaz also told Olson, again recalling the details in court, that she thought she recognized one of the gunmen from April 1997. She thought it was the same man who Reyes had talked to shortly before the shooting, when she and Reyes stopped at a grocery store, when Reyes got out of the car and talked to the man while pointing at Diaz, when she and Reyes left the store without ever going inside. Diaz told detectives that she didn't think going to the police sooner about Crystal's abuse was an option. She thought Tamala was the police. A father and his DNA With a witness to Crystal's abuse, Olson's renewed investigation into her murder had started to take shape. He continued tracking people down, including the man detectives believed was Crystal's biological father. Darren Stockwell, the former MCSO detention officer whose relationship with Reyes ended several months after it began, was living in north Phoenix. It had been more than 20 years since he met Reyes. He hadn't heard from investigators about the case since shortly after a detective left a business card on his front door in 1998. On Aug. 1, 2014, Olson visited Stockwell at his home. Stockwell was surprised to see the detective. He was \"in shock\" when Olson told him about bone fragments found in the desert, that the remains were likely his daughter's, he recalled in court. Police recovered around 17 fragments of Crystal Reyes' cranium in 1998. Those fragments were used to conduct a DNA analysis to identify the 3-year-old girl. Maricopa County Attorney's Office Stockwell couldn't be certain that Reyes was telling the truth about her pregnancy in 1993. He didn't know that he actually had a child, let alone that she was dead. Olson asked Stockwell if he was willing to provide a sample of his DNA, to prove the bones were Crystal's. He initially refused, but provided a sample when Olson returned with a warrant. \"I didn't know what to think, I was overwhelmed,\" Stockwell said. \"It was pretty earth-shattering news.\" In court, Olson described the emotional interaction with Stockwell, when his eyes filled with tears as he learned he did have a daughter, that she was dead. His eyes welled again when he saw an old photo of Anna Reyes. But Stockwell also had questions, Olson said, adding that, before the DNA test, \"Stockwell asked why he wasn't contacted at the beginning of the investigation in [1998].\" Olson simply told him, \"I don't know.\" The DNA analysis, combined with Tamala's interviews and Diaz's statements, was enough to indict Tamala and Reyes on murder charges in December 2014. Tamala, who was on probation after serving 10 years in prison for the federal drug conviction, was arrested and booked into the Fourth Avenue Jail. His murder trial began on Oct. 18, 2016. One verdict, one wanted For a month, jurors listened to testimony. The group of detectives that investigated Crystal's case described their interviews, their successes and failures. The housekeeper wept as she recounted Crystal's abuse and the whimpers of a starving child. Forensic experts offered differing views about how Crystal died, agreeing only that there wasn't enough evidence to determine a specific cause of death. Friends, family and acquaintances detailed their encounters with Tamala and Reyes. Crystal's father talked about his romance with Reyes, how their abrupt breakup devastated him. They all had stories to tell. Some contradicted others. The truth of exactly how Crystal died was elusive. The 17 fragments of bone weren't enough to determine whether fractures in Crystal's partially recovered cranium suggested more to her death than a towel taped to her head. But that's not what the jurors were instructed to decide. Their task was specific: Should they find Avelino Tamala guilty of murder? Police recovered around 17 fragments of Crystal Reyes' cranium in 1998. Those fragments were used to conduct a DNA analysis to identify the 3-year-old girl. Maricopa County Attorney's Office It didn't take long for jurors to reach a verdict. The group moved into deliberations about 4 p.m. on a Monday. The notification that went out to legal counsels, asking them to return to court, came at 1:27 p.m. the following day. It was Nov. 8, 2016. Election Day. Seated in the front row, immediately behind prosecutors from the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, Darren Stockwell stood as the jurors entered the room. Behind him, nearly a dozen law enforcement detectives and retirees involved with the case waited. Stockwell stared ahead as the verdict was read, exhaling as his shoulders fell. Guilty. One by one, the jurors exited and walked past Stockwell, some with nods and shallow smiles as they made eye contact with Crystal's father. As Avelino Tamala awaits his sentencing on Dec. 9, the search continues for the woman at the center of a tangled web of lies and deceit, manipulation and murder. Anna Reyes was deported to Mexico in 2008, after serving eight years of a 10-year prison sentence for the federal drug conviction. She was living in the U.S. illegally. Her whereabouts are unknown.

    "text": "<p>Capt. Clay Higgins</p> Close KATC-TV/ \"Crimestoppers\" BATON ROUGE, La. - The 2016 campaign season has finally ended, with Louisiana\u2019s runoff election cementing Republican control of the U.S. Senate. The GOP also is holding onto the two U.S. House seats that were undecided going into the state\u2019s runoff election. Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy\u2019s victory Saturday gives the GOP a 52-48 edge in the Senate starting in January. His runoff campaign focused on his support for President-elect Donald Trump and opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Voters also chose Republican Clay Higgins, a former sheriff\u2019s captain known as the \u201c Cajun John Wayne ,\u201d in the 3rd District representing southwest and south central Louisiana. Republican state Rep. Mike Johnson won the 4th District, covering northwest Louisiana. How the \"Cajun John Wayne\" calls out suspects Higgins had gained national fame for hosting a\u00a0 weekly \u201cCrime Stoppers\u201d segment \u00a0for a local news show, where his tough talk earned him the \u201cJohn Wayne\u201d nickname. \u00a0 Higgins resigned from the Landry Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office earlier this year, after causing controversy with his viral online videos. He said he resigned as a captain in the Sheriff\u2019s Office \u201cas a matter of conscience,\u201d citing his faith as a primary motivator for moving on. \u201cI begin each day on bended knee, but I kneel to our savior,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not kneel to violent street gangs, I will not kneel to murderers or the parents who raised them. I will not kneel to a discredited wannabe black activist that doesn\u2019t really have the best interest of his people in mind. I will not kneel to bureaucrats from Washington, Baton Rouge or anywhere else.\u201d \u00a0 In one of his famous earlier videos, Higgins spoke directly to thieves who robbed a store for cigarettes. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of these idiots, pay attention son, and try to focus and listen to your elder,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cWhat you fellas are is the Virginia Slim gang cause you\u2019re certainly not Marlboro men.\u201d Higgins\u2019 home base is in Opelousas, Louisiana, the heart of Cajun country, famous for its music, cooking and culture. But Higgins said there\u2019s not a drop of Cajun in him. Before he was chasing suspects, the New Orleans native was chasing money. \u201cI had the trapping of success. I was -- I had money,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a very successful businessman, but wasn\u2019t fulfilled in my spirit and I knew there was another path for me.\u201d That path, he said, led him to law enforcement. \u201cI went from a job making $144,000 a year to making $8 an hour as a cop,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Kennedy entered the senate race as the front-runner and never relinquished the position, even when the field swelled to two dozen contenders in November. In the runoff, he defeated Democrat Foster Campbell, a state utility regulator who was such a long-shot that national Democratic organizations gave him little help. It was Kennedy\u2019s third U.S. Senate run since 2004 and this time he won in a landslide, taking 61 percent to Campbell\u2019s 39 percent in the low-turnout election. \u201cWith 52 seats in the U.S. Senate, we are excited for Republicans to confirm a conservative Supreme Court justice and begin working with President-elect Trump to pass an agenda of change for the American people,\u201d a statement from Republican National Committee co-chair Sharon Day said. Kennedy declared that he represents change in Washington. \u201cI believe that our future can be better than our present, but not if we keep going in the direction the Washington insiders have taken us the last eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about to change, folks.\u201d Louisiana\u2019s open primary system pits all candidates against each other and sends the top two vote-getters into a runoff when no one gets more than 50 percent. Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence both traveled to Louisiana to rally for Kennedy, and despite Campbell\u2019s slim chances, he did get donations from around the country, aimed at bolstering resistance to the Trump presidency. \u201cWe worked as hard as possible. We left no stone unturned,\u201d Campbell said in his concession speech. \u201cI make no excuses. We did everything humanly possible.\u201d The results keep Louisiana with one Democratic representative among its six congressman and two senators. The Senate seat was open because Republican David Vitter decided against running for a third term after losing the governor\u2019s race last year. Both Kennedy and Campbell have been involved in Louisiana politics for decades. Kennedy, an Oxford-educated lawyer from south Louisiana, is in his fifth term as treasurer, and has repeatedly been in the headlines while clashing with Louisiana\u2019s governors over state finances. He sprinkled campaign speeches with examples of government-financed contracts he considered outrageous, like money \u201cto study the effects of Swedish massage on bunny rabbits.\u201d Campbell, a cattle farmer and populist former state senator from north Louisiana who railed against \u201cBig Oil,\u201d talked openly about man-made climate change and argued for increasing the minimum wage. Though a Democrat, he opposed abortion and ran as supportive of gun rights. Two House seats were open because Republicans Charles Boustany and John Fleming unsuccessfully sought the Senate seat instead of re-election. The 3rd District race\u2019s presumed front-runner had been Scott Angelle, a Republican member of the Public Service Commission and well-known public official for nearly 30 years. But Higgins - who made attention-grabbing Crime Stoppers videos as a sheriff\u2019s captain - capitalized on disenchantment with career politicians to trounce Angelle with only a fraction of his money and a bare-bones organization. In the 4th District, Johnson defeated Democrat Marshall Jones in a competition that largely steered clear of attacks. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Elise Viebeck and Karoun Demirjian December 11 at 1:57 PM Follow @eliseviebeck Follow @karoun Republicans Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) have been highly critical of Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Russia. On Sunday, they joined Democrats in demanding a wide-ranging probe of Russia\u2019s election influence. (Michael Reynolds/EPA) Two Senate Republicans joined\u00a0demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia\u2019s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald J. Trump as questions continue to mount about the president-elect\u2019s expected\u00a0decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee\u00a0\u2014 joined calls by incoming\u00a0Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.) \u00a0for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIA\u2019s private conclusion that Russia\u2019s activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump. President-elect Donald Trump as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Dec. 11 reacted to the CIA's assessment that Russia intervened to help Trump win the election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyber-attacks.\u201d [ Trump, CIA on collision course over Russia\u2019s role in the election ] \u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security,\u201d they added. But McCain and Graham \u2014 who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election \u2014\u00a0 have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide-ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). One GOP senator \u2014 Sen. James Lankford (Okla.), who serves on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee \u2014 agreed with McCain and Graham\u2019s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections. \u201cCybersecurity investigation of Russian interference can\u2019t be partisan,\u201d Lankford tweeted Sunday. Republicans may be loathe to join calls for such a wide-ranging investigation into Russia\u2019s election-related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as \u201cridiculous.\u201d They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president-elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he praised during the campaign. \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it . . . No, I don\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d Trump said of the CIA charges on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d CIA officials told senators it is now \"quite clear\" that electing Donald Trump was Russia's goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) [ Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election ] McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number-two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets \u2014 although some of them suggested Congress\u2019s review of Russian actions should broaden. \u201cAll this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news,\u201d Cornyn tweeted Saturday. The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham: \u201cCyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia \u2013 not just election influence.\u201d \u2014 JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 10, 2016 Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he \u201crejects any politicization of intelligence matters,\u201d calling foreign intervention \u201cunacceptable.\u201d For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether \u00a0Putin\u2019s government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trump\u2019s likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO, as secretary of state due to his \u00a0ties to\u00a0Putin. Republicans in a 52-to-48 Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State,\u201d Rubio tweeted Sunday. Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Bob Menendez (N.J.) and Chris Coons (Del.), stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate. Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state \u201calarming and absurd,\u201d concluding that \u201cthe Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President\u2019s Cabinet guiding our nation\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d Yet\u00a0the committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) \u2014 who was considered a possible pick for Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 has said Tillerson would be a good choice. \u201cIf it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual,\u201d Corker tweeted. Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least 50 of the 52 votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence could cast the tie-breaking vote. Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man much at all, but let\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then we\u2019re gonna have some talkin\u2019,\u201d Graham said early Saturday morning. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some questions. I don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d Mike DeBonis contributed to this report. powerpost ",

    "text": "CBS News Dec 11, 2016 1:33 PM EST Kellyanne Conway on Sunday defended President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s response to the confirmation from intelligence officials that Russia worked to influence the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump, saying the stories are just an attempt to \u201crelitigate\u201d the results from Election Day. Mr. Trump \u201cthinks people are trying to relitigate the election,\u201d Conway told CBS\u2019 \u201c Face the Nation ,\u201d \u201c...First it was [FBI Director] Jim Comey\u2019s fault. Then we\u2019re going to have a recount. Then it\u2019s the alt-right\u2019s fault. Now it\u2019s Russian interference.\u201d Conway\u2019s comments follow reports in the Washington Post and other news outlets -- and confirmed by CBS News -- that intelligence officials believe Russia not only worked to cause chaos in the U.S. election, but was specifically working to promote Mr. Trump . She echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the story: in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d he said new revelations about Russia\u2019s influence on his behalf are \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2026 Every week it\u2019s another excuse. \u00a0We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\u201d Conway called for a \u201cpeaceful transition,\u201d and suggested those unhappy with the election result look at President Obama\u2019s actions as a guide. \u201cI want to tell everybody, take the cues and the clues from President Obama himself who has not just congratulated Donald Trump as the new president but conceded to him,\u201d she said. (Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, not Mr. Obama, formally conceded the election to Mr. Trump.) Conway added that Mr. Obama and his administration are \u201cthere to support this peaceful transition into democracy and I just believe unfounded accusations like this really undercut that.\u201d Conway said Mr. Trump would allow a\u00a0 congressional investigation \u00a0into the matter to proceed, reassuring that he \u201cwould not interfere in the legislative branch in that way\u201d -- but also said Mr. Trump has \u201cmade very clear\u201d his views on the subject of Russian interference. Conway also worked to square Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the Russia issue with his overall feelings toward the intelligence community: in the wake of the stories this weekend, the Trump transition team released a statement blasting the intelligence community as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d \u201cHe absolutely respects the intelligence community. He\u2019s made clear he\u2019s going to put his own people in there as well,\u201d Conway said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s said is laughable and ridiculous is this entire notion \u2026 that somehow this was meant to defeat Hillary Clinton and elevate him to the presidency. Its untrue and it\u2019s also unfair.\u201d She also defended his decision to receive the president\u2019s highly classified intelligence briefings just once a week , as opposed to daily as his recent predecessors have done, and noted she and other top-level advisers are not included in those briefings. \u201cHe appreciates these briefings but let me make very clear that even me as a close adviser and many others with whom you\u2019ll be speaking about do not have access to those top secret briefings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that type of clearance nor should we. So \u2026 he is not divulging the information he has, nor should he.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Today, the ancient city lies in ruins. Salih tears up thinking about Nimrud's destruction \u2014 60 percent of what's been excavated now gone, according to her estimate. Seeing Nimrud as a schoolgirl inspired her to become an archaeologist; many of her colleagues are still trapped inside the city. \"It is a tragic thing \u2014 our culture, our history, our memories,\" she says, wiping her eyes. \"They tried to destroy the identity of Iraq. The only thing we can do now is document the damage so we can start thinking of how to rebuild again.\" Nimrud before ISIS wrecked it in March, 2015. Yuka Tachibana / NBC News A recent visit to Nimrud revealed the devastating scale of the destruction. Just the archway entrance to famed Northwest Palace, built by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II, remains, surrounded by piles of rubble. The fragments of its former winged guardians lie in a heap nearby.

Sheikh Khalid al-Jabbouri, a local tribal commander from Nimrud, says he wept when he first saw how little remained of the ancient city that generations of his family used to take care of. \"I wasn't as devastated when they destroyed my house or when they killed some of my relatives because this is life \u2014 all of us die,\" he says, surveying the damage. \"But Nimrud was like a part of our family. This heritage was part of our lives, part of all of Iraq.\" Leila Sallih became an archaeologist after she was mesmerized by the ancient city of Nimrud which she saw for the first time as a teenager. She spent many years excavating the site. Yuka Tachibana / NBC News Iraq has lost thousands of precious objects from its national museum and other \u00adarchaeological sites following the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. And Salih says that Nimrud needs immediate protection before archaeologists can fully assess the damage. She also hopes that the militants featured in the ISIS video would be found and prosecuted for war crimes, similar to what happened in Mali. While the ancient palaces and pyramid are gone for good, Salih says there is hope yet for Nimrud. Only 30 percent of the site has been excavated.

Iraq Historical artifact with intricate carvings lies on the ground in Nimrud. Yuka Tachibana / NBC News An Assyrian Christian whose family was driven from their home by ISIS two years ago, 17-year-old Ninous Thabit considers Nimrud to be the work of his ancestors. Over the past year, he's been sculpting intricate replicas of the priceless objects destroyed by ISIS. Related: ISIS Damages Iraq's Hatra Archaeological Site in Purported Video He says he made nearly 40 pieces over the past year \u2014 including replicas of the famed \"lamassu\" statues -- winged bulls with human heads. It's painstaking work, but Thabit says he feels a duty to protect his country's heritage. \"It is very hard to accept the destruction of a civilization that was built thousands of years ago so started sculpting Assyrian figures, especially those are connected to Nimrud to fight back,\" Thabit said. \"I wanted to let ISIS knows that we are people who love life, we love our civilization, and we will protect it in the future.\" Lucy Kafanov ",

Asked in an exclusive interview with \u201c Fox News Sunday \u201d whether he\u2019d take a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d to President Obama\u2019s legacy, the construction magnate responded: \u201cNo.\u00a0I don't want to do that at all.\u00a0I just want what's right.\u201d The answer may have surprised those watching Trump\u2019s recent Cabinet selections, which have included: a prominent ObamaCare critic to lead the Health and Human Services Department; a foe of Obama\u2019s overtime pay expansion to lead the Labor Department; and a state attorney general currently suing the Environmental Protection Agency to lead that very agency. Trump, at the same time, has sent mixed signals about his plans, meeting in recent days with prominent climate change activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about the implications of those meetings as well as his Cabinet selections, Trump indicated his interest is in making the government more efficient and responsive to business.\u00a0 TRUMP RIPS CLAIMS OF RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IN 2016 RACE At the EPA, he said, \u201cYou can't get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay?\u00a0That's why people don't want to invest in this country.\u201d\u00a0 Trump said: \u201cSo we're going to clean it up.\u00a0We're going to speed it up and, by the way, if somebody is not doing the right thing we're not going to approve. \u2026 We can't let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.\u201d Trump steered clear of committing to specific actions regarding projects that have pitted environmental interests against the energy industry, while suggesting economic considerations are paramount to him. On the long-disputed Keystone pipeline that was halted by the Obama administration, Trump said \u201cyou\u2019re going to have a decision fairly quickly.\u201d Asked about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which the Army Corps of Engineers wants to re-route following protests, Trump said he did not want to answer right now. \u201cBut I will tell you, when I get to office, if it's not solved, I'll have it solved very quickly,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cSomething will happen.\u00a0It'll be quick.\u00a0I think it's very unfair.\u00a0So, it\u2019ll start, one way or the other.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, said he is still studying the Paris climate agreement \u2013 a pact, backed by the U.S. and dozens of other nations, committing countries to curb the global rise in temperatures \u2013 but, \u201cI don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries.\u201d When asked where he stood on the environment and climate change, Trump would not be pinned down. \u201cI'm very open-minded.\u00a0I'm still open-minded.\u00a0Nobody really knows,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cLook, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows.\u00a0It's not something that's so hard and fast. I do know this:\u00a0other countries are eating our lunch.\u201d Taken together, Trump\u2019s comments, meetings and appointments speak to an incoming president still weighing his options on how drastically he wants to reverse or halt the Obama regulatory agenda. In an indication that the incoming administration may be preparing for big changes with regard to energy sector programs and rules, his transition team reportedly has sent around a questionnaire asking the Energy Department for a list of appointees and senior executives \u2013 and details on who has spearheaded the agency\u2019s clean energy initiatives. One unnamed department official described the questionnaire as a hit list, according to an Associated Press report. The memo sparked alarm among some Democrats, as did Trump\u2019s decision last week to name Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. Pruitt has been involved in lawsuits against the Obama EPA, including over the controversial Clean Power Plan and waterway regulations. He also has suggested the debate over global warming \u2013 and the impact of human activity on global temperatures \u2013 is unsettled. \u00a0 Former Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested Sunday that the Pruitt pick suggests the meetings with Gore and others are not informing policy decisions. \u201cI\u2019m glad they reached out to Gore, but apparently they are not hearing what Gore has to say,\u201d he told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Sanders said it\u2019s troubling Trump would appoint a climate change \u201cdenier\u201d to lead the EPA. Trump\u2019s first order of Obama legacy business may be the Affordable Care Act, with congressional Republicans eager to send a repeal bill to his desk next year. Trump has said he plans to nominate Georgia Rep. Tom Price to lead HHS, which would put an outspoken ObamaCare critic at the helm of the agency that implemented the law. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that the Obama administration \u201cpushed investment out\u201d with its raft of rules and predicted a shift toward what he called \u201ccommon-sense regulation,\u201d including with health care. \u00a0 \u201cOur No. 1 focus is jobs [in the House],\u201d he said. \u201c[ObamaCare] is going to collapse on itself. We have to look at health care in a new form and have a new health care system.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Source: IHS Conflict Monitor (control areas from Dec. 5-Dec. 8) DEC. 10, 2016 By The New York Times Later, Umm Faisal said, she, her husband and two children took a taxi to the rebel-held town of Marea, near the Turkish border. Along the twisting route, they bribed guards at checkpoints and talked their way out of detention by Kurdish militias. Before she left the refugee center, Umm Faisal refused to appear on state television, she said, because \u201cI couldn\u2019t lie on TV.\u201d Others, though, have been filmed thanking Mr. Assad, receiving aid bags marked \u201cHelp from Russia\u201d and saying rebels had earlier prevented them from leaving. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One aid worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said it was unclear how freely civilians in government territory were speaking. But the worker said one man had told her in compelling detail that the rebels refused to let him leave for medical treatment for his young daughter, who was rail thin from a stomach ailment. Separately, a nurse in eastern Aleppo, who spoke on the condition that she not be named, told us that rebels had stopped her parents and others from leaving the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. First, the fighters warned their group that government troops would shoot them, the nurse said. Then they threatened the travelers, asking why they wanted to \u201cgo to those who are bombing you.\u201d \u201cWe are dead either way,\u201d one civilian had replied, the nurse said. Aid workers say the reclaimed areas of east Aleppo are largely destroyed and empty: Very few people stayed as troops moved in. The army took several hundred people back to one district, Hanano, telling them to move into abandoned apartments. But with no electricity, heat or water and many homes looted, some have asked to return to shelters despite the cold, uncomfortable conditions there as aid agencies scramble to catch up. Those who have decided to stay inside eastern Aleppo face continued airstrikes and shelling as people crowd into shrinking areas without medical care. Modar Shekho, a nurse, and his family ran from their house under fire, several of his friends said. As they searched for shelter, a shell killed his brother. As they looked for a place to bury him, the friends said, another explosion killed his father, a teacher who had helped arrange for students to take their state exams despite the siege. It was the second time that Mr. Shekho had lost two members of his family in a single day, according to friends; a brother and sister, a doctor and nurse, died in a hospital bombing in 2013. Given such suffering, rebel groups are arguing. A hard-line minority, including the Qaeda-linked Levant Conquest Front, wants to continue the fight, and the rest, including United States-backed groups, want to make a deal to get civilians out. Some question whether they have already waited too long. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Zohair al-Shimali, a longtime activist, said he and others who had led street protests and later supported rebels had failed to deliver. \u201cPeople started to hate their lives because of us,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is for nothing, we lost everything.\u201d He said that while some rebels were counseling \u201cpatience,\u201d he was ready for any deal, either for rebels to leave in exchange for ending the bombing or to bus civilians out. \u201cPeople have the right to take their children wherever they want, we can\u2019t take them as hostages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t meet the promises we made them.\u201d Infighting and mistrust among rebels have hastened their collapse. During the week, Qaeda-linked fighters attacked United States-backed groups and took their supplies. Dr. Farida, a gynecologist who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, checked off the people around her who planned to leave. \u201cMy only neighbor, my only aunt and uncle, my secretary, my maid, and even my right hand at work are going to the regime areas,\u201d she wrote in a text message. \u201cThey are neutral and just want to live and eat and drink, they don\u2019t care about the revolution and religion. \u201cI feel like I lost a piece of me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Maher Samaan from Paris.

Delta confirmed the incident to Today in the Sky, saying it occurred around 11:30 a.m. ET on a flight arriving from Buffalo. \"Delta Flight 724 ... landed and was turning from the runway onto the taxiway when it left the pavement, stopping in the snowy grass,\" Delta spokesman Anthony Black said in a statement. \"The passengers were off-loaded and bused to the terminal about an hour late. All bags were recovered.\" Delta said none of the 65 passengers or five crew members were injured. x Share The National Weather Service issued lake effect snow warnings across much of northeast Ohio Saturday as cold air streams across the Great Lakes. Similar conditions are forecast for parts of the upper Midwest and the Northeast. (Dec. 10) AP The incident\u00a0 happened as snow fell in Detroit and at other airports across the Great Lakes region. It was not immediately clear how much the snow might have contributed to the mishap, though the storm had forced airlines to ground more than 1,500 flights in the region. Following the incident, a \"ground stop\" was put in place by the Federal Aviation Administration for flights at other airports awaiting take off for Detroit. The agency cited \"WEATHER/SNOW-ICE and WEATHER/BRAKING ACTION\" as the ground stop remained in effect as of 3:20 p.m. ET. Delta spokesman Black said the airline has launched an investigation to determine exactly what caused the plane to leave the pavement. Numerous passengers from Delta Flight 724 took to social media with tales of the incident; many included photos from the scene. \u201cWe got to exit off the tail of the plane.

Video provided by AFP Newslook President-elect Donald Trump attending the Army-Navy game Saturday in Baltimore (Photo: Rob Carr) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Donald Trump ran for the White House\u00a0as an outsider and a pragmatist.\u00a0But he's quickly putting together an administration\u00a0that will be\u00a0the most fiercely conservative of any in decades. After campaigning as the least ideological presidential contender in modern times, Trump is\u00a0naming a Cabinet and senior White House staff that is dominated by retired military leaders, wealthy business executives and partisan activists who oppose the historic mission of the departments they are poised to head. While the president-elect issued few policy blueprints while he was seeking the job, his nominees for key posts already have been leading the charge to dismantle President Obama's initiatives on health care and climate change. \"I call it the\u00a0three 'G' Cabinet: Goldman, generals and gazillionaires,\" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, said mockingly Sunday on ABC's This Week, a reference to multiple Trump appointees who have worked at the Wall Street firm\u00a0Goldman Sachs. On Fox News Sunday, Trump said he\u00a0was\u00a0\"very, very close\" to naming his pick for the Cabinet's biggest prize, secretary of State, speaking favorably of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. \"He's much more than a business executive,\" Trump said of Tillerson, reported to be the frontrunner for the job.\u00a0\"I mean, he's a world-class player.\" The president-elect also favorably mentioned two other prospects, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker. Trump's unorthodox campaign, dominated by a promise to \"make America great again\" and attacks on Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, gave limited \u00a0insights about what a Trump administration would look like. But in the past four weeks, he has\u00a0reassured Republicans and alarmed Democrats by appointments that largely reflect GOP orthodoxy \u2014 from a Labor secretary-designate who opposes raising the minimum wage to a Housing and Urban Development secretary-designate who warns that subsidized housing fosters dependency. His domestic team would have been a good fit for just about any of his Republican primary rivals, though Trump's friendly stance toward Russia and its provocative president, Vladimir Putin, is at odds with GOP tradition and the party's leading congressional voices on foreign policy. So far, Trump's choices \u2014 including top jobs for a trio of veterans of Goldman Sachs, a firm he blasted at campaign rallies\u00a0\u2014 haven't reflected the populist impulses that fueled his appeal to some white working-class voters\u00a0or his vow to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington of donors and other insiders. \"I think we're going to have one of the great Cabinets ever put together,\" Trump boasted.\u00a0The nominations, announced via Twitter and at campaign-style rallies, provide clues about how he will operate and what he will do after the Inauguration. Here are some things we're learning: 'I like generals' \"I think generals are terrific, you know?\" Trump said in Sunday's interview on Fox News. \"They go through schools and they sort of end up at the top of the pyramid, and it's like a test. They passed the test of life.\" He's picked three of them to top jobs: retired Marine Corps Gen.\u00a0James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis as secretary of Defense, retired Marine Corps Gen.\u00a0John Kelly as secretary of Homeland Security, and retired Army Gen.\u00a0Michael Flynn as national security adviser. He's also met at Trump Tower with retired Army Gen.\u00a0David Petraeus and retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis as he weighed the possibilities for secretary of State. Corporate command Not since the Eisenhower administration have so many business executives landed top government jobs, making Trump's Cabinet the wealthiest in American history. \"I want people that made a fortune because now they're negotiating with you,\" he told supporters in Des Moines Thursday during his \"thank you\" tour. \"It's not different than a great baseball player or a great golfer.\" He has designated former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Bannon as his senior White House strategist, Goldman veteran Steve Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary and\u00a0billionaire activist Betsy DeVos as Education secretary. Another billionaire, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, has been named deputy Commerce secretary. Linda McMahon, a former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, has been chosen to head the Small Business Administration. A millionaire who is married to a billionaire,\u00a0she contributed $7 million to pro-Trump super PACs\u00a0this fall. Climate-change campaign in the crosshairs Last week, environmental activists were encouraged when Trump met with former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, both activists on climate change. Then the president-elect selected as head of the Environmental Protection Agency Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt \u2014 a skeptic of climate change who repeatedly has sued the EPA to push back regulations aimed at reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), an ally of the fossil-fuel industry, is reported to be Trump's choice to lead the Interior Department. She has supported legislation to open the Atlantic Ocean to drilling and prevent the Interior Department from regulating hydraulic fracturing. Trump, who during the campaign called climate change \"a big scam,\" now says it's up for debate and decries the burden of regulations on businesses. (Mainstream scientists overwhelmingly agree that the climate is changing, in part due to human activity.) \"I'm still open-minded,\" Trump said Sunday. \"Nobody really knows.\" He complained that China, Mexico and other countries were \"eating our lunch\" because of environmental regulations. \"\"We can't let all of these permits, that take forever to get, stop our jobs,\" he said, adding that he was studying whether to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. \"I don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries.\" Russian roulette Trump's stance on Russia, including his call for more cooperation with Putin, puts him at odds with many of the Republicans allied with him on other fronts. Some of the top appointments he has made or is considering are aligned with his views. Flynn sat next to Putin last year during a paid appearance in Moscow for Russia Today, a TV network financed by the Kremlin.\u00a0Tillerson, who has negotiated business deals with Putin for years, was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013. Trump\u00a0disputed the conclusion in an unpublished CIA report that Russia tried to intervene in the election to boost his prospects. \"I think it's ridiculous,\" he said. \"I don't believe it.\" Senate Armed Services chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) disagreed. \"It's clear the Russians interfered,\" he said on CBS' Face the Nation. He called for a select congressional committee to investigate Russia's efforts and expressed concern about Tillerson's ties to Moscow. \"It's\u00a0a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin, and obviously they've done enormous deals together,\" McCain said. \"That\u00a0would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, one of Trump's primary rivals who happens to be on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will consider his nomination for secretary of State, on Sunday signaled his concern in a Trump-like way \u2014 on Twitter. \"Being a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryofState,\" he posted. 4908 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 130 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hBnc4M ",

    "text": "Jury Deliberations Begin in Will Smith Murder Trial Following Emotional Closing Arguments By Michael Edison Hayden Dec 11, 2016, 7:27 PM ET 0 Shares Star Matthew Sharpe/Getty Images Will Smith, #91 of the New Orleans Saints, heads for the sidelines during the game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Louisiana Superdome, on Oct. 31, 2010, in New Orleans, Louisiana. 0 Shares Email Jury deliberations began this afternoon in New Orleans after the prosecution and the defense completed their closing arguments today in the trial of Cardell Hayes, the man accused of fatally shooting former New Orleans Saints star Will Smith in an alleged road-rage incident. Smith, 34, died after an altercation with Hayes in New Orleans on April 9. He was found dead in his Mercedes SUV with the driver's door open, slumped over the driver's seat, according to The Associated Press. Hayes, a former semi-professional football player, will face a mandatory life sentence if convicted, according to The AP, and has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder . Today, the prosecution and defense painted different portraits of the incident that took place between the two men this past spring. Video Captures Aftermath of Football Player Will Smith's Killing \"Will Smith played defense for the Saints but he was defenseless that night. Now it's your turn to play defense for him,\" Orleans Parish Assistant District Attorney Jason Napoli asserted today about the former Saints player in his closing arguments. Napoli said that all of the bullets and casings found at the scene were from Hayes' gun, a statement that seems intended to refute Hayes' testimony that he heard Smith fire his own weapon. A loaded gun was found inside Smith's Mercedes SUV, according to police, but there was no evidence that the weapon had been fired. Napoli also pointed to testimony from Kevin O'Neal, who was riding in Hayes' orange Hummer at the time of the incident. O'Neal testified on Thursday that there was no physical contact between the two parties during the incident. However, Hayes testified that Smith punched him multiple times during the altercation. According to local ABC affiliate WGNO, O'Neal said when they were at a red light and it turned green, Smith hit the brakes, causing Hayes' vehicle to hit Smith's. Police said the rear window of Smith's Mercedes SUV shattered from the impact. Hayes is also charged with attempted second-degree murder for allegedly shooting and injuring Smith's wife, Racquel Smith, in the incident. \"Racquel Smith had to watch as the love of her life was murdered,\" Napoli said today. Defense attorney John Fuller made an emotional and at times angry plea on behalf of Hayes in his closing arguments. \"Have you asked yourself what would happen if we treated this case the same, but the roles were reversed?\" Fuller said, arguing that, in his opinion, if Smith had shot Hayes, this case would not have gone to trial. \"Would anyone be sitting at this defense table? Change the variables and no one would be sitting here. Everyone knows that.\" According to The Times-Picayune, Fuller previously said that his client felt threatened and was the victim of a hit-and-run by either Smith or Smith's friends who were driving in a separate car just moments before Hayes' Hummer was involved in an accident with Smith's Mercedes SUV. \"My client was not the aggressor,\" Fuller said in a court appearance in April, The Times-Picayune reported. Fuller also insinuated that witnesses who knew Smith lied about what happened, and suggested that the prosecution tried to focus on making the defense attorneys look bad. \"Y'all are really seeing how this [district attorney's] office operates!\" he told the jury. Fuller concluded by saying that Smith didn't deserve to die, but that he put Hayes in a position where he had to defend himself. \"This boy acted in self-defense,\" he said, laying a hand on Hayes. \"You've got to make some tough decisions,\" Fuller told the jury. \"The proper decision is 'not guilty' on all counts.\" Assistant District Attorney Laura Rodrigue then delivered the state's rebuttal, accusing Fuller of seeming to think that this case was \"about him.\" She also denied Fuller's claim that there was \"special treatment\" for this case. \"Every time a victim in this city comes forward, we take those cases as they are,\" she said. Ultimately, she said the case comes down to \"math and science.\" She said Hayes made no effort to slam on the brakes, \"which means that crash is intentional.\" She also blasted Hayes' testimony that he was punched multiple times, saying there were no marks on his face. \"Does that make sense?\" she asked. \"This is about someone getting really mad.

    "text": "Prosecutors in 2 States Face Uphill Police Murder-Retrials By dan sewell, associated press CINCINNATI \u0097 Dec 11, 2016, 6:13 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Michael Slager, at right, walks from the Charleston County Courthouse under the protection from the Charleston County Sheriff's Department after a mistrial was declared for his trial Monday Dec. 5, 2016, in Charleston, S.C. Former patrolman, Slager, was charged with murder in the April 4, 2015, shooting death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. (AP Photo/Mic Smith) 0 Shares Email Facing uphill battles to find jurors willing to convict police officers, prosecutors in two states say they will try again to win guilty verdicts against white officers in the fatal shootings of black men. A judge in the case against former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing set a Monday hearing on a timetable for a retrial. Jurors couldn't reach a verdict on murder and voluntary manslaughter charges against him in the death of Sam DuBose, and a mistrial was declared Nov. 12. A South Carolina jury deadlocked Dec. 5 on the same charges against Michael Slager, a former North Charleston officer. The prosecutor also pledged to try Slager again for the death of Walter Scott . Legal experts say the mistrials underscore the difficulties prosecutors face in police cases, with many jurors unwilling to second-guess officers' split-second reactions when they claim to be in danger. \"Juries tend to give police officers the benefit of the doubt,\" said Mike Allen, a Cincinnati attorney and former prosecutor. \"You can argue till the cows come home whether that's right or not.\" In both trials, the former officers testified in their own defenses and said they feared for their lives. Tensing, 27, said he believed he could be killed by DuBose's car, as the 43-year-old man tried to drive away after he was stopped by Tensing in July 2015 for a missing front license plate. Slager, 35, said the 50-year-old Scott wrestled his stun gun away and pointed it at him after he stopped Scott for a broken tail light in April 2015. Prosecutors said evidence including Tensing's bodycam video contradicted his story. A bystander's cellphone video showed Slager shooting Scott five times in the back, video that was widely seen and further inflamed national debate about how police treat blacks. \"Even in the most egregious cases, it takes an awful lot to get a jury to convict a police officer,\" said Philip Stinson, a Bowling Green (Ohio) State University criminologist who tracks police shooting cases around the country. \"They just don't want to believe that a police officer can be capable of murder.\" The only police officer Stinson knows of who's been convicted of murder by a jury for an on-duty shooting since he began compiling statistics in 2005 is James Ashby. The former small-town Colorado officer was sentenced to 16 years in prison after a jury in June convicted him of second-degree murder for fatally shooting Jack Jacquez in the back in 2014 after following him into the home of the slain man's mother. By Stinson's count, 78 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter in on-duty shootings since the beginning of 2005. Those cases resulted in 27 convictions on at least one charge, 14 in jury trials. Thirty ended without convictions, including 15 jury acquittals. Twenty-one, including Tensing and Slager, are pending trials or potential retrials. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said he wants to move the Tensing case to another Ohio county, away from intense local attention he believes added pressure to jurors who at one point refused to come out of the jury room because of fears about being identified publicly. It seems unlikely Hamilton County Judge Leslie Ghiz, who took over the case after the first trial judge recused herself, would agree to move the trial without first trying to seat a jury in Cincinnati. Changes of venue are rarely granted and are usually sought by defense attorneys who feel their clients have been subjected to prejudicial publicity. Regardless, Allen said, prosecutors will be going against jury tendencies in police shooting cases. \"I do understand the prosecutor's desire to move the trial, but I think it's probably going to be the same in any jurisdiction,\" he said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell For some of his other recent stories: http://bigstory.ap.org/content/dan-sewell 0 Shares ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Through documents and interviews, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned about Chor Nar Siu Ng: \u2022 First, Ms. Ng owns several properties in the Bay Area \u2014 roughly 10 \u2014 most of which are in Oakland. She owns the warehouse that burned, at 1315 31st Avenue, as well as an adjacent lot to the south and an adjacent building to the north. That building houses a Boost Mobile store, a boutique called Moda and a family-owned religious goods shop called Botanica 3 MMM. \u2022 Second, the city has spent years fining Ms. Ng for what it calls \u201cnuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious\u201d conditions at the lot south of the warehouse and at the building to the north. While it\u2019s difficult to determine exactly how much Ms. Ng has paid because of these conditions, tax records offer a clue: Between 2005 and 2014, Ms. Ng paid $26,570.20 in \u201ccode enforcement\u201d fees to the city of Oakland for the lot next to the Ghost Ship. I\u2019ve reached out to the city to ask about the specifics of what led to these fines. Messages were also left with two of Ms. Ng\u2019s children, as well as with a lawyer named Gerard Lam, who represented Ms. Ng in a previous dispute with a tenant. There\u2019s been no response yet. \u2022 Third, it\u2019s clear that Ms. Ng had at least some presence in the warehouse area. Several people who used to live at the Ghost Ship have said Ms. Ng or her daughter would come by the warehouse, first alerting Derick Ion Almena, the man who rented the place from them. What\u2019s not clear is whether the Ngs entered the building and saw what was inside: a jury-rigged staircase, a blocked exit upstairs, webs of extension cords, propane tanks used to heat water and piles of flammable debris. Now that it\u2019s evident that Ms. Ng has a string of properties around the city, it will be important to try to find her tenants. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What did they think of how she ran her buildings? Did they feel safe? For about 20 years, Griselda Ceja and her family rented a portion of the building next to the burned warehouse. From there, Ms. Ceja ran a beauty salon she called Griselda\u2019s. (The salon is still listed on Google Maps.) \u201cShe never took care of the building,\u201d Ms. Ceja said. \u201cWe were scared. We were all scared.\u201d Ms. Ceja, 43, described troubling conditions: a circuit box and light fixtures that sparked as she dried customers\u2019 hair. A blocked emergency exit. An aged electric system that failed constantly. There were also rats in the walls and holes in the floors. She wanted to go elsewhere but couldn\u2019t afford to, she said. Ms. Ceja said she complained frequently to Ms. Ng and her relatives, communicating through letters, phone calls and text messages. After about a year, Ms. Ceja said, the Ngs added a second circuit box, an effort to stop the sparking. Ms. Ceja said she called the city once, about a decade ago, to complain about the rats. She said an Oakland official came by, but she didn\u2019t press him to take action. \u201cHe said the building would close if he did something about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand everyone would go out of business.\u201d A request has been sent to the city for documents that would confirm this. Ms. Ceja suggested talking to Leo Barrera, who had worked with her at the salon, to verify her account. \u201cWe told them many times: \u2018Please, if you could fix this, we need light, or water, or an emergency exit,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barrera, 36, said at her new beauty shop. \u201cThe most basic. Nothing more. We weren\u2019t asking for luxuries,\u201d she said. California Today The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

The Bob Dylan Archive -- which contains thousands of his personal writings and items -- is housed at the University of Tulsa. \u201cThe biggest surprise in the archive -- not just for me, but also for his biographers and people who have seriously studied his work -- was the amount of writing that Bob managed to hold onto,\u201d said curator Michael Chaiken.

The Indianapolis Star reported that the ACLU\u2019s Indiana chapter and Knightstown resident Joseph Tompkins argue that the Christian symbol on display in the Knightstown town square violates the First Amendment. The lawsuit is seeking for removal of the cross, monetary damages and declaration that the cross display violates the First Amendment.\u00a0 CBS affiliate WTTV reported that the suit alleges that the Latin cross \u201cis the preeminent symbol of Christianity, representing the instrument of the crucifixion of Jesus.\u201d So if the display is religious, the suit argues, it has no business on town property. \u00a0 Court documents say that the illuminated cross is atop a large evergreen tree and has for a number of years. The documents say there are no other holiday decorations on the square.\u00a0 \u00a0 The documents go on to say that every day, Tompkins \u201cis forced to come into direct and unwelcome contact\u201d with the cross on top of the tree as he drives through town. This, the suit says, has caused him \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d which can only be remedied by taking the cross down and paying Tompkins monetary damages. \u201cYou gotta sit down and talk about it before you file the lawsuits,\u201d said Knighstown resident Kevin Richey to WTTV. \u00a0 The town of about 2,200 residents is about 40 miles east of Indianapolis.\u00a0 Town officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment from the newspaper or The Associated Press. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

English emerged victorious Monday following a meeting of the National Party caucus. Two other candidates for the job withdrew last week after English gained more support. He is to be officially sworn in later Monday. His ascension from deputy prime minister follows the surprise resignation last week of John Key after eight years as prime minister. Key was a popular leader and was expected to contest a fourth straight election next year. But he said he wanted to leave while he was on top and to spend more time with his wife and two children.

By Juliet Eilperin December 11 at 3:14 PM Follow @eilperin President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election night rally on Nov. 9 in New York. (Evan Vucci/AP) President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that \u201cnobody really knows\u201d whether climate change is real and that he is \u201cstudying\u201d whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago. In an interview with\u00a0\u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cvery open-minded\u201d on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obama\u2019s efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut America\u2019s global competitiveness. \u201cI\u2019m still open-minded. Nobody really knows,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s so hard and fast. I do know this: Other countries are eating our lunch.\u201d [ Scientists, environmentalists gear up for a clash with Trump ] There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity \u2014 including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing \u2014 is driving recent climate change.\u00a0In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0 concluded that it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the \u201cdominant cause\u201d of the planet\u2019s warming trend.\u00a0The top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880. But it\u2019s not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view. During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a \u201choax\u201d perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At\u00a0that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to\u00a0address the issue, to which he replied: \u201cLet me ask you this \u2014 take it easy, fellas \u2014 how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming?\u201d After asking three times \u201cWho believes in global warming?\u201d and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that \u201cnobody\u201d believed climate change was underway except for Andrade. During Sunday\u2019s interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U.S. competitors. \u201cIf you look at what \u2014 I could name country after country. You look at what\u2019s happening in Mexico, where our people are just \u2014 plants are being built, and they don\u2019t wait 10 years to get an approval to build a plant, okay?\u201d he said. \u201cThey build it like the following day or the following week. We can\u2019t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs.\u201d The U.S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the 2008 recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U.S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts. The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he\u00a0has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt \u2014 a climate change skeptic \u2014 as the head. Wallace asked whether he\u00a0was \u201cgoing to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy,\u201d to which Trump replied, \u201cNo. No. No. I don\u2019t want to do that at all.\u00a0 I just want what\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cEPA, you can\u2019t get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, okay? \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people don\u2019t want to invest in this country.\u201d It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States\u2019 voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force.
