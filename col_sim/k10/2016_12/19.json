The civil defense office of that western state of Jalisco says the three eruptions occurred Sunday morning. The biggest columns of ash reached 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) in height, and the smallest was just under a mile tall. The eruptions cap about 10 days of periodic exhalations at the volcano, which is one of Mexico's most active. Also known as the Volcano of Fire, the 12,533-foot (3,820-meter) volcano is 430 miles (690 kilometers) west of Mexico City.

    "text": "What was the worst thing the Bears did against the Packers? Where do you start? Photos from the Bears-Packers game on Dec. 18 at Soldier Field. Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog The choice (and remember, death is not an option): Bears quarterbacking or Bears tackling? Or Bears coverage or Bears coaching? But say this for the Bears offense: Whether it\u2019s Matt Barkley or Jay Cutler , the strip-sack and horrible interceptions consistently remain regular parts of the game plan against the Packers . And just when so many people had Barkley making the Pro Bowl. You can give Barkley credit for a comeback if you want, but he threw three picks and lost a fumble. Good luck trusting that. Barkley doesn\u2019t have a starter\u2019s arm, nor did he have a desire to get his top receiver involved. Yeah, sure, Alshon Jeffery showed up and caught a TD pass, but none of it happened until the Packers led 27-10. That\u2019s when Jeffery showed up. Or that\u2019s when Barkley started throwing to him. Take your pick. Sunday's Bears game against the Packers was not the coldest at Soldier Field, but still made the list of 10 most frigid games at the venue.In NFL games, temperature is recorded at kickoff -- 11 degrees at 12:02 p.m., Sunday -- which doesn't take into consideration any fluctuations that happen after... (Kori Rumore) Don\u2019t tell me Jeffery was double-covered. If Barkley can throw into double- or triple-coverage for any other target downfield, and he did and that's how some passes become interceptions, then he can give Jeffery a chance to high-point a pass. Barkley showed too much of that Brian Hoyer -like trait of immediately going away from his top target because a team shows two-man coverage. Like that, the quarterback helps the opponent take the best receiver out of the game. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s particularly smart, but hey, that\u2019s just me. And besides, Barkley was turning over the ball anyway, so why not target your best receiver? How does even a rookie safety let the best receiver on the Packers get deep in the last minute of a tie game? That would go for any receiver in that situation, but especially Jordy Nelson . If that was supposed to be single coverage, then how does any defensive coordinator do that in that spot against Nelson? John Fox \u2019s Bears were 3-10. They had the ball fourth-and-goal at the 3 with less than two minutes to go in a game they trailed by three points, and Fox elected to kick the tying field goal. What do you have to lose by going for it? You\u2019ve already lost the season and, who knows, maybe your job. The Packers were shaky. The Green Bay defense was looking for reasons to give up. The Packers certainly were capable of committing a penalty in the end zone to give you another set of downs. Wanting to go to overtime when you\u2019re 3-10 is lame. ",

The boy is the second toddler to die in a car-related shooting in the city in the past month. \"The grandma and 3 year old victim are innocent and have no relationship w/ the suspect,\" the Little Rock Police Department said in a tweet early Sunday. The department has asked the local community to help find the suspect in the case, who's described as a tall black man driving an older black Chevrolet Impala. Police believe the man \"opened fire on the grandmother's car because he thought she 'wasn't moving fast enough,' \" according to a report on member station KUAR's website . The grandmother had been taking the boy and another child, 1, on a shopping trip. Citing a police report on the shooting, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette says the grandmother's name is Kim King-Macon, and that she told officers the shooting occurred after she had stopped her Dodge Charger at a red light in southwest Little Rock. From the Democrat-Gazette: \"King-Macon told police a black Chevrolet Impala pulled up behind her while she was stopped at a traffic light and honked its horn, the report said, noting King-Macon then honked back. \" 'Ms. King-Macon stated that a black male then exited [the Impala] and fired one shot,' the report said, adding King-Macon then drove to the shopping center and found the boy had been shot when she got him out of the vehicle.\" Article continues after sponsorship Discussing the case in the parking lot outside a JC Penny store where officers had converged on King-Macon's car, Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said, \"This is the second time in less than a month that an infant child has been shot while traveling in a vehicle in our city. As you can probably understand, that's very, very frustrating to our police agency, as it should be to our community.\" That earlier shooting, of a 2-year-old girl on Nov. 22, remains an open investigatio n despite a $20,000 reward for information that results in an arrest and conviction of those responsible. Members of the local community say they're planning a news conference at Mercy Church in southwest Little Rock, to support the boy's family and promote the Stop The Violence movement. ",

    "text": "Cre'Von LeBlanc the fall guy in Bears loss, but who called that defense? Photos from the Bears-Packers game on Dec. 18 at Soldier Field. David Haugh Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Surrounded by reporters Sunday inside the Bears locker room, the loneliest man in Chicago slowly fastened the buttons on his shirt and fidgeted with his belt. The longer Cre'Von LeBlanc lingered, the better he collected his thoughts, which surely were scattered recalling the decisive play of the Bears' 30-27 loss to the Packers . The Bears cornerback let Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson beat him for a 60-yard completion with 27 seconds left that set up Mason Crosby 's game-winning 32-yard field goal. A wind chill of minus-4 degrees at kickoff made this one of the coldest games ever at Soldier Field, and the Bears' last-minute lapse, after a furious 17-point fourth-quarter rally, ranked it among the cruelest. When an NFL team is 3-11, it finds ways to lose, but this was inventive even by Bears standards. \"At the end of the day, my technique has to be better,\" a composed LeBlanc said, accepting responsibility like a pro. Nobody will argue. Nelson quickly gobbled up LeBlanc's 7-yard cushion, put his hand up so Rodgers would see him open and waited for the quarterback's perfectly placed spiral. The ball fell exactly where it has so many times in Rodgers' Hall of Fame career. LeBlanc had one job on third-and-11 from the Bears 26: Stay deeper than the deepest \u2014 and Nelson got behind him anyway. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers saw exactly what he wanted. He had a matchup he loved \u2014 top receiver Jordy Nelson versus Bears rookie Cre'Von LeBlanc \u2014 and a play design that left the Bears defense vulnerable in coverage. In the closing minute of a tie game at Soldier Field,... In simplest terms, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers saw exactly what he wanted. He had a matchup he loved \u2014 top receiver Jordy Nelson versus Bears rookie Cre'Von LeBlanc \u2014 and a play design that left the Bears defense vulnerable in coverage. In the closing minute of a tie game at Soldier Field,... (Dan Wiederer) \"Perfect catch, perfect throw,\" Bears cornerback Tracy Porter said. \"Only two or three quarterbacks can make that throw ... and the other two are Tom Brady and Drew Brees .\" The Bears played what they call quarters coverage, dividing the secondary into fourths, meaning the design of the defense called for an undrafted rookie out of Florida Atlantic to defend a Pro Bowl wide receiver one-on-one with the game on the line. Quarterbacks like Rodgers are sure to RSVP such an invitation to a big play every time. Before the snap, Porter warned everyone to \"keep their antennas up\" because experience told him Rodgers wasn't going to settle for overtime. Did LeBlanc expect safety help? \"Kind of, sort of,\" LeBlanc said. \"But in the huddle, they said stay deep and I should have been in position and gotten over his top shoulder.\" Truth is, LeBlanc never should have been in the position to let everybody down. Perhaps that was part of what general manager Ryan Pace shared with LeBlanc in a postgame pep talk. Bears - Packers game. \"It's starting to get cold now,\" Torbert said to another official during the Packers' dramatic 30-27 victory at... His microphone inadvertently left on after announcing a penalty, referee Ron Torbert gave an on-field weather update midway through the fourth quarter of Sunday's Bears - Packers game. \"It's starting to get cold now,\" Torbert said to another official during the Packers' dramatic 30-27 victory at... (Chris Kuc) The situation called for a safer two- or three-deep zone coverage supported by safeties reminded to keep everything in front of them. Instead, rookie safety Deon Bush \u2014 who had a chance to help LeBlanc deep \u2014 was focused more on the crossing route in front of him. We lately have referred to defensive coordinator Vic Fangio as a genius, but this puzzling sequence sent press-box wags searching the thesaurus for antonyms. The Bears' last two losses came down to passes slipping through a wide receiver's hands. This time, Bears coaches dropped the ball. \"I'm not going to play the blame game,\" Fox said when asked about the pivotal play. The coaching strategy on the 60-yard completion merited more criticism than Fox's decision to kick a field goal on fourth-and-goal from the 4 with 1 minute, 23 seconds left, a move more likely to drive conversation Monday in the Second (Guessing) City. As popular as Fox potentially would have been had the Bears scored the go-ahead touchdown, imagine the regret if the Packers stopped them on fourth down. Regardless of the rivalry, Fox made the smart call to play for overtime at home with the Bears having regained momentum. Taking the 10-second runoff in the final minute wouldn't have changed the outcome either. The choice (and remember, death is not an option): Bears quarterbacking or Bears tackling? Or Bears coverage or Bears coaching? But say this for the Bears offense: Whether it\u2019s Matt Barkley or Jay Cutler , the strip-sack and horrible interceptions consistently remain regular parts of the game plan... The choice (and remember, death is not an option): Bears quarterbacking or Bears tackling? Or Bears coverage or Bears coaching? But say this for the Bears offense: Whether it\u2019s Matt Barkley or Jay Cutler , the strip-sack and horrible interceptions consistently remain regular parts of the game plan... (Steve Rosenbloom) \"(Second-guessing) comes with the territory and we managed not to win the game,\" Fox said. Gradually, these Bears have developed a knack for managing not to win games. They aren't getting blown out, but the Packers exposed the Bears for not knowing yet how to win. Example: On first-and-goal from the 3, tight end Logan Paulsen got called for holding, eventually forcing the Bears to settle for a field goal. An aside: Why does it seem that Paulsen's name only comes up when something bad happens? Meanwhile, frustration mounts on a team staring at 13 losses. Alshon Jeffery , unable to shake double coverage for three quarters, caught six passes for 89 yards in the fourth quarter against the Packers prevent defense but hardly felt satisfied. Jeffery stopped a postgame interview with WBBM radio because he was afraid he would say something offensive. Defensive end Akiem Hicks chided a reporter asking about Rodgers by wondering if he was \"in the Aaron Rodgers Fan Club.\" Even Matt Barkley , still considered the new guy, admitted the feeling  is  getting old. \"It seems almost deja-vu-ish,\" Barkley said. Two things made this defeat different for the Bears. Barkley, despite a huge fourth quarter, endured a Cutleresque day that included impressive numbers marred by three interceptions and a fumble. And Fangio's vaunted seventh-ranked defense gave up 223 rushing yards, letting Packers running back Ty Montgomery go through holes like a plow through snow. \"I don't think we expected to run for over 200 yards,\" Rodgers said. You can say the Packers took what the Bears gave them, down to the last play. dhaugh@chicagotribune.com ",

Gabor died around 1 p.m. Sunday, her former publicist Edward Lozzi told ABC News. She was 99 years old. Born S\u00e1ri G\u00e1bor, the actress has never admitted a birthdate but is thought by Hollywood journalists to have been born between 1917 and 1919. Her Wikipedia page cites her birthdate as Feb. 6, 1917, which would make her 99 years old. Gabor got her start in show business in Europe, competing in the Miss Hungary beauty contest in 1936 and singing in Richard Tauber's Austrian operetta \"The Singing Dream\" later that year. Her first major Hollywood movie was 1952's \"Lovely to Look At.\" That same year, Gabor starred in her breakout film, \"Moulin Rouge.\" For the next two decades, she captivated audiences in a number of films, including \"Lili,\" \"Touch of Evil,\" \"Death of a Scoundrel\" and \"Boys' Night Out.\" Earl Leaf/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor poses during a photo shoot at home in Los Angeles, March 23, 1956. Gabor appeared in a handful of films after 1980, including \"The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\" Gabor's attitude made her as much of a character as her acting. In 1989, she was accused of slapping a Beverly Hills police officer who stopped her for a traffic violation. She was found guilty of assault and sentenced to three days in jail. Gabor went on to poke fun at the incident in her TV and movie roles. Clive Limpkin/Express/Getty Images 12th March 1966: Hungarian actress and celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor. With nine marriages, Gabor ranks as one of Hollywood's most legendary romancers. She was divorced seven times; one marriage was annulled. Gabor married Frederic Prinz von Anhalt in 1986; their relationship was by far her most long-lasting. Gabor's sisters, Magda and Eva, also followed her path to fame and became actresses and socialites. However, Gabor has not been seen in public for some time, as her health has been declining for years. Paul Natkin/Getty Images Hungarian-born American actress Zsa Zsa Gabor appears on an episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show in Chicago, Nov. 1, 1988. She was partially paralyzed in a 2002 car accident and suffered a massive stroke in 2005. She underwent two surgeries in 2007, one to deal with the aftermath of the '05 stroke and another to treat a leg infection. Gabor broke her hip on July 17, 2010 after a fall at her Bel-Air home. She went through hip replacement surgery later that month. After that, she was hospitalized several times for swelling, clots, blood transfusions and the amputation. Then, in January 2011, doctors at the UCLA Medical Center amputated most of her right leg. That same month, von Anhalt put their mansion on the market for $28 million in an effort to raise money for her medical bills. \"I just want to settle my wife's debts and keep her comfortable,\" he said, according to the LA Times . She is survived by her husband. Gabor had one daughter, Francesca, from her marriage to Conrad Hilton , though she died last year. 0 Shares ",

Trump won the Electoral College, 306 votes to Hillary Clinton's 232, but lost the popular vote by over 2.5 million votes, the third worst margin since 1824 . A handful of Democrats and even a few Republican electors have embarked on an unusual effort to deny Trump the victory \u2014 or at the very least, raise the specter of changing the election. Electors in three states have gone to court seeking the chance to vote their mind; another resigned to avoid the vote altogether. One Republican elector in Texas has publicly said he will not vote for Trump, although his state voted overwhelmingly for the GOP candidate. Related: The 'Real' Presidential Vote Happens Monday And a group of about 80 electors (including one Republican) signed on to a letter to National Intelligence Director James Clapper asking for a briefing on the role Russian hacks may have played in the election before the vote. (That request, supported by Hillary Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta, will not be granted, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said.) Activists, meanwhile, have taken up the cause. A petition aimed at \"conscientious electors\" has garnered nearly 5 million signatures. The West Wing's fictitious president, Martin Sheen, and a slew of actors released a YouTube appeal pleading with electors to give the election to Clinton, or anyone other than Trump. On \"Saturday Night Live,\" comedian Kate McKinnon revived her Clinton impression to show up at the house of an elector and spoof the cue card scene from the holiday movie \"Love Actually.\" \"Just vote for literally anyone else,\" one of the cards read. Constitutionalists argue that the electors are free to vote however they please, although 29 states have Supreme Court-upheld laws requiring them to vote as their state did. The constitutionality of enforcing those laws, however, has never been tested. But even if these efforts worked to deny Trump the 270 votes, they are not aimed at boosting Clinton. The election would be sent to the House of Representatives where Republicans have a large advantage, meaning Trump would still almost certainly still be president. A Great Big Civics Lesson All these machinations are another sign of just how hugely partisan and unusual 2016 was. In past elections, few have acted as so-called \"faithless\" electors. Since 1948 there have only been nine of them. Even in the disputed 2000 presidential election, when passions ran almost as high as today, no electors changed their votes and just one abstained. That was in protest over D.C.'s lack of voting representation in Congress. Experts say the only real effect of Monday's vote might be a civics lesson for America. \"For citizens, they tend to learn something from these car crashes,\" legal analyst Jonathon Turley said, recalling the 2000 election's startling reminder that a majority of Americans don't necessarily elect presidents in America. \"This raises the question: Do we need electors?\" said George C. Edwards III, a Texas A&M professor and author of \" Why The Electoral College is Bad for America .\" \"This increases awareness and sensitivity of the problems of the Electoral College. That in turn might have a longer term impact on the structure of American politics.\" Play ",

    "text": "Dec 18 2016, 4:41 am ET Trump Plan to Move Embassy From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Poses Challenges by Alexander Smith, Paul Goldman and Lawahez Jabari Share advertisement Donald Trump's pledge to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem poses monumental challenges in one of the world's most tense environments, according to experts. Relocating the diplomatic outpost to the holy city is \"a very big priority\" for the president-elect, aide Kellyanne Conway told radio host Hugh Hewitt earlier this week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stands next to Donald Trump during a meeting in New York in September. HANDOUT / Reuters David Friedman, Trump's pick for ambassador to Israel, reinforced this commitment Thursday, saying he looks forward to serving \"from the U.S. Embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem.\" Trump is not the first president to make this promise. But if he follows through where others have reneged, he would please some Israelis who have long since been frustrated with the international community for not recognizing Jerusalem as their capital city. It would also likely enrage the Arab world, largely because the Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. \"This could set off demonstrations in Arab cities and capitals throughout the Middle East and the Muslim world beyond,\" according to Professor Chuck Freilich at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, an Israeli university. Building anything is a challenge in tension-wrought Jerusalem, where any shovel that breaks ground has a good chance of hitting a site with significance to at least one religion. But a U.S. Embassy isn't just any building. \"It will be very, very costly to build and very, very costly to defend\" A diplomatic mission in the city would have to be fitted with state-of-the-art security measures, would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to complete. \"I think it's going to be a tremendous challenge, and the biggest challenge is going to be the design of it,\" said Christopher Hagon, managing director of Incident Management Group, a Florida-based security consultancy. \"You cannot guess at it \u2014 you have to extrapolate every possibility and work all these things through.\" Hagon, who was personal protection officer to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in the 1980s, said the building would need three levels of security: physical, technical, and procedural. Physical measures, he said, are anything that would stop a would-be bomber or gunman entering the premises. This includes the design of the nearby roads, the presence of armed personnel, and a likely network of blast-proof doors and windows. \"If someone gets to the innermost barrier, then you have a likely catastrophe,\" Hagon said. The technical measures involve detecting assailants \u2014 security cameras, sensors and infrared beams guarding the premises. If someone does gain access, that's when the procedural measures kick in: \"In short, what are you going to do about it?\" Hagon said. Furthermore, while the project is underway, every person \u2014 right down to the last construction worker \u2014 would have to be vetted, he added. The fear is that rogue contractors could build weaknesses into the structure or even hide bugs in its wiring. \"You have really got to look at the people who are putting this stuff in and ask where their loyalties lie,\" Hagon said. This is not just a precaution. There were almost 500 attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities between 1987 and 2013, according to a report issued last week by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which criticized the cost of building modern embassies. The worst of these attacks came in 1998, when 224 people were killed in near-simultaneous bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. This attack served as a wake-up call for the U.S. government. \"Embassies, simply put, are not regular buildings,\" according to Tim Bradley, another managing partner at Incident Management Group. \"They are the seat of foreign governments in the host country, and as such, actors who oppose the U.S. government would most likely look at the embassy as a symbolic target.\" While warranted, embassy security measures come at a cost, although it's hard to estimate a ballpark figure for the Jerusalem move. Motorists drive past the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. Nir Elias / Reuters, file Trump's plan appears to be in its very early stages, and the current U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv would not give NBC News any information regarding its size or number of employees. \"It will be very, very costly to build and very, very costly to defend,\" according to Jane Loeffler, an architectural historian and author of \"The Architecture of Diplomacy: Building America's Embassies.\" She added that \"it's a lot of money to spend on symbolism, and it's a symbolism that works both ways,\" referring to the conflicting territorial claims in the region. For comparison, the new U.S. Embassy in London that's scheduled to open in February will house 1,000 employees, is projected to cost more than $1 billion, and has been under construction for more than three years. Related: Qataris Will Spend $1.4B to Turn U.S. Embassy Into Hotel Five years ago in Mexico City, the State Department paid $120 million for a piece of land to use as its new embassy compound, according to last week's House report. Despite spending another $56 million on the project, it said, the contractors have yet to break ground. For Trump, a president-elect who has railed against the costs of Boeing's Air Force One deal and the F-35 fighter jet program, the symbolic embassy move is going to come with a hefty price tag. Jerusalem. David Copeland / NBC News It's not just security that might inflate the cost of a Jerusalem embassy, but also aesthetics. The House report, entitled \"Over-Budget Overseas: The State Department's Failure to Protect Our Diplomats,\" alleged that the spiraling cost of embassies worsened after the State Department introduced its \"Design Excellence\" program in 2011. This was an attempt to get away from the previous template of bunker-style buildings, which caused John Kerry to lament in 2009 that \"we're building some of the ugliest embassies I've ever seen.\" According to the new program, \"embassies should represent the best in American architecture, design, engineering, technology, sustainability, art, and cultural heritage.\" The result of this can be seen at the new London embassy, which its architect describes as a \"transparent, crystalline cube,\" which represents a \"holistic fusion of urbanism.\" The complex also features a half-moat, curving walkways and a 4.9-acre garden plaza. A rendering of the U.S. Embassy that's currently being built in London. KieranTimberlake / U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulates in the United Kingdom According to the House report, however, this \"Design Excellence\" process \"costs too much and takes too long,\" and projects often face \"millions of dollars in design costs and months of delay.\" Timing may also be an use for Trump, according to Barbara A. Nadel, an award-winning New York architect and security consultant \"U.S. embassies are complex building types subject to many site planning, design, construction and security considerations,\" Nadel said. \"They take years to plan, design and build.\" Despite his bold statements, it's still far from certain whether Trump will go through with his plan. Since 1995, all U.S. presidents have been required by law to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but all have used a rolling six-month waiver to avoid the legislation. George W. Bush and Bill Clinton said they would go through with it, but never did. And most foreign powers agree that Jerusalem's fate should be decided as part of the peace process. Trump's rhetoric has been bold, however, giving hope to many in Israel and beyond who back the move. \"Moving the embassy is the right thing to do,\" Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat told NBC News this week. \"It's a statement that he has been making and I'm sure that sooner or later [the embassy] will move to Jerusalem.\" Barkat said he has already been in discussions with the Trump team, both before and after the election. Local media has suggested the city's Diplomat Hotel has been scoped as a possible site, and The Times of Israel noted this week that in 1989 the U.S. took out a 99-year lease on a plot of land intended one day for a new embassy location. According to the newspaper, Palestinians regard the lot as stolen property. Supporters of the move, including the city's mayor, are unshaken. \"Here is what I learned in the Middle East: You've got to do the right thing,\" Barkat said. \"Do the right thing, what's good for Jerusalem, what's good for the Middle East, [and] everything else will sort itself out.\" The Diplomat Hotel in Jerusalem.

    "text": "Continue this way throughout the course of a meal, and you\u2019ll experience the third-eye-opening pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings. Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting, breathing, standing and walking, many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food, expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel. In one common exercise, a student is given three raisins, or a tangerine, to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at, musing on, holding and patiently masticating. Lately, though, such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena, from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google. In the eyes of some experts, what seems like the simplest of acts \u2014 eating slowly and genuinely relishing each bite \u2014 could be the remedy for a fast-paced Paula Deen Nation in which an endless parade of new diets never seems to slow a stampede toward obesity. Mindful eating is not a diet, or about giving up anything at all. It\u2019s about experiencing food more intensely \u2014 especially the pleasure of it. You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully, if you wish. You might enjoy it a lot more. Or you might decide, halfway through, that your body has had enough. Or that it really needs some salad . \u201cThis is anti-diet,\u201d said Dr. Jan Chozen Bays , a pediatrician and meditation teacher in Oregon and the author of \u201cMindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food.\u201d \u201cI think the fundamental problem is that we go unconscious when we eat.\u201d The last few years have brought a spate of books, blogs and videos about hyper-conscious eating. A Harvard nutritionist, Dr. Lilian Cheung , has devoted herself to studying its benefits, and is passionately encouraging corporations and health care providers to try it. Photo A road sign shows the way to the monastery. Credit Jennifer May for The New York Times At the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, Prof. Brian Wansink , the author of \u201cMindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think,\u201d has conducted scores of experiments on the psychological factors that lead to our bottomless bingeing. A mindful lunch hour recently became part of the schedule at Google, and self-help gurus like Oprah Winfrey and Kathy Freston have become cheerleaders for the practice. With the annual chow-downs of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Super Bowl Sunday behind us, and Lent coming, it\u2019s worth pondering whether mindful eating is something that the mainstream ought to be, well, more mindful of. Could a discipline pioneered by Buddhist monks and nuns help teach us how to get healthy, relieve stress and shed many of the neuroses that we\u2019ve come to associate with food? Dr. Cheung is convinced that it can. Last week, she met with team members at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and asked them to spend quality time with a chocolate-covered almond. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe rhythm of life is becoming faster and faster, so we really don\u2019t have the same awareness and the same ability to check into ourselves,\u201d said Dr. Cheung, who, with the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh , co-wrote \u201cSavor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why mindful eating is becoming more important. We need to be coming back to ourselves and saying: \u2018Does my body need this? Why am I eating this? Is it just because I\u2019m so sad and stressed out?\u2019\u00a0\u201d The topic has even found its way into culinary circles that tend to be more focused on Rabelaisian excess than monastic restraint. In January, Dr. Michael Finkelstein, a holistic physician who oversees SunRaven , a holistic-living center in Bedford, N.Y., gave a talk about mindful gardening and eating at the smorgasbord-friendly headquarters of the James Beard Foundation in New York City. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t what are the foods to eat, in my mind,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMost people have a general sense of what the healthy foods are, but they\u2019re not eating them. What\u2019s on your mind when you\u2019re eating: that\u2019s mindful eating to me.\u201d A good place to try it is the Blue Cliff Monastery , in Pine Bush, N.Y., a Hudson Valley hamlet. At the serene refuge about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, curious lay people can join Buddhist brothers and sisters for a free \u201cday of mindfulness\u201d twice a week. At a gathering in January, visitors watched a videotaped lecture by Thich Nhat Hanh (pronounced tik-nyot-HAHN), who founded this and other monasteries around the world; they strolled methodically around the grounds as part of a walking meditation, then filed into a dining room for lunch. No one spoke, in keeping with a key principle of mindful eating. The point is simply to eat, as opposed to eating and talking, eating and watching TV, or eating and watching TV and gossiping on the phone while Tweeting and updating one\u2019s Facebook status. A long buffet table of food awaited, all of it vegan and mindfully prepared by two monks in the kitchen. There was plenty of rice, herbed chickpeas, a soup made with cubes of taro, a stew of fried tofu in tomato sauce. Photo Prof. Brian Wansink at the Cornell Food and Brand Lab has studied the psychological causes of binge eating. Credit Bill Wingell for The New York Times In silence, people piled their plates with food, added a squirt or two of condiments (eating mindfully doesn\u2019t mean forsaking the hot sauce) and sat down together with eyes closed during a Buddhist prayer for gratitude and moderation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What followed was captivating and mysterious. Surrounded by a murmur of clinking forks, spoons and chopsticks, the Blue Cliff congregation, or sangha, spent the lunch hour contemplating the enjoyment of spice, crunch, saltiness, warmth, tenderness and like-minded company. Some were thinking, too, about the origins of the food: the thousands of farmers, truck drivers and laborers whose work had brought it here. As their jaws moved slowly, their faces took on expressions of deep focus. Every now and then came a pause within the pause: A chime would sound, and, according to the monastery\u2019s custom, all would stop moving and chewing in order to breathe and explore an even deeper level of sensory awareness. It looked peaceful, but inside some of those heads, a struggle was afoot. \u201cIt\u2019s much more challenging than we would imagine,\u201d said Carolyn Cronin, 64, who lives near the monastery and regularly attends the mindfulness days. \u201cPeople are used to eating so fast. This is a practice of stopping, and we don\u2019t realize how much we\u2019re not stopping.\u201d For many people, eating fast means eating more. Mindful eating is meant to nudge us beyond what we\u2019re craving so that we wake up to why we\u2019re craving it and what factors might be stoking the habit of belly-stuffing. \u201cAs we practice this regularly, we become aware that we don\u2019t need to eat as much,\u201d said Phap Khoi, 43, a robed monk who has been stationed at Blue Cliff since it opened in 2007. \u201cWhereas when people just gulp down food, they can eat a lot and not feel full.\u201d It\u2019s this byproduct of mindful eating \u2014 its potential as a psychological barrier to overeating \u2014 that has generated excitement among nutritionists like Dr. Cheung. \u201cThich Nhat Hanh often talks about our craving being like a crying baby who is trying to draw our attention,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the baby cries, the mother cradles the baby to try to calm the baby right away. By acknowledging and embracing our cravings through a few breaths, we can stop our autopilot of reaching out to the pint of ice cream or the bag of chips.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The average American doesn\u2019t have the luxury of ruminating on the intense tang of sriracha sauce at a monastery. \u201cMost of us are not going to be Buddhist monks,\u201d said Dr. Finkelstein, the holistic physician. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that it has to work at home.\u201d Photo Dr. Lilian Cheung of Harvard's School of Public Health is a proponent of mindful eating. Credit Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times To that end, he and others suggest that people start with a few baby steps. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself,\u201d Dr. Cheung said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be able to switch on your mindfulness button and be able to do it 100 percent. It\u2019s a practice you keep working toward.\u201d Dr. Bays, the pediatrician, has recommendations that can sound like a return to the simple rhythms of Mayberry, if not \u201cLittle House on the Prairie.\u201d If it\u2019s impossible to eat mindfully every day, consider planning one special repast a week. Click off the TV. Sit at the table with loved ones. \u201cHow about the first five minutes we eat, we just eat in silence and really enjoy our food?\u201d she said. \u201cIt happens step by step.\u201d Sometimes, even she is too busy to contemplate a chickpea. So there are days when Dr. Bays will take three mindful sips of tea, \u201cand then, O.K., I\u2019ve got to go do my work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnybody can do that. Anywhere.\u201d Even scarfing down a burrito in the car offers an opportunity for insight. \u201cMindful eating includes mindless eating,\u201d she said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018I am aware that I am eating and driving.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Few places in America are as frantically abuzz with activity as the Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., but when Thich Nhat Hanh dropped by for a day of mindfulness in September, hundreds of employees showed up. Part of the event was devoted to eating thoughtfully in silence, and the practice was so well received that an hourlong wordless vegan lunch is now a monthly observance on the Google campus. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cInterestingly enough, a lot of the participants are the engineers, which pleases us very much,\u201d said Olivia Wu, an executive chef at the company. \u201cI think it quiets the mind. I think there is a real sense of feeling restored so that they can go back to the crazy pace that they came from.\u201d It\u2019s not often, after all, that those workhorse technicians get to stop and smell the pesto. \u201cSomebody will say, \u2018I ate so much less,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cAnd someone else will say, \u2018You know, I never noticed how spicy arugula tastes.\u2019\u00a0\u201d And that could be the ingredient that helps mindful eating gain traction in mainstream American culture: flavor. \u201cSo many people now have found themselves in an adversarial relationship with food, which is very tragic,\u201d Dr. Bays said. \u201cEating should be a pleasurable activity.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on February 8, 2012, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Food For Thought.

USA TODAY NETWORK Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner (Photo: Little Rock Police Department) A manhunt was underway Sunday in Little Rock after a 3-year-old boy was fatally shot in a road-rage encounter while on a shopping trip with his grandmother. Police said another driver apparently became frustrated that the grandmother was not moving fast enough through a\u00a0stop sign Saturday. The two drivers honked their horns before the suspect stepped out of his car and fired. The woman continued driving to a local J.C. Penney store, where police were called. The boy died at a hospital a short time later.\u00a0Police Chief Kenton Buckner said the grandmother was not wounded, and it was not immediately clear whether she was aware the boy was shot until she arrived at the store. \"Tonight's homicide was a road rage incident, the grandma and 3 year old victim are innocent and have no relationship w/ the suspect,\" police said on Twitter. Police were looking for\u00a0an older black Chevrolet Impala being driven by a tall black man. We can confirm that the child has died. Homicide detectives are conducting the investigation. This is 40th homicide this year. \u2014 Little Rock Police (@LRpolice) December 18, 2016 \"This is probably one of the most frustrating things you will encounter in your (law enforcement) career, when it involves children, particularly kids of this age,\" Buckner said. Buckner noted the shooting marked the second time in less than a month that a child was fatally shot while riding in a vehicle in the city. A 2-year-old girl was killed by gunfire while riding in the backseat of a car Nov. 22. No arrest has been made in the case. Buckner said there was no immediate information linking the cases. \"That is very,\u00a0very frustrating to our police agency as it should be to our community,\" Buckner said. \u201cWe cannot have a community where the least protected among us, being infants, are dying (in)\u00a0senseless crimes.\u201d 186 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 143 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i38TGj ",

    "text": "For Ghost Ship rescuers, a scene they can never forget Ghost Ship warehouse rescuers: 'It was very surreal to be there' Brian Centoni of the Alameda County Fire Department recounts the night of the Ghost Ship warehouse\u00a0fire in Oakland. Brian Centoni of the Alameda County Fire Department recounts the night of the Ghost Ship warehouse\u00a0fire in Oakland. Alene Tchekmedyian Contact Reporter The first body he saw, he recognized. She looked like a mannequin under a pile of charred wreckage about a dozen feet high, among pianos, drum kits and amplifiers coated with soot. As Brian Centoni carefully peeled away layers of debris, his body drenched in sweat under heavy fire gear, he realized he knew her face. Hours earlier, the fire engineer had seen her photograph on the news. She reminded him of his wife. Same size, same race. She was somebody\u2019s daughter. She was among those unaccounted for after a fire broke out during a concert at an Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship. She was the 31st victim authorities pulled from the rubble. \u201cThis situation was just, like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 \u201d Centoni said later. \u201cIt just got real, real fast.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 For days after the Dec. 2 fire, dozens of searchers fulfilled their grim mission in near silence. Some constructed wooden shoring to stabilize areas where the two-story building was collapsing, while others filled five-gallon buckets with blackened lamps, pieces of pallet furniture and horned skull masks while searching for bodies. The work was slow and somber, done mostly by hand, at times with shovels. Centoni spent roughly three hours digging through the smoldering hulk of the massive Ghost Ship. These are hours neither Centoni nor other firefighters will ever forget. \u201cYou go in there, you put your head down and you work,\u201d said Brian Ferreira, a fire captain with the Alameda County Fire Department who spent several hours that Sunday sawing wood and hammering nails to build five large shores that could each hold roughly 16,000 pounds of weight. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it with the intent to bring closure to those families, to bring them their loved ones.\u201d Sundays are typically quiet at Centoni\u2019s Alameda County Fire Station No. 10, several miles from the East Oakland warehouse in neighboring San Leandro. Centoni, a 36-year-old guitarist in a band with other firefighters, thought he\u2019d squeeze in time between calls to catch the Oakland Raiders playing the Buffalo Bills\u00a0on TV. But about halfway into his 48-hour shift, Centoni\u2019s crew got called to the warehouse fire. A feeling of dread ran through him. He knew he\u2019d be searching for the dead. \u201cI knew I was going to see young kids, artists and musicians \u2014 kind of like myself,\u201d Centoni said. But he thought of his father, a retired firefighter who responded to the World Trade Center with cadaver dogs two weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and felt proud to have been chosen for such a daunting task. After a briefing, Centoni\u2019s crew, including Capt. Bryan Dillingham and firefighter Brendan Burke, hopped on their rig and headed to Oakland Fire Station No. 13, where they swapped out their dress uniforms for their protective turnout\u00a0gear. Centoni fastened his helmet and pulled on his gloves before walking a few hundred feet to the Ghost Ship, past people weeping and laying bouquets of flowers outside the building. It felt eerie inside; smoke hung in the damp air. Reality struck when he glimpsed that\u00a0first body. In that moment, he had no idea what the rest of the day would hold \u2014 whether he\u2019d find one more body, or 20. Coroner\u2019s officials came over to snap photographs, looking for tattoos or piercings that would help verify the woman\u2019s identity, before her body\u00a0was carried to a more secure area. As he dug farther\u00a0down in the pile, Centoni noticed two more bodies. A man and a woman had fallen together from the second floor after flames climbed walls and caved in\u00a0the roof. Authorities fished out their iPhones and wallets, still mostly intact. \u201cThey really had no chance,\u201d Centoni said. \u201cThe fire just snuck up on them so fast.\u201d If only the fire broke out at a different hour, he thought, when the warehouse wasn\u2019t filled with people. \u201cIt just trips me out how everything lined up perfectly to have this tragedy happen,\u201d Centoni said. \u201cIt was basically a burial ground for these people.\u201d With his face coated with dirt and ash, Centoni took a break that Sunday afternoon to hydrate. He almost couldn\u2019t eat after what he\u2019d seen, but he felt fatigued and hungry. He scarfed down tacos and water, washed up and waited to see if he\u2019d be sent back inside. He wanted to go back in, he told his captain. He wanted to help. Another round of digging followed, but he found no other bodies. By that\u00a0night, Centoni had returned to his regular fire station. He threw his dirty turnouts in the wash and, after showering, changed into a spare set. Another emergency call came in. Someone was having chest pains. With his muscles sore and a trace of soot still on his face, Centoni jumped into Engine 10 with his crew and rolled out. \u201cIt was like nothing happened,\u201d he said. Emotion would seep through later, triggered by a news alert, a mindless cleaning task, a photograph. \u201cFirefighters are faced with horrific things on a daily basis: victims of fires and auto accidents and medical emergencies,\u201d said Alameda County Deputy Fire Chief Jim Call.\u00a0\u201cIt can weigh heavy.\u201d Waking up at his regular fire station\u00a0Monday morning, Centoni glanced at his cellphone while still in bed. An alert had come in from KTVU: Three more bodies had been recovered from the Ghost Ship. The final death toll would be 36. Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories Centoni\u2019s shift was over at 8 a.m. At home, he hugged his 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter a little tighter than usual. When he\u2019d picked up his daughter  from school, a teacher walking with a line of students saw him, stopped and asked,\u00a0\u201cWere you on Engine 10 yesterday?\u201d He said yes, and she gave him a hug. Centoni spent his day off cleaning out his music studio, thinking of the victims as he moved his own amplifiers and cables, equipment that resembled the ruins he\u2019d spent hours sifting through the day before.\u00a0 Later, he recorded a song called \u201cEureka\u201d for his reggae-rock band\u2019s upcoming album. It was almost as if he was recording the song for them, he said, those lost in the Ghost Ship. \u201cYou see how creative these people were; everybody\u2019s super talented \u2014\u00a0DJs, artists, beatboxers \u2014\u00a0all super talented people that loved music,\u201d Centoni said. \u201cI almost could\u2019ve saw myself in this place.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss The Ghost Ship fire has brought scrutiny to warehouses and unconventional living spaces, the L.A.

Time_Sports Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley yells out during the second half of  an NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings at EverBank Field. (Photo: Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports) There are now two head coaching vacancies in the NFL. After blowing a 13-point lead in a loss Sunday, the Jacksonville Jaguars announced they have fired Gus Bradley. The Jaguars fell to 2-12 after losing 21-20 to the Houston Texans. With the loss, Bradley\u2019s career record in Jacksonville fell to 14-48 over nearly four full seasons. That makes him the head coach with the lowest winning percentage in the Super Bowl era (.226) with a minimum of 50 games coached. The Jaguars were a popular preseason pick to compete for an AFC South title, but quarterback Blake Bortles regressed and consistently compromised a talented defense. Brock Osweiler's benching leaves Texans' QB picture cloudy Team owner Shad Khan announced the move in a statement shortly after the loss. \u201cI thanked Gus Bradley today for his commitment to the Jacksonville Jaguars over the past four seasons,\u201d Khan's statement read. \u201cAs anyone close to our team knows, Gus gave his staff and players literally everything he had. Our players competed for Gus and I know they have great respect for him, as do I. \u201cGus also represented the Jaguars, the Jacksonville community and the NFL in nothing less than a first-class manner as our head coach. That counts for a lot. It is unfortunately evident that we must make a change. I thought it would be best to do it immediately after today\u2019s result so Gus can step away, relax and regroup with his family during the Christmas and holiday season. \u201c(General manager) Dave Caldwell agreed and will now be charged with exploring all options to hire the best head coach possible to lead what I feel is an extremely talented team and reward a very loyal and patient fan base in Jacksonville.\u201d That Caldwell is mentioned in Khan's statement indicates the Jaguars will probably not be undergoing a complete overhaul of the front office. One potential candidate to take over for Bradley on an interim basis is assistant head coach Doug Marrone, who also oversee the offensive line. He compiled a 15-17 record in two seasons as head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 2013-14. Bradley joins Jeff Fisher, whom the Los Angeles Rams fired Dec. 12, as former head coaches who will be looking for new roles this offseason. *** Follow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 15 Posted!

Photo From left, Zsa Zsa Gabor and her sisters, Magda and Eva, in 1955. Credit Associated Press Ms. Gabor appeared in more than 60 television movies and feature films, mostly American-made, although some were Italian, French, German and Australian. Critics said her best roles were early in her career, in \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d (1952) and \u201cLili\u201d (1953). She also appeared as a nightclub manager in Orson Welles\u2019s 1958 classic \u201cTouch of Evil\u201d and, the same year, as a sexy alien in \u201cQueen of Outer Space,\u201d a camp favorite about virile American astronauts landing on a planet populated by scantily clad women. From the 1950s into the \u201990s, she was also on scores of television programs: talk shows, game shows, comedy specials, westerns, episodic dramas. On the 1960s series \u201cBatman,\u201d she played the gold-digging Minerva , whose mineral spa fleeced swells by extracting secrets from their brains. \u201cA real vicked voman,\u201d she described the character in her Hungarian accent. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Exploiting her naughty celebrity, Ms. Gabor, with the help of collaborators and ghost writers, published four books: \u201cZsa Zsa Gabor: My Story\u201d (1960), \u201cZsa Zsa\u2019s Complete Guide to Men\u201d (1969), \u201cHow to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man\u201d (1970) and \u201cOne Lifetime Is Not Enough\u201d (1991). In addition to her steady appearances in movies and on television, Ms. Gabor operated a mail-order cosmetics company. She once offered $1 million to anyone who could prove she had had a face-lift. In 1974, she bought a villa in Bel Air built by Howard Hughes and formerly owned by Elvis Presley. Her multitiered clothes closet \u2014 30 feet long, 12 feet deep and 14 feet high \u2014 contained 5,000 garments that, except for favored gowns, were given to charities and replaced with a new wardrobe from time to time, according to her official fan site, zsazsagabor.org. In early 2009, Ms. Gabor discovered that she had joined a long list of celebrities who were victimized by Bernard L. Madoff, the financial swindler whose worldwide Ponzi scheme that cost investors tens of billions. Her lawyer Chris Fields said she lost at least $7 million and possibly as much as $10 million. Ms. Gabor had been in and out of hospitals for years. She suffered head and other injuries and was hospitalized for a month in 2002 after a car driven by her hairdresser struck a utility pole in West Hollywood. It left her in a wheelchair, and she retreated from the spotlight. She suffered a stroke in 2005 and had surgery for a blocked carotid artery. In 2007, she again underwent surgery to treat a leg infection and after-effects of the stroke. In July 2010, she underwent hip-replacement surgery after a fall at her home in which she also suffered a concussion. Released from the hospital in August, she was readmitted two days later for treatment of unspecified complications. In January 2011, her right leg was amputated above the knee after an infection proved resistant to antibiotics. Doctors said the operation was necessary to save her life. Two months later, shock over the death of her friend Elizabeth Taylor sent her to the hospital with high blood pressure, and Ms. Gabor\u2019s publicist, John Blanchette, quoted her as saying she feared she was next. In November 2011, she was taken to Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center for emergency surgery after blood began flowing through a feeding tube inserted in her stomach. Born Sari Gabor in Budapest in 1917, 1918 or 1919 \u2014 she always gave a birth date of Feb. 6 or 7, but not the year, though most sources suggest it was 1917 \u2014 Ms. Gabor grew up in relative prosperity, the second of three daughters of Vilmos and Jolie Gabor. Raised for stardom, the sisters attended private schools and were chauffeured to acting, dancing, music and fencing classes. Photo Ms. Gabor in Budapest, Hungary, around 1940. Credit Laszlo Varkonyi/European Pressphoto Agency On the eve of World War II, Ms. Gabor, her mother and her sisters emigrated to the United States, and by the 1950s the Gabor sisters had become as well known for their love lives as for their careers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Magda, who acted on radio briefly and helped her mother operate a chain of jewelry boutiques, died in 1997, as did her mother. Eva, who was best known for her role on television\u2019s \u201cGreen Acres\u201d in the 1960s \u2014 and whom the public sometimes confused with Zsa Zsa \u2014 died in 1995 . Zsa Zsa, who divorced seven of her eight husbands, was first married to Burhan Belge, a Turkish diplomat in Budapest, from 1937 to 1941. Her second marriage, to Mr. Hilton, lasted from 1942 to 1947. Their daughter, Francesca Hilton, an actress, was Ms. Gabor\u2019s only child. She died in 2015 . Her other marriages were to Mr. Sanders (1949-54), who later married Magda Gabor; the investor-industrialist Herbert L. Hutner (1962-66); the oil magnate Joshua S. Cosden Jr. (1966-67); Jack Ryan , an inventor and toy designer who helped create the Barbie doll (1975-76); Michael O\u2019Hara, a lawyer (1976-82); and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Prinz von Anhalt, whom she married in 1986. Mr. Prinz von Anhalt, often described in the news media as a prince or the Duke of Saxony, was born Hans Robert Lichtenberg, the son of a police officer in Germany. He changed his name to include what sounded like a title after Princess Marie Auguste of Anhalt, the Duchess of Saxony, adopted him in 1980 as an adult. The adoption, widely reported to have been a business transaction, conferred only an illusion of nobility, reinforced by the name change. Some biographies of Ms. Gabor also mention a 1983 marriage to Felipe de Alba, a lawyer who appeared in films in Mexico in the 1940s and \u201950s, but Ms. Gabor said it lasted only a day. The ceremony was performed by a ship\u2019s captain at sea but was probably illegal because the ship was not in international waters, and Ms. Gabor was technically not yet divorced from Mr. O\u2019Hara. It was later annulled, just to make sure. There were also notorious affairs with Porfirio Rubirosa, the Dominican playboy, and with Rafael Trujillo Jr., the son of the Dominican dictator. Ms. Gabor\u2019s many public appearances included a 1987 address to the American Bar Association convention in San Francisco, where she spoke to the family law section at a standing-room-only luncheon. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of the routine speakers,\u201d the chairman said, introducing Ms. Gabor as \u201can optimist who still believes in marriage.\u201d Advertisement Telling her tales of marital joys and woes, Ms. Gabor confided, \u201cI have learned that not diamonds but divorce lawyers are a girl\u2019s best friend.\u201d Then, inviting questions, the chairman said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep it on direct, not on cross.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat means they\u2019ve got to be nice to you.\u201d Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting.

The massive oil spill still isn't fully cleaned up three years and three months after it happened. The company responsible hasn't even set a date for completion. Some say that one of the largest onshore oil spills recorded in the U.S. serves as a cautionary example, especially given a recent pipeline break about 150 miles south and ongoing debates over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline. (AP Photo/Kevin Cederstrom, File) 0 Shares Email Three years and three months later, a massive oil spill in North Dakota still isn't fully cleaned up. The company responsible hasn't even set a date for completion. Though crews have been working around the clock to deal with the Tesoro Corp. pipeline break, which happened in a wheat field in September 2013, less than a third of the 840,000 gallons that spilled has been recovered \u2014 or ever will be, North Dakota Health Department environmental scientist Bill Suess said. A farmer, Steve Jenkins, who'd smelled the crude oil for days, discovered the spill in his northwestern North Dakota field near Tioga \u2014 his combines' tires were covered in it. While the nearest home was a half-mile away and the state said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife hurt, one of the largest onshore oil spills recorded in the U.S. serves for some as a cautionary example, especially given a recent pipeline break about 150 miles south and ongoing debates over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline. \"What happened to us happened and we can't go back,\" said Patty Jensen, Steve's wife. This month's pipeline break in Belfield, which belched an estimated 176,000 gallons of oil into a creek that feeds into the Little Missouri River, a tributary of the Missouri River, really rankled her. \"But I get really upset when I hear of a new one and I wonder what is being done to prevent these spills,\" she said. Both the Tesoro break and the Belfield break occurred on 6-inch steel pipelines \u2014 a part of a large network pipelines that crisscross western North Dakota's oil patch. By comparison, the Dakota Access pipeline is made of 30-inch steel and will carry nearly 20 million gallons daily. The Tesoro spill was not far from where oil was first discovered in North Dakota in 1951.The Texas-based company and federal regulators have said a lightning strike may have caused the 2013 rupture in the pipeline, which runs from Tioga to a rail facility outside of Columbus, near the Canadian border. North Dakota regulators initially thought just 750 barrels of oil was involved in the spill, but later updated the amount exponentially. They also expanded the affected acreage from about 7 \u2014 the size of seven football fields \u2014 to about 13 acres, Suess said. The cleanup has cost Tesoro more than $49 million to date and is expected to top $60 million, according to recent filings to the state. Tesoro spokeswoman Destin Singleton said she could not immediately confirm the numbers, and noted the cleanup completion date remains unknown. The pipeline was monitored remotely, but the company has said the spill wasn't detected. Crews have had to dig as deep as 50 feet to remove hundreds of thousands of tons of oil-tainted soil, Suess said. The company has now switched to special equipment that cooks hydrocarbons from crude-soaked soil in a process called thermal desorption before putting it back in place. The Dec. 5 spill on the Belle Fourche pipeline also was discovered by a landowner. Crude oil migrated about almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. Seuss said it appears no oil got as far as the Little Missouri River, and no drinking water sources were threatened. It's not yet clear why monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, according to Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the pipeline. The Dakota Access pipeline builder, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, has said the project will be safe and that workers remotely monitoring the pipeline will be able to shut it down if a leak is detected. Owen said didn't know how long it would take to clean the Belle Fourche spill, given that wintry weather was slowing down the progress, or how much it would cost. Patty Jensen is aware of the glacial pace of oil spill cleanups. For more than three years, it's been part the couple's life. \"They are there working away 24 hours a day, seven days a week \u2014 it's pretty amazing,\" she said. \"The noise from the equipment used to bug us but we've grown used to it.\" 0 Shares ",

(Kori Rumore) The frosty conditions \u2014 along with the Bears' 3-10 record entering the game \u2014 contributed to 16,536 tickets going unused. Still, 44,601 braved the chill, including at least one who watched much of it without a shirt. The offenses certainly weren't affected by the weather. The Packers compiled 451 yards \u2014 226 on the ground and 225 in the air \u2014 while the Bears had 449 (95 and 354). \"We were warm on the sideline, and during the drives you're moving around and staying warm,\" said Bears quarterback Matt Barkley , who wore a wetsuit under his uniform. \"The layers and hand warmers helped. It wasn't a factor.\" Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said: \"It was uncomfortable at times, but it was warmer than most of us expected. We were expecting minus teens.\" One player clearly not bothered by the cold was Packers running back Ty Montgomery, who ran for 162 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries.

I was very thankful that the sun was out, so that made it more manageable. \"I take my hat off to the grounds crew. It was a good surface. It was a little soft, but you're going to have that. Based on the forecast and the temperatures, I thought it was as good as it could possibly be.\" ",

(Brad Biggs) LeBlanc took accountability for his misstep, wishing he had been sharper with his technique and stayed on top of Nelson. \"Once he broke my cushion and he went post, I sped turned,\" LeBlanc said. \"And he kind of just ran away from my leverage. Great throw. \u2026 In that coverage, the corner is really on his own.\" As for the Packers, Rodgers acknowledged that the key read on the play is the back-side safety \u2014 in this case, Chris Prosinski . And when Rodgers saw Prosinski remain \"square-shouldered\" after the snap, signaling that he would not be rolling toward the middle of the field, the Packers quarterback knew Nelson's post route had a chance. \"I just tried to put it in a place where (Nelson) could come down with it,\" Rodgers said. Sounds simple enough. But don't underestimate the degree of difficulty of the throw Rodgers made, 62 yards in the air into an arctic breeze with the game on the line. Asked how many quarterbacks he has faced who are capable of making that throw, LeBlanc sighed.

But the answer will have to wait until coordinator Vic Fangio's news conference Tuesday. Coach John Fox offered no explanation of the strategy or the execution after Sunday's loss. \"I'm not going to get into the blame game,\" Fox said. Instead, the Bears were left to stomach another frustrating finish. So much for that spirited fourth-quarter rally, the one that erased a 17-point deficit and allowed them to tie the game at 27 with a little more than a minute left. It took only one coverage failure and some familiar Rodgers magic to kill the mood. \"Nobody in football, nobody in the NFL likes to get beat deep,\" LeBlanc said. \"It hurts. It hurts deep.\" dwiederer@chicagotribune.com ",

(Photo: Charlie Riedel, AP) Another blast of Arctic chill slammed\u00a0the Upper Plains and Midwest on Sunday with high temperatures below zero, one day\u00a0after snow and freezing rain blanketed the region and led to numerous\u00a0accidents and thousands of disrupted flights. A strong cold front crossing the Appalachian Mountains on Sunday morning was\u00a0marching steadily toward\u00a0the East Coast before moving offshore by evening. Behind the front, a\u00a0surge of Arctic air brought frigid temperatures in the wake of precipitation, according to the National Weather Service. Overnight lows reached the negative 20s across much of the Upper Plains, and cold weather was forecast for the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and New England. At least one death and two injuries were connected to the snow in Wisconsin, which also caused a multitude of\u00a0accidents that\u00a0sent vehicles off\u00a0roadways, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel A 44-year-old man died Saturday morning while shoveling outside his home. Two children, ages 6 and 9, were hospitalized in Madison after being struck by a city snowplow, police told the paper. Flight woes: Nearly 5,000 cancellations since Thursday And a semi-trailer eastbound on Interstate 94 hit a wall and spilled the fuel it was carrying, but no injuries were reported, according to the Waukesha County Sheriff's Department. A tanker carrying gasoline skidded off a highway in Baltimore on Saturday and exploded, according to the Associated Press. Two people died in the nearly 70-vehicle pileup on Interstate 95. In Ohio, a Columbus woman died Saturday when her car skidded off a slick road, authorities told AP Indiana had dozens of crashes \u2014 two of them with fatalities \u2014 because of\u00a0freezing rain and ice, according to AP. The roads were so slick that authorities had to move motorists stranded on an overpass with a ladder. Flight woes: Nearly 5,000 cancellations since Thursday Since Thursday, when the first of several winter systems began to disrupt U.S.\u00a0flights, about 4,900 flights have been canceled in the U.S. and more than 15,600 delayed. The storms\u2019 four-day effects have hit airports across the country, spreading delays and cancellations from California east through the Rockies, the Midwest and into Eastern airports. Most airlines were offering to change tickets without fees because of the weather. Temperatures were\u00a0expected to plummet Sunday beneath clear skies from Wisconsin to Indiana into the negative teens by Monday morning. The 1 p.m. football game between the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers could set a record-low temperature for kickoff in the Windy City, according to AccuWeather.com. It could be colder than the 2 degrees set Dec. 22, 2008, for a game between the same teams. The temperatures are much colder than usual. In Minneapolis, the high Sunday will be in the single digits below zero, compared with\u00a0a normal high of 27 degrees, according to AccuWeather.com. The temperature in Great Falls, Mont., bottomed out at 26 degrees below zero on Saturday, which wasn't enough to match the record of 36 below, set on Dec. 16, 1964. About 4 to 6 inches of snow accumulated. For the past 10 days, Great Falls residents haven\u2019t seen the thermometer rise above 11 degrees, according to the Great Falls Tribune. Snow accumulation around Cascade averaged 4 to 6\u00a0inches; higher elevation saw a\u00a0foot or more. The Bozeman area got up to 10 inches of new snow. Freezing temperatures will also spread\u00a0across the South on Sunday, from southern Texas to northern Georgia. High temperatures will range 15 to 25 degrees below normal, according to Accuweather.com. There is some good news. Temperatures will begin to moderate with the workweek\u00a0and return more toward normal by midweek. \u201cAfter a few days of below-normal temperatures in the Midwest and eastern U.S. early in the week, highs will return to near average by Wednesday,\u201d said Max Vido, an AccuWeather meteorologist. 23 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hVvzwd ",

Al Behrman/AP hide caption toggle caption Al Behrman/AP Dr. Henry Heimlich has died in Ohio at age 96. He's seen here in 2014, holding a copy of his memoir at his home in Cincinnati. Al Behrman/AP He's credited with saving thousands of people from choking to death, thanks to the method he popularized in 1974. Now comes word that Dr. Henry Heimlich has died at age 96. Heimlich died early Saturday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, according to Bryan Reynolds, spokesman for Episcopal Retirement Services, which operates the retirement home where the physician lived for years. Dr. Heimlich Uses His Maneuver At Retirement Home, Saves 87-Year-Old Woman According to Reynolds, Heimlich was experiencing complications from a massive heart attack he suffered in his home Monday. Since its invention, the Heimlich Maneuver has become both a life-saving tool and a part of modern culture. It's uncertain how popular it would be if the move was still known by its original term: subdiaphragmatic pressure. As Heimlich told NPR back in 1999, that's the name he assigned the method when he described it in a medical journal in June of 1974. That original name didn't last long. As Heimlich said, \"the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association called me, and they said, 'We have found that so many lives have been saved in less than two months, we would like to name this after you.'\" By 1980, he said, the Heimlich maneuver had gained enough prominence to be an entry in foreign-language dictionaries. The thoracic surgeon famously used his own maneuver earlier this year to help a fellow resident at his retirement home \u2014 an 87-year-old woman who began choking on a hamburger during dinner. In a statement, Heimlich's family said they were saddened by the death of a man who's seen by a hero by many. And they said the physician's legacy extends beyond his famous life-saving method: \"As a young surgeon, Dad was the first American to devise and perform a total organ replacement. Later, he came up with a device that saved thousands of soldiers' lives during the Vietnam War. The Heimlich Chest Drain Valve is still used worldwide for patients undergoing chest surgery. \"Dad was firm in his convictions and passionate for his causes. He didn't play politics well. Instead, he was single-minded in his quest to find better ways to save lives. Dad dreamed that anything was possible in the field of medicine, even when critics said otherwise.\" Article continues after sponsorship Some of those critics focused on Heimlich's theory of malariotherapy , in which malaria is induced in people suffering from HIV, Lyme disease and other conditions with the goal of using malaria's high fevers to help patients. Heimlich has acknowledged performing such research on HIV patients in China, telling Boston.com in 2014 that he feels the idea deserves to be researched. Other disagreements have centered on the use of the doctor's eponymous maneuver. The Red Cross says it should be used only after slapping a choking victim's back, for instance, and the Red Cross and other organizations have also said drowning victims should get mouth-to-mouth resuscitation rather than the Heimlich maneuver. The Heimlich Maneuver is relatively simple to perform; it's also been deployed to rescue people from Carrie Fisher and Halle Berry to President Ronald Reagan and New York Mayor Ed Koch, as Radiolab has reported . Here's how Heimlich himself described the maneuver to NPR: \"There are several positions. Now everybody knows where you stand behind the person, put your thumb inside of your fist just above the bellybutton \u2014 remember, below the chest. And you grasp your fist with your other hand and you press inward and upward. Now you repeat that until the object comes out. \"But it also can be done with a person lying down on their back. You kneel astride their thighs and put one of your hands on top of the other, and the heel of the bottom hand just above the bellybutton, and press your weight in. And that's how children have saved their parents. In addition, its widest use now is to save drowning victims.\" You can also see examples of the maneuver in videos from the physician's Heimlich Heroes website . ",

By Anthony Faiola December 18 at 6:49 PM Follow @Anthony_Faiola WARSAW \u2014 The Law and Justice Party rode to power on a pledge to drain the swamp of Polish politics and roll back the legacy of the previous administration. One year later, its patriotic revolution, the party proclaims, has cleaned house and brought God and country back to Poland.\u00a0 Opponents, however, see the birth of a neo-Dark Age \u2014 one that, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, is a harbinger of the power of populism to upend a Western society. In merely a year, critics say, the nationalists have transformed Poland into a surreal and insular place \u2014 one where state-sponsored conspiracy theories and de facto propaganda distract the public as democracy erodes. In the land of Law and Justice, anti-intellectualism is king. Polish scientists are aghast at proposed curriculum changes in a new education bill that would downplay evolution theory and climate change and add hours for \u201cpatriotic\u201d history lessons. In a Facebook chat, a top equal rights official mused that Polish hotels should not be forced to provide service to black or gay customers. After the official stepped down for unrelated reasons, his successor rejected an international convention to combat violence against women because it appeared to argue against traditional gender roles. Over the weekend, Warsaw convulsed in street protests amid allegations that the Law and Justice party had illegally forced through a budget bill even as it sought to restrict media access to Parliament. Cheered on by religious conservatives, the new government has defunded public assistance for in vitro fertilization treatments. To draft new sexual-education classes in schools, it tapped a contraceptives opponent who argues that condom use increases the risk of cancer in women. The government is proffering a law that critics say could soon be used to limit opposition protests. Yet nothing has shocked liberals more than this: After a year in power, Law and Justice is still by far the most popular political party in Poland. It rides atop opinion polls at roughly 36 percent \u2014 more than double the popularity of the ousted Civic Platform party. \u201cThe people support us,\u201d boasted Adam Bielan, Law and Justice\u2019s deputy speaker of the Senate. Trump is promising a tax code rework that could trigger a bonanza of cash rebates for Americans. In Poland, Law and Justice put cash in pockets in other ways, but always while merging social conservatism and nationalism with populist economics. The new government doled out money to families with children. They also slashed Poland\u2019s retirement age \u2014 to as young as 60 for women and 65 for men. Opponents call such actions the \u201cbuying\u201d of support, moves that will only drive up Polish debt and masquerade a long-term power grab that could entrench Law and Justice for years. But right now, for many Poles, nationalism has never felt so good. \u201cWe are living in this post-truth environment where you can say and do anything and people don\u2019t seem to care,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Warsaw-based Institute of Public Affairs. Now they\u2019re true believers The road to Law and Justice country runs an hour outside cosmopolitan Warsaw, down a dirt path in the hamlet of Krupia Wolka. Once there, pass the front-yard playground of a cream-colored house and meet Pawel and Maria Wiechowski.\u00a0 High school sweethearts, they married back in 1992. Two-and-a-half decades and 10 children later, they\u2019re still deeply Catholic \u2014 and still struggling financially.\u00a0 Maria, a therapist for autistic children, quit work when child-care costs exceeded what she earned. Pawel, a craftsman, makes intricate moldings for ceilings and walls. Their parents helped them buy their six-bedroom dream home in the country, so they\u2019re mortgage-free. But he hasn\u2019t had work in two months. During dry spells before, the couple would mothball their 20-year-old VW van to save on gas, and the kids would walk to school. But in the era of Law and Justice, there\u2019s no need. The new government program for families is the Wiechowskis\u2019 life raft; it offers them a monthly cash payout worth nearly $1,000. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s 100 percent of our income,\u201d Pawel said. \u201cSome people criticize the child benefit and say it\u2019s a government handout. It\u2019s not. It is support for traditional families.\u201d Pawel voted for Law and Justice last year as \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d But now he\u2019s a true believer. \u201cIn the United States, you had the same choice, picking the lesser of two evils,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure a year ago either, but now I see how right we were.\u201d Embracing the new government, to some measure, also means buying into the disturbing worldview it sells: You can only trust a Pole \u2014 even then, only some. And the party\u2019s views have never been more effectively disseminated. The national broadcaster in Poland would often tilt toward the party in power. But following its victory, Law and Justice launched an unprecedented purge of journalists at the channel, turning it into what opponents describe as a propaganda machine where conspiracy theories flourish. It recently ran a piece on the health risks of child vaccinations.\u00a0 Conservative Catholic radio and television, meanwhile, is abuzz with the\u00a0 reopening of an investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed then-President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and 94 others. The crash was blamed on human error at the time. But Jaroslaw Kaczynski \u2014 the late president\u2019s twin brother and Law and Justice\u2019s powerful party chief \u2014 appears certain it was a coverup. Was it? \u201cWe are considering the possibility,\u201d Pawel said with a nod. The new government is also skeptical of the Paris climate change agreement to cut carbon emissions and has pulled support for Polish wind and solar farms. At the same time, it is pumping more money into coal.\u00a0 \u201cWho really knows what is causing global warming?\u201d Pawel said. \u201cAnd Poland needs the coal industry.\u201d Maria was always more concerned with the spread of liberal values, which Law and Justice has, she said, rightly nipped in the bud. There is no more talk in Poland, for instance, of offering any legal rights to same-sex couples. Earlier this year, the office of a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group in Warsaw was badly vandalized. Police never caught the perpetrators. \u201cHomosexuality was quiet before, then they tried to normalize it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that happening now.\u201d\u00a0 Are they concerned about allegations the new government is distracting the public as it chips away at Polish democracy? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just cleaning house.\u201d \u2018Where is all this going?\u2019 On a frigid recent evening in Warsaw, Monika Mizolebska, a museum researcher, stoically marched with thousands of other Poles to protest the new government. This is the street opposition \u2014 the people terrified by what they see unfolding in Poland. Already, the new government has taken steps to limit the power of the constitutional court, chipping away, critics say, at checks and balances. A new draft law would also allow government-appointed governors the right to decide on future permits for demonstrations.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m here marching because it may be the last time we\u2019re allowed to,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think many of us really understand what\u2019s happening in Poland.\u201d The mother of a 13-year-old daughter, Mizolebska said she is deeply concerned about what sees as an attack on\u00a0 women\u2019s reproductive rights . A near-total abortion ban \u2014 women and doctors faced up to five years in jail \u2014 was defeated in October after a\u00a0 massive street protest . But she fears it may yet come back. \u201cThe government wants women to be mothers, to be housewives, but my daughter wants to be a writer, maybe a journalist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what chance does she have here? In these conditions?\u201d She is also concerned about a new proposed school curriculum the Polish Academy of Sciences says will marginalize evolution theory by reducing its prominence in some grades. Sciences more generally would receive less time, in favor of more hours for Polish history.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s 2016 and we\u2019re still talking about whether to teach evolution,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWhere is all this going? I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Ewa Galica in Warsaw contributed to this report. Read more ",

An undated file photo taken about 1940 shows Zsa Zsa Gabor in Budapest, Hungary. An undated file photo taken about 1940 shows Zsa Zsa Gabor in Budapest, Hungary. (Laszlo Varkonyi / European Pressphoto Assn.) Valerie J. Nelson, Beverly Beyette The best known of three glamorous sisters from Hungary, actress Zsa Zsa Gabor pioneered a modern version of celebrity \u2014 she was famous for being famous. With the advent of television talk shows, Gabor became a frequent guest as early as the 1950s, charming audiences with her fractured English and slightly risque jokes about her reputation as an oft-married seductress fond of men and money. \u201cHusbands are like fires. They go out if unattended,\u201d she would say. Or \u201cI want a man who is kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?\u201d Her nine marriages and reputation for shaving years off her age made her a pop-culture punch line. When entertainer Bob Hope joked, \u201cYou can calculate Zsa Zsa Gabor\u2019s age by the rings on her fingers,\u201d it only cemented her fame. So did a penchant for public escapades that included a 1989 assault conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer. When reporters asked if she was prepared for a long trial, she cooed: \u201cI have enough outfits to last a year.\u201d The final years of her life were marked by a strange circus of publicity often orchestrated by her ninth husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt , a German immigrant who had brokered an adoption as an adult to gain a royal-sounding title. He issued frequent media alerts on her precarious health and publicly squabbled with Gabor\u2019s only child, Francesca Hilton . Gabor died Sunday of heart failure in her Bel Air mansion, according to her publicist Edward Lozzi. She was 99. The last surviving Gabor sister, she had been in declining health after being seriously injured in 2002 when the Rolls-Royce convertible in which she was riding, with her hairdresser at the wheel, jumped a curb on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood and struck a light pole. The accident left Gabor partially paralyzed. She had been in and out of the hospital since breaking her hip in 2010 and having most of her right leg amputated in early 2011 after developing an infection following hip-replacement surgery. Although her personal life grabbed the headlines, Gabor did build an acting career. One of her finest film roles came early in her career when she portrayed Henri Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s model in 1952\u2019s \u201cMoulin Rouge.\u201d In directing her, John Huston reportedly said: \u201cZsa Zsa, forget about acting. Just make love to the camera.\u201d Gabor later told a biographer: \u201cNow, I knew very little about acting but a great deal about making love. It worked.\u201d In 1958 she made an impression as a strip-club owner in the Orson Welles cult classic \u201cTouch of Evil\u201d and appeared in the campy \u201cQueen of Outer Space,\u201d one of her many more forgettable movies. She acted in at least 30 films. By the 1970s, Gabor had begun turning down the smaller parts that came her way but would occasionally appeared on TV and in movies. She made appearances on talk shows, and on game shows as a panelist, into the 1990s. To Gabor, everyone was \u201cdahlink,\u201d an endearment that entered the vernacular of mid-20th century America. She was a celebrity of the old school who believed in glamour. She once said of today\u2019s actresses, \u201cWhen you see them in real life, they look like nothing.\u201d Not so Zsa Zsa, who flaunted her jewels and furs. She turned her celebrity into a commodity, mining her own reputation for one-liners. \u201cI am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man I keep his house,\u201d she might say, or \u201cThere is nothing wrong with a woman encouraging a man\u2019s advances, as long as they are in cash.\u201d The aristocratic, blond Gabor was reportedly wooed by such rich and famous men as Prince Aly Khan, billionaire J. Paul Getty and actor Richard Burton , none of whom she married. Shortly after arriving in the U.S. in 1942, she made her most notable marriage with second husband Conrad Hilton, the hotel magnate, who was more than twice her age. The union lasted five years. The couple\u2019s daughter, Francesca, was the only offspring of the Gabor sisters, who had at least 18 marriages among them. Older sister Magda, who largely stayed out of the limelight, had at least five husbands, while younger sister Eva had at least four. Eva made the biggest splash as an actress, co-starring in the CBS sitcom \u201cGreen Acres,\u201d which debuted in 1965. Life with his young wife, Hilton later wrote, was \u201ca little like holding a Roman candle \u2014 beautiful, exciting, but you were never quite sure when it would go off. And it is surprisingly hard to live the Fourth of July every day.\u201d He added, \u201cGlamour, I found, is expensive.\u201d For her part, Gabor later said Hilton was the only husband she had married for money. In the divorce settlement she received $35,000 and $2,500 a month until she remarried. That union linked her by marriage to tabloid favorite Paris Hilton, Conrad\u2019s great-granddaughter. Gabor\u2019s next marriage, in 1949, was to actor George Sanders , whom she called her one true love. But Gabor complained that the mercurial Sanders wanted to turn her into a \u201clittle hausfrau\u201d and divorced him after five years. Sanders, who was later briefly married to Gabor\u2019s sister Magda, committed suicide in 1972. Gabor next married businessman Herbert Hutner, oilman Joshua Cosden, inventor Jack Ryan, attorney Michael O\u2019Hara and Mexican businessman Felipe de Alba. The De Alba union was declared invalid after a day because Gabor\u2019s divorce from O\u2019Hara wasn\u2019t final. In 1986, when Gabor married Von Anhalt, she told reporters he would be her last husband. She was true to her word. Zsa Zsa Gabor was born Sari Gabor in Budapest on Feb. 6, 1917, and named for Hungarian actress Sari Fedak. Her father, Vilmos, was a cavalry officer turned diamond merchant, and her mother, Jolie, was a onetime aspiring actress who steered her daughters toward show business. At 15, Zsa Zsa entered the Miss Hungary contest, which led to another beauty contest in Vienna. Instead of returning to Swiss boarding school, Gabor proposed to Burhan Belge, a former Turkish ambassador to Hungary, and the couple married. But bored with her first husband \u2014 and entranced by sister Eva\u2019s descriptions of life in Hollywood, where she had started acting \u2014 Gabor hopped a ship to America in 1941 and had her marriage annulled. Her mother came too and started a successful jewelry business in New York. With her daughters, she became a fixture of high society. Both Zsa Zsa and Eva often appeared on the covers of popular magazines, and in 1953 the three sisters had a nightclub act in Las Vegas. Gabor said she was \u201cborn to make headlines,\u201d and often did. In a 1989 incident that came to be known as \u201cthe slap heard \u2019round the world,\u201d she was convicted of assaulting Paul Kramer, a Beverly Hills police officer who had pulled over her Rolls-Royce Corniche for having expired license-plate tags. She claimed she never hit him, served three days in an El Segundo jail and paid nearly $13,000 in fines. She later poked fun at the cop-slapping incident in the movie \u201cThe Naked Gun 2 1/2.\u201d She became entangled in a slander suit brought by actress Elke Sommer, who didn\u2019t appreciate being called \u201ca has-been.\u201d Gabor was ordered to pay $3.3 million in damages \u00a0in 1993. Gabor and Von Anhalt pursued lawsuits against the driver of her Rolls-Royce in the aftermath of her 2002 accident, and against Gabor\u2019s daughter over disputed finances, one of several clashes that publicly pitted Von Anhalt against Francesca Hilton. But when Francesca Hilton began performing a stand-up comedy routine \u00a0in 2008 that riffed on her famous family lineage, Gabor supported the move, according to her daughter. \u201cMy mother and I, we\u2019re the best of friends now that we\u2019re the same age,\u201d Hilton, then 61, said in a joke referring to Gabor that wrapped up the act. Hilton died in January\u00a02014 of an apparent stroke. She was 67. Medical bills and meager savings forced Von Anhalt to list Gabor\u2019s mansion in 2011, he said. Two years later the home sold for $11 million in a court-approved deal that allowed the couple to continue living there for three more years. An accomplished horsewoman, Gabor rode in the Rose Parade and owned a horse ranch in Ventura County. She also wrote several autobiographies, including a slender 1970 volume, \u201cHow to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man.\u201d \u201cA girl must marry for love,\u201d Gabor once said, \u201cand keep on marrying until she finds it.\u201d She is survived by her husband, who could not immediately be reached for comment by The Times on Sunday.

REUTERS/Carlos Eduardo Ramirez CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuela\u2019s president said Sunday that the sudden decision to scrap the country\u2019s most-used currency bill was an economic triumph over the country\u2019s enemies even as the government sent troops and police to cities where riots and looting broke out over the measure. In a national radio and television broadcast, Nicolas Maduro said his abrupt action had flooded the country\u2019s banks with currency deposited by Venezuelans racing to get rid of the paper bills while also devastating Colombian-border currency traders he blames for the bolivar\u2019s precipitous plunge in value against \u201cthe criminal dollar.\u201d Last week\u2019s sudden announcement annulling all 100-bolivar notes led to massive lines at banks, a dramatic spurt in electronic payment and widespread fear by poorer people with no bank accounts and all their savings in the doomed bills, whose value had already plunged to a few U.S. cents. Cash transactions such as buying food or gasoline became extremely difficult. Maduro suddenly changed course late Saturday, announcing the 100-bolivar notes could be used until Jan. 2 Before that announcement riots and looting broke out in several cities and Maduro said Sunday more than 300 people had been detained, including several members of opposition parties. He said the violence resulted from \u201ca macabre\u201d plan promoted by U.S. President Barack Obama to extract massive quantities of 100-bolivar notes from the country and stockpile them abroad. He said it was meant to be \u201cthe final blow of Obama, a final blow to create chaos, violence, division.\u201d 13 Photos Venezuela: A life waiting in line Most economists blame the country\u2019s economic woes on price controls and falling prices for the country\u2019s oil exports, as well as heavy government spending and production-crippling policies that gave Venezuelans lots of 100-bolivar notes but not enough to buy with them. Maduro said he\u2019d had to lift extend the life of the old currency notes because saboteurs had prevented the arrival of three airplanes carrying newly printed, larger-denomination bills from abroad. He didn\u2019t give details about the plot. Disturbances continued into Saturday evening in places such as Ciudad Bol\u00edvar, where officials banned motorcycles for 48 hours and restricted overnight car and pedestrian traffic. Bolivar state Gov. Francisco Rangel Gomez said 3,200 police were sent into the streets to ensure order and he said 262 people had been arrested in the state. Rangel Gomez, a retired general, urged people to stay in their homes until the vandalism is quelled. Eight hundred police and troops were sent to the town of El Callao, where Mayor Coromoto Lugo said a youth was killed, 25 businesses were looted and 40 people were injured in the disturbances. In the southwestern town of La Fria, officials said city hall was burned during rioting on Saturday. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Log Out He could have been stopped: How one pedophile kept coaching gymnastics An IndyStar investigation traced the path of former coach Ray Adams across a dozen gyms in four states. Email Comment Jenny Brannan answered the phone, and 20 years of fear bubbled to the surface with the caller\u2019s first question: \"Do you know who Ray Adams is?\" Silence. The Missouri woman spent most of her life trying to forget that name. In 1993, when she was 12, she accused the charismatic gymnastics coach of sexually abusing her. But the case never went to court. Now a Florida prosecutor was on the phone, asking Brannan to share her story. Adams had hurt another little girl. Brannan\u2019s first thought: \"He's still doing it?\" He was. Brannan would eventually learn that Adams had been accused of inappropriate conduct involving 15 other girls. Over the years, he had worked in at least a dozen gyms in four states. He had been fired at least six times. He had been criminally charged four times. Once he was acquitted. Another time he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery for abusing four little girls. Now he was facing two new criminal prosecutions in Florida. Yet, somehow, Adams kept getting hired, even by elite gyms that produced Olympians for USA Gymnastics. An expanded timeline of Ray Adams' predatory trail Adams' case \u2014 more than any other uncovered in a nine-month IndyStar investigation \u2014 demonstrates the breadth of flaws in the apparatus of the USA Gymnastics network and a culture of secrecy that has enabled sexual predators to continue coaching. Again and again, girls he targeted didn't recognize the abuse or were too scared or embarrassed to report it. Parents declined to prosecute, fearing further trauma to their children. Gym owners didn't recognize the signs of abuse or\u00a0worried that reporting it\u00a0would\u00a0hurt their businesses. And USA Gymnastics, the sport\u2019s national governing body, doesn't enforce strict standards or effectively track potential predators as they move through a\u00a0system of 3,400 independent gyms. No one wanted to give Ray Adams ready access to victims for 16 years. But the events that occurred between Brannan\u2019s first encounter with Adams and the call she would receive two decades later point to a stark reality: America\u2019s gyms are failing at every level to protect the children under their watch. The troubled history of gymnastics coach Ray Adams. Robert Scheer/IndyStar 1993 All American Gymnastics, St. Louis, Missouri Brannan told IndyStar she met Adams in the early 1990s at All American Gymnastics in St. Louis. At 5 feet 10 inches, the coach seemed tall to Brannan, who was a petite elementary school student. Adams, then in his early 20s, was slender and full of energy, Brannan recalled during an interview with IndyStar. He showed off with a series of round-offs and back flips. The girls he coached adored him. Adams acted silly, laughed with them and asked questions about school and boyfriends. He also chatted with gymnasts\u2019 parents. IndyStar typically does not name alleged victims of sexual abuse without their consent. Jenny Brannan, who was 12 when she said Ray Adams molested her, agreed to testify against Adams in 2013 at his sentencing for attempting to receive child pornography. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Brannan, whom IndyStar agreed to identify by her maiden name, said she trusted Adams. So she said she brushed it off when he stood over her as she did the splits in a handstand. She dismissed it as weird when Adams\u2019 thumb rubbed her nipple as he spotted her on bars. That trust shattered during a private lesson in 1993,\u00a0Brannan\u00a0would later testify in court. She struggled to hit a tumbling pass. Adams asked what was wrong, and when she answered, he replied, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you. Let\u2019s go into the office.\u201d Away from others in the gym. Adams closed the door. \u201cSit in my lap,\u201d he invited. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d He placed his hand above her knee , she testified. He asked if it tickled or gave her goose bumps. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. Adams slid his hand higher. Does this tickle? \u201cNo.\u201d He pulled her leotard to the side and touched her vagina. Does this? \u201cNo.\u201d He put his finger inside her. Brannan said she knew it was wrong. She wanted him to stop but didn\u2019t say it. \u201cI was raised that you don\u2019t really question authority,\u201d she said. Brannan said she thinks Adams stopped because he realized she was getting upset. They finished practice as if nothing had happened. At first, Brannan didn\u2019t tell anyone. She didn\u2019t know what to say. A couple of weeks later, while Brannan\u2019s classmates\u00a0played on the swings and tossed a ball during recess, she stood off to one side of the playground, crying. A friend came over and asked what was wrong. Brannan shared what Adams had done. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d she said. But that friend told her mom, who called Brannan\u2019s mom. Brannan\u2019s mother met with Anna Lum, who owned the gym until 1998. Brannan\u2019s mother made it clear she didn\u2019t want to press charges. But she wanted Adams fired. Despite concerns, Lum said she honored the request. She fired Adams but didn\u2019t contact police. She also adopted a new sexual harassment policy that specifically prohibited gymnasts from being in the room where the alleged abuse took place. \u201cI was just too na\u00efve,\u201d she said. Brannan\u2019s mother, who was present during IndyStar\u2019s interview with her daughter, declined to be interviewed. Brannan said her mother was trying to protect her. \u201cIt was kind of done,\u201d Brannan said. \u201cLike, we didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Adams was far from done. 1994 Scott\u2019s Gymnastics, St. Louis, Missouri Kevin Scott, then-owner of Scott\u2019s Gymnastics in St. Louis, heard concerns among people in the gymnastics community that Adams was too friendly with kids. But Adams had the potential to be an exceptional coach, Scott told IndyStar.\u00a0Scott hired Adams in 1994 with the understanding that Adams would follow rules that were \u201c10 times stricter\u201d than those imposed on other employees. Among them: No kid sits on your lap, no hugs, no being alone with a gymnast, no pictures of kids. \u201cI was very, very clear about what was acceptable and what was not acceptable,\u201d Scott said. He said Adams was a talented coach who was \u201ca master\u201d at developing rapport with his gymnasts\u2019 mothers. He took them to lunch and complimented them. \u201cHe was able to kind of build up those moms, make them feel good about themselves,\u201d Scott recalled. \u201cGive them some attention they were needing, and they soaked it up.\u201d But, soon,\u00a0 some parents complained \u00a0about Adams\u2019 \u201cphysical and verbal treatment of children,\u201d including possible inappropriate touching as he spotted gymnasts on uneven bars during practice. Scott told IndyStar he didn\u2019t call police because the accusations weren\u2019t criminal in nature, but they were too much for him. \u201cDude, you gotta go,\u201d Scott said he told the coach. 1994-1996 Metro Sports, Alton, Illinois On July 1, 1994, Adams surfaced at Metro Sports, an athletic facility just over the state line in Alton, Illinois. Once again, Adams\u2019 engaging personality was good for business. He would hop on the front counter and flirt with mothers. He complimented their clothes, hair and nails. And his gymnastics routines for students were \u201ccreative and exciting,\u201d Metro Sports owner Barbara McAfoos recalled. \u201cI probably made more income off Ray Adams than any other instructor I\u2019ve ever had in our gymnastics and dance studio,\u201d she told IndyStar. But by his second year of employment, she noticed warning signs. Adams once joked to her that he could wrap his penis around his neck, McAfoos said. When she chastised him for the remark, he replied: \u201cI thought we were closer than that.\u201d Ray Adams worked at Metro Sports in Alton, Illinois, from 1994 to 1996. He was let go after the owner confronted him with allegations of inappropriate conduct. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Adams also was giving gifts to gymnasts. And a father removed his three children from the gym, complaining Adams was too touchy. Adams would playfully poke little girls in the stomach, asking \u201cwhat\u2019s that on your shirt?\u201d Then he\u2019d flick their noses. A coach from another Alton facility told McAfoos that Adams had been fired from All American Gymnastics. \u201cI was afraid of this getting out... of this ruining my studio.\u201d Barbara McAfoos, owner Metro Sports in Alton, Ill. \u201cAt the\u00a0time, it\u2019s kind of like you don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was such an outstanding instructor. I just really didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d Then, in March 1996, a gymnast on Adams\u2019 competition team abruptly quit. McAfoos said it was unusual because it was a few months before the end of the dance season and the family had already paid for the recital and costumes. So she called the girl\u2019s mother. The mother put her daughter on speakerphone. The girl said Adams told her to go into a small office to try on a leotard. Then he came in to \u201csee whether or not it fit.\u201d He pulled the leotard from side to side and felt her crotch, according to court records. The girl told him to stop. His reply: \u201cI thought we were closer than this.\u201d The words rang true to McAfoos, who had heard them before. But she didn\u2019t call police. McAfoos\u2019 plan was to get through the dance season and let Adams go. That would be it. \u201cI was afraid of this getting out,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid of this ruining my studio.\u201d She and her husband confronted Adams about the allegations in March 1996. They told him his time at the gym would be over at the end of the dance season. The season ended three months later, in June 1996, and Adams was gone. Soon after, McAfoos said, she received a letter from an attorney representing Adams. It warned he would sue if she divulged anything negative about him.

September 1996 Center Stage Dance Studio, Imperial, Missouri In the weeks that followed, Adams started giving private lessons to a 13-year-old he previously coached at another gym. Within a few months, on Sept. 16, 1996, the family contacted the St. Louis County Police Department and the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Department . The girl told police that during a drive to Center Stage Dance Studio in Imperial, Adams asked \u201cif her boyfriend had ever felt her up or felt her down.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. Then Adams asked whether she\u2019d seen her boyfriend\u2019s penis. \u201cNo.\u201d According to police records, he then asked if she would like to see his penis. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Adams replied, \u201cbecause you are going to be disappointed when you do get to see your boyfriend\u2019s penis.\u201d When they got to the dance studio, Adams pulled her leotard down to her hips and began massaging her stomach, the girl told police. It stopped when the gym owner arrived. \u201cI wish that she would hurry and leave so we could be alone,\u201d Adams told the girl, according to her account to police. That night, the girl told her parents. They were adamant that something be done to prevent Adams from doing something similar to other girls. Police officials from Jefferson and St. Louis counties pursued arrest warrants for Adams, but prosecutors in both jurisdictions declined to file criminal charges. Ed Magee, executive assistant for the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney\u2019s office, said he could not provide information on the case because the court records are closed. Under Missouri law, records are closed if the prosecutor\u2019s office declines to pursue criminal charges or the defendant is acquitted. November 1996 Metro Sports, Alton, Illinois Around that time, Adams was teaching children at Jeanie\u2019s Rainbow Connection in Centralia, Illinois, and at an unknown studio\u00a0across the state line in St. Louis, according to a report from the Alton Police Department. McAfoos, the owner of Metro Sports in Illinois, was still grappling with her own decision not to report Adams. By Thanksgiving of 1996 she was concerned enough to discuss the situation with her sister-in-law, who warned that she needed to report suspected child abuse. \u201cI\u2019m telling you now, you need to turn him in,\u201d McAfoos\u2019 sister-in-law insisted. \u201cIf there\u2019s any indication you knew anything, you\u2019ll lose everything you have.\u201d McAfoos called the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services on Dec. 6, 1996. Child welfare officials forwarded the report to the Alton Police Department, and both agencies launched investigations. About a month later, on Jan. 21, 1997, the father of the girl from Metro Sports told police he didn\u2019t want to go forward with the case . He said it would mentally harm his daughter because \u201cshe has had dreams about the incident.\u201d The case was reopened later that year after other gymnasts\u2019 families reported Adams to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Alton Police Chief Jason Simmons said. In September 1997, Alton police requested an interview with Adams. During the interview , police told Adams that several young girls had accused him of exposing\u00a0their breasts and vaginas. Adams didn\u2019t deny it, according to police. Instead, he nodded. \u201cWhat can I do to take care of this?\u201d Adams asked. \u201cI am willing to do my part and take care of it.\u201d The detective told Adams to stop molesting children, confess what he\u2019d done, seek counseling and quit working with children. Adams agreed to quit his gymnastics job but said he needed to leave at the end of the year because he\u2019d already been paid, according to a police report. Out of Balance When the detective asked Adams for a written confession, Adams\u2019 attorney intervened and said he wouldn\u2019t allow Adams to sign a statement unless a prosecutor was involved. He didn\u2019t want his client to have a felony conviction. Police and prosecutors scheduled a meeting with Adams and his attorney for early October 1997. As that investigation lingered, Adams continued coaching at a YMCA in the St. Louis area. 1997-1998 YMCA, metro St. Louis, Missouri A 7-year-old girl at the YMCA said she and her teammates sat in a circle under the uneven bars and played duck, duck, goose. The winner got to sit in Adams\u2019 lap. \u201cIt was something, you know, he wanted you to work for,\u201d the girl said in a deposition taken 15 years later during an unrelated criminal case. \u201cIt was something that he wanted you to try to win.\u201d The girl said Adams rubbed her stomach, chest and vagina while she was on his lap in front of other girls at the gym. She said he kept talking as though nothing was happening. A Gateway Region YMCA spokesman said the organization could not locate Adams\u2019 employment record because it does not keep data that old. At the time, the girl said, she didn\u2019t know it was wrong. Adams remained her coach, she said, until he was arrested in May 1998. 1998-2000 Alton, Illinois McAfoos\u2019 fears about the potential impact on her business were soon laid to rest. \u201cIt had no effect on my business because I turned him in... I\u2019m glad that I did.\u201d Barbara McAfoos, owner Metro Sports in Alton, Ill. Prosecutors charged Adams with four felony counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. The 27-year-old was accused of inappropriately touching four Metro Sports gymnasts, all younger than 13. Assistant State Attorney Amy Maher told a local newspaper that Adams may have abused as many as eight girls. When the news came out, McAfoos said, she didn\u2019t lose a single student. \u201cIt had no effect on my business because I turned him in,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I did.\u201d Brannan, the Missouri girl who said Adams abused her at All American Gymnastics, learned about the criminal charges and immediately contacted the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. I want to testify, the then-17-year-old told the Alton Police Department . But she wouldn\u2019t get a chance, not then. The Illinois girls\u2019 parents did not allow their children to cooperate with the prosecution, according to a prosecutor who reviewed Adams\u2019 criminal history. Nearly two years later, in February 2000, prosecutors agreed to drop the felony charges as part of a plea agreement. Adams pleaded guilty to four counts of misdemeanor battery and was ordered to pay a fine. 2001-2003 Camelot Music, Chesterfield, Missouri A month after his guilty plea, Adams started talking with a preteen girl who frequented Camelot Music, where he worked at the Chesterfield Mall in Missouri, according to police records . On Dec. 2, 2001, the girl stopped by the store and Adams invited her to join him in the office while he ate lunch. \u201cDo you ever think about me?\u201d the girl recalled Adams asking. The girl, who was then 14, told him she didn\u2019t, other than when she was at the mall and considering whether she should stop by to say \u201chi.\u201d Adams moved his left hand behind her head and pulled her toward him. The girl told police Adams kissed her, tried to put his tongue in her mouth and slid his hand under her untucked shirt to touch her breasts through her bra. She pulled away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou are 10 years older than I am.\u201d \u201cYeah, it's kind of a problem,\u201d Adams replied. \u201cBut when you turn 18 we are going to have to talk.\u201d When she tried to change the subject, he asked to see her bra. The girl\u2019s mother called the Chesterfield Police Department five days later. She said her daughter was embarrassed and scared to report it. Less than two years after Adams had accepted the\u00a0plea deal in Illinois, he was again facing allegations of inappropriate conduct. Adams, then 31, was charged in 2002 in St. Louis County with fondling the 14-year-old girl. But he was acquitted in 2003. Details about the outcome\u00a0are unavailable. In Missouri, court records are closed to the public after an acquittal, said Magee, executive assistant for the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney\u2019s office. By 2003, no fewer than 12\u00a0young girls had accused Adams of groping them, yet he continued to coach gymnastics. Early 2000's Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy, Fairfield, Ohio Exactly where Adams went between 2002 and late 2005 is unclear. Records indicate Adams may have briefly moved to Michigan. But sometime in that period, Adams landed at the Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy in Fairfield, Ohio. The elite gym has produced a series of Olympians and U.S. national team members, such as gold medalists Amanda Borden and Jaycie Phelps. The gym owner, Mary Lee Tracy, said she didn\u2019t do background checks of prospective employees at that time. She said she has since strengthened her policies, following USA Gymnastics\u2019 lead. Tracy did call one of Adams\u2019 references, a former employer with no connection to gymnastics.\u00a0That person told Tracy that Adams was a hard worker. Tracy said she never had a problem with Adams. He left voluntarily, and she gave him a good reference. She said she didn\u2019t know about Adams\u2019 criminal history until IndyStar told her. \u201cThat makes me sick to my stomach,\u201d she said. To empower the journalism behind IndyStar, you can\u00a0 subscribe for just\u00a0$4.99 \u00a0for the first year. 2005-2007 Buckeye Gymnastics, metro Columbus, Ohio By late 2005, Adams was hired part time at Buckeye Gymnastics, another elite gym that produced gold medalist Gabby Douglas and other U.S. national team members. David Holcomb, president of Buckeye Gymnastics, told IndyStar that Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy gave Adams a positive recommendation. But, through back channels, coaches said things like they \u201calways got a bad vibe\u201d and \u201ckeep your eye on him.\u201d Holcomb also said former employers listed on Adams\u2019 resume said they let him go. When Holcomb asked why, they said Adams was \u201ckind of acting like a creep\u201d but wouldn\u2019t provide specifics. At the same time, Holcomb said he received glowing references from people who called Adams a \u201csuper spotter\u201d who was terrific with kids and parents. He noted that Adams also was a member in good standing with USA Gymnastics, the sport\u2019s national governing body. \"I won't hire anybody who doesn't have credentials,\" Holcomb said. It's not clear when Adams became a USA Gymnastics member. The organization\u00a0declined to say when he joined or when it conducted a background check on him for any criminal convictions. USA Gymnastics did say that Adams\u2019 brushes with the law, including his misdemeanor battery conviction, did not show up on its background screen. It blamed the criminal justice system\u2019s fragmented record keeping, as well as laws that prohibit agencies from providing information on nonconvictions older than seven years. Holcomb said he separately\u00a0paid for a background check on Adams, relying on the same company used by USA Gymnastics. It came back clean. \u201cI was getting very mixed messages, and good coaches are hard to come by,\u201d Holcomb said. He gave Adams a chance. The first complaints Holcomb received weren\u2019t about Adams\u2019 conduct in the gym. Some parents complained that Adams was giving gymnasts gifts from his other job at Sharper Image, a retailer that sells home electronics, air purifiers and other gadgets. Some of the gifts were expensive, but not all of the kids were getting them. \u201cHe had his favorites,\u201d Holcomb said. Some parents whose children didn\u2019t receive gifts complained to the gym. Holcomb warned Adams to stop. He didn\u2019t. Then a parent complained that Adams had tickled his daughter, who didn\u2019t like to be tickled. And Holcomb found out the coach had taken three photos of little girls doing the splits \u2014 something Holcomb said shouldn't be done. Adams lasted 18 months. Holcomb said he fired Adams in March 2007 for failing to follow the gym\u2019s policies. \u201cThe pictures were bothering me,\u201d Holcomb said, \u201cthe fact that he was taking inappropriate pictures of kids. I fired him on the spot. He was done.\u201d Holcomb followed up with a letter to parents . \u201cI understand that many of you have developed a friendly and close relationship with Ray,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNonetheless, I am advising the gymnasts against any further contact.\u201d He told IndyStar that Adams threatened to call a lawyer when Holcomb confiscated Adams\u2019 cellphone, which had the pictures on it. Afterward, the Buckeye Gymnastics owner strengthened his own policies. He said he no longer allows anyone else to shoot photos of the gymnasts. He does it himself. And Holcomb said he educated himself about the warning signs of abuse. Those behaviors \u2014 giving gifts, tickling and photographing gymnasts \u2014 mirrored other cases involving predatory coaches that were examined by IndyStar. \u201cBack in 2006, 2007, I was pretty oblivious,\u201d Holcomb said. \u201cI learned a hard lesson.\u201d He said he considered sending a complaint to USA Gymnastics, but the allegations against Adams weren\u2019t violations of USA Gymnastics\u2019 bylaws, nor did he think they were criminal violations. A blind eye to sex abuse: How USA Gymnastics failed to report cases What, Holcomb wondered, would he tell the national governing body? That Adams gave gifts, took some photos and tickled a kid? \u201cIn hindsight, yep, I should\u2019ve,\u201d Holcomb said. \u201cAt the time, I\u2019m going, \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing to hang my hat on here.\u2019 It\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s basically my gut instinct that this guy is bad news.\u201d Jenny Brannan, one of Ray Adams' earliest victims, St. Louis, Friday, August 19, 2016.

    "text": "advertisement The Muslim teen who alleged to have been the victim of a hate crime last week in New York was charged with falsifying her report Wednesday \u2014 and the reaction from many Muslim Americans has gone from anger at the time of the purported incident to dismay following her arrest. Muslims nationally have been openly worrying about how 18-year-old Yasmin Seweid's arrest might affect them and the struggle against real bigotry and Islamophobia. \"Whenever an individual, especially a minority, cries wolf, it always ends up hurting that community,\" said Wajahat Ali, creative director of Affinis Labs, a center for social entrepreneurship and innovation. Yasmin Seweid Courtesy of NYPD Seweid has been charged with lying about being harassed by group of men she claimed were Trump supporters on the New York City subway. Robina Niaz, the executive director for the nonprofit Turning Point for Women and Families, suggested Muslims put this story into perspective. NBCNewYork: Sister of Muslim Teen Who Claimed Harassment, Slams Cops, Media \"Girls and young women must have safe spaces to talk about the issues and challenges they face at home and in society. There's peer and familial pressure, as well as from the community, especially after 9/11,\" she told NBC News. An NYPD spokesman told NBC News that a great deal of time was spent seriously investigating this incident, from tracking down witnesses to researching the claimed wrongdoing of a group of men said to have verbally attacked her on a Manhattan subway train. Seweid's sister in a Facebook post said that while she tries to discern \"why Yasmin lied,\" there is another issue that deserves more attention. \"I'm deeply concerned about the mental state of young Muslim women who feel that they have to lie so intensely to survive,\" she wrote. Even so, interfaith activists like Imam Shamsi Ali, who serves the Jamaican Muslim Center in Queens, N.Y., said that lies like this only hurt the Muslim community in a world where there are very real threats. NBCNewYork: Missing Muslim Teen Harassed on Subway Found: Nassau County Police \"I am truly worried that the real concerns of our community will be undermined and in time real attacks perpetrated against Muslims will be just considered such as this lie,\" Imam Ali told NBC News. There has been a spike in reported hate crimes since the election of Donald Trump, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , which monitors hate groups in the United States. Just last Saturday, a Muslim NYPD officer was the target of a hate crime that garnered attention from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who called the incident \"unacceptable.\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced steps to monitor reports of hate crimes in New York state through a special state police unit . Ali added that reporting false incidents damages the cause of equality. \"Not only is it dishonest, using and abusing people's empathy, goodwill, time and emotion, it comes at a tremendous cost, which is always borne by the most marginalized of society, who are trying to gain an equal footing, live their life with dignity, safety and security,\" he said.

A woman standing outside her home watches Iraqi special forces in Mosul\u2019s Mishraq neighborhood. The area was recently retaken from Islamic State militants. (Hadi Mizban/AP) By Mustafa Salim and Loveday Morris December 18 at 5:40 PM Follow @LovedayM MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of people who remain in this northern Iraqi city are struggling to find food and safe drinking water as the protracted offensive against Islamic State militants batters their neighborhoods. When the battle began seven weeks ago, aid agencies feared that an exodus from the city would overwhelm already crowded camps . Instead, most people heeded government advice to stay in their homes as security forces advanced. Now many of those residents lack even basic services, with water supplies cut by the fighting, and U.N. and government aid distributions unable to reach all of those in need. Some residents are moving from neighborhood to neighborhood in search of food or to escape the bombardment. Meanwhile, in areas still controlled by the Islamic State , a siege by security forces is slowly tightening, pushing up food prices and causing shortages while the militants prevent people from leaving. Iraq is struggling to meet the needs of 3.2\u00a0million people displaced over the past three years during fighting against the Islamic State. To limit the displacement from Mosul, the government airdropped leaflets over the city telling civilians to stay put. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP) But few commanders expect the battle to finish anytime soon, and the misery unfolding in Mosul is expected to worsen as winter sets in. Reaching people inside the city is risky for humanitarian agencies, which also say they do not have enough aid to meet the need. This month, Iraqi counterterrorism forces escorted a truck carrying bottled water into the neighborhood of Zuhoor, which had been retaken two days earlier. People quickly crowded around to grab whatever they could. \u201cIs there any food?\u201d they clamored. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any food.\u201d [ The mounting death toll in Mosul forces questions about the battle plan ] Because of the shortages, some residents have decided to leave the recently reclaimed neighborhoods and move to others on the city\u2019s edge that are better supplied. Only people who end up in the camps are included among the official number of displaced \u2014 100,000 people \u2014 and the United Nations says it has no way to gauge how many internally displaced are in the city. Jassim al-Attiyah, Iraq\u2019s deputy minister for migration and displacement, estimated that more than 150,000 are displaced within the city and that hundreds of thousands of others remain in their homes but still need aid. \u201cThere is some aid, but it\u2019s a big battle,\u201d he said. On the far eastern outskirts of the city, Haitham Mazin, 40, his wife and three children are living with a relative in Gogjali, where water and food are distributed more frequently, and some medical assistance is available. Mazin had wanted his family to stay in their home in the Zahra neighborhood after the area was retaken by Iraqi security forces, but the food and fuel he had stockpiled ran out. He said that aid distributions were haphazard and that while some people with connections to security forces had received enough assistance to even sell some, other families, including his, had gone without. Dependent on well water, which is not safe to drink, residents had fought when water supplies arrived, he said. \u201cWe became like beggars,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government at the beginning told us to stay home, but they didn\u2019t provide anything for us.\u201d Half the direct assistance provided by the United Nations since the beginning of the operation for Mosul has been distributed to those in the city, said Lise Grande, the organization\u2019s humanitarian coordinator for Iraq. \u201cWe are very worried that we are going to run out of supplies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe only have limited amounts of stocks, and if everyone near and inside Mosul requires help, we won\u2019t have enough \u2014 not by a long shot.\u201d [ Iraq has never seen this kind of fighting in its battles with ISIS ] The United Nations and its partners are providing food parcels to sustain families for a month \u2014 after which the government\u2019s food-distribution system is supposed to take over. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this happens, because in many locations the first month is nearly over,\u201d she said. Younes Sabri, 30, left the recaptured neighborhood of Bakr this month with his mother and two children. There was no food, water or electricity, he said, and the mortar shells were still falling. At first he had walked an hour each day to Gogjali in search of supplies to take back to his family, but then he had decided to move into the house of a friend in the neighborhood who had left for a camp when the area was engulfed in fighting. \u201cThe humanitarian situation there was very bad. Even the basics were not available,\u201d he said of his neighborhood. But like others, he is wary of the camps, because once people are there, they are not allowed to leave, not even if their neighborhood has been retaken. \u201cPeople of Mosul have only two options,\u201d he said. \u201cEither stay inside and die because of the bombing or hunger, or go to the camps \u2014 to the prison. Either way, it\u2019s a slow death.\u201d Attiyah, the government minister, cited \u201csecurity reasons\u201d for restricting the movement of those in the camps. The government\u2019s decision to try to keep people in their homes has slowed the battle, limiting the use of heavy artillery and airstrikes. Commanders are urging Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to allow them to move families out of their neighborhoods temporarily to quicken the battle, but that could add to the humanitarian burden. For the moment, people are being given the choice of whether to stay or leave. Attiyah said he expects the situation to worsen. Security forces have retaken neighborhoods on the eastern side of the Tigris River, which carves the city in half, but have not yet entered areas on the other side. The situation in those Islamic State-held areas is also a \u201ctragedy,\u201d Attiyah said. \u201cThere is no water, no electricity, and a lot of the doctors have left.\u201d Instead of heading to the camps, some people have fled to western Mosul. When the fighting starts there, he said, they will have nowhere to run. Read more: ",

    "text": "Zsa Zsa Gabor dead at 99 Published               December 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Zsa Zsa Gabor, the curvy blonde actress known for her intriguing personal life, including nine marriages, her breathy accent and her habit of calling everyone \"darling,\" died Sunday. She was 99. The middle and most famous of the sisters Gabor died Sunday of a heart attack at her Los Angeles home, husband Frederic von Anhalt told The Associated Press. \"We tried everything, but her heart just stopped and that was it,\" he said. \"Even the ambulance tried very hard to get her back, but there was no way.\" The great aunt of Paris Hilton and a spiritual matriarch to the Kardashians and other tabloid favorites, Gabor was the original hall-of-mirrors celebrity, famous for being famous for being famous. Starting in the 1940s, she rose from beauty queen to millionaire's wife to minor television personality to minor film actress to major public character. With no special talent, no hit TV series such as her sister Eva's \"Green Acres,\" Zsa Zsa nevertheless was a long-running hit just being Zsa Zsa -- her accent drenched in diamonds, her name synonymous with frivolity and camp as she winked and carried on about men, dahling, and the droll burdens of the idle rich. She was like popcorn for the public and, for sociologists, the seeming fulfillment of the mindless future imagined in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" a creation made possible by mass, electronic media; her words and image transcribed and beamed into theaters and living rooms, on the internet and the shelves of newsstands and supermarket checkout lines. JOHN GLENN TO BE BURIED AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY In 1998, cultural historian Neal Gabler diagnosed her kind of celebrity as \"The Zsa Zsa Factor.\" \"When she first came to fame in the early 1950s, Zsa Zsa wasn't an actress or a singer or a dancer or an entertainer of any sort,\" he observed. \"She was the beautiful wife of actor George Sanders who happened to appear on a quiz show dispensing offhanded advice to lovelorn viewers. By being herself she became such a success that she immediately landed movie roles.\" Her secret, in part, was being in on the joke, once saying about a 1956 TV role, \"I play a fabulously rich woman who has just bought her fifth husband; she is very unhappy. I won't tell you who it's supposed to be.\" Ever game for a laugh, Gabor spoofed her image in a videotaped segment on David Letterman's \"Late Show,\" which had the two stars driving from one fast-food restaurant to another, sipping sodas and digging into burgers like they were slabs of wedding cake. Gabor's film career was, as The Film Encyclopedia notes, \"mostly decorative.\" Among her more prominent credits: as dancer Jane Avril in John Huston's Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, \"Moulin Rouge,\" 1952; and Orson Welles' classic \"Touch of Evil,\" 1958. More recently, she appeared in the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series and in the \"Naked Gun\" spoofs. Amid all the trivia, she had a peripheral part in two big scandals of the early 21st century: the death of Anna Nicole Smith (von Anhalt claimed to have had an affair with her) and the alleged financial scam of Bernard Madoff (a lawyer said she might have lost $10 million through him). And she was in the spotlight for a dustup from the late 20th century: \"The slap heard `round the world.\" In June 1989, Gabor smacked Paul Kramer, a police officer, on a Beverly Hills street, after he pulled over her Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible for a traffic violation. She was convicted of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, driving without a driver's license and having an open container of alcohol in the car. She served three days in jail, performed community service at a woman's shelter and paid $13,000 in fines and restitution. When she was freed, she told reporters the jailers were kind but \"at first I was petrified. They even took my makeup away.\" Gabor kept up the act in the advice book \"How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man,\" and in the exercise video, \"It's Simple Darling,\" in which she banters and stretches with a pair of muscular young trainers. Her memoir, \"One Life Is Not Enough,\" came out in 1991 and dished about everything from her virginity (gone at 15) to the endless men who came on to her (She would claim that William Paley of CBS promised Gabor her own show if only she would spend an afternoon with him.) Gabor had one child, Francesca Hilton, from her marriage to hotelier Conrad Hilton. (She would allege the child was conceived after Hilton raped her.) In later years, Gabor, von Anhalt and Francesca battled in court over family finances. Francesca Hilton died of an apparent stroke in 2015. The actress was born Sari -- Zsa Zsa was a family nickname --Gabor in Budapest on Feb. 6, 1917. She, along with her sisters Eva and Magda, and their mother, Jolie, emigrated to America around World War II. Zsa Zsa gained notice when she became the wife of Hilton, whom she married in 1942 and by the following decade all the Gabors were celebrities. (Eva died in 1995 at age 74. Mother Jolie died in April 1997 at age 97 and sister Magda died two months later at age 78). In 1954, Gabor made headlines being seen with Dominican Republic playboy-diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa within weeks of his marriage to dime store heiress Barbara Hutton. Her 1958 romance with Rafael Trujillo Jr., son of the Dominican dictator, became a scandal in Congress. Ohio's Rep. Wayne Hayes -- eventually caught in his own adulterous affair -- cited the expensive gifts Gabor was allegedly receiving from the young man to argue that foreign aid for the island nation should be eliminated. She wed eight times -- nine including a 1982 shipboard ceremony that was quickly annulled and may not have been legal. Other husbands included businessman Herbert L. Hutner and prolific inventor Jack Ryan, credited with designing everything from missiles to the Barbie doll. She is survived by von Anhalt, whom she married in 1986. Part of Mama Jolie's advice to her daughters, as recounted in a 1953 Associated Press interview with Zsa Zsa, has a modern touch. She said she told them: \"You must be independent and able to do for yourself. Then you do not have to marry a rich man, you can marry a poor one. And if it is wrong, you can go.\" \"I am a marvelous housekeeper,\" Zsa Zsa once said. \"Every time I leave a man I keep his house.\" She also noted, \"Husbands are like fires. They go out when unattended.\" She regularly appeared on the talk show \"The Merv Griffin Show\" during the 1960s and 1970s, and one of her most recent medical problems began while she was watching Griffin's other notable TV creation, \"Jeopardy.\" She broke her right hip and suffered a concussion in July 2010 when she fell out of bed while watching the quiz show. At one point, she received last rites. Her now-deceased publicist, John Blanchette, told NewsCore after her initial fall, \"She has been bedridden since her accident in 2002,\" referring to a car accident that left the actress partially paralyzed and forced her to use a wheelchair. She also suffered a stroke in 2005. In November 2011, she was rushed to the hospital after bleeding from the feeding tube in her stomach, according to her husband. That incident came only a month after she was taken to UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, where she previously had been admitted multiple times, after losing consciousness. Gabor\u2019s right leg was amputated that same year after powerful antibiotics failed to clear up an infection. She was again hospitalized after screen legend Elizabeth Taylor died in March of that year. Gabor was quoted at the time as saying she feared she would be the next to go.

    "text": "Email LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A 3-year-old boy being taken on a shopping trip by his grandmother was killed in a road rage shooting when a driver opened fire on the grandmother\u2019s car because he thought she \u201cwasn\u2019t moving fast enough at a stop sign,\u201d police said. The boy and his grandmother were at the stop sign in southwest Little Rock on Saturday evening when a driver apparently angry about the delay stepped out of his car and opened fire, police said. The boy was struck by gunfire at least once, they said. The grandmother, who wasn\u2019t struck, drove away and called police from a shopping center.\u00a0 A one-year-old was also in the car with the grandmother during the shooting, CBS Little Rock affiliate KTHV reported .\u00a0 Police arrived at the shopping center and found the boy in the car outside a JCPenney department store. The boy was taken to a hospital, where he died shortly after, becoming the second young child shot dead in a road rage incident in the city in the last few weeks. Police Lt. Steve McClanahan said investigators believe the boy and his grandmother \u201cwere completely innocent\u201d and have no relationship with Saturday\u2019s shooter, who was being sought. He said the grandmother simply was \u201cdriving the car and was taking her grandson shopping when the incident occurred.\u201d Police said they were looking for an older black Chevrolet Impala. Police did not release a detailed description of the man who was driving it.\u00a0 Police are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect. $20,000 reward for the arrest & conviction of the individual(s) involved in this homicide. pic.twitter.com/o8p6W77Hi3 \u2014 Little Rock Police (@LRpolice) December 18, 2016 Last month, a 2-year-old girl was killed when a car drove by and someone fired into her vehicle; the shooter in that case hasn\u2019t been captured.\u00a0 Police Chief Kenton Buckner said the road rage killings were frustrating for the police department and the community, especially because the young victims were \u201cvery innocent\u201d and \u201ccan do very little to protect themselves.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have a community to where the least protected among us, being infants, who are dying (in) these senseless crimes in our city,\u201d Buckner said.

The cyber-security incident happened back in May, when authorities say over 100 employees responded to a phishing email allegedly sent by the suspect, described as a Nigerian national, reports CBS Los Angeles . The workers provided the username and passwords to the alleged scammer through an email designed to look legitimate, officials said. \u201cSome of those employees had confidential client/patient information in their email accounts because of their County responsibilities,\u201d the county said in a news release. \u201cCounty officials learned of the breach the next day, and immediately implemented strict security measures.\u201d County officials say investigators requested the delay in telling the public what happened. \u201cAn exhaustive forensic examination by the County has concluded that approximately 756,000 individuals were potentially impacted through their contact with the following departments: Assessor, Chief Executive Office, Children and Family Services, Child Support Services, Health Services, Human Resources, Internal Services, Mental Health, Probation, Public Health, Public Library, Public Social Services and Public works,\u201d the county said. Names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, addresses, home phone numbers, medical treatment information are among the information that may have been compromised. On Thursday, an arrest warrant was issued for Austin Kelvin Onaghinor, who has been charged with nine counts, including unauthorized computer access, and identity theft, authorities said. \u201cMy office will work aggressively to bring this criminal hacker and others to Los Angeles County, where they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

    "text": "Dec 18 2016, 3:50 pm ET Massive 2013 Oil Spill in North Dakota Still Not Cleaned Up by The Associated Press advertisement BISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 Three years and three months later, a massive oil spill in North Dakota still isn't fully cleaned up. The company responsible hasn't even set a date for completion. Though crews have been working around the clock to deal with the Tesoro Corp. pipeline break, which happened in a wheat field in September 2013, less than a third of the 840,000 gallons that spilled has been recovered \u2014 or ever will be, North Dakota Health Department environmental scientist Bill Suess said. A farmer, Steve Jenkins, who'd smelled the crude oil for days, discovered the spill in his northwestern North Dakota field near Tioga \u2014 his combines' tires were covered in it. Cleanup at the site of an oil pipeline leak and spill near of Tioga, North Dakota, on Oct. 11, 2013. Kevin Cederstrom / AP File While the nearest home was a half-mile away and the state said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife hurt, one of the largest onshore oil spills recorded in the U.S. serves for some as a cautionary example, especially given a recent pipeline break about 150 miles south and ongoing debates over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline. Related: Pipeline Spills Oil 150 Miles From Dakota Access Protests \"What happened to us happened and we can't go back,\" said Patty Jensen, Steve's wife. This month's pipeline break in Belfield, which belched an estimated 176,000 gallons of oil into a creek that feeds into the Little Missouri River, a tributary of the Missouri River, really rankled her. \"But I get really upset when I hear of a new one and I wonder what is being done to prevent these spills,\" she said. Play Veterans Stand Ground with Pipeline Protesters at Standing Rock 5:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161219005104if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/829509187575\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Both the Tesoro break and the Belfield break occurred on 6-inch steel pipelines \u2014 a part of a large network pipelines that crisscross western North Dakota's oil patch. By comparison, the Dakota Access pipeline is made of 30-inch steel and will carry nearly 20 million gallons daily. The Tesoro spill was not far from where oil was first discovered in North Dakota in 1951.The Texas-based company and federal regulators have said a lightning strike may have caused the 2013 rupture in the pipeline, which runs from Tioga to a rail facility outside of Columbus, near the Canadian border. Related: Dakota Protesters Say Belle Fourche Oil Spill 'Validates Struggle' North Dakota regulators initially thought just 750 barrels of oil was involved in the spill, but later updated the amount exponentially. They also expanded the affected acreage from about 7 \u2014 the size of seven football fields \u2014 to about 13 acres, Suess said. The cleanup has cost Tesoro more than $49 million to date and is expected to top $60 million, according to recent filings to the state. Tesoro spokeswoman Destin Singleton said she could not immediately confirm the numbers, and noted the cleanup completion date remains unknown. The pipeline was monitored remotely, but the company has said the spill wasn't detected. Crews have had to dig as deep as 50 feet to remove hundreds of thousands of tons of oil-tainted soil, Suess said. The company has now switched to special equipment that cooks hydrocarbons from crude-soaked soil in a process called thermal desorption before putting it back in place. The Dec. 5 spill on the Belle Fourche pipeline also was discovered by a landowner. Crude oil migrated about almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. Seuss said it appears no oil got as far as the Little Missouri River, and no drinking water sources were threatened. Related: Army Corps of Engineers Had Actually Recommended Dakota Access Pipeline Route Approval It's not yet clear why monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, according to Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the pipeline. The Dakota Access pipeline builder, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, has said the project will be safe and that workers remotely monitoring the pipeline will be able to shut it down if a leak is detected. Owen said she didn't know how long it would take to clean the Belle Fourche spill, given that wintry weather was slowing down the progress, or how much it would cost. Patty Jensen is aware of the glacial pace of oil spill cleanups. For more than three years, it's been part the couple's life. \"They are there working away 24 hours a day, seven days a week \u2014 it's pretty amazing,\" she said. \"The noise from the equipment used to bug us but we've grown used to it.\" The Associated Press ",

By John Sullivan , Jennifer Jenkins, Julie Tate , Shaun Courtney and Jordan Houston December 18 at 6:10 PM Follow @JohnSullivanAU Follow @JulieATate On a warm September evening in Columbus, Ohio, panicked witnesses called police to report that a group of boys had robbed a man at gunpoint and fled into a maze of alleys and fences on the city\u2019s east side. In the fading light, Officer Bryan Mason cornered two of the boys in an alley, where, according to police, 13-year-old Tyre King pulled a gun from his waistband. Mason fired three rounds, striking the teen in the head, chest and torso. The black gun police recovered at the scene looked like their own department-issued, polymer-framed Smith & Wesson Military and Police semiautomatic pistol. It even had a laser sight. But police would soon learn that King\u2019s weapon was a BB gun \u2014 a facsimile of the gun Mason used to shoot and kill the teen. At a news conference the next day, Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs waved a stock photograph of the BB gun. \u201cOur officers carry a gun that looks practically identical to this weapon,\u201d she said. \u201c. . . It looks like a firearm that could kill you.\u201d (Lee Powell/The Washington Post) Police across the country say that they are increasingly facing off against people with ultra-real-looking pellet guns, toy weapons and non-functioning replicas. Such encounters have led police to shoot and kill at least 86 people over the past two years, according to a Washington Post database of fatal police shootings nationwide. So far this year, police have fatally shot 43 people wielding the guns. In 2015, police also killed 43. The Post analysis is the first accounting of fatal police shootings involving people armed with air guns, toys or replicas, a phenomenon last studied in depth more than 25 years ago, when Congress first sought to address the problem of police shootings involving toy guns. The 86 shooting deaths are among the nearly 2,000 people shot and killed by police since 2015, which The Post is tracking, something no government agency does. Police recovered a wide variety of the weapons in the fatal shootings, but almost all had one thing in common: They were highly realistic copies of firearms. Of those, 53 were pneumatic BB or pellet guns that fire small-caliber metal balls or pellets. An additional 16 were Airsoft guns, which use compressed air cartridges to fire plastic BBs. Thirteen were replicas, two were toys, one was a starter pistol and one was a lighter. Experts who study the domestic market for pellet and Airsoft guns said consumer demand for replica firearms has grown. \u201cThey are red hot,\u201d said Tom Gaylord, an industry consultant who runs a popular blog for the Ohio-based Pyramyd Air, one of the largest air gun retailers in the country. Pyramyd Air declined to comment. Police say it is virtually impossible to train officers to identify imitation firearms from any distance. Short of eliminating the guns, police have little choice but to assume the guns are lethal. Efforts to stop production of the guns or radically alter their appearance have mostly failed because of resistance from gunmakers and gun rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about this 26 years later, and I\u2019m not sure anything has really changed except that tragic occurrences continue to happen,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, who runs the Police Executive Research Forum, a policing policy think tank that studied the issue in 1990 for Congress. \u201cA toy gun in a country with 300 million real guns is hard to distinguish.\u201d Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs holds up a photo of the type of BB gun that police say 13-year-old Tyre King pulled from his waistband just before he was fatally shot on Sept. 14, 2016. (Andrew Welsh-Huggins/Associated Press) The role of imitation firearms in fatal police encounters reemerged as a national issue in 2014, when Cleveland police fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was playing with a BB gun in a park. Police were responding to a call about a man with a gun outside a local recreation center. The shooting was among a spate of controversial and deadly encounters with police that helped galvanize the Black Lives Matter movement. Of the 86 fatal shootings involving imitation firearms since 2015, the most common theme was mental illness: 38 of those killed had a history of it, according to their families and police reports. Fourteen of the calls were domestic disturbances. Ten others began as robberies. The remaining circumstances range from patrolling neighborhoods to serving arrest warrants to making traffic stops. Of the people killed, 50 were white men. The oldest person killed was Robert Patrick Quinn, 77, who was fatally shot in Pittston, Pa., as he rode his motorized scooter outside an apartment complex while waving a realistic-looking pellet gun. Half of the shootings happened at night. In almost every case, police said the victims failed to comply with an officer\u2019s orders. In 60 cases, police said they pointed guns at officers. Among the dead are Ernesto Flores, a mentally distraught 52-year-old man who after a standoff with police in April 2015 stepped out of a pink stucco home in Montclair, Calif., holding a BB gun. Police opened fire, killing Flores in front of his family. One of only five women killed by police was 17-year-old Shelly Haendiges, who was shot in Kokomo, Ind., after police responded to a robbery call and found her pointing a pellet gun at a store clerk. Her family said she suffered from mental illness. Two of the most recent shootings happened in October in Elkton, Md., where police shot and killed Brandon Jones and Chelsea M. Porter, both 25 and of Dover, Del., after they pointed BB guns at police who were trying to arrest them. The BB gun recovered after police killed King, the Ohio teenager, was made by Umarex USA, one of the largest air gun and firearm manufacturers in the world and the self-proclaimed \u201cking of replicas.\u201d Umarex makes air guns under the Beretta, Colt, Smith & Wesson, HK, Ruger and Browning brands. It sells BB guns that are copies of such firearms as the iconic Colt Peacemaker, which was first produced in the 1870s, and the Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine, a mainstay of specialized military and police units. The Umarex 40XP BB gun that King allegedly brandished sells for about $50 in stores, including Walmart. Gunmaker Sig Sauer makes air guns that are advertised as \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of their most popular lethal firearms, including the P226 semiautomatic handgun. A commercial on the Sig Sauer website displayed the BB gun and the lethal P226 as reflections of each other in a mirror. Umarex USA and Sig Sauer did not return repeated calls seeking comment. Gun rights groups, including Gun Owners of America, based in Virginia, have lobbied against laws that seek to alter air guns to make them distinguishable from firearms. Michael E. Hammond, a legal adviser to the pro-gun group, said the alterations never seem to be enough for those who dislike guns. \u201cIt all arises out of this general animus and media-fed fear of anything that has to do with guns,\u201d Hammond said. The NRA declined to comment. In Ohio, where King and Rice were killed, the state does not regulate BB guns and also allows firearms to be openly carried. The day after Rice\u2019s death, black legislators in Ohio tried to regulate the guns, introducing a law requiring all BB and pellet guns sold in the state to have special markings or be brightly colored. The bill died in committee. Two years later, police shot King. \u201cWhy is it that a 13-year-old would have nearly an exact replica of a police firearm on him in our neighborhoods, an eighth-grader involved in very, very dangerous conduct in one of our neighborhoods?\u201d Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther (D) said at a news conference after the shooting. Safety on In the 1980s, a string of police shootings of children prompted Congress to pass the first and only federal regulations on toy guns. In 1983, 5-year-old Patrick Andrew Mason was alone in his Stanton, Calif., home when an officer who was called to the unit to do a welfare check mistook the boy with his red toy gun for a burglar; the boy was fatally shot while his single mother was away at work, according to news reports. In 1988, officers in San Francisco responding to a report of shots fired mistook a plastic toy gun for a .22-caliber pistol and shot a 13-year-old mentally disabled boy in the head, killing him. Parents began to push manufacturers to make the guns appear less realistic. Retailers such as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us stopped carrying realistic toy guns, and toy manufacturers began adding an orange plug to toy guns. After several states restricted the use of imitation firearms, Congress in 1988 passed a law requiring the bright orange barrel plug on all toy guns. The law applied to water guns, many replicas and Airsoft guns that fire nonmetallic projectiles, but it exempted BB, pellet guns and replicas of antique firearms. The law also mandated two studies on whether the new orange tips would prevent shootings. In one study, FBI recruits were confronted by assailants carrying firearms or guns with orange tips. The recruits had two seconds to decide whether to shoot. When faced with unmarked replica pistols or guns with orange tips, officers shot 95\u00a0percent of the time. \u201cIt is clear from this study that the orange plug marking system does not help police officers distinguish between toy guns and real guns,\u201d concluded the 1989 report , which was managed by the National Institute of Justice. The second study a year later reached the same conclusion, saying that police response when confronted with the guns was linked to environmental factors \u2014 such as what a police dispatcher tells an officer. Calls for service in a high-crime area, for example, might lead officers to consider \u201ca worst case scenario,\u201d said the report, overseen by the Police Executive Research Forum. But it was the behavior of the person holding the toy gun that mattered most. \u201cIf they are told there\u2019s a person with a gun acting in a threatening manner, that\u2019s what they respond to,\u201d said David L. Carter, a professor at Michigan State University who spoke to officers in 27 law enforcement agencies for the 1990 study. Last year, Congress revisited the issue when Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) introduced a bill that would force the country to enact a law similar to California\u2019s, which requires the entire surface of all toy and BB guns be painted a bright color. \u201cNo child should ever die because a police officer or anyone else mistakes a toy gun for a real weapon,\u201d Boxer said in a news release at the time. The bill stalled in committee. Twelve states and the District and Puerto Rico have banned the guns or imposed restrictions on their use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the District, realistic-looking toy or air-powered guns cannot be possessed in public. In 2012, D.C. police seized about 450 imitation guns, according to the most recent data available. Baltimore\u2019s City Council this month passed a similar ban, responding to an April shooting and wounding by police of a 14-year-old carrying a BB gun. In 2015, Boston outlawed imitation firearms in public. The law allows police to confiscate those guns, and they have seized 139 this year. Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans said if a facsimile gun has been used in a crime, police will charge a suspect with possession of a real gun. \u201cThey are the exact same unless you have it in your hand and take it apart,\u201d Evans said. Maurice Cardwell, Tyre King\u2019s father, wears a pin in remembrance of his son during an event on what would have been King\u2019s 14th birthday on Dec. 7. (Andrew Spear/For The Washington Post) \u2018Dangerous and unfair\u2019 In March in Gainesville, Fla., Alachua County sheriff\u2019s officers were called to a parking lot where they encountered 16-year-old Robert L. Dentmond, who was armed with what appeared to be an AR-15 assault rifle. Dentmond was a high school sophomore who had lived in foster care, according to police reports. His mother went to prison and his father physically abused him, the records show. He was on probation for burglary. One bright spot for Dentmond was Cayla Todd, his girlfriend of one month. But on the night of March 20, Todd said they fought online and that she ended the relationship. Dentmond sent her a Facebook message, which investigators later found. \u201cI\u2019m finna have the police shoot me,\u201d Dentmond wrote. At 10:07 p.m., Dentmond called police and said that he was at the Majestic Oaks Apartments with an M-16. When deputies and officers from the Gainesville Police Department arrived, they saw the 6-foot tall Dentmond, dressed in gray pajama pants and a blue jacket, in the middle of a dimly lit parking lot holding a gun. Crouching behind dumpsters and parked cars, police ordered him to drop the gun, according to police. \u201cDrop it now, or you will be shot!\u201d officers yelled. After 24 minutes, Dentmond leveled what looked to officers like an assault-type rifle and began walking. Nine officers opened fire and didn\u2019t stop until the gun fell from his hand. He died at a hospital. After the shooting, police saw Dentmond\u2019s weapon had broken in two, according to a state report. When picking up the pieces, an officer noticed that their weight \u201cdid not feel right\u201d and they seemed to be plastic. Officers did not learn until the next morning that Dentmond\u2019s gun was a toy, an Airsoft rifle with the orange tip removed. \u201cSome of them broke down in tears,\u201d Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a high-five situation. It\u2019s a devastating career-long and lifelong impact.\u201d Grant McDougall, the psychotherapist who evaluated the deputies after the shooting, said they all wished that they could go back and change the outcome. \u201cEvery single one of them \u2014 some of them very graphically \u2014 grieved the loss, even if they would sit here and tell me they did the right thing,\u201d McDougall told The Post. A grand jury investigating the shooting cleared the officers and suggested that the state ban imitation firearms. \u201cIt is dangerous and unfair to all for law enforcement to confront a situation where to all appearances a real weapon is involved, only to be subjected to intense second-guessing after the fact when that turns out not to have been so,\u201d the jury said. Dentmond\u2019s family could not be reached for comment. Todd told The Post that police could have done more. \u201cHe was only 16 years old. He didn\u2019t need to die,\u201d she said. Three months later, it almost happened again. In June, Alachua County deputies got a call that two groups of young men were driving around with AK-47s. The department sent every available unit, and they quickly came upon a black Honda Civic and a black Toyota Camry. Men wearing werewolf masks were hanging out the cars\u2019 sunroofs waving what appeared to be Heckler & Koch MP5 machine guns, according to Darnell and records. Police disarmed the men. The guns were plastic toys, and the gunmen, university students were making a movie for a film contest. \u201cThis is what those of us in law enforcement are so concerned about,\u201d Darnell said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s real or what\u2019s not, so part of the solution is to ban the sale of toy or replica guns.\u201d Demonstrators hold a rally for Tyre King outside city hall in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 19, 2016. (John Minchillo/Associated Press) \u2018Oh, he\u2019s shooting them\u2019 In Columbus, Ohio, Chief Kim Jacobs has spent the past few months explaining to outraged community members why one of her veteran police officers fatally shot a 13-year-old carrying a BB gun. She wants people to understand how a mix of panicked reports of armed mayhem and a real-looking gun can turn deadly. Complicating the matter is that the officer, Bryan Mason, had been involved in three shootings since 2009, one of them fatal. In 2012, Mason shot and killed a man who was pointing a firearm at another person. In all cases, Mason\u2019s use of force was ruled justified by the department. Jacobs said Mason would not be allowed to comment until the conclusion of the investigation. Jacobs said the shooting has taken its toll on everyone, including Mason. \u201cYou go to work and you do your job, and then all of the sudden you\u2019re under criminal investigation,\u201d Jacobs said. King\u2019s family has no sympathy for Mason. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody held accountable,\u201d said his father, Maurice Cardwell. \u201cThere\u2019s no wrongdoing over there it seems. And you\u2019re killing kids?\u201d Sept. 14 started out like most days for Tyre King. His parents described him as an astute child who worked selling candy, cutting grass and trimming hedges. After King returned from school that day, he finished his homework and left his house. At 7:42 p.m. witnesses called 911 to report a robbery. The callers said a gunman wearing a hoodie and baggy pants fled the scene. The robbery victim came on the line and told dispatchers, \u201cI\u2019m not going to mess with it over $10.\u201d Another witness said seven or eight armed men were running away with police chasing them. \u201cOh, he\u2019s shooting them. Oh my God,\u201d a caller said, apparently describing police shooting King. Chanda L. Brown, an attorney for the family, said they had serious doubts that King was involved in the robbery and that he did not own a BB gun. Police have not disclosed the source of the gun. Brown said that she believes King was shot running away, not pulling a gun. The only person charged in the robbery is Demetrius E. Braxton, 19. His attorney, Lodema M\u2019Poco, told The Post last week that Braxton admits he used the gun to commit the robbery while King and others waited nearby. M\u2019Poco said Braxton then passed the gun to King, who put the weapon in his pants. Braxton said that after police ordered him and King to the ground, King ran and Mason shot him. M\u2019Poco said Braxton did not see King pull the BB gun from his pants. Braxton pleaded guilty last month to felony robbery charges. In court he described the episode as a \u201clapse in judgment. As the oldest, I should have been the one to tell everybody, \u2018Let\u2019s not do this,\u2019 \u201d the Columbus Dispatch reported. Brown, the King family\u2019s attorney, said police failed to train officers how to deal with children with BB guns. \u201cAnyone that takes the blame and puts it on a 13-year-old instead of an officer that\u2019s been trained \u2014 or should be trained \u2014 in how to evaluate and respond to situations like this, I think they\u2019re missing the bigger picture here,\u201d Brown said. \u201cShooting should be the last resort.\u201d For Jacobs and other officers, they seldom have the benefit of weighing all the evidence and making a decision. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand the dynamics of a police-involved situation, how fast they occur,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThey all have families, they want to go home at the end of their shift.\u201d Lee Powell, Teaganne Finn, Josephine Peterson and Taylor Hartz contributed to this report.

    "text": "Activists take to the streets to protest Donald Trump ahead of electoral college vote Anti-Trump demonstration Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times Hundreds of activists marched through the streets of downtown Los Angeles to protest against President-elect Donald Trump. Hundreds of activists marched through the streets of downtown Los Angeles to protest against President-elect Donald Trump. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) Javier Panzar A coalition of activist groups on Sunday took to the streets of downtown Los Angeles to protest against some of the labor and immigration policies proposed by President-elect Donald Trump , a day before he is expected to officially claim victory in the nation\u2019s presidential contest. On Monday, 538 presidential electors from across the country will convene in their respective states to cast their votes and finalize the results of the Nov. 8 election. Trump, who only needs 270 electoral votes, is expected to collect 306 votes as pledged by members of the electoral college. Electors are chosen by the voters from party slates and are expected to support the party nominee. Although constitutional scholars agree that electors are free under the U.S. Constitution to cast their votes as they please, 29 states and the District of Columbia have statutes that seek to bind electors, sometimes with threats of fines or criminal penalties. But many Hillary Clinton supporters point out that she won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and are urging electors to block path Trump\u2019s path to the White House. While that is unlikely, they said they want to send a message of defiance over some of Trump\u2019s proposed policies, including a crackdown on illegal immigration. Hundreds of activists from groups and unions that fight for the rights of Muslims, Jews, immigrants in the country illegally\u00a0and the LGBT community marched through the streets of downtown Sunday, which is recognized by the United Nations as International Migrants Day . Many carried signs that said, \u201cStop Trump,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a Criminal, I pay Taxes,\u201d and \u201cFearless, United.\u201d Updates on California politics \u00bb \u201cToday is about protecting our communities, especially our immigrant community,\u201d said David Huerta, the president of SEIU United Service Workers West, a union that represents janitors, security officers and other service workers. The fear is real for Stephanie Temix, a 21-year-old immigrant from Mexico in the U.S. illegally, who is studying sociology at Cal State Northridge. She worries her family could be targeted for deportation if Trump follows through on his campaign promises calling for tougher immigration policies. \u201cWe need to show that we are people and our rights matter,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are fighting for our future and rights.\u201d Joe Salas, a board member of the Islamic Center of Claremont, said he wanted people outside of California to know the state\u2019s activists were ready to mobilize.\u00a0 \u201cWe will stand up against discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will go anywhere and help anyone being discriminated against.\u201d The march paused outside Grand Central Market, where Father Greg Boyle stood on the back of a truck and promised the immigrants in the crowd, \u201cwe will make sure that you are safe.\u201d California state Senate leader\u00a0Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who has been a vocal critic of Trump , vowed to protect the rights of immigrants and said California would be a \u201cbeacon of hope for the rest of America.\u201d A group calling itself the Hamilton Electors will hold a candlelight vigil at City Hall at 6 p.m. to encourage members of the electoral college to vote their conscience when they cast their votes for president on Monday.

    "text": "<p>Al Karak castle in Jordan, in a 2010 photo</p> Close Wikimedia Commons AMMAN, Jordan -\u00a0Gunmen carried out a series of attacks in central Jordan on Sunday, including at a Crusader castle popular with tourists, killing a total of nine people, including a female tourist from Canada, and wounded 27 more, officials said. At least four members of the Jordanian security forces have been killed in the attacks that seemed to primarily target police officers. A standoff between Jordanian special forces and armed men holed up inside the castle continued after nightfall Sunday, several hours after the first shooting. Government officials declined comment on local news reports saying the attackers were holding hostages. Compared to many of its neighbors, Jordan has enjoyed relative peace since the Arab Spring,\u00a0 the Syrian civil war , and the rise of the\u00a0 Islamic State of Iraq and Syria . However, Sunday\u2019s shootings were the latest in a series of attacks that have challenged the pro-Western kingdom\u2019s claim to be an oasis of calm in a region threatened by Islamic extremists.\u00a0 There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in and near the town of Karak. The chain of events began when a police patrol received reports of a house fire in the town of Qatraneh in the Karak district, said a statement by Jordan\u2019s Public Security Directorate. The officers responding to the call came under fire from inside the house, the statement said. Two policemen were wounded and the assailants fled in a car, it said. In another attack, gunmen fired on a security patrol in Karak, causing no injuries, the statement said. Armed men also opened fire on a police station in Karak Castle, a Crusader-era fort, wounding members of the security forces. The statement said five or six gunmen were believed to be holed up inside the castle.\u00a0 The Jordan tourism board\u00a0 describes \u00a0Karak as \u201ca fortress since biblical times. The Bible relates how the King of Israel and his allies from Judah and Edom ravaged Moab and besieged its king Mesha in the fortress of Kir Heres, as Karak was then known.\u201d \u00a0 In all, four members of the security forces and a female tourist from Canada were killed in the shootings, though it was not clear if all five were killed at the castle. Jordan faces homegrown extremism, with hundreds of Jordanians fighting alongside other ISIS militants and several thousand more supporting the extremist group in the kingdom. Jordan is a key U.S. ally, and a member of a U.S.-led military coalition fighting ISIS. Over the past year, gunmen have carried out several attacks on members of the Jordanian security forces and foreign trainers. Earlier this year, Jordanian security forces engaged in a deadly shootout with suspected ISIS sympathizers in a northern Jordanian town. Last month, three American soldiers were killed \u00a0in a shooting attack while working for the CIA in Jordan training Syrian rebels. The three came under fire while driving into the base. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "21 Photos This file image released on Thursday, Dec. 15, 2016 by Aleppo 24, shows residents gathered near green government buses as they hold their belongings for evacuation from eastern Aleppo, Syria.&nbsp; AP BEIRUT -- France struck a compromise Sunday with Russia on a U.N. resolution that it said would prevent \u201cmass atrocities\u201d in besieged areas of Aleppo, where thousands of trapped civilians and rebel fighters await evacuation in freezing temperatures. On the ground, prospects for swift evacuations from Aleppo and other besieged areas were thrown into doubt again Sunday after militants burned buses assigned to the rescue operation that has taken center stage in the five-year-old Syrian civil war . The Aleppo evacuations were to have been part of a wider deal that would simultaneously allow more than 2,000 sick and wounded people to leave two pro-government villages that have been besieged by Syrian rebels. Most villagers are Shiite Muslims, while most rebels are Sunni Muslims.\u00a0 White Helmets give hope to Syrians seeking refuge from bombardment Six buses that were among those poised to enter the villages of Foua and Kfarya on Sunday were set on fire by unidentified militants, presumably to scuttle any deal. A video posted online showed armed men near the burning buses as celebratory gunshots rang out. \u201cThe buses that came to evacuate the apostates have been burned,\u201d the narrator of the video said. He warned that no \u201cShiite pigs\u201d would be allowed to leave the towns. The video could not be verified independently, but was in line with AP reporting from the area. Earlier Sunday, pro-Syrian government TV stations showed dozens of buses on stand-by at a crossing near eastern Aleppo, reportedly poised to resume evacuations from the opposition\u2019s last foothold in the city. The evacuations had been suspended two days earlier amid mutual recriminations after several thousand people had been ferried out of the war zone. Thousands more desperate civilians are believed trapped in the city. About 2,700 children were evacuated in the first rescue mission earlier this week, but hundreds more \u201care now waiting in freezing temperatures, close to the front lines,\u201d said Shushan Mebrahtu of the U.N. agency for children, UNICEF. \u201cWe are deeply worried.\u201d Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher and Aleppo resident, said he went to an evacuation point on Sunday afternoon and found buses with evacuees on board, but that the vehicles did not move. The opposition\u2019s Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said the buses hadn\u2019t left the city. A bus convoy with Aleppo evacuees was stuck for hours in a buffer zone between the front lines in the city, without food or water, according to aid officials familiar with the negotiations between the two sides. Eastern Aleppo resident Rami Zien, who said he was on one of the buses \u201cstuck in a no-man\u2019s land\u201d between government and rebel control, told The Associated Press via messenger service that evacuees were stressed and frightened. \u201cGovernment forces are just ahead of me and if anything goes wrong I\u2019ll be the first to die,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0 21 Photos Aleppo: Before and after Zien said evacuees were crammed 70 people to a bus, with many having no room to sit. He said the Red Crescent, which is facilitating the evacuation, had been unable to provide water. He said there were 50 to 60 buses in the convoy. On Friday, a bus convoy carrying evacuees was stuck in government territory in Aleppo and was turned back after being searched. The continued suspension of evacuations is throwing into disarray an Aleppo deal that had been brokered last week by Syria ally Russia and opposition supporter Turkey. The deal marked a turning point in the country\u2019s civil war. With the opposition leaving Aleppo, Syrian President Bashar Assad has effectively reasserted his control over Syria\u2019s five largest cities and its Mediterranean coast nearly six years after a national movement to unseat him took hold.\u00a0 After hours of negotiation between Russia, the U.S. and France on Sunday, the U.N. Security Council forged a compromise which, if approved, will allow the U.N. to send monitors to oversee the evacuation of civilians and fighters and ensure their protection if they decide to stay in war-torn Aleppo. The Council decided to hold the vote on the measure for Monday morning, to allow member states time to consult with their capitals on the details of the deal. If the compromise vote passes on Monday, there are still hurdles for civilians trying to escape the dire conditions in what was the city\u2019s last rebel enclave, in eastern Aleppo, but CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk reports it would at least illustrate some level of compromise between Moscow, Washington, and Paris over how to protect civilians in Syria. \u00a0 View Gallery People warm themselves around a fire while waiting to be evacuated from a rebel-held sector of eastern Aleppo, Syria on Dec.17, 2016. REUTERS/Abdalrhman Ismail France\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Francois Delattre, told reporters the compromise was reached after more than three hours of closed consultations on Sunday and the Security Council would vote on the resolution at 9 a.m. EST on Monday. He said some countries want to report to their capitals overnight. He said he hoped for a positive vote, but that he remained cautious. Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, told reporters before consultations that Moscow could not accept the French draft resolution unless it was changed. He presented council members with a rival text. After the consultations, Churkin said a \u201cgood text\u201d had been formulated.\u00a0 The compromise resolution, which CBS News has seen, asks the Secretary General to take urgent steps to make security arrangements in consultation with interested parties for the evacuations and for the \u201csafe, immediate and unimpeded access\u00a0 of U.N. monitors.\u201d It \u201cdemands that all parties allow complete, immediate, unconditional, safe and unhindered access for the United Nations and its implementing partners, in order to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches people through the most direct route in order to meet basic needs, including the provision of medical care... for the whole of Syria and respect and protect all civilians across Aleppo and throughout Syria.\u201d Delattre said approval of the resolution \u201cwould give us collectively the tools to avoid... a situation in which, after the end of major military operations, forces including militias, would commit mass atrocities.\u201d He said the resolution could also offer leverage to negotiate a broader cease-fire \u201cand toward political negotiations.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Bipartisan Letter Seeks Single Inquiry Into Russian Hacking Claims By NICHOLAS FANDOS \u25a0 Four senators, including Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham, called for a select committee to investigate Russian hacking of the American election process. \u25a0 Robert Gates said the Russian hacking was designed to hurt Hillary Clinton. \u25a0 John Podesta said the F.B.I. had contacted him only once about the hacking of his emails. \u25a0 President-elect Donald J. Trump has defied many conventions. But he will keep one: staying at Blair House. Photo Senator John McCain in Washington early this month. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Bipartisan group of Senators says Russian hack should \u2018alarm every American.\u2019 A bipartisan group of senators on Sunday urged Senator Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky and majority leader, to create a new, select committee on cyberattacks to investigate possible Russian interference in the American election. \u201cRecent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter released on Sunday. \u201cCybersecurity is the ultimate cross-jurisdictional challenge, and we must take a comprehensive approach to meet this challenge effectively.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story They recommended that the select committee undertake a \u201ccomprehensive investigation of Russian interference\u201d and develop \u201ccomprehensive recommendations and, as necessary, new legislation to modernize our nation\u2019s laws, governmental organization, and related practices to meet this challenge.\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the armed services committee, signed the letter, along with fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and minority leader; and Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who also serves on Mr. McCain\u2019s committee. They had previously warned that any congressional investigation into the hacks \u201ccannot become a partisan issue.\u201d Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

You are already subscribed to this email. Privacy Policy Their call is at odds with Mr. McConnell, who has said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is \u201cmore than capable of conducting a complete review\u201d of the interference without the creation of a select committee. As majority leader, Mr. McConnell has the power to decide whether to form a new committee. The view is also starkly at odds with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has repeatedly rejected the conclusions of American intelligence reports, saying they are politically motivated. Gates says Russian hack was a covert operation to discredit the U.S. election. Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense under President Obama and President George W. Bush, said on Sunday that Russian cyberattacks were aimed at discrediting the American electoral process and \u201ccertainly at weakening\u201d Hillary Clinton. \u201cWhether it or not it was intended to help one another candidate, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Gates, who also served as C.I.A. director under President Bush. \u201cBut I think it clearly was aimed at discrediting our elections, and I think it was aimed certainly at weakening Mrs. Clinton. Speaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d he stopped short of saying the meddling was intended to help Mr. Trump, and said the best course of action to respond to the cyberattacks was unclear. Asked why Mr. Trump appeared not to be taking the allegations against Russia seriously, Mr. Gates speculated that the president-elect \u201cfelt the way this information came out through newspaper stories and so on was somehow intended to delegitimize his victory in the election and that he\u2019s reacting to that rather than \u2018the facts on the ground,\u2019 as it were.\u201d Advertisement Mr. Trump has chosen to receive intelligence briefs only occasionally. Podesta said the F.B.I. contacted him only once. Few people were as directly affected by the hacking as John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. But on Sunday he suggested that there was hardly a zealous effort by the F.B.I. to investigate, adding that the only time he had been contacted by federal agents was two days after his hacked personal emails began appearing on WikiLeaks. Mr. Podesta said he had believed that some of the documents related to the Democratic National Committee published by WikiLeaks last summer could have come from his account. But he only became certain that his account had been fully compromised when WikiLeaks began publishing its contents on Oct. 7. \u201cTwo days later, the F.B.I. contacted me, and the first thing the agent said to me was, \u2018I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware, but your email account might have been hacked,\u2019\u201d Mr. Podesta said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, I was aware of that,\u2019\u201d he added. Trump will stand by custom and stay at Blair House. Mr. Trump will spend his last nights before his inauguration at Blair House after all, keeping alive a tradition that started with President Jimmy Carter four decades ago, a top aide said on Saturday. Mr. Trump had been considering a stay at his newly opened Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House. But his transition communications director, Jason Miller, said in a Twitter post reacting to a New York Times article late Saturday night that Mr. Trump would follow conventional practice. Not accurate. The President-elect is staying at Blair House. https://t.co/LhhyozXSBB \u2014         Jason Miller (@JasonMillerinDC) Dec. 18, 2016 Known as \u201cthe president\u2019s guesthouse,\u201d Blair House is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House and normally plays host to visiting heads of state and other dignitaries. Every few years, though, it becomes the pre-inaugural headquarters for the incoming president and first family during the festivities that accompany the formal oath of office. Mr. Trump and his entourage should have plenty of space to spread out. The complex has 14 bedrooms and 35 bathrooms across 70,000 square feet. ",

She was 99. Gabor's husband, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Prinz von Anhalt, confirmed her death to NBC News. Hungarian actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. Keystone/Getty Images \"She had a heart attack in her house,\" von Anhalt said. \"They tried to save her. She was still breathing when they got here, but we ended up losing her. I am grateful that she died with no pain.\" Gabor, who was born Sari Gabor in Budapest in 1917, studied at a Swiss boarding school, was crowned Miss Hungary in 1936 and sang and acted in Europe in the 1930s before landing in Hollywood, joining her almost equally famous sister Eva Gabor. Her first breakout film was 1952's \"Moulin Rouge,\" which was nominated for seven Oscars \u2014 although Gabor's role as singer Jane Avril was not one of them. In 1958, she starred as a stripclub owner alongside Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Marlene Dietrich and Orson Welles in Welles' gritty noir classic, \"Touch of Evil.\" By the 1960s, as Gabor became a regular on the celebrity talk show circuit, she was also a constant on television shows. Among Gabor's nine husbands was the hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, whom she married in 1942 and divorced in 1947. Their daughter, Francesca Hilton, died last year at age 67 of a stroke. In 1989, Gabor was arrested for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer who'd stopped her for a traffic violation. She claimed that he'd sworn at her, although she spent three days behind bars for the crime \u2014 and which she later parodied in \"Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear.\" Tim Stelloh ",

(Photo: Albin Lohr-Jones / POOL, EPA) A string of tweets put out by serial tech entrepreneur Elon Musk on Saturday hints that his entrepreneurial future may be a little \"boring.\" The Tesla and SpaceX founder got on Twitter on Saturday morning to rant about an issue he seems to find irksome \u2013 traffic. Musk, who has commented in the past about his issues with transportation infrastructure in the U.S., sent out these posts: Tesla founder Elon Musk sent out a string of tweets Saturday morning, Dec. 17, 2016,  hinting that he plans to start up a new venture to deal with traffic issues using tunneling. He wants to name the company Boring. \u00a0(Photo: USA TODAY) Musk has also been working on resolving his frustration with traffic issues through above-ground means with his Hyperloop venture, which proposes a plan for mass-transit pods moving through above-ground tubes. But that doesn't appear to be enough, commenting:\u00a0\u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging\u2026\u201d He even offered up a name for the venture, calling it \"The Boring Company,\" and began branding it with a slogan: \"Boring, it's what we do.\" Then capped it off by tweeting, \"I am actually going to do this.\" With the tweets, Musk\u2019s Twitter bio got an update, too. It\u00a0now lists his presumed priorities as \"Tesla, SpaceX, Tunnels (yes, tunnels) & OpenAI.\" The executive may have been taking cues from President-elect Donald Trump, who commented during his election campaign about the need for infrastructure rebuilding.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump said first lady Michelle Obama \"must have been talking about the past\" when she said there's no sense of hope after his election. Trump, speaking Saturday at the final rally of his postelection \"thank you\" tour, then resisted escalating the spat further, suggesting \"she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out.\" But as Trump praised the Obamas for treating him so nicely when he visited the White House shortly after the election, many in the Mobile, Alabama, crowd booed the first family. Michelle Obama, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey set to air Monday on CBS, said she was now certain that her husband's victory had inspired people because \"now we're feeling what not having hope feels like.\" \"What do you give your kids if you can't give them hope?\" she added. Trump's comments about Michelle and President Barack Obama was one of the few conciliatory notes he sounded during a victory tour in which he showed few signs of turning the page from his blustery campaign to focus on uniting a divided nation a month before his inauguration. At each stop, the Republican gloatingly recapped his election night triumph, reignited some old political feuds while starting some new ones, and did little to quiet the hate-filled chants of \"Lock her up!\" directed at Democratic rival Hillary Clinton . At the tour's finale at the same football stadium in Mobile that hosted the biggest rally of his campaign, Trump saluted his supporters as true \"patriots\" and made little attempt to reach out to the more than half of the electorate that didn't vote for him. \"We are really the people who love this country,\" said Trump. He reminisced about his campaign announcement and his ride down Trump Tower's golden escalator. His disputed a newspaper's account of the size of the crowd at one of his rallies and bashed the press as dishonest. And he joked that he had booked a small ballroom for his election night party so, if he lost, he \"could get out!\" He paid homage to the August 2015 rally in the same stadium that he said jump-started his campaign. Though the crowd was not as large on Saturday, it was no less fervid, repeatedly chanting \"Build the wall!\" when Trump renewed his vow to build an impenetrable border at the Mexican border. Trump brought his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, up onstage to receive cheers from his hometown crowd. When Trump's plane landed, he received a water cannon salute from a pair of fire trucks and was greeted by several Azalea Trail Maids, local women dressed in antebellum Southern Belle outfits. The raucous rallies, a hallmark of his campaign, are meant to salute supporters who lifted him to the presidency. But these appearances also have been his primary form of communication since the Nov. 8 election. Trump has eschewed the traditional news conference held by a president-elect within days of winning. He's done few interviews, announced his Cabinet picks via news release and continues to rely on Twitter to broadcast his thoughts and make public pronouncements. That continued Saturday morning when Trump turned to social media to weigh in on China's seizure of a U.S. Navy research drone from international waters, misspelling \"unprecedented\" when he wrote \"China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act.\" He later corrected the tweet. China said Saturday it intended to return the drone to the U.S. Within days of beating Clinton, Trump suggested to aides that he resume his campaign-style barnstorming. Though he agreed to hold off until he assembled part of his Cabinet, Trump has repeatedly spoken of his fondness for being on the road. Aides are considering more rallies after he takes office, to help press his agenda with the public \u2014 a possibility that Trump embraced from the stage Saturday. But Trump has also sounded some notes of unity on the tour. In Mobile, he acknowledged that \"now the hard work begins\" and ended with a plea for all Americans, including those who did not support him, to \"never give up.\" After the rally, Trump planned to return to Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. Aides said the president-elect probably would spend Christmas week there and could stay until New Year's. Earlier Saturday, he announced the nomination of South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Management and Budget, choosing a tea partyer and fiscal conservative with no experience assembling a government spending plan. Mulvaney, a founder of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, has taken a hard line on budget matters, routinely voting against increasing the government's borrowing cap and pressing for major cuts to benefit programs as the path to balancing the budget. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire 0 Shares ",

The ban was been gradually eased and city officials expect the results of EPA tests on Sunday to determine it can be fully lifted. (AP Photo/Frank Bajak) 0 Shares A nearly four-day ban on drinking the water in Corpus Christi, Texas , was lifted on Sunday after test results showed no contamination due to a chemical leak, the city's mayor announced. Mayor Dan McQueen said residents could resume using the city's water supply for drinking, bathing and cooking. \"It is all full use but we are going to continue to monitor as we go on,\" McQueen said. None of the 28 drinking water samples the Environmental Protection Agency reviewed tested positive for Indulin AA-86, an asphalt-emulsifying agent that's corrosive, the federal agency said Sunday in a statement. Indulin can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. The water ban had been issued late Wednesday out of concern that a chemical leak at an asphalt plant could have contaminated the city's water supply. The EPA said there have been seven \"unconfirmed\" reports of symptoms possibly related to prohibited water use. The federal agency, along with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, will continue collecting and testing water samples over the next few days. Officials in Corpus Christi began on Sunday to dismantle distribution centers that had been set up to give water to residents, said City Manager Margie Rose. The mayor cautioned residents to be conservative in their water use to avoid overtaxing the system after water tanks were flushed in parts of the city, which has about 300,000 residents and is located along the Texas Gulf Coast. On Saturday, city officials had said that there had been three reports of dirty water before the ban had been issued. McQueen said officials will continue investigating the leak at the asphalt plant and seek possible damages from those responsible. 0 Shares ",

One year earlier, 53,000 people died of alcohol poisoning in Russia, reaching epidemic proportions.</p> Close HECTOR MATA/AFP/Getty Images MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s top investigative agency says that at least eight people have died of alcohol poisoning in a Siberian city. The Investigative Committee said Sunday that at least 18 people had got poisoned after consuming a bath lotion containing alcohol in Irkutsk, Russia\u2019s sixth-largest city with a population of 1.1 million. Eight of them have died and the 10 others have been hospitalized in grave condition. The committee said that the bottles with lotion were marked with warnings that they aren\u2019t for internal use. It said the investigators have opened a probe into the incident. Poisonings with surrogate alcohol are a regular occurrence in Russia, but the Irkutsk case was one of the deadliest such incidents in years. In 2014, a study of more than 150,000 Russians found men who drank three or more bottles of vodka per week were about twice as likely to die prematurely than men who drank less than a bottle per week. \u00a0\u00a0 That might explain why 25 percent of Russian men die before the age of 55, compared to about 7 percent of men in the U.K., according to the British researchers behind the study. \u201cSince the average life expectancy from birth for men in Russia is still only 64 years, ranking among the lowest 50 countries in the world, more effective alcohol and tobacco policy measures are urgently needed,\u201d Dr J\u00fcrgen Rehm, director of social and epidemiological research at the Centre for Addition and Mental Health in Toronto, said in a\u00a0 statement . \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Farrakhan Sees a New Opening for Black Separatist Message By sophia tareen and rachel zoll, associated press CHICAGO \u0097 Dec 18, 2016, 1:51 PM ET 0 Shares Minister Louis Farrakhan speaks at Fellowship Chapel, Aug. 25, 2015 in Detroit, Michigan. 0 Shares Email Minister Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam, spoke from a podium draped in the red, black and green of the Pan-African flag, a symbol of black pride. It was the week after Donald Trump won the presidency. The result had delighted a new generation of white supremacists, and Farrakhan was analyzing the political landscape. In a speech before the State of the Black World Conference in New Jersey , he warned, \"The white man is going to push. He's putting in place the very thing that will limit the freedom of others.\" Then he pointed to the crowd, smiled and said, \"That's what you needed,\" as motivation to finally separate from whites. \"My message to Mr. Trump: Push it real good,\" Farrakhan said, building to a roar that drew applause and cheers. \"Push it so good that black people say, 'I'm outta here. I can't take it no more.'\" After a presidential campaign that emboldened white identity politics, the Nation of Islam, a black separatist religious movement, is positioning itself as newly relevant. Some watchdogs who monitor Farrakhan say his latest appeal is a desperate grasp at significance for a group far from its heyday. However, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism, has found black separatism growing alongside white supremacy, creating a more favorable environment for the Nation's teachings. \"Racial nationalism of all kinds is on the rise,\" said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Theresa X, an alcohol and drug counselor from Northern California, said after this \"vicious\" election, she hoped others, including her Mexican American relatives, would follow her into the Nation of Islam, which she joined in the 1980s. \"I think they should,\" she said in a phone interview. \"They're afraid.\" The Nation has been largely closed off to outsiders, making it impossible even for those who follow the movement closely to gauge its strength. Neither Farrakhan nor the head minister of the movement's Mosque Maryam in Chicago, Ishmael Muhammad, responded to interview requests. Still, Farrakhan and his message of black empowerment clearly have an ongoing impact. The Million Man March he organized in 1995, drawing hundreds of thousands to Washington, remains a cultural touchstone, and hip-hop artists praise him in their music. The Nation has an extensive prison ministry, along with health and social service programs, and the movement's militia, the Fruit of Islam, provides security at public housing and elsewhere. That name recognition and high level of organization has left the Nation well situated to take advantage of the current political moment, including the emergence of Black Lives Matter protests over police shootings of black men. \"We have to turn to each other,\" said Nation member Duane Muhammad, 63, a Chicago-area elected official who helps produce videos of Farrakhan. In Chicago, Nation members stood between police and marchers at a post-Thanksgiving protest last year over the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a white police officer. Marchers blocked traffic and store entrances along the Magnificent Mile shopping district, and Nation members \"formed a line and made sure we were OK,\" said Ja'Mal Green, a Chicago activist. Zain Abdullah, a Temple University professor who specializes in Islamic studies, noted the Nation first gained national prominence in 1957 following their stunningly disciplined Harlem protest after police beat Nation member Johnson Hinton. \"Before that, the membership was a couple of hundred. After that, people were coming to the temple to listen and join,\" Abdullah said. Online, the Nation's presence has grown. Sunday services from Mosque Maryam are streamed live. Farrakhan's public speeches and sermons are on YouTube. He has more than 637,000 followers on Facebook and 462,000 on Twitter. Mikal Nash, a professor at Essex County College in Newark and author of \"Muslims in Newark, New Jersey: A Social History,\" said he has noticed increasing interest in \"the voice of people like Minister Farrakhan much the same way there's been an interest in the voice of Donald Trump.\" During the campaign, Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists, advocated policies that put Muslims under general suspicion and drew an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan . The president-elect has been criticized for being slow to condemn white supremacists. \"I think people are attracted to those voices as a result of a racially polarized society,\" Nash said. \"This election, you could see the whole issue of race arose more than any election in my lifetime.\" During the campaign, Farrakhan sent mixed signals about Trump, indicating the minister saw some reflection of his worldview in the candidate's rhetoric, including the Republican's talk of a \"global power structure\" that has rigged the economy. Farrakhan has long promoted conspiracy theories, blaming Israel and Jews for the Sept. 11 attacks, and accusing Jews of controlling the American government. In an extensive interview last January with Alex Jones of InfoWars, a conservative website that traffics in conspiracy theories, Farrakhan described Trump as a \"businessman par excellence\" and agreed with Trump's proposal to more strongly vet refugees from Muslim countries, pointing to the resentment generated by American policies in the Muslim world. \"The hatred for America is in the streets now,\" Farrakhan told Jones. \"Now, if you let them in and you don't vet them carefully, you might be letting in your own destruction.\" During a February address on Saviours' Day, an annual event commemorating the movement's founder, Farrakhan praised Trump for confronting Republican establishment candidates like Jeb Bush . \"Not that I'm for Trump, but I like what I'm looking at, because I know by Allah's grace where it's leading,\" Farrakhan said. Then, he noted that Trump had previously told some Jewish leaders he didn't need their donations for his campaign. A couple of months earlier, Trump had said to the Republican Jewish Coalition, \"You're not going to support me because I don't want your money,\" and \"You want to control your own politician.\" Farrakhan said in his sermon, \"Anytime a man can say to those who control the politics of America, 'I don't want your money,' that means if I don't take your money, you can't control me. And they cannot afford to give up control of the presidents of the United States.\" For longtime Nation watchers, the praise held an echo of the 1960s, when then Nation leader Elijah Muhammad tried to make common cause with the American Nazi Party over their desire for whites and blacks to live separately. Abdullah said he'd be surprised if the Nation membership increased significantly in the age of Trump, mainly because the movement demands so much from its followers, including a strict diet, several daily prayers and extensive study of the movement's beliefs. Still, Abdullah said conditions are ripe for spreading the minister's views. While the Nation shares some practices of mainstream Islam, the movement, which started in 1930s Detroit, deviates from the orthodox faith in significant ways, including on race. Mainstream Islam teaches the unity of all believers no matter their ethnicity. \"Because of the failure of integration, I think we're finding that people are attracted to, out of their frustration, Farrakhan's message. It often speaks to self-determination and black uplift,\" Abdullah said. \"Middle class blacks are finding they don't have the kind of integration or gains they expected because of civil rights gains. Black college students are actually now realizing that education is not going to protect you from police brutality. Farrakhan becomes appealing to people because of this.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll reported from New York. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to fix the capitalization of Laquan McDonald's first name. 0 Shares ",

In an interview that aired on CBS Friday , Mrs. Obama told Oprah Winfrey \"now we're feeling what not having hope feels like.\" She did not mention Trump's name explicitly. \"I assume she was talking about the past not the future cause I'm telling you, we have tremendous hope and we have tremendous promise and tremendous potential,\" Trump said Saturday. The crowd booed at the mention of Mrs. Obama. Trump's comments were a contrast for the president elect, who was known on the campaign trail for swift and biting rebukes of those who spoke ill of him, even in veiled language. \"I met with President Obama and Michelle Obama in the White House. My wife was there. She could not have been nicer,\" Trump said. \"I honestly believe she meant that statement in a different way than it came out.\" Trump's multi-stop, multi-week victory tour came to an end in a familiar stadium Saturday, a place that once housed his biggest rally of the campaign.

But also notable about the episode is the return of cast member Kate McKinnon's Hillary Clinton in a sketch later in the show, inspired by the 2003 romantic comedy \"Love Actually.\" But instead of actor Andrew Lincoln holding cue cards that express his love for co-star Keira Knightley, McKinnon's Clinton arrives on the doorstep of an elector (Cecily Strong) and holds up a series of cue cards aimed at getting the elector to not vote for Trump. The cue cards read, \"I know you're an elector,\" \"And on December 19th...,\" \"You're supposed to vote for Donald Trump,\" \"But Bish...,\" \"He cray,\" \"1. He's refusing security briefings,\" \"2. He's already provoked the Chinese,\" followed by additional cue cards hammering home her point. Hillary Clinton still hasn't given up. #SNL pic.twitter.com/0OtUtwGf7n \u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) December 18, 2016 The cold open begins with Baldwin's Trump and \"SNL\" cast member Kate McKinnon's Kellyanne Conway at Trump Tower discussing former Texas governor Rick Perry , who is Trump's pick for energy secretary. Asks Baldwin's Trump, \"Wasn't that a great choice? I saw him on ' Dancing With the Stars .'\" Then in a nod to a tweet Trump wrote Saturday morning which misspelled the \"unprecedented,\" Baldwin's Trump adds, \"This guy has so much energy. Un-president-ed.\" McKinnon's Conway then hands Baldwin's Trump a tiny piece of paper with a list of singers willing to perform at the inauguration -- a jab at the reported refusal by some musicians to perform at the inauguration. \"SNL\" cast member Cecily Strong played first lady-to-be Melania Trump , while fellow cast member Beck Bennett played Putin. During the cold open, the fictitious Trumps are jolted by a sound coming from the chimney. Ask Baldwin's Trump, \"What's that sound? ... Is it a ghost? Am I being scrooged? I hate that\" The mystery is soon solved when Bennett's shirtless Putin pops out of the fireplace. Well, look who came down the chimney! #SNL pic.twitter.com/0R9o81HvlY \u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) December 18, 2016 Soon after, surprise guest John Goodman enters the room, playing Trump's pick for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson , the ExxonMobil CEO and chairman who is friendly with Putin. The cold open pokes fun at their pair's real-life relationship, with Goodman's Tillerson greeting Bennett's Putin with the nickname \"Pooty,\" and Bennett's Putin, greeting his friend with, \"oh my God, Rexy!\" The pair then engage in a bro-like handshake and cheer. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Not A Hack: U.S. Office Of Government Ethics Tweets At Trump As the head of the Trump Organization, the incoming president has financial interests in hundreds of companies , spread over at least 20 countries. He also has many outstanding debts. His exact assets and debts are not known because he has refused to release tax records. The scant information available comes from a disclosure filing Trump made in May to the Office of Government Ethics. So while relatively few details are known, this much is obvious: Trump The Businessman has many financial interests that would come into direct conflict with Trump The President. Examples Of Conflicts: The conflicts are far too numerous to list here, but two examples provide a glimpse into how serious the problem is. The first involves the Philippines, where Trump licenses his name to Trump Tower at Century City, a huge project involving residential, commercial and retail space. His business partner there is Jose E.B. Antonio . After Trump won the election, the Philippines named Antonio as a special envoy to the United States. So in the future, Trump will face a question when he sits down with Antonio to discuss U.S. foreign policy in Southeast Asia: Is he acting in the best interests of all Americans \u2013 or in the best interests of Trump Tower's profits? Article continues after sponsorship Trump's Loans From Troubled German Bank Pose Conflict Of Interest Here's the second example, this one involving debt. Trump's disclosure form and other documents show he owes roughly $364 million to Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. But the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing an immense fine \u2013 around $14 billion \u2013 from Deutsche Bank for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. If the Trump administration were to back off from demanding such a huge fine, would it be because that's the right policy for this country, or because Trump wants to curry favor with his German lender? As long as Trump is both president of the country and father of the men running the Trump Organization, questions constantly will arise about his motives. Ethics Rules For Presidents: Decades ago, Congress wrote rules to prevent federal officials from having conflicts of interest, but they left the president exempt. Nevertheless, presidents have complied with the standards , putting their financial interests into a blind trust or investing only in simple instruments such as Treasury notes. Trump's plan to have his sons run the Trump Organization would not create a hands-off \"blind\" trust. In fact, sons Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump already have blurred the lines between their roles in the company and the incoming administration. For example, when Trump met with technology industry executives last week, his sons, along with daughter Ivanka, were seated at the table. Were the four Trumps listening for lucrative investment opportunities, or for good public-policy ideas? Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, released a letter last week saying that \"transferring operational control of a company to one's children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest.\" The Stalemate So how does OGE normally enforce federal ethics rules? It does so by referring cases to the Department of Justice. But as noted, the president is technically exempt, and in any case, he chooses the Attorney General to run DOJ, so that path to an ethics crackdown doesn't sound likely. But in addition to the federal ethics rules, the Constitution itself has an \"emoluments clause\" that says \"no person holding any office of profit or trust\" shall \"accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state\" unless Congress consents. So remember those two examples of conflicts, one involving a Philippines real estate project and the other, a German bank loan? What if Trump were to someday use his presidential clout to steer business to Trump Towers at Century City, or reduce Justice Department fines for Deutsche Bank in exchange for forgiveness of his company's debts? Such examples are entirely hypothetical. But if in the future, Congress were to discover that Trump took actions equivalent to accepting foreign bribes, then lawmakers could turn to another part of the U.S. Constitution: \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Already, Democrats are making it clear they will be watching Trump conflicts closely. Last week, Senate Democrats introduced legislation requiring Trump to divest, and House Democrats held an event where ethics experts discussed Trump's conflicts. ",

She was 99 years old, just two months shy of her 100th birthday. NPR has not independently confirmed the reports. Buxom and blond, vampy and campy, the Hungarian-born screen siren mainly contributed to cultural touchstones such as The Love Boat, The Naked Gun 2 1/2 and Hollywood Squares \u2014 where she answered (or, more accurately, couldn't answer) questions about Cheez Whiz.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Hulton Archive/Getty Images But it would be a grave mistake to trivialize Gabor's achievements. \"She is one of the most important figures of the late 20th century in terms of thinking about celebrity, thinking about women,\" says Kirsten Pullen, a professor at Texas A&M; University. Pullen is not joking. As far back as the 1950s, when women were expected to be decorous, Gabor sought and got constant press for her juicy hookups, her fabulous bling and her public antics. She could dominate a newsreel about a movie premiere \u2014 for a movie she wasn't even in \u2014 just by showing up in a diaphanous gown. She was arguably the prototype for today's Kim Kardashians and Paris Hiltons. (In fact, Gabor and Hilton had family ties: Gabor was once married to Conrad Hilton, who is Paris Hilton's great-grandfather.) \"You can't make this stuff up,\" Pullen says wryly. \"Whether or not we think it's great to be famous for being famous, she is the one who really set the template for that.\" Gabor followed her sister Eva from Hungary to Hollywood in the 1940s. Zsa Zsa scored some small movie parts from big movie directors \u2014 Orson Welles and John Huston among them \u2014 and was also featured in some movies probably best forgotten, such as Queen of Outer Space.

Mary Lederhandler/AP hide caption toggle caption Mary Lederhandler/AP Zsa Zsa Gabor strikes a glamorous pose during a rehearsal for CBS's As The World Turns in 1981. Mary Lederhandler/AP She had charm, which made her jokes about marrying for money rather than romance more palatable right when women were starting to demand more financial control. Her oft-stated fondness for sex dented traditional expectations of passive femininity, Pullen says: \"She paved the way for the sexual revolution.\" And when Gabor slapped a policeman who pulled her over in 1989, she parlayed the incident into a full-blown comeback, without any apparent help from mangers or publicists. The incident put her back on the talk show circuit, where she chattered merrily about the challenges of maintaining a beauty regimen in the slammer. Even as an older woman, Gabor tended her image as the glamorous starlet who married something like 10 times. She threw out lines like, \"I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.\" But she also, ironically enough, had this to say about Paris Hilton: \"I think she's rather silly. She does too many things for publicity.\" ",

By Paul Schwartzman December 18 at 7:57 PM Follow @paulschwartzman NEW YORK \u2014 The world\u2019s power address du jour is a sheath of soaring black glass on Fifth Avenue, at the entrance to which a cop in combat armor \u2014 his fingers on an assault rifle \u2014 took a moment the other day to tell a tourist where to find the city\u2019s best pizza. A parade of technology tycoons bounded by, on their way to meet with the building\u2019s developer and best-known resident, President-elect Donald Trump, a procession monitored in the lobby by a swarm of Secret Service agents, reporters and spectators that included one Kit Regone of Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s befitting a king,\u201d the retired production manager said, standing behind a velvet rope and taking in all the pink marble, golden mirrors, gleaming escalators and ever-tinkling, four-story waterfall that define Trump Tower\u2019s lobby. The White House may be the nation\u2019s time-honored symbol of power, but Trump is establishing his 58-story colossus at 725 Fifth Avenue as a stage for his new role, potentially nipping at Washington\u2019s reputation as the center of American authority and the stature of its most famous address, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. On most days, crowds of tourists, rank-and-file New Yorkers and candidates seeking jobs with the new administration endure a maze of checkpoints, barricades and police command posts on the traffic-choked streets that bound Trump Tower. President-elect Donald Trump walks in the lobby at Trump Tower on Dec. 6. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Their soundtrack is less \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d and more honking horns, wailing sirens and irritated pedestrians moaning, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Across the street from the president-elect\u2019s entrance, behind more barricades between 56th and 57th streets, are a phalanx of television news cameras, all of them trained on the \u201cT-R-U-M-P T-O-W-E-R\u201d spelled out not once but twice above the revolving doors. On the afternoon of his Jan.\u00a020 inauguration, Trump is expected to move into the White House. But he has said he still plans to spend time in New York, where his wife, Melania, and 10 year-old son, Barron, will remain at Trump Tower, at least until the end of the school year. How often Trump will be in New York is a looming question, but the president-elect is as famous for defying convention as he is for adoring his gold- and \u00addiamond-laden triplex high above Manhattan. Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, said the president-elect called after his post-election visit to the White House and pronounced himself \u201cvery impressed\u201d with his new residence, where the living quarters are some 10,000 square feet smaller than his current home. \u201cHe kept telling me how beautiful it was and how much he liked the architecture,\u201d Stone said. At the same time, Stone described his Queens-born friend as \u201cthe quintessential New Yorker,\u201d a \u201chomebody\u201d who \u201clikes to sleep in his own bed.\u201d \u201cLike all presidents,\u201d Stone said, \u201cI expect he won\u2019t be at the White House all the time. Instead of bailing out for Camp David, he can come to New York on the weekends.\u201d Workers and visitors make their way around the gilded halls of the lobby at Trump Tower. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Protecting Trump during his transition is costing New York taxpayers upward of $500,000 a day, a price that has triggered no small amount of outrage from Mayor Bill de Blasio and prompted one city lawmaker to politely urge the president-elect to decamp to another one of his properties, perhaps in Florida. An overwhelming majority of New York City voters rejected Trump\u2019s candidacy, and many grouse at the prospect of their city becoming his presidential backdrop. But Cindy Adams, a New York Post gossip columnist and longtime Trump friend, said she would understand if he preferred his home town to Washington, which she dismissed as overpopulated by fashion-challenged lawmakers who wear \u201cplastic shoes with rubber soles.\u201d \u201cThe White House is smaller than where he\u2019s used to living,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have a proper ballroom there. You get 11\u00a0people into the Red Room and it\u2019s crowded.\u201d Trump\u2019s choices in real estate could test whether Washington\u2019s preeminence in the country\u2019s political order depends on where the president spends his weekends \u2014 or weekdays for that matter. Yet the city\u2019s stature is not defined only by the White House, but also by the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the myriad federal agencies located there. \u201cAll the mechanics of government will remain in Washington,\u201d said Tammy Haddad, a D.C.-based media consultant steeped in the city\u2019s tribal customs. \u201cAnd around the world, going to the White House is something every world leader wants. That\u2019s not going to change.\u201d Yet, Haddad acknowledged one immediate difference wrought by Trump\u2019s New York-based transition. After previous elections, Caf\u00e9 Milano in Georgetown was the place where Washington insiders could spy who was dining with whom and decode who was up for a Cabinet post. Now, she said, the terrain fomenting speculation is the lobby of Trump Tower, which in recent days has hosted an ungainly mass of visitors including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, musician Kanye West, British politician Nigel Farage and an unidentified man who performed a perfect back flip. \u201cIs that Mike Pence?\u201d asked Susan McKenzie, a tourist from Pennsylvania, motioning as she stood in the lobby toward a man who was in fact Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). A few feet away, Joe Lepore, 57, of Fort Lee, N.J., said he was hoping to deliver to the president-elect a Christmas card and a photograph of himself fist-bumping with Trump 16\u00a0months earlier outside a New York courthouse. As much as he likes having Trump at Trump Tower, a building he believes should be officially designated \u201cWhite House North,\u201d Lepore said tradition dictates that the president belongs in Washington. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him \u2018Trump\u2019 up the White House, put his name on top of the building,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see him trick the whole thing out.\u201d As challenging as it may seem to imagine, the White House can feel like a studio apartment to its famous occupants, even with 18\u00a0acres, 132\u00a0rooms and 31\u00a0bathrooms. A \u201cgilded cage\u201d is how President Ronald Reagan described the residence first occupied in 1800 by President John Adams. Reagan liked to escape to his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., while President John F. Kennedy preferred Cape Cod in Massachusetts, and Richard Nixon retreated to Key Biscayne, Fla. Key West, Fla., was where Harry Truman spent the winters. George W. Bush\u2019s getaway was a one-story ranch house on 1,600 acres in Crawford, Tex. No president has made his weekend White House a Manhattan penthouse, a choice that may seem to challenge Trump\u2019s everyman bona fides. \u201cWhen a so-called populist moves the White House to Fifth Avenue, you have to say, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 \u201d said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar who was an adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is trying to make a point. He\u2019s just trying to get home \u2014 and his home happens to be a lot bigger and grander than the one the government is letting him live in.\u201d Trump Tower includes a bar (Trump Bar), a restaurant (Trump Grill), and a store (Trump Gift Shop), which sells items such as Success by Trump, a fragrance \u201cthat captures the scent of the driven man,\u201d according to the Trump Organization website. Under an agreement with the city, Trump Tower\u2019s lobby is accessible to the public from 8\u00a0a.m. to 10\u00a0p.m., a fact that allows spectators an elevator-side perch to watch who\u2019s visiting the president-elect. \u201cIs anybody famous going to come out of the elevator?\u201d asked Leandra Estrada, 39, an occupational therapist visiting from Texas, as she stood in the lobby last week. That she was even allowed to stand there, Estrada said, proved that Trump \u201cis with the people.\u201d Her son, Mike, 22, nodded: \u201cI see him on TV \u2014 he comes down, he walks around. It\u2019s more relaxed.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the people,\u201d Leandra said. Trump has lived in his tower since he built it in the early 1980s, a project that ruffled preservationists who regarded it as the architectural equivalent of a gaudy stretch limousine parked alongside the avenue\u2019s more refined Bentleys and Rolls-Royces. Trump celebrated his building\u2019s extravagance, gave tours of his Versailles-themed penthouse and touted sales of condominiums to stars such as Michael Jackson. More than three decades later, New York\u2019s luxury market is dominated by newer, more expensive real estate, leaving Trump Tower as a bit of a \u201ctired\u201d throwback, said Gabby Warshawer, a data analyst for CityRealty, a real estate group. While the average price of Manhattan condos rose 19\u00a0percent this year, she said, the cost of Trump Tower apartments were relatively stagnant. Of the eight condos that sold in the building this year, six had price cuts of between 5\u00a0and 33\u00a0percent. \u201cIt\u2019s still considered a luxury condo,\u201d Warshawer said. \u201cHowever, there are quite a lot more that command higher prices.\u201d If the bedlam accompanying Trump\u2019s life as president threatens to make his building less attractive to buyers, one real estate agent recently tried a new pitch, touting the Secret Service presence as an amenity and calling the property Manhattan\u2019s \u201cmost secure.\u201d The four police officers in front of the tower\u2019s entrance on Wednesday, each of them in helmets and swathed in body armor, seemed like sufficient evidence to back up that claim. The officers\u2019 main focus at that moment was the performer known as the \u201cNaked Cowboy,\u201d who had just arrived to pose for photos in his cowboy hat, white boots and underwear, on the back of which was written \u00ad\u201cT-R-U-M-P.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my mother,\u201d Barbara Plott of Alabama said as she photographed the cowboy hoisting an older woman in the air. Across the street, behind another set of metal barricades, Paul Rossen, 54, was selling \u201cDump Trump\u201d buttons, which he said were making him more money than the anti-Trump \u201cWe Shall Overcomb\u201d bumper stickers he peddled last year. For all his antipathy toward Trump, Rossen said he wouldn\u2019t mind if the country\u2019s new leader is in New York as often as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s good for business, and I like money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to live here, you know.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The email trove hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and posted on WikiLeaks shows Abedin, the estranged wife of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner, as an important resource for the campaign. The vice chair of the Clinton campaign, Abedin offered guidance on Clinton\u2019s probable thoughts regarding upcoming events, meetings and calls before the requests ever made it to the Democratic presidential candidate. While her fingerprints don\u2019t often appear on policy issues, she weighed in with authority on most other matters. ABEDIN CLAIMS SHE NEVER RECEIVED FBI WARRANT Clinton was known to keep an extremely small and tight-knit group around her, and, indeed, during the 2016 primary and presidential campaign, the core group \u2013 including Campaign Manager Robbie Mook, Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, adviser Cheryl Mills, Podesta and Abedin \u2013 never changed. One Clinton insider, however, said the closeness of that group also created problems, prompting dismissive answers when new ideas that originated outside the circle were suggested, Vanity Fair reported. \u201cWhere in most presidential campaigns the circle grows broader and broader, hers grew smaller and smaller,\u201d a source told Vanity Fair. A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign disputed that notion to Vanity Fair and said the campaign\u2019s plane seated up to three times as many people during the run-up to the November vote. Abedin declined to be interviewed for the feature. Abedin\u2019s proximity to Clinton \u2013 and in turn the limelight \u2013 also created another issue, according to some observers. \u201cShe was enjoying the red carpet and enjoying the photo spreads much too much in my opinion,\u201d one Clinton insider told Vanity Fair. \u201cShe enjoyed being a celebrity too much.\u201d Though Abedin\u2019s next move seems to be in limbo now that Clinton\u2019s political career appears to be over, she was recently spotted at Clinton\u2019s \u201cThank You\u201d holiday party for top-tier donors on Thursday and then at an after party with fellow attendees Mick Jagger and Reese Witherspoon, The New York Post reported. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just p----- off, but I really don\u2019t give a s--- about what happens to Huma to be honest with you,\u201d one close adviser to Clinton told Vanity Fair.

Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times Polar Bears\u2019 Path to Decline Runs Through Alaskan Village The bears that come here are climate refugees, on land because the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is receding. By ERICA GOODE DEC. 18, 2016 KAKTOVIK, Alaska \u2014 Come fall, polar bears are everywhere around this Arctic village, dozing on sand spits, roughhousing in the shallows, padding down the beach with cubs in tow and attracting hundreds of tourists who travel long distances to see them. At night, the bears steal into town, making it dangerous to walk outside without a firearm or bear spray. They leave only reluctantly, chased off by the polar bear patrol with firecracker shells and spotlights. On the surface, these bears might not seem like members of a species facing possible extinction. Carbon\u2019s Casualties Articles in this series explore how climate change is displacing people around the world. Part 1 Heat, Hunger and War Force Africans Onto a \u2018Road on Fire\u2019 Scientists have counted up to 80 at a time in or near Kaktovik; many look healthy and plump, especially in the early fall, when their presence overlaps with the Inupiat village\u2019s whaling season. But the bears that come here are climate refugees, on land because the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is receding. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and the ice cover is retreating at a pace that even the climate scientists who predicted the decline find startling. Much of 2016 was warmer than normal , and the freeze-up came late. In November, the extent of A rctic sea ice was lower than ever recorded for that month. Though the average rate of ice growth was faster than normal for the month, over five days in mid-November the ice cover lost more than 19,000 square miles, a decline that the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado called \u201calmost unprecedented\u201d for that time of year. In the southern Beaufort Sea, where Kaktovik\u2019s 260 residents occupy one square mile on the northeast corner of Barter Island, sea ice loss has been especially precipitous. The continuing loss of sea ice does not bode well for polar bears, whose existence depends on an ice cover that is rapidly thinning and melting as the climate warms. As Steve Amstrup , chief scientist for Polar Bears International , a conservation organization, put it, \u201cAs the sea ice goes, so goes the polar bear.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Polar bears holding each other in waters near the village. The continuing loss of ice bodes ill for them. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times An Imperfect Symbol The largest of the bear subspecies and a powerful apex predator, the charismatic polar bear became the poster animal for climate change . Al Gore\u2019s 2006 film, \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d which depicted a lone polar bear struggling in a virtually iceless Arctic sea, tied the bears to climate change in many people\u2019s minds. And the federal government\u2019s 2008 decision to list polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act \u2014 a designation based in part on the future danger posed by a loss of sea ice \u2014 cemented the link. But even as the polar bear\u2019s symbolic role has raised awareness, some scientists say it has also oversimplified the bears\u2019 plight and unwittingly opened the door to attacks by climate denialists. \u201cWhen you\u2019re using it as a marketing tool and to bring in donations, there can be a tendency to lose the nuance in the message,\u201d said Todd Atwood , a research wildlife biologist at the United States Geological Survey \u2019s Alaska Science Center . \u201cAnd with polar bears in particular, I think the nuances are important.\u201d Few scientists dispute that in the long run \u2014 barring definitive action by countries to curb global greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 polar bears are in trouble, and experts have predicted that the number will decrease with continued sea ice loss. A 2015 assessment for the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List projected a reduction of over 30 percent in the number of polar bears by 2050, while noting that there was uncertainty about how extensive or rapid the decline of the bears \u2014 or the ice \u2014 would be. A version of the assessment was published online Dec. 7 in the journal Biology Letters. But the effect of climate change in the shorter term is less clear cut, and a populationwide decline is not yet apparent. Nineteen subpopulations of polar bears inhabit five countries that ring the Arctic Circle \u2014 Canada, the United States, Norway, Greenland and Russia. Beaufort Sea ",

(Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports) 48 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE High-priced free agent quarterback Brock Osweiler has been benched by the Houston Texans. In light of Osweiler's continued struggles with accuracy issues, Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien pulled his regular starter in favor for third-year veteran Tom Savage in the second quarter of Sunday's contest against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Prior to his benching, Osweiler completed just six of 11 passes on the day for 48 yards, two interceptions and no touchdowns. The Texans signed Osweiler to a four-year, $72 million contract this offseason with $37 million guaranteed in the first two seasons, meaning that Houston could theoretically cut its losses following Osweiler's second-season with the team. Entering Sunday\u2019s game against the 2-11 Jaguars, Osweiler had completed just 59.7% of his passes for 2,656 yards, 14 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Savage\u2019s first attempt was a 32-yard connection with rookie Wendall Williams. He eventually led Houston on a scoring drive to cut the Jaguars lead. But the drive ended when Savage's fourth-and-goal\u00a0fade attempt to DeAndre Hopkins fell incomplete. Follow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes . PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 15 Posted!

In response, the company\u2019s owners refocused on their global business, particularly in the developing world. 2011 operations OxyContin is a dying business in America. This is the third part of a Los Angeles Times investigation exploring the role of OxyContin in the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic. With the nation in the grip of an opioid epidemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives, the U.S. medical establishment is turning away from painkillers. Top health officials are discouraging primary care doctors from prescribing them for chronic pain, saying there is no proof they work long-term and substantial evidence they put patients at risk. Prescriptions for OxyContin have fallen nearly 40% since 2010, meaning billions in lost revenue for its Connecticut manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. This is the third part of a Los Angeles Times investigation exploring the role of OxyContin in the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic. So the company\u2019s owners, the Sackler family, are pursuing a new strategy: Put the painkiller that set off the U.S. opioid crisis into medicine cabinets around the world. A network of international companies owned by the family is moving rapidly into Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and other regions, and pushing for broad use of painkillers in places ill-prepared to deal with the ravages of opioid abuse and addiction. Mundipharma is courting Chinese patients with a campaign encouraging people to take medications as their physicians prescribe. In this global drive, the companies, known as Mundipharma, are using some of the same controversial marketing practices that made OxyContin a pharmaceutical blockbuster in the U.S. In Brazil, China and elsewhere, the companies are running training seminars where doctors are urged to overcome \u201copiophobia\u201d and prescribe painkillers. They are sponsoring public awareness campaigns that encourage people to seek medical treatment for chronic pain. They are even offering patient discounts to make prescription opioids more affordable. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy said he would advise his peers abroad \u201cto be very careful\u201d with opioid medications and to learn from American \u201cmissteps.\u201d \u201cI would urge them to be very cautious about the marketing of these medications.\u201d \u2014 Vivek H. Murthy, U.S. Surgeon General Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy has called on U.S. doctors to help end the opioid epidemic. (Charles Dharapak / AP) \u201cI would urge them to be very cautious about the marketing of these medications,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNow, in retrospect, we realize that for many the benefits did not outweigh the risks.\u201d Former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner David A. Kessler has called the failure to recognize the dangers of painkillers one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine. Speaking of Mundipharma\u2019s push into foreign markets, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s right out of the playbook of Big Tobacco. As the United States takes steps to limit sales here, the company goes abroad.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s right out of the playbook of Big Tobacco.\u201d \u2014 David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration David A. Kessler, a physician, was head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from 1990 to 1997. (Randi Lynn Beach / Los Angeles Times) Some Mundipharma representatives and promotional material have downplayed the risk that patients will become addicted to their opioid medications. Those claims recall the initial marketing of OxyContin in the U.S. in the late 1990s when Purdue deceived doctors about the drug\u2019s addictiveness. Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges of misbranding drugs and were ordered to pay $635 million. The Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2003 that the company\u2019s \u201caggressive, excessive and inappropriate\u201d marketing \u201cvery much exacerbated\u201d abuse and criminal trafficking of OxyContin. Purdue was a small New York City pharmaceutical firm when brothers Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, both psychiatrists, bought it in 1952. The spectacular success of OxyContin has generated nearly $35 billion in revenue over the last two decades and made the Sacklers one of the nation\u2019s wealthiest families. Three generations of the family now help oversee Purdue and the Mundipharma associated foreign corporations. Family members declined to be interviewed for this article, as did executives who run their international companies. Get involved I know someone who has had an experience with OxyContin In a statement, Mundipharma International, which is based in Cambridge, England and responsible for European operations, said it was \u201cmindful of the risk of abuse and misuse of opioids\u201d and  was \u201cdrawing on the experiences and insights of the US in tackling this issue.\u201d Mundipharma said those efforts include seeking regulatory approval in Europe for a formulation of OxyContin already sold in the U.S. that deters certain forms of abuse and introducing another opioid painkiller, Targin, with similar abuse-deterrent properties. \u201cMundipharma is committed to developing prescription medicines for healthcare professionals to treat patients in pain safely and responsibly,\u201d the statement said. Promotional videos for Mundipharma, which feature smiling people of many ethnicities, suggest the companies regard OxyContin\u2019s U.S. success as merely a beginning. \u201cWe\u2019re only just getting started,\u201d the videos declare. \u201cOpiophobia\u201d around the globe Joseph Pergolizzi Jr. is a Florida doctor with an array of business ventures. He runs a pain management clinic and co-founded a drug research company. He invented a non-prescription pain-relieving cream he sells on cable television and he serves as an expert for a mail-order nutritional supplements company. He also talks up opioids to foreign doctors for Mundipharma. In April, Pergolizzi was in Rio de Janeiro at a cancer pain seminar sponsored by the company. For an hour, Pergolizzi lectured the gathered physicians in English about the use of opioids in cancer patients and those with what he called \u201cthe death sentence of chronic pain.\u201d Brazil had stepped up its use of painkillers in recent years, he said, but \u201cyou are still low\u201d compared with the U.S., Canada and Europe. \u201cI think unfortunately you may not have all the tools you need to properly address pain,\u201d he said, according to a video of the seminar posted online by Mundipharma. Consultants like Pergolizzi are key to helping Mundipharma overcome one of its greatest obstacles to selling painkillers abroad: Doctors\u2019 aversion to prescribing narcotics. Consultants like Pergolizzi are key to helping Mundipharma overcome one of its greatest obstacles to selling painkillers abroad: Doctors\u2019 aversion to prescribing narcotics. For generations, physicians have been taught that opioid painkillers are highly addictive and should be used sparingly and primarily in patients near death. Mundipharma executives and consultants call this \u201copiophobia\u201d and top company officials have said publicly that success in new markets depends on defeating this mind-set. Speeches like Pergolizzi\u2019s portray painkillers as a modern approach endorsed by leading experts in the U.S. Mundipharma presented Pergolizzi to the Brazilian group as a professor at the Johns Hopkins and Temple University medical schools. Medical journal articles published in 2015 and 2016 with funding from Mundipharma or in collaboration with its scientists have identified him variously as a faculty member at Johns Hopkins, Temple and Georgetown University medical schools. In fact, he is an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins and he has not been affiliated with Georgetown since 2010 or Temple since 2014, according to school officials. Asked to explain, Pergolizzi said by email that he was having \u201cpaperwork issues\u201d at Temple \u201cwhich I am rectifying with their full cooperation\u201d and was \u201cin discussions\u201d with Georgetown about an adjunct position. \u201cI have never intentionally misrepresented \u2026 my university affiliations,\u201d he wrote in another email. Joseph Pergolizzi addresses an April cancer pain seminar in Brazil sponsored by Mundipharma. (Mundipharma) A Temple spokesman said the university had \u201cno reason to believe he will have any future relationship\u201d with the school, and a Georgetown spokeswoman said, \u201cWe are not in discussions with that gentleman.\u201d Government records indicate that Purdue and other U.S. pharmaceutical firms have paid Pergolizzi more than $1 million since 2013 for consulting work, speaking engagements and other services as well as travel reimbursements. The records do not include any payments he may have received from foreign pharmaceutical firms such as Mundipharma. In his Rio presentation, he clicked quickly past a slide listing 16 drug companies for which he had done work. After Purdue launched OxyContin in the U.S. in 1996, the company ran similar training seminars for specialists \u2014 known in pharmaceutical marketing as \u201ckey opinion leaders\u201d \u2014 in the pain field. Doctors were invited to all-expenses paid weekends in resort locations like Boca Raton, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz. The company found that doctors who attended seminars in 1996 wrote more than twice as many prescriptions as those who didn\u2019t, according to a company analysis. Several thousand of these specialists signed on to the Purdue \u201cspeakers bureau,\u201d which paid them to make speeches about opioids at medical conferences and at hospitals. iCalendar \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Google Calendar \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Outlook \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Outlook Online \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 Yahoo! Calendar Dr. Barry Cole, a Reno psychiatrist and pain management specialist, started giving speeches about OxyContin for Purdue the year the drug hit the market. In recent years, he moved to the company\u2019s international operation in a consulting role he described in an online resume as a \u201cpain ambassador,\u201d teaching the use of opioids to doctors in Colombia, Brazil, South Korea, the Philippines, China and Singapore. \u201cAny side effect is reversible when treatment is discontinued, and there is no permanent damage to the body,\u201d Cole told a 2014 conference of pain specialists in Veracruz, Mexico, according to account of the presentation published on Mexican health websites. In an interview with The Times, Cole said he made the foreign presentations despite having developed deep misgivings about the use of OxyContin and similar drugs in the U.S. Witnessing the opioid epidemic unfold, seeing the effect of opioids on his patients and reading scientific literature about the drugs, he said, led him to conclude by about 2010 that painkillers were too dangerous for most chronic pain patients. \u201cWe thought we could just get away with putting everybody on opioids, and it would be hunky-dory,\u201d Cole said. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t work and it had darker consequences than any of us were predicting.\u201d He defended his work promoting opioids to foreign doctors, saying terminally ill patients were dying in pain in many places he visited. He said he never shied away from questions about abuse and had no way of knowing whether his talks led doctors to prescribe more opioids. \u201cYou show up, do a presentation and then you get back on the plane and are gone,\u201d he said. He said he stopped making appearances for Mundipharma last year. One \u201ckey opinion leader\u201d who attended Cole\u2019s seminars was Ricardo Plancarte Sanchez, a Mexico City pain doctor who holds a position at Mexico\u2019s national cancer institute. Plancarte now speaks at Mundipharma seminars in Mexico. In an interview, he said his aim was to help \u201cdemystify the use of opioids in chronic pain\u201d and that he was not paid for his appearances. \u201cWe need to work more to educate so that people use analgesics more,\u201d Plancarte said. He said he was not concerned Mexico would see large-scale abuse and addiction. \u201cIf we educate our doctors as well as our patients, there will be better use of the drugs than in the United States,\u201d he said. \u2018Talking about big money\u2019 Untreated pain is a global scourge. Each year millions with terminal cancer and end-stage AIDS die in needless agony, according to the United Nations. The problem is most acute in the poorest countries. Stefano Berterame, an officer of the U.N.-affiliated International Narcotics Control Board in Vienna, works to increase access to opioids in countries with shortages. He said most of the global problem could be solved with \u201cvery cheap morphine\u201d but that selling it held little allure for multinational drug companies \u201cIt\u2019s not very profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies prefer to market expensive preparations.\u201d Purdue charges hundreds of dollars a bottle for a month\u2019s supply of OxyContin in the U.S.  Generic morphine, which provides similar pain relief, can cost as little as 15 cents a day. Mundipharma is not alone in seeking new markets for opioids outside American borders. In the last year, two other manufacturers, Teva and Grunenthal, each bought drug companies in Mexico. Mundipharma sells drugs for a range of conditions, including asthma, cancer, and arthritis, but the core of its product line is opioid painkillers. In its global expansion, Mundipharma is looking to countries with wealth, health benefits or large emerging middle classes. And it is pursuing patients healthy enough to be customers for a long time. \u201cIf your market is only cases of terminal cancer, then your market is relatively limited\u2026,\u201d Berterame said. \u201cIf you enlarge the market to also chronic pain, then you are talking about big money.\u201d \u2018Rebel against the pain\u2019 Seeking new patients in Spain, Mundipharma chose ambassadors guaranteed to attract attention: Naked celebrities. A string of topless actors, musicians and models looked into the camera and told fellow Spaniards to stop dismissing aches and pains as a normal part of life. \u201cDon\u2019t resign yourself,\u201d Maria Reyes, a model and former Miss Spain, said in the 2014 television spot. \u201cChronic pain is an illness in and of itself,\u201d the pop singer Conchita added. The one-minute ad was part of a nationwide campaign developed and financed by Mundipharma to raise awareness of chronic pain \u2014 Reb\u00e9late contra el dolor (Rebel against the pain). In a 2013 Spanish television spot sponsored by Mundipharma, celebrities wear chains to represent the burden of chronic pain. The ads do not recommend a specific treatment or medication, but do urge sufferers to see a healthcare professional \u2014 thousands of whom have been trained by the company in the use of opioids. The campaign is part of a strategy to redefine back pain, joint aches and other common conditions as a distinct malady \u2014 chronic pain \u2014 that doctors and patients should take seriously. Chronic pain patients, who fill prescriptions month after month and often year upon year, have been the driver of billion-dollar sales for Purdue in the U.S. University of North Carolina researchers analyzed the medical records of patients taking OxyContin at strengths of  30 milligrams or more\u2014 common doses for the drug \u2014 and found that more than 85% were diagnosed with chronic pain of one type or another. In Spain, painkiller use is on the rise. Company sales were up seven-fold since 2007, a Mundipharma executive said in a 2014 interview with an industry blog. Spanish pain specialist Cesar Margarit, a consultant for Mundipharma, said the celebrity ads performed a public service by propelling patients who were \u201cshy in recognizing they suffer from pain\u201d to seek treatment. \u201cYou have celebrities saying, \u2018I have chronic pain.\u2019 [Patients] say, \u2018OK, if they can say that, I can too,\u201d Margarit said. \u201cThe impact in Spain was a very big one.\u201d A Spanish-language promotional video titled \u201cDolor Cronico Camapana 2014\u201d shows people discussing pain and where it might afflict them with graphic illustrations. (Instituto Mundipharma) The company removed the \u201cRebel against the pain\u201d spots from its YouTube channel this fall \u2014 after The Times submitted questions to the company about the chronic pain campaign. A spokeswoman said the videos were taken down because the program was inactive. Around the world, Mundipharma companies cite statistics suggesting there is a great unmet need for their products. Opening an office in Mexico in 2014, Mundipharma officials declared that 28 million citizens were suffering from chronic pain. In Brazil, the company cited a figure of 80 million. In Colombia last year, a company news release said 47% of the population \u2014 about 22 million people \u2014 were afflicted by \u201cthis silent epidemic.\u201d Source: QuintilesIMS National Sales Perspective Paul Duginski / @latimesgraphics \u201910 \u201908 A 2011 survey in the Philippines designed and paid for by the company concluded that the \u201cgovernment should recognize chronic pain as a specific health problem\u201d and should improve access to pain medications. Health authorities in the U.S. say opioids are not the solution to chronic pain.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this year there is \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d that the drugs relieve pain in patients who take them for more than three months. Up to 24% of people on the drugs long-term become addicted, the CDC said. Up to 24% of patients who take the drugs long-term develop addiction problems, the CDC said. Some Mundipharma representatives abroad have suggested publicly that painkiller risk is overblown. As public health officials in the U.S. were issuing their latest warning about painkiller abuse last year, a Mundipharma executive was quoted in a Seoul newspaper saying that Korean doctors \u201cworry too much\u201d about addiction. \u201cBut many studies have shown that it\u2019s almost impossible for those with chronic or severe pain to become addicted to narcotics, as long as the drug is used for pain relief,\u201d Lee Jong-ho told the Korea Herald. Lee could not be reached for comment. Willem Scholten, a retired World Health Organization official Mundipharma has paid to speak at medical conferences, said President Obama, public health officials and the media have \u201cexaggerated\u201d the U.S. prescription opioid crisis. The surge in addiction and death was largely due to recreational abuse, he said. \u201cThe problem is a lot of crime,\u201d Scholten, a Dutch pharmacist, said in an interview. \u201cIf [other countries] make good regulations, they won\u2019t have similar problems.\u201d Subscribe today for unlimited access to exclusive investigations, breaking news, features and more He said that \u201cthere is hardly any evidence\u201d that pain patients abuse medications. Sharon Walsh, a University of Kentucky addiction expert who advises the FDA on risks from pain drugs, called the assertions \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d \u201cThat is exactly the same thing they were teaching U.S. physicians when they launched OxyContin in this country,\u201d said Walsh, who runs the university\u2019s Center on Drug and Alcohol Research. \u2018The Google of the pharma industry\u2019 Mundipharma\u2019s operations in the developing world are run out of a sleek Singapore office with a Silicon Valley feel. There are bean bag chairs, a \u201cchill-out zone\u201d and a tea bar, and employees are encouraged to think of the company as a nimble, creative start-up \u2014 \u201cthe Google of the pharma industry,\u201d in the words of one executive. After introducing OxyContin in the U.S., Purdue\u2019s Canadian affiliate and Mundipharma\u2019s Australian company began promoting the painkiller  in those countries. In the last decade and a half,  both have seen U.S.-style problems, including criminal trafficking, addiction and death. Mundipharma turned its focus to the developing world in 2011, as U.S. sales began their drop. Rapidly modernizing countries are expected to spend more than $20 billion on pain medicines by 2020, according to QuintilesIMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. Mundipharma expanded first in Asia, then Latin America and then the Middle East and Africa, ultimately having a presence in 122 developing markets. The high cost of brand-name medications remains a barrier in many developing countries, but Mundipharma has sought ways to adjust. In Brazil, the company started a program this year that offers patients discounts on the cost of pills. Purdue used coupons in the U.S. that offered patients a free initial prescription for OxyContin. About 34,000 coupons were redeemed before the company terminated the program as concerns about abuse grew, according to a Congressional report. Revenues for Mundipharma Emerging Markets, the Singapore-based company that oversees developing world operations, have risen 800% over the last five years to about $600 million annually. A Mundipharma spokeswoman said that growth included revenue from deals the companies have made with other manufacturers to sell non-opioid products. Raman Singh, head of Mundipharma Emerging Markets, has said publicly that pain treatment in Asia is 1/50th of what it should be. Half the company\u2019s worldwide sales in the developing world, which include products other than painkillers, already come from China, according to Mundipharma, and China is central to the Mundipharma\u2019s global strategy.

(Suhaimi Abdullah / Getty Images) The Chinese government has pledged that all 1.4 billion citizens will have health insurance by the close of the decade, and the company is working quickly to establish itself as the market leader in pain medications. Since 2011, Mundipharma has hired more than a thousand employees, most of them sales representatives,  and now has a presence in 300 cities. Thousands of Chinese doctors have attended training seminars about Mundipharma\u2019s drugs, and it claims a 60% share of the cancer pain market. Mundipharma has sponsored clinical trials of OxyContin and Targin at hospitals across the country. There remains, however, a deep-seated fear of opioids stemming from Chinese defeats in the 19th century Opium Wars that left millions addicted. Under strict government regulations, patients can purchase OxyContin only from a hospital or other medical institution, and can receive no more than a 15-day supply. Relatively few Chinese use Mundipharma\u2019s painkillers for chronic pain because of their high price. Mundipharma's operation in China, headquartered in a Beijing skyscraper, has expanded rapidly since 2011. (Jonathan Kaiman/Los Angeles Times) Mundipharma is courting Chinese patients with a campaign encouraging people to take medications as their physicians prescribe. In one animated video on the company\u2019s website, an elderly cancer patient who expresses fear about becoming addicted to painkillers is corrected by his nurse. \u201cYou will not be addicted if you follow the doctor\u2019s instructions,\u201d she tells him.  The video was removed from the site this fall at around the time The Times asked company officials about it. Asked why, a company spokeswoman said \u201cprograms and campaigns change frequently and content is updated often.\u201d In China, where there are nearly 3 million registered drug abusers, the government has forced addicts into boot-camp style treatment that human rights advocates have described as prisons. Treatment is rudimentary or unavailable in many parts of the developing world. UNC researcher Nabarun Dasgupta, who has advised federal health authorities and the WHO on prescription opioid abuse, said the wide use of painkillers in those countries \u201csounds like a recipe for disaster\u201d because \u201ca certain percent [of users] will go on to need addiction treatment.\u201d \u201cA certain percent [of users] will go on to need addiction treatment.\u201d \u2014 Nabarun Dasgupta, University of North Carolina researcher Dr. Nabarun Dasgupta of the University of North Carolina has advised U.S. and world health authorities on opioid abuse. (Los Angeles Times) Mundipharma Emerging Markets said in a statement, \u201cWe attach great importance on promoting our pain medicines in a balanced and responsible manner so that the correct physicians are prescribing the correct medicines to the correct patients.\u201d \u2018A big deal\u2019 Public health officials in Europe worry far less about painkiller addiction than their American counterparts. Government health systems in many countries track prescriptions, making it more difficult than in the U.S. to obtain large amounts of opioid medication for abuse or criminal trafficking. But when a team of international researchers recently conducted the first large-scale survey of drug abuse in Europe, they found what the lead investigator described as a significant problem with prescription opioid abuse. Painkiller abuse rates are similar to the U.S. in the early 2000s \u201cbefore the epidemic really got going,\u201d Scott Novak, a scientist at the nonprofit RTI International in North Carolina, said in an interview. In Spain, 18% of those surveyed acknowledged abusing painkillers in the course of their life, according to the study published in August. Across Europe, people with prescriptions were eight times as likely to abuse the drugs. Behind the story How we reported the investigation \u201cThey are potentially at the precipice of a major public health problem if prescribing increases,\u201d Novak said. Mundipharma International took issue with that conclusion. The company said in a statement that painkiller abuse is less of a problem in Europe than in the U.S., in part because of stricter pharmacy regulation and government health systems. Mundipharma said that it was conducting a study of abuse in Britain and Germany and that initial results \u201csuggest that in these countries abuse of prescription opioids is less than 1%.\u201d In one European country \u2014 Cyprus \u2014 OxyContin abuse is an acknowledged problem. Mundipharma began marketing the painkiller in 2008 on the Mediterranean island of 1 million. Government health coverage made the medication cheaper than heroin and addicts began crushing and snorting the pills. Officers responding to overdoses knew little of the U.S. experience with painkillers. Stelios Sergides, a superintendent with the Cyprus National Police, said that the first time he heard the word OxyContin, he had to look it up online. Since 2013, authorities have linked six deaths to the drug. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal, a big deal,\u201d Sergides said. Police superintendent Stelios Sergides has investigated OxyContin dealing on the small Mediterranean island of Cyprus. (Lisa Girion / Los Angeles Times) Mundipharma said it was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the deaths in Cyprus and suggested the blame rested with a rehab center which used OxyContin to treat heroin addiction, a practice the company does not recommend. Police in Cyprus are investigating doctors suspected of overprescribing and working with public health officials to get addicts into rehab. Last year, 59 people requested treatment. \u201cWe are worried, of course, because of the numbers, especially the treatment demand,\u201d Sergides said. In the Mundipharma\u2019s Cyprus office, managing director, Menicos M. Petrou, called OxyContin \u201can excellent product\u201d and said he had been honored to meet members of the Sackler family during visits to a factory on the island. \u201cIf people misuse drugs, most of the time there is little a pharmaceutical company can do,\u201d he said.

Wochit Zsa Zsa Gabor has died, according to reports. (Photo: Curt Wilcott, AP) Zsa Zsa Gabor, the 99-year-old former beauty queen and actress, died Sunday in Los Angeles. Her friend and former publicist, Edward Lozzi, told USA TODAY that she died around 1 p.m. PT Sunday.\u00a0The news was first reported by TMZ . She was ahead of her time. In the Hollywood Golden Age, Gabor, or simply Zsa Zsa to most, was perhaps the first celebutante. If there had been no Zsa Zsa, there probably would be no Kim Kardashian. \"She did not suffer fools well,\" said a statement from Lozzi, who had represented her \"on and off\" since 1989. \"Zsa Zsa Gabor was one tough cookie. Her beautiful lips and mouth would also be her worst enemy when and if she turned on the verbal machine gun. Most of her problems originated from that beautiful mouth. \"Zsa Zsa Gabor\u00a0will always be an American icon and the klieg\u00a0in the Gabor-Hilton dynasty.\" Stars remember Zsa Zsa Gabor on Twitter Gabor had been in ill health since being hospitalized after a fall in July 2010. She had hip replacement surgery afterward\u00a0but returned to the hospital several times for treatment of swelling and clots. Most of her right leg had been amputated\u00a0because of gangrene. Although after her television career Gabor had become a punchline or a caricature, known for her run-in with a Beverly Hills cop or for her many marriages, it wasn\u2019t always that way. Gabor was of a time when \u201csocialite\u201d was not yet a term of derision. Despite a spotty film career, she became a staple on TV. She often appeared as herself and spoofed her active social life with a quip and a \u201cdahlink\u201d that became her signature term of endearment. Posted!

    "text": "Trump almost certain to win Electoral College vote, but nothing's sure in 2016 elections Published               December 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Electoral College is expected Monday to select Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, despite efforts to disrupt the 227-year-old process that so far appears to have resulted in just one openly rogue voter. Still, Democrats and Republicans on Sunday spoke with some uncertainty about the anticipated outcome. \u201cWe expect everything to fall in line,\u201d Reince Priebus, White House chief of staff in the incoming Trump administration, told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d In most presidential election years, the Electoral College vote would essentially be a formality after the popular vote is cast in November. But 2016 was not a typical election year, considering Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote with roughly 2.6 million more ballots than Trump but lost the Electoral College vote. Trump got more Electoral College votes by winning many of the smaller, less-populated states in the Midwest and South, along with the big coastal state of Florida and traditionally Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump and Clinton also split the six most populous states. Trump needs 270 electoral votes Monday. And the state victories put him in line to get 306 of the 538 -- with each state getting one vote for each House and Senate member. The three remaining votes go to the District of Columbia. \u00a0 Priebus, who still runs the Republican National Committee, which is trying to keep count of the apportioned or \u201cpledged\u201d votes, cited the only known and so-called \u201cfaithless\u201d balloter, who lives in Texas and whose vote goes to Trump but plans to vote for another, yet-to-be-named Republican. \u201cBut other than that, we're very confident that everything is going to be very smooth,\u201d said Priebus, noting a massive petition drive to get electoral voters to cast ballots against Trump and the alleged harassment of some of the voters, particularly in Arizona, where Trump won 49 percent of the vote, compared to 45 percent for Clinton, which entitles him to all 11 electoral votes. Arizona electorate Donald Graham told Fox News on Saturday that the 11 electorates have received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he\u2019s received information that some of other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat. \u201cIt\u2019s out of hand when you have such \u2026 a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\u201d said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \u201cThe Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\u201d All swore to party officials that they will back Trump, even though they're not legally bound to do so, and plan to hold to that pledge. Trump himself responded to the reports of elector harassment and intimidation Sunday.\u00a0 If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2016 There is no federal law on electoral votes. Some states bind their voters -- often state party officials -- to the popular vote. But the penalties for violations are minor, such as being disqualified from future balloting. On Sunday, John Podesta, Clinton campaign chairman, suggested that 37 electoral voters bound to Trump could defect, which would be enough to create at least a tie and send the vote to the GOP-controlled House, where Trump would still likely win. Podesta, as he has in recent days, pressed the argument on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Russians hacking the emails of Democrats during the election led in part to Clinton\u2019s loss. He also made a last-minute argument that members of the Electoral College should have an intelligence briefing about the hackings before voting Monday. \u201cI assume that our electors are going to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cBut the question is whether there are 37 Republican electors who think that either there are open questions [about the purported Russian hackings] or that Donald Trump \u2026 is really unfit to be president. \u2026 And I guess we will know that \u2026 tomorrow.\u201d The Associated Press tried to reach all 538 electors and was able to interview more than 330 of them. Many reported getting tens of thousands of emails, calls and letters asking them to vote against Trump. But the canvass found overwhelming support for the system, and the nominee, among Republican electors. The AP found only one pledged to Trump who will refuse to vote for him but did not identify him as the voter in Texas. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Biden Jr., as the departing president of the Senate, is expected to preside over the count, during which every state\u2019s vote is opened and announced in alphabetical order. Mr. Biden will then declare the winner based on who has the majority of votes \u2014 at least 270. (That has led, three times, to an awkward moment when the sitting vice president has announced his own defeat, according to the House historian\u2019s office . That happened most recently in 2001, to Al Gore.) And that\u2019s it? Not quite. At that point, Mr. Biden will ask if there are any objections, and lawmakers can then challenge either individual electoral votes or state results as a whole. If an elector has chosen to vote against state results, that is the moment when lawmakers can petition to throw that vote out. Objections must be in writing and signed by at least one member of the House and one member of the Senate. If there are any objections, the House and Senate then immediately split up to consider them and have just two hours to decide whether they support the objection or not. Both chambers will then reconvene and share their decisions; if both the House and the Senate agree with the objection, then they will throw out the votes in question. But Congress has never sustained an objection to an electoral vote. After any and all objections have been resolved, the results are considered final. The next step is to swear in the winner on Jan. 20. Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

And as serious as those conflicts may be, the cheeky nature of the portal is indicated by its obscenity-implied URL: Corrupt.af . Matt Ortega, who worked for the Clinton campaign through the primary, says he created the website and maintains it on his own. He first began promoting it a few weeks after the election. Related: GOP Opposition to Potential Trump Cabinet Nominees Grows Corrupt.af pulls its domain suffix \u2014 the rarely seen .af \u2014 from Afghanistan's country code, but it is not affiliated with the war-torn nation. Instead it is meant to highlight how corrupt Trump could be, since \"af\" is a modern abbreviation for \"as f-ck\" \u2014 that is, very. Corrupt.af creator Matt Ortega Courtesy Matt Ortega \"[Trump] attacked Hillary Clinton with exaggerated and false \"pay-to-play\" allegations over the Clinton Foundation,\" Ortega told NBC News. \"He created the examples of what was disqualifying and is brazenly engaged in conducting them himself.\" The website tracks the amount of reported cases of potential corruption and the number of hours since the latest report. It currently cites 62 reports of \"corruption.\" Corrupt.af has received nearly 500,000 page views since its inception. \"Yesterday it was buckling a bit under the weight of traffic,\" Ortega said late last week. \"There were as many as 1,200 people on the site at any given moment for much of the day.\" Ortega \u2014 who says he will continue the website as long as he can \u2014 says he mostly sees spikes in traffic when he puts a new instance on Facebook or Twitter. He believes the project is necessary, he said, because tracking Trump's many interests can be overwhelming. \"It may even be possible Trump's people count on the sheer volume to cause peoples' eyes to just glaze over and forget about it. That's my fear,\" Ortega said. Phil McCausland ",

In the 1992 presidential election, Democrat Bill Clinton won West Virginia by a solid 13 percentage points. In November, Republican President-elect Donald Trump captured the state in a walk \u2014 winning it by more than 40 percentage points. The forces behind that turnaround are complex. The decline of the coal industry and the changing demographics of the political parties explain part of it. But underneath that are the peaks and valleys of the Appalachian Mountains that make West Virginia what it is: picturesque, resource-rich and remote. Coal has dominated much of the state's story, and the industry's declines are very real. Coal production in West Virginia has declined by 30 percent since 2010 and, in that time, coal mine employment in West Virginia has fallen by more than 27 percent. Some places have been hit especially hard. In Boone County, a short drive from Charleston, the mining cuts have shattered the economy \u2014 more than 4,000 jobs lost in the last five years, said Kris Mitchell, director of the Boone County Community and Economic Development Corporation. And that's in a county with only 24,000 people. Coal production in the county has dropped from 22,400 tons in 2010 to 8,400 in 2015. \"Whether we like it or not, this place is forever changed,\" Mitchell said. And for a lot of people, the sources of those changes are clear: Democrats and environmental regulations. President Barack Obama's plans to cut power plant carbon emissions by 30 percent impacted coal directly. Hillary Clinton's electoral drubbing here was driven in part by her promise to put \"a lot of coal miners\" out of work in pursuit of clean energy. The words were pulled out of context, but they fit into a narrative people here knew well. \"When Obama first got into office he said he was going to bankrupt the coal industry and he did. And he done it by regulation,\" said Steve Kennedy, who works at the Hobet Mine in Boone County. The site is being reclaimed and, people hope, redeveloped. \"I have an 18-year-old son that graduated high school and he's working part time at UPS now but if that doesn't pan out, then he'll have to leave here to find work because there's nothing here.\" Coal's struggles are not just about regulations, as officials and industry experts acknowledge. The booming natural gas market and automation have also played major, arguably larger, roles. Voters, however, see the Democrats as big drivers of the state's challenges. Since 2010, West Virginia is the only state in the union that has lost population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Its November unemployment rate, 6 percent, ranked 47th out of the 50 states. In a larger sense, though, West Virginia's political shift is about more than economics. It's about changes in the parties, the way the state's population views itself and the way it views Washington. So it's about culture as much as economics. Ask people in and around Charleston why the state has moved away from the Democratic Party and one of the most common responses you get is that the party has become too \"liberal.\" \"The Democratic Party is in full retreat here now,\" said Mike Plante, a Democratic strategist in Charleston who's been in the state since 1992. Government, he said, is viewed as a tool of elites and a \"malevolent force out to do us harm.\" And that's gotten worse under Obama, he added. Play ",

The ban was lifted Sunday, Dec. 18. Frank Bajak/AP On Sunday, the city issued a statement saying : \"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the City of Corpus Christi have concurred on the decision to lift the tap water restrictions citywide effective immediately. \"The City recommends flushing each tap in the house for 2 \u2014 3 minutes to clear any water lines and replacing filters, at your discretion.\" The water ban had been in effect since Dec. 14, when the city notified residents that possible chemical contamination could make the water unsafe to drink or bathe in.

Corpus Christi Mayor Dan McQueen said the city believed a \"backflow incident\" at Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions company caused an unknown amount of the chemical to enter the water supply. According to a manufacturer's data sheet about the chemical, four states specifically regulate the substance. Texas does not. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality released results on Sunday from 28 water samples collected Dec. 15 and Dec. 16 showing none of them detected dangerous levels of the chemical, which the TCEQ and local branch of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defined as under 2.6 mg/l for Indulin-AA-86 in drinking water. Speaking Sunday, McQueen said he could feel the pain in the community, reported the Corpus Christi Caller-Times : \"I hope you guys understand and feel the emotion I have right now. This certainly isn't something the city wanted to do. It's the 18th of December. We have Christmas right around the corner. My heart goes out to everybody in our city right now. I apologize.

    "text": "DEC. 17, 2016 By The New York Times This time, China chose a more unconventional method to challenge the United States and hastened the timetable, challenging a president-elect rather than a newly installed president as it has in the past. The drone itself, known as an unmanned underwater vehicle, was not a particularly important piece of equipment. Such drones are deployed to gather military oceanographic data and are available over the counter for about $150,000, the Pentagon said. Data from the drone would no doubt be used to help track China\u2019s growing submarine fleet, naval experts said. More important than the equipment was the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters, and whether China was in the process of imposing its own rules in the South China Sea \u2014 more than 800 miles away from its coastline, said Alexander Vuving, a specialist on Vietnam at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. \u201cThis is China showing that it is in the process of setting the rules in the South China Sea, imposing its own view in the South China Sea and saying the South China Sea should be its own backyard,\u201d Mr. Vuving said. \u201cIf China can get away with this incident with impunity,\u201d he added, \u201cthis will send a chilling message to countries in the region.\u201d Some leaders, like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, will feel validated in a pivot away from the United States toward China, Mr. Vuving said. \u201cOthers, like the Vietnamese, will have to seriously rethink their regional outlook.\u201d Vietnam \u2014 always fearful of China, its neighbor to the north, but also careful not to alienate Beijing \u2014 has tried in the last few years to draw closer to the United States, while still maintaining a careful distance. Advertisement In 2011, as China became more assertive in the South China Sea, Vietnam accused China of instructing three high-speed patrol boats to cut the cables of a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship. The authoritarian Vietnamese government was so furious that it allowed anti-Chinese demonstrations in Hanoi. In 2014, China moved a billion-dollar oil rig to waters close to the Paracel Islands that both Vietnam and China claim, and then blasted a flotilla of Vietnamese ships with water cannon. Since then, China has hardened its position, sometimes referring to the South China Sea a \u201ccore interest\u201d in which there is no room for compromise, though others in the region call it bullying by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Under that vision, China would be in control from the waters of Indonesia to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and up to Japan. In the East China Sea, China and Japan are at odds over an uninhabited island chain, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. In June, China sent a warship for the first time into the waters around the islands, further escalating tensions. Japan has been more outspoken than other Asian countries in its support for the Obama administration\u2019s objections to China\u2019s construction of military facilities on seven artificial islands in the South China Sea. But in Tokyo, the government was watching the outcome of the drone episode with some anxiety. So far, Washington\u2019s restrained response has not been reassuring.

Store managers Jamie Taflinger, left, and Kendyll Murray serve customer Cornell Hall of Highland at the Get Loaded gun store in Grand Terrace, which has seen a surge in gun sales ahead of the Jan. 1 implementation of new laws. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Patrick McGreevy Contact Reporter Gov. Jerry Brown \u2019s approval of sweeping gun control legislation in July has triggered a run on firearms in California, with some stores reporting sales have doubled since then. Starting Jan. 1, the general public in California can no longer buy a semiautomatic rifle equipped with bullet-buttons that allow for the quick removal and replacement of ammunition magazines, under a new law signed by the governor. Guns purchased before Jan. 1 can be kept as long as the owner registers them with the state as assault weapons. As a result, sales of the long guns have at least\u00a0doubled at many California gun stores, owners report. \u201cWhen Gov. Brown signed that bill, the first 30 days in July were just insane,\u201d said Joshua Deaser, the owner of Just Guns, a store in Sacramento. \u201cIt died down for a while but now we are back with everyone trying to get what they can before the end of the year.\u201d Terry McGuire, owner of the Get Loaded gun store in the\u00a0city of Grand Terrace in San Bernardino County, said people are clamoring to buy semiautomatic rifles before midmonth, given that the state background check process takes about 10 days. \u201cWe have people lined up out the door and around the block,\u201d McGuire said. State officials confirm there has been a surge\u00a0in gun sales. The number of semiautomatic rifles registered this year with the state has more than doubled over last year, according to the state Department of Justice. In the less than six months since the July 1 signing of the rifle ban, 257,895 semiautomatic rifles have been purchased, eclipsing the 153,931 rifle purchases reported to the state in all of 2015, the state agency said. Purchases of all firearms, including handguns, have jumped\u00a040% over last year,\u00a0to nearly 1\u00a0million this year, according to the state agency. \u201cWe expected this,\u201d said Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California. \u201cAny time the government comes up with a ban on guns, the public rushes to buy them to make sure they have at least one.\u201d The state Legislature approved a raft of new gun control measures this year in response to mass shootings from Newtown, Conn., to Tucson, Ariz. The new law was also in response to a terrorist shooting in San Bernardino last year in which weapons including AR-15\u00a0 rifles were used to kill 14 people attending a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center. Assemblyman Phil Ting\u00a0(D-San Francisco), a coauthor of the bill, said military-style weapons \u201cenable shooters to take the most lives in the least amount of time\u201d and there is no place for them on California\u2019s streets. \u201cAll of us should be able to go to work and send our kids to school free from the fear of becoming a mass shooting victim,\u201d Ting said. \u201cThe bullet button loophole undermined California\u2019s assault weapons ban and the shocking loss of life in San Bernardino last year revealed the subsequent threat to public safety.\u201d Assemblyman Marc Levine (D-San Rafael), another coauthor of the bill, said the new law is important. \"We raise our children in communities, not war zones,\u201d he said. Levine downplayed the increase in gun sales currently being experienced by California stores. \u201cGun sales have trended up for a while now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnxiety and strife are being sowed throughout American society. The Legislature acted to limit bloodshed in our communities.\u201d Updates from Sacramento \u00bb Paredes said he expects a lawsuit challenging the new law, but said\u00a0he understands why people are stockpiling the weapons in the meantime. In addition to the rifle ban, gun owners are\u00a0anxious about\u00a0a law by Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) that will require ammunition purchasers to undergo background checks in 2019, and the recently approved initiative by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom that included gun control measures such as a ban on possessing magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Gavin Newsom, Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Jerry Brown are the biggest marketing and sales guys for AR-15 and AK-47-style rifles in the state of California,\u201d Paredes said. \u201cBecause of their actions, people are buying them any way they can.\u201d Brown, Newsom and De Le\u00f3n did not respond to requests for comment on the run on guns. An aide to Brown referred to his signing message on the gun control bills that said he was approving them \u201cto enhance public safety.\u201d Customers who are buying the guns are as upset as store owners, according to Pete Brown, the retail sales manager at American\u00a0Gun Works in Glendale, where he said sales are \u201cway up.\u201d \u201cPeople are angry,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey are angry with the Legislature because [the law] doesn\u2019t address crime. Nothing in the law addresses criminals. It\u2019s another way of cutting back on what\u2019s available to law abiding citizens, and that\u2019s why they are angry.\u201d Alex Lopez, the owner of Western Firearms in Bell, confirmed that gun buyers don\u2019t like the direction the new laws are taking the state. \u201cThey can\u2019t figure out how this is going to affect criminals from getting access to firearms,\u201d Lopez said.

    "text": "Clinton campaign chief: Did Trump, Russians collude? Richard Wolf , USA TODAY 1:24 p.m. EST December 18, 2016 457 Shares x Share Despite previous reports, apparently both the CIA and FBI agree that Russia intervened in the election to benefit Donald Trump. Video provided by Newsy Newslook WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign chairman said Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump's campaign may have colluded with the Russian government over hacked e-mails in an effort to\u00a0swing the election. \"It's very much unknown whether there was collusion,\" John Podesta said on NBC's Meet the Press. Without pointing a finger directly at Trump, Podesta said any ties between the Russian hacking\u00a0and the president-elect's campaign should be revealed to members of the Electoral College before they confirm the election results Monday. \"What did 'Trump\u00a0Inc.'\u00a0know, and\u00a0when did they know it?\" Podesta said.\u00a0\"Were they in touch with the Russians? I think those are still open questions, and the electors have a right to know what the answers are \u2014\u00a0if the United States government has those answers \u2014\u00a0before the election.\" While many pundits have said the Russians wanted to discredit the U.S. election process but did not necessarily aim to elect Trump, Podesta cited examples of direct contacts: Russian diplomats' statements that they were speaking to the Trump campaign; Trump adviser Roger Stone's comments in August that Wikileaks had Podesta's e-mails before they were released;\u00a0and meetings in Russia before the Republican National Convention between a Trump foreign policy adviser and Russian intelligence officials. All of that points to the need for an independent investigation, Podesta said \u2014\u00a0something Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Sen. John McCain endorsed Sunday\u00a0by calling for a select committee. Speaking in New York, Schumer said the special panel should focus on Russia, \"but also China and Iran, and their hacking our political system as well as our economic infrastructure and social system.\" And speaking on CNN's State of the Union,\u00a0McCain said \"the Russians and others, Chinese to a lesser degree, have been able to interfere with our electoral process ... This is serious business. If they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections.\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected the idea of a new bipartisan panel in favor of a probe by the existing Senate Committee on Intelligence. But Schumer and McCain, along with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, said only a special committee can gather all the evidence because of existing committees' separate jurisdictions. On\u00a0Fox News Sunday,\u00a0incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said even if there eventually is proof of\u00a0Russian hacking, it's \"insane\" to think the Trump campaign coordinated it. \"Of course we didn't interface with the Russians. I mean, this whole thing is a spin job,\"\u00a0Priebus said. Furthermore, he saids, \"There's\u00a0no evidence that shows that the outcome of the election was changed because of a couple of dozen John Podesta\u00a0e-mails.\" Even Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, said on ABC's This Week\u00a0that Trump's victory had more to do with his cracking the \"blue wall\" of Democratic strongholds in the Midwest, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. Still, she said, \"Donald Trump used this information in ways to also sow division.\" Contributing: David Jackson Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hWeimX Most Popular ",

(Dec. 17) AP In this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, smoke rises in green government buses, in Idlib province, Syria, Sunday, Dec. 18, 2016. Activists said militants have burned at least five buses assigned to evacuate wounded and sick people from two villages in northern Syria. (Photo: Uncredited, AP) A compromise that would allow the evacuation\u00a0of rebels and civilians from besieged eastern Aleppo hit a snag Sunday, and it was not immediately clear whether\u00a0the critical humanitarian effort would take place. Syrian government forces agreed to allow the evacuations to resume after rebels agreed to allow thousands of\u00a0people to leave villages west of Aleppo besieged by rebel groups. The deal was in doubt, however, after several buses traveling in the convoy to government-held villages were burned Sunday by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a Sunni terrorist group linked to al-Qaeda. The militants sometimes fight\u00a0alongside U.S.-backed rebels combating\u00a0forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. One advocacy group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, later said buses and ambulances had begun entering the government-held villages of Foah and Kefraya. But no confirmation of any evacuations were available late Sunday. \"Reckless armed men burning buses for Foua and Kefraya undermine evacuation and relief for all civilians in besieged areas in Syria,\" Jan Egeland, chairman of a U.N. Syria task force, said on Twitter. He said the \"cowardly terrorists\" had killed a bus driver. Obama: 'I always feel responsible' for Aleppo Also Sunday, Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said his country would veto a \"disaster\" of a resolution put forward by France to deploy a\u00a0United Nations monitoring mission in Aleppo to oversee evacuations. Russia then circulated its own draft resolution calling on the UN to make \"arrangements\" to monitor conditions but with no mention of deploying monitors on the ground, France 24 reported. Aleppo has been the scene of a humanitarian crisis for months as rebel forces cling\u00a0to eastern sections of the city amid a onslaught from government troops backed by Soviet firepower. The situation further eroded Friday, when a\u00a0plan to evacuate the rebel-held enclaves collapsed, leaving civilians stranded along the route with little food and no shelter. Russia has been the focus of much ire from advocacy groups seeking aid for beleaguered Aleppo.\u00a0Syrian human rights and international physician\u00a0groups submitted a report\u00a0last week to the U.N. Commission of Inquiry for Syria, citing Russian responsibility for and complicity in war crimes in the battered city. The groups called on the commission to investigate Russian responsibility for war crimes in Aleppo and to report on its findings in its special inquiry due in March. \"Russia\u2019s airstrikes have targeted schools, hospitals, maternity wards, mosques, homes and ambulances,\" the groups warned. \u201cRussia has air-dropped incendiary weapons and cluster munitions on heavily populated civilian areas. Not even rescue workers or aid providers have been spared Russia\u2019s strikes.\u201d 19 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hWfgPT ",

Civilians, trying to escape the shells that kept falling on a ravaged city, turned to Twitter and WhatsApp to plead: \u201cPlease, save us.\u201d Syria\u2019s nearly six-year-long civil war took another brutal swing last week as attempts to evacuate Aleppo, a city that government forces are poised to recapture, repeatedly broke down . Warplanes bombed insurgent-held areas as trapped residents tried to flee in a chaotic and dangerous relocation effort. \u201cEverybody has been watching helplessly as this conflict unfolds,\u201d an analyst said. \u201cThey are watching civilians being massacred mercilessly and all they can do is tweet about it and sign petitions.\u201d _____ Photo Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times 5.

Her parents are watching , with both pride and alarm, as their Syrian children transform into Canadians. Something as simple as a school field trip can become a flash point: For refugees torn away from a world they loved, adapting to a new one without losing their identities is a fraught balancing act. _____ Photo Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times 6. The slow burn of climate change is driving West Africans to cross the Sahara, risking their lives, to find a new place where they can earn a living \u2014 away from the droughts and heat that have blighted land where crops once grew. Nearly half of Niger\u2019s young children are malnourished. The continent is growing hotter, wreaking havoc on food supplies, but those who try to leave have nowhere to go. As wary nations close their borders to migrants, policy makers see little chance that refugee protections will be expanded to cover the climate\u2019s casualties. _____ Photo Credit Gene Arias/NBC, via Getty Images 7.

Matthew Brown / AP Share advertisement As Donald Trump continues to announce administration roles, environmental experts and advocates are sounding the alarm over what they say are \"extreme\" selections that will put the government at odds with science and the health of the Earth. \"I think what we're seeing is the most hard-right ideological, fossil fuel-oriented Cabinet appointments we've ever seen,\" David Goldston, Director of Government Affairs at the National Resources Defense Council told NBC News. Trump's selection of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency was a major concern for Goldston and Christine Whitman, the former EPA Administrator under President George W. Bush from 2001-2003 and a former Republican governor of New Jersey.

Smith / AFP - Getty Images \"This is someone who has sued the agency numerous times,\" Whitman said. \"He seems to have a generalized disdain for the rule making body and that's what it does, it's a regulatory agency.\" Pruitt has sued the agency multiple times and is currently one of a group of attorneys general leading a suit against the Obama Administration's rules to curb carbon emissions. He also said in a 2014 op-ed that the debate over mankind's role in climate change \"is far from settled.\" \"You look at that set up and it's not a recipe for optimism\" And Trump's picks of former Texas Governor Rick Perry f or secretary of energy and Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke for secretary of the interior have also expressed skepticism over climate change science or the degree to which human beings are culpable for its acceleration. Perry also sits on the board of a few oil companies, including Energy Transfer Partners, the firm that was pushing to build the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe. Related: Skeptics Rip Rick Perry as Trump's Pick to Lead Department of Energy \"It's an alarming set of picks in terms of both the influence that fossil fuel interests will have in this administration, but also the lack of balance terms of picks that will protect public health and clean energy,\" Jeremy Symons, Associate Vice President of Climate Political Affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund told NBC News. \"You look at that set up and it's not a recipe for optimism,\" said Jody Freeman, a former counselor for energy and climate change in the Obama White House and director of Harvard's Environmental Law Program. \"I think there's this undercurrent of threatening the legitimacy of climate science and I think that's very dangerous.\" Experts told NBC News that, while a Trump Administration could take steps to seriously undermine key gains made under the Obama Administration, there were still significant legal constraints on what it could do to unravel major, longstanding environmental protections.

Related: Breaking the Ice: Obama Seeks to Cement Climate Change Legacy Despite the variations in his statements, Freeman said, \"the proof is in the pudding, and that means we ought to look at who he picks to run the essential agencies.\" Mike Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, echoed the sentiment, saying we should look at the track record of Trump's appointees. \"If you look at the track record of these people, we're likely to see attempts to roll back clean air regulations, clean water regulations, endangered species protections and also pulling back or altering our international efforts,\" he said.

Goldston said that while Trump would face a long and arduous process if he wanted to completely back out of the climate agreement, he could take the route of \"making it harder for the United States to meet its obligations.\" And many have noted that just because Trump voters wanted \"change\" of some sort, that doesn't mean they are clamoring for an anti-environmental agenda. \"In no way did the election give Trump or these nominees or his allies in Congress a mandate to undermine recent environmental progress or bedrock environmental protections,\" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice president for government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. \"People did not realize what was at stake.\" The Eiffel Tower is lit in green and illuminated with lettering reading \"The Paris accord is done\" on Nov. 4, 2016, to celebrate the first day of the application of the Paris climate accord. Patrick Kovarik / AFP - Getty Images The climate deal was negotiated by more than 190 nations in Paris last year, and requires all participating nations to reduce greenhouse emissions with the goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures \"well below\" 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit from pre-industrial times to the end of this century. Scientists have said the consequences of climate change and rising global temperatures include more intense heat waves, rising sea levels, loss of glaciers, more powerful storms and habitat loss. \"If you look at the track record of these people, we're likely to see attempts to roll back clean air regulations, clean water regulations, endangered species protections and also pulling back or altering our international efforts\" Freeman added that Trump could undermine the U.S.'s commitment by \"just failing to push forward on things like the Clean Power Plan and other plans to cut our green house emissions.\" Obama unveiled the Clean Power Plan in 2015 with the aim of reducing carbon pollution from power plants. The Supreme Court stayed implementation of the plan in February pending judicial review, prompted by the lawsuits Pruitt supported. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is currently considering the legality of the rule. Related: Obama Caps Environmental Legacy With Paris Climate Change Deal Trump could have several paths to rolling back the plan, based on the court's decision, Freeman wrote after the election , but he could still potentially face legal battles. Freeman added that she \"wouldn't be surprised\" if the current administration's moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands , announced in January, were lifted \"fairly quickly\" as it did not go through as lengthy of a rule-making process. Activists have also expressed concern over the fate of the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline and privatization of tribal lands. Earlier this month, Trump's transition team came under fire from Native American environmental activists for a proposal to privatize up to 56 million acres of tribal lands for resource extraction.

Police said they stopped the van with British plates on Saturday evening, near the town of Novska, by the border with Bosnia. Some of the migrants were packed in the van's cargo compartment, police said. Two Bulgarian citizens are under criminal investigation for smuggling the migrants, the police statement said. It said the van was headed west, toward the capital Zagreb and on toward western Europe. Thousands of migrants are stranded in neighboring Serbia looking for ways to reach EU countries Croatia or Hungary . Many turn to people smugglers to take them illegally across the borders.

Baylen / Los Angeles Times UCLA graduate student Andrew Gutierrez III talks with eight-grader Avani Green during class at Horace Mann Middle School, which has a new partnership with UCLA and is now called Horace Mann UCLA Community School. UCLA graduate student Andrew Gutierrez III talks with eight-grader Avani Green during class at Horace Mann Middle School, which has a new partnership with UCLA and is now called Horace Mann UCLA Community School. (Liz O. Baylen / Los Angeles Times) Anna M. Phillips and Sonali Kohli Contact Reporters When Horace Mann Middle School principal Orlando Johnson thinks about the eighth-graders he sent off to high school last year, he worries about how they will\u00a0fare. Only about 1% of Horace Mann students in that grade and the ones below it tested at\u00a0grade level in math. At the end of the year, the eighth-grade math teacher was dismissed for ineffective teaching. Sixth- and seventh-graders, meanwhile, were learning math from long-term substitutes.\u00a0 Johnson wanted to fill\u00a0the vacancies,\u00a0but teachers weren\u2019t lining up to work at one of the lowest performing schools in L.A. Unified. \u201cI felt almost like a failure as a principal because I was sending kids off to high school without a solid math foundation,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said. Prospects have improved\u00a0for Mann students this year. UCLA\u00a0has formed a partnership with the school, now called\u00a0Horace Mann UCLA Community School, that includes\u00a0 an effort to change the school\u2019s image , and plans to expand\u00a0so that\u00a0the campus eventually will\u00a0serve grades 6 to 12,\u00a0and potentially elementary\u00a0grades\u00a0as well. The new eighth-grade math teacher\u00a0is on the faculty of UCLA\u2019s Graduate School of Education. A UCLA doctoral student is teaching sixth-grade math. And UCLA undergraduates are tutoring Mann students. As the district struggles with financial woes and an enrollment crisis, universities including UCLA and Loyola Marymount are stepping in to help. In exchange, they are gaining a significant say in how the schools are run, winning some of the freedom that charter schools enjoy, including\u00a0having a say in\u00a0teacher hiring and curriculum choice. UCLA\u2019s partnership with Mann in South L.A. is the university\u2019s second foray into the school district.\u00a0The first UCLA Community School\u00a0opened in 2009\u00a0on the site of the old Ambassador Hotel in Koreatown,\u00a0on the campus of Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools. For Loyola, expansion has come in response to the popularity of Playa Vista Elementary School , which it operates in conjunction with the school district. On Tuesday, the LAUSD school board approved a new middle school in the Westchester neighborhoodthat would give preference to children already attending\u00a0Playa Vista. The middle school, which does not yet have a name, is expected to serve as a teacher training ground for Loyola\u2019s students. \u201cThe field of education is changing. Universities and K-12 systems can\u2019t work in isolation anymore,\u201d said Manny Aceves, an associate dean at the LMU School of Education. \u201cThe days of learning to become a teacher at university, those days are not really the way we want to approach things anymore. We truly feel we can prepare educators in a much stronger way at local school sites.\u201d For district officials, part of the appeal of these university partnerships\u00a0is the possibility that they will encourage families to keep their children in L.A. Unified schools. When the first UCLA Community School opened, the district was feeling newly threatened by the arrival of charter schools. \u201cIt\u00a0was a very new movement, People didn\u2019t really know how it was going to play out in L.A.,\u201d said Karen Quartz, research director for the UCLA community schools. \u201cAnd so the university\u00a0wanted to be part of this alternative reform effort that would be inside [the district].\u201d Mann\u2019s enrollment has been hit hard as the number of charter schools\u00a0in South L.A. has mushroomed. Although the campus was built for about 1,500 students, today fewer than 400 attend Mann. The district has turned some of the empty classrooms over to one of the\u00a0charter schools. LAUSD\u2019s board approved\u00a0the partnership between UCLA and Mann\u00a0in October, and on a recent visit it appeared the university was already making its presence felt.\u00a0Multiple UCLA education school faculty members\u00a0serve on the school\u00a0design team, helping to plan curriculum and teacher development. One UCLA graduate student researcher co-teaches the school's first ethnic studies class, while another holds after-school seminars and surveys students about safety, classroom instruction and school climate. At first,\u00a0Johnson said some\u00a0Mann teachers were apprehensive. \u201cThey felt like, \u2018oh, somebody else is coming in \u2026 to tell us how to do it. And then they\u2019re not going to succeed and they\u2019re going to leave in a year or two.\u2019 That\u2019s what they were afraid of,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cI think [UCLA]\u00a0earned a lot of respect when they started to work with us before the ink was even dry.\u201d\u00a0 In Westchester, Loyola\u2019s partnership with the district to open a new middle school has become the focus of a heated battle between families in Playa Vista who have greeted the school with enthusiasm, and their neighbors in Playa del Rey and Westchester, who say the district\u00a0has excluded them. At the center of this fight is well-off families\u2019 resistance to the idea of sending their children to their zoned middle school, Orville Wright Engineering and Design Magnet , which is under-enrolled and has struggled to counter its reputation for low academic achievement. Many of the families who live near the school choose to leave the district, enrolling their children in charter or private schools\u00a0or\u00a0seeking permits to attend the nearby El Segundo Unified School District. Under the district\u2019s plan, Playa Vista Elementary School students will be given an admission preference at the new middle school, virtually assuring them seats\u00a0in what has been billed as an extension of their high-performing, science and technology-focused school. If these students do not fill the 150-seat sixth- and seventh-grade classes opening next fall on the campus of the old Westchester High School, children from nearby neighborhoods will be permitted to enroll. At public hearings, Playa Vista parents have praised the district for opening a new school, but other families have expressed disappointment and anger. \u201cWhen those tiered admission priorities came out, it was a slap in the face,\u201d said Christina Nairn, 39, a Westchester resident who hopes eventually to\u00a0send her kindergartner to Loyola\u2019s new middle school but is considering leaving for the El Segundo\u00a0school district. \u201cWe\u2019re being told. \u2018It\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s for them, but we\u2019re going to put the school in your community.\u2019\u201d District officials\u2019\u00a0explanation\u00a0that they are trying to create a \u201cpathway\u201d for Playa Vista students to continue in a school similar to the one they will have graduated from\u00a0has failed to quell the\u00a0discontent. School board member Monica Ratliff said the area's affluence may have been in factor in the district's decision to open the school in Playa Vista. \u201cIt feels a little bit like based on socioeconomics and based on LMU, this is happening here,\u201d she said, \u201cwhereas in other areas where we have the beginnings of pathways, they aren\u2019t getting anywhere.\u201d L.A. Unified\u2019s partnerships with universities have not always gone smoothly. In 2007, USC\u2019s Rossier School of Education took on the challenge of trying to improve\u00a0Crenshaw High School\u2019s academics. But\u00a0the university walked away from the collaboration\u00a0after five years, too frustrated with the school district to continue, according to an essay by the school\u2019s dean published earlier this year. The university has since founded a\u00a0 network of three charter schools , with\u00a0 two more expected to open next year in Pico-Union and East Los Angeles. Frances Gipson, the district\u2019s chief academic officer, said LAUSD wants to increase the number of schools linked to reputable universities. \u201cCan I tell you how many of each type of school we will\u00a0have in the near future? Not at this time. But we\u2019re actively pursuing partnerships,\u201d she said.

They tried to hack into our system repeatedly,\" Brazile told ABC's Martha Raddatz in an exclusive interview on \"This Week\" Sunday. Obama said at a press conference Friday that Russia's \"tampering\" with the U.S. election process stopped in early September after he spoke to Putin at an international conference. \"In early September when I saw president Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out, and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn't,\" Obama said. \"In fact we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through Wikileaks had already occurred.\" Brazile said she supports Obama's call for a thorough investigation of the hacking but she lamented the administration\u2019s failure to protect the party and its infrastructure. \"We were attacked by a foreign adversary, and I think it\u2019s the responsibility of the government to help individual citizens -- as well as institutions, nonprofits, corporations -- to protect us,\u201d she said. Hillary Clinton: Putin's Alleged Involvement in Democratic Hack Stems From 'Personal Beef' While critical of President Obama, Brazile also slammed President-elect Donald Trump, accusing him of using information obtained in the hack to \"sow division\" during the campaign. \"The emails were weaponized,\" the Democratic chair said of the thousands of emails that were hacked from the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign staff and then released publicly. \"Donald Trump used this information in ways to also sow division. I was very disappointed in his repeated usage some of the stolen information. He used it as if he received daily talking points.\" But Brazile refused to blame Russia\u2019s interference in the election for Democrats\u2019 loss. \"I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat what happened on Election Day. We, the Democratic Party have a lot of things that we have to do. Donald Trump cracked the blue wall,\" she said, referring to the once reliably Democratic-voting states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. \"He cracked the blue wall. We had a blue wall; we should\u2019ve maintained it.\" Brazile, who took over as chair months after the cyberattacks had begun, also accepted that the DNC was partly responsible for the hack after leaving itself vulnerable to this kind of intrusion. \u201cThere\u2019s no question; I took full responsibility \u2026 I spent the entire month of July, all of August, apologizing because of the leaks,\u201d she said, while highlighting the \u201cappropriate steps\u201d the party took to prevent another attack afterwards. She added that although she is outraged by the hacking, the country needs to look to the future to ensure it doesn't happen again. \u201cI\u2019m still outraged by it,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cBut I want to make sure that this never happens again because this country deserves to have the kind of cybersecurity experts involved to make sure that our homeland is protected.\" In particular, she sent a letter to Congress on Sunday on behalf of the DNC, asking for an independent, bipartisan commission to study the entire episode. 0 Shares ",

One of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first, and defining, acts next year could come on Republican legislation to cut off taxpayer money from Planned Parenthood.

He said \"millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood,\" but also endorsed efforts to defund it. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File) 0 Shares Email One of President-elect Donald Trump's first, and defining, acts next year could come on Republican legislation to cut off taxpayer money from Planned Parenthood . Trump sent mixed signals during the campaign about the 100-year-old organization, which provides birth control, abortions and various women's health services. He said \"millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood,\" but he also endorsed efforts to defund it. Trump once described himself as \"very pro-choice .\" Now he's in the anti-abortion camp. Still, the Republican has been steadfast in calling for repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law, and the GOP-led Congress is eager to comply. One of the first pieces of legislation will be a repeal measure that's paired with cutting off money for Planned Parenthood. While the GOP may delay the impact of scuttling the law for almost four years, denying Planned Parenthood roughly $400 million in Medicaid funds would take effect immediately. \"We've already shown what we believe with respect to funding of Planned Parenthood,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters last month. \"Our position has not changed.\" Legislation to both repeal the law and cut Planned Parenthood funds for services to low-income women moved through Congress along party lines last year. Obama vetoed it; Trump's win removes any obstacle. Cutting off Planned Parenthood from taxpayer money is a long-sought dream of social conservatives, but it's a loser in the minds of some GOP strategists. Planned Parenthood is loathed by anti-abortion activists who are the backbone of the GOP coalition. Polls, however, show that the group is favorably viewed by a sizable majority of Americans \u2014 59 percent in a Gallup survey last year, including more than one-third of Republicans. \"Defunding Planned Parenthood as one of their first acts in the New Year would be devastating for millions of families and a huge mistake by Republicans,\" said incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Democrats pledge to defend the group, and they point to the issue of birth control and women's health as helping them win Senate races in New Hampshire and Nevada this year. They argue that Trump would be leading off with a political loser. But if he were to have second thoughts and if the Planned Parenthood provision were to be dropped from the health law repeal, then social conservatives probably would erupt. \"They may well be able to succeed, but the women of America are going to know what that means,\" said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., citing reduced access to services Planned Parenthood clinics provide. \"And we're going to call Republicans on the carpet for that.\" At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, may oppose the effort. Collins has defended Planned Parenthood, saying it \"provides important family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive health care services to millions of women across the country.\" She voted against the health overhaul repeal last year as a result. Continued opposition from Collins, which appears likely, would put the repeal measure on a knife's edge in the Senate, where Republicans will have a 52-48 majority next year. Senate GOP leaders could afford to lose just one other Republican. Anti-abortion conservatives have long tried to cut Planned Parenthood funds, arguing that reimbursements for nonabortion services such as gynecological exams help subsidize abortions. Though Planned Parenthood says it performed 324,000 abortions in 2014, the most recent year tallied, the vast majority of women seek out contraception, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases , and other services including cancer screenings. The drive against Planned Parenthood picked up steam in 2015 after an anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress released secretly-recorded videos that it claimed showed Planned Parenthood officials profiting from sales of fetal tissue for medical research. The measure, however, would strip Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding for only a year, a step taken to give time for continued investigations of Planned Parenthood's activities. A House panel is still active, but investigations by 13 states have been concluded without charges of wrongdoing. Planned Parenthood strongly denied the allegations and no wrongdoing was proved, but the group announced in October that it will no longer accept reimbursement for the costs involved in providing fetal tissue to researchers. The defunding measure would take away roughly $400 million in Medicaid money from the group in the year after enactment, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and would result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care. One factor is that being enrolled in Medicaid doesn't guarantee access to a doctor, so women denied Medicaid services from Planned Parenthood may not be able to find replacement care. Planned Parenthood says private contributions are way up since the election, but that they are not a permanent replacement for federal reimbursements. \"We're going to fight like hell to make sure our doors stay open,\" said Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Erica Sackin. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 18, 2016 11:24 PM EST Hungarian-born actress and socialite Zsa Zsa Gabor has died, her publicist tells CBS Los Angeles . She was 99.\u00a0 The middle and most famous of the sisters Gabor died Sunday of a heart attack at her Bel-Air home, her husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, said. Gabor faced failing health in recent years . In July 2010, von Anhalt told\u00a0 ET Online \u00a0that she was having a feeding tube inserted so she could get the nutrients she needed. Gabor\u00a0 broke her hip \u00a0earlier that month when she tumbled out of bed while watching television, trying to answer a telephone at her Bel-Air home. In a statement, her former publicist Edward Lozzi confirmed her death and said she is \u201cfinally out of her misery.\u201d \u201cFor the past five years, Zsa Zsa has suffered chronic dementia, locked away in her mansion laying in a hospital bed being fed through tubes in her naval, not able to speak, see, write or hear. Nor knowing who she was or how famous she was,\u201d he said. \u201c...Zsa Zsa did not suffer fools well. That fact, along with her European post-war survival techniques inspired by her mother, Zsa Zsa Gabor was one tough cookie.\u201d Gabor was the only survivor of the trio of acting Gabor sisters. Her sister Eva died in 1995 and Magda in 1997.\u00a0 She has rarely been seen in public since she was partially paralyzed in a 2002 car accident. Gabor also suffered a stroke in 2005. View Gallery The Gabor sisters -0 \u00a0Zsa Zsa, left, Magda, center,  and Eva 0- are seen in this 1955 black-and-white photo. All three Hungarian-born stars became famous in the U.S.\u00a0 AP Graphicsbank Gabor took her first husband when she was 20 in 1937. She attracted the attention of nine husbands including hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and Oscar winning actor George Sanders.\u00a0 Gabor had one child, Francesca Hilton, from her marriage to hotelier Conrad Hilton. (She would allege the child was conceived after Hilton raped her.) In later years, Gabor, von Anhalt and Francesca battled in court over family finances. Francesca Hilton died of an apparent stroke in 2015. Her first seven marriages ended in divorce. Her marriage to her eighth husband, Mexican attorney Felipe de Alba, was annulled, reportedly because her previous marriage was not properly ended. Sari Gabor -- Zsa Zsa is a family nickname -- was born in Budapest in 1917, according to a finishing school yearbook kept by a former classmate. Various references over the years have given other birth dates; Gabor usually avoided the subject. She was still in Hungary when she won a beauty contest and married and divorced a Turkish diplomat, Turhan Belge. Gabor, sisters Eva and Magda, and their mother, Jolie, emigrated to America around World War II. Zsa Zsa gained notice when she became the wife of Hilton, whom she married in 1942 and by the following decade all the Gabors were celebrities. In 1998, cultural historian Neal Gabler diagnosed her kind of celebrity as \u201cThe Zsa Zsa Factor.\u201d \u201cWhen she first came to fame in the early 1950s, Zsa Zsa wasn\u2019t an actress or a singer or a dancer or an entertainer of any sort,\u201d he observed. \u201cShe was the beautiful wife of actor George Sanders who happened to appear on a quiz show dispensing offhanded advice to lovelorn viewers. By being herself she became such a success that she immediately landed movie roles.\u201d Her film career was, as The Film Encyclopedia notes, \u201cmostly decorative.\u201d Among Gabor\u2019s more prominent credits: as dancer Jane Avril in John Huston\u2019s Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d 1952; and Orson Welles\u2019 classic \u201cTouch of Evil,\u201d 1958. More recently, she appeared in the \u201cNightmare on Elm Street\u201d series and in the \u201cNaked Gun\u201d spoofs.\u00a0 View Gallery Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor holds up a beaded purse removed from a 30-year-old trunk containing possessions from actress Marilyn Monroe on April 11, 1996, at Planet Hollywood in Beverly Hills, California. Kim Kulish/AFP/Getty Images Her love life, meanwhile, rolled on, like a B-melodrama on a double-bill with Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s A-list spectacular.\u00a0 In 1954, Gabor made headlines being seen with Dominican Republic playboy-diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa within weeks of his marriage to dime store heiress Barbara Hutton. Her 1958 romance with Rafael Trujillo Jr., son of the Dominican dictator, became a scandal in Congress. Ohio\u2019s Rep. Wayne Hayes -- eventually caught in his own adulterous affairl -- cited the expensive gifts Gabor was allegedly receiving from the young man to argue that foreign aid for the island nation should be eliminated. Gabor spent three days in the El Segundo jail in 1989 after she was found guilty in a well-publicized trial over slapping the face of a Beverly Hills police officer who stopped her for a traffic violation. \u00a0 When she was freed, she told reporters the jailers were kind but \u201cat first I was petrified. They even took my makeup away.\u201d The great aunt of Paris Hilton and a spiritual matriarch to the Kardashians, Simpsons and other tabloid favorites, she was the original hall-of-mirrors celebrity, famous for being famous for being famous. Starting in the 1940s, Gabor rose from beauty queen to millionaire\u2019s wife to minor television personality to minor film actress to major public character. With no special talent, no hit TV series such as her sister Eva\u2019s \u201cGreen Acres,\u201d Zsa Zsa nevertheless was a long-running hit just being Zsa Zsa -- her accent drenched in diamonds, her name synonymous with frivolity and camp as she winked and carried on about men, dahling, and the droll burdens of the idle rich. She was like popcorn for the public and, for sociologists, the seeming fulfillment of the mindless future imagined in Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d a creation made possible by mass, electronic media; her words and image transcribed and beamed into theaters and living rooms, on the Internet and the shelves of newsstands and supermarket checkout lines. Her secret, in part, was being in on the joke, once saying about a 1956 TV role, \u201cI play a fabulously rich woman who has just bought her fifth husband; she is very unhappy. I won\u2019t tell you who it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d Ever game for a laugh, Gabor spoofed her image in a videotaped segment on David Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Show,\u201d which had the two stars driving from one fast-food restaurant to another, sipping sodas and digging into burgers like they were slabs of wedding cake.\u00a0 Part of Mama Jolie\u2019s advice to her daughters, as recounted in a 1953 Associated Press interview with Zsa Zsa, has a modern touch. She said she told them: \u201cYou must be independent and able to do for yourself. Then you do not have to marry a rich man, you can marry a poor one. And if it is wrong, you can go.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The incident happened around shortly after 2 a.m. in Allentown, The Morning Call reports . The bullet skimmed the woman\u2019s head without penetrating her skull and she had moderate injuries, police told the newspaper. The woman told police she was in a rear room on the second floor of her home when she heard voices in the back of her house, Allentown police Capt. Bill Reinik told the paper. She saw four people when she looked out the window, heard a noise and then felt something hit her head.\u00a0 She was wounded by a bullet from a small-caliber handgun, officers and paramedics discovered, according to Reinik. Detectives determined that the shooting wasn\u2019t random, but targeted, and detectives were working to find out why, Reinik said. \u00a0The woman couldn\u2019t identify the four people she said she saw when she looked out the window. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Gunmen Kill 10, Including Canadian, in Attacks on Police By omar akour and mohammed daraghmeh, associated press KARAK, Jordan \u0097 Dec 18, 2016, 5:49 PM ET 0 Shares Kerak Castle in al-Karak, Jordan is pictured in this undated stock photo. 0 Shares Email Gunmen assaulted Jordanian police in a series of attacks Sunday, including at a Crusader castle popular with tourists, killing seven officers, two local civilians and a woman visiting from Canada, officials said. Several armed men were reported barricaded inside the castle after nightfall, hemmed in by special forces soldiers. At least 34 people, including two foreign nationals, were wounded in the day's violence, which was one of the bloodiest attacks in Jordan in recent memory. Security officials said in a statement late Sunday that at least four gunmen were killed and that troops continued to search the area. The statement said large amounts of weapons had been seized. It made no reference to local media reports that at one point, the attackers had held hostages. The shootings were the latest in a series of attacks that have challenged this pro-Western kingdom's claim to be an oasis of calm in a region threatened by Islamic extremists. The killing of the Canadian tourist could further hurt Jordan's embattled tourism sector, which has declined sharply since the Islamic State group seized large parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq two years ago. Another Canadian was injured in the shooting, Canada's Global Affairs spokesman John Babcock said. \"Canadian officials in Amman are actively working with local authorities to gather additional information and are providing consular assistance to Canadians at this difficult time,\" he said. The Canadian Embassy in Amman issued an alert warning urging Canadians to avoid travel to Karak, a town in central Jordan about 140 kilometers (87 miles) south of the capital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in and near Karak. The chain of events began when a police patrol received reports of a house fire in the town of Qatraneh in the Karak district, said a statement by Jordan's Public Security Directorate. Officers responding to the call came under fire from inside the house, the statement said. Two policemen were wounded and the assailants fled in a car, it said. In another attack, gunmen fired on a security patrol in Karak, causing no injuries, the statement said. Armed men also opened fire on a police station at Karak Castle, a Crusader fort, wounding members of security forces. The statement said five or six gunmen were believed to be holed up inside the castle. In all, seven members of the security forces, two local civilians and the tourist from Canada were killed, security officials said. Fifteen members of the security forces, 17 local civilians and two foreign nationals were injured. Jordan faces homegrown extremism, with hundreds of Jordanians fighting alongside other Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and several thousand more supporting the extremist group in the kingdom. Jordan is a key U.S. ally, and a member of a U.S.-led military coalition fighting IS. Over the past year, gunmen have carried out several attacks on members of the Jordanian security forces and foreign trainers. Earlier this year, Jordanian security forces engaged in a deadly shootout with suspected IS sympathizers in a northern Jordanian town. In the most recent incident, three U.S. military members were killed in a shooting outside an air base in southern Jordan in November. The three were in Jordan on a training mission, and came under fire while driving into the base. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Omar Akour reported this story in Karak and AP writer Mohammed Daraghmeh reported from Gaza City, Gaza Strip. 0 Shares ",

Civilians and rebel fighters are trying to leave the city's eastern half. Youssef Karwashan/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Youssef Karwashan/AFP/Getty Images Syrians walk in the old city of Aleppo Saturday, as pro-government forces worked to re-open previously barricaded roads. Civilians and rebel fighters are trying to leave the city's eastern half. Youssef Karwashan/AFP/Getty Images At least 25 buses entered besieged neighborhoods to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from eastern Aleppo Sunday, Syria's official news agency says \u2014 but that was before an attack on buses elsewhere put all movement on hold. The setback comes after the evacuation effort was halted Friday after just one day , with all sides lobbing accusations at each other. As the evacuation effort drags on, leaving families and civilians in a dangerous limbo due to both the threat of violence and freezing temperatures, the U.N. Security Council prepares to vote Sunday on a resolution that calls for sending international monitors to the city. \"The resolution was drawn up by France,\" NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports for our Newscast unit, \"and calls on the U.N. to send people into the devastated eastern part of Aleppo to monitor evacuations, and make sure they are voluntary.\" The buses that were attacked were slated to help people in two pro-government villages about 35 miles southwest of Aleppo. Under a deal that was reportedly brokered by Iran, Russia and Turkey, some buses and ambulances reached those villages \u2014 Kafarya and al-Foua \u2014 according to both the Syrian Arab News Agency and the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Article continues after sponsorship But then state media and other outlets reported several of the buses had been attacked and burned before they could reach their destination. \"It is not clear which rebel faction attacked the buses, but the area is a stronghold of Al-Qaeda linked forces,\" NPR's Alison Meuse reports for Newscast. In another development, Syria's Cabinet will now include an office for the Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid agency, the country's prime minister announced Sunday . The fall of rebel positions in Aleppo represents both a humanitarian crisis and a key development in Syria's prolonged civil war. But large portions of the country are still being controlled by either rebels, or ISIS, or Kurdish groups. For a look at the broader picture, here's what Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy told NPR's Michel Martin on All Things Considered this weekend: \"It is a turning point. Aleppo is Syria's largest city. The rebels had taken over half of it in the summer of 2012. And controlling a major city in Syria was very important for the rebellion. And their attempt to hold it these last few years became sort of the heart of the revolution in many ways, particularly in the western part of the country. And the taking of Aleppo by the regime is a major setback for the rebels, but it's not going to end the war. \"[Two-thirds] of Syrian territory is outside of Bashar al-Assad's control. Most famously, we have the eastern part of Syria, which is controlled by ISIS, but many of the rebel groups control areas in the northwest, the south. In the northeast, the Kurds and also other Arab tribes control other areas. So Syria's still a fragmented country, and Bashar al-Assad simply just does not have the troops to rapidly retake all those areas. So while Aleppo fell, and it's a victory for Assad, it is not the end of the war. And the dangers that have come out of the Syrian war for Syrians and those in the region and all over the world continue.\" As for what to expect from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump in his handling of Syria, Tabler sees two main possibilities. The first would be that U.S. and Russian military efforts in Syria become better coordinated \u2014 and perhaps allow for safe deliveries of aid to the opposition. The second and more controversial step, Tabler said, could see the U.S. cut off covert aid for rebels in Syria \u2014 a move that could also have deep ramifications for U.S. intelligence efforts in the area.

    "text": "CIA analyst: Saddam Hussein 'seemed clueless,' was 'inattentive' leader Published               December 18, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Saddam Hussein was an inept dictator during his final years in charge, thought 9/11 would bring Iraq and America closer together and took partial blame for his eventual fall from power after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, according to a new book by one of the men who interrogated the ex-Iraqi president. The revelations are contained in the upcoming John Nixon book \u201cDebriefing the President: The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein.\u201d Nixon was a CIA analyst in Iraq who had been assigned the task of finding Hussein, and then getting information out of him. But he quickly found that \u201cSaddam seemed clueless.\u201d \u201cHe was inattentive to what his government was doing, had no real plan for the defense of Iraq and could not comprehend the immensity of the approaching storm,\u201d Nixon wrote in the book excerpt published by The Daily Mail. SADDAM WHINED ABOUT SCRAPES AND BRUISES, BOOK SAYS Hussein, who was hanged and killed in 2006 for crimes against humanity, was frequently defiant while being interviewed and even mocked the U.S. rationale for the war: that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. \u201cYou found a traitor who led you to Saddam Hussein. Isn\u2019t there one traitor who can tell you where the WMDs are?\u201d Hussein said shortly after he was found hiding, dirty and grizzled, inside an underground \u201cspider hole\u201d on Dec. 13, 2003. The sadistic despot said Iraq had never thought about using WMDs and questioned why \u201canyone with full faculties\u201d would deploy chemical weapons unprovoked. \u201cIraq is not a terrorist nation,\u201d Hussein told Nixon during one session. \"We did not have a relationship with [Usama] bin Laden, and did not have weapons of mass destruction... and we\u2019re not a threat to our neighbors. But the American president [George W. Bush] said Iraq wanted to attack his daddy and said we had \u2018weapons of mass destruction.\u2019\u201d Asked about the 1988 Halabja massacre, in which thousands of mostly Kurdish civilians were killed by Iraqi chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, Hussein grew angry. \u201cThen he turned to me and sneered: \u2018But I did not make that decision,\u2019\u201d Nixon wrote. The carnage in Halabja allegedly infuriated Hussein, not because of the thousands killed, but instead, because it provided Iran with a propaganda coup. Hussein could also be candid, Nixon wrote, and did not absolve himself of all responsibility for his downfall. \u201cThe spirit of listening and understanding was not there \u2013 I don\u2019t exclude myself from this blame,\u201d Hussein said of his frequently antagonistic relationship with the international community. As Nixon questioned Hussein, he said it became clear the CIA profile of the Iraqi leader had been wrong on many fronts. \u201cI asked about the CIA\u2019s belief that Saddam suffered great pain from a bad back and had given up red meat and cigars,\u201d Nixon wrote. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t know where I was getting my intelligence, but it was wrong. He told me he smoked four cigars every day and loved red meat. He was also surprisingly fit.\u201d A little more than four months after 9/11, President Bush named Iraq as a member of the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d during his State of the Union address. Hussein, however, had initially assumed the Al Qaeda-directed terror attacks would bring the U.S. and Iraq closer together. Hussein had believed his secular government would be seen by America as an ally in the war on fundamentalist terror. Instead, fewer than two years after the attacks, the U.S.-led coalition deposed Hussein. Advertisement ",

(Dec. 15) AP WASHINGTON \u2014 Aides to President-elect Donald Trump accused their critics Sunday of trying to use the upcoming Electoral College vote as part of an effort to de-legitimize the president-elect's victory. \"The whole thing is a spin job,\" incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told Fox News Sunday. \"And I think what the Democrats ought to do is look in the mirror and face the reality that they lost the election.\" Citing attempted recounts in key states as well as efforts to get Trump electors to vote for someone else, Priebus said anti-Trump political groups are\u00a0\"doing everything they can to de-legitimize the outcome of the election ... Nothing is going to change.\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, speaking on CBS' Face The Nation, denounced the \"nonsense\" surrounding Monday's vote of the Electoral College, and said those who are urging electors to vote against Trump are undermining\u00a0a democratic election. Priebus and Conway, like Trump himself, also continued to dispute the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in an effort to help Trump win, a cyber attack project probably approved by President Vladimir Putin. Different agencies are saying different things about the plot, Priebus said, and there is no evidence Russian activity changed the results of the election. Members of the Electoral College\u00a0and others \u2014\u00a0almost all of them Democrats \u2014\u00a0are calling for at least a delay of Monday's vote, citing reports that Russia intervened in the election by hacking the emails of Democratic officials. A group of electors have requested a classified briefing on the Russia allegations before the Electoral College vote,\u00a0though there is no sign there will be a delay. \"This is about protecting democracy,\" said Rhode Island Democratic elector Clay Pell, also speaking on Fox News Sunday. Pell added, though: \"Donald Trump will be re-elected as president tomorrow.\" Read more: Electors\u2019 lawyer: Founding Fathers \u2018anticipated\u2019 Trump A coalition of outside groups are financing a half-a-million ad buy over the weekend, seeking to pressure Republican electors to vote for someone other than Trump. Some are not urging a vote for Clinton, but another Republican like Ohio Gov. John Kasich. An organization called\u00a0Hamilton Electors said in a statement Sunday it wants college members \"to either vote for an alternative Republican candidate or abstain from voting\" in order to send the vote to the U.S. House of Representatives. Whatever happens, it's hard to imagine Trump losing at this stage. Thanks to victories in once-Democratic-leaning states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, Trump \u2014\u00a0while losing the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes \u2014\u00a0racked up 306 electoral voters, well over the 270 majority needed to win. While critics are trying to get electors to change their votes, some states forbid the practice of \"faithless electors.\" Should Trump somehow fail to get 270 electoral majority, the decision would then go to the House of Representatives \u2014\u00a0which has a Republican majority. Some groups pushing for a delay of the Electoral College vote have suggested some kind of link between the Russian hacking and the Trump campaign, a claim the Trump camp has angrily denied. \"Even this\u00a0question is insane,\" Priebus told Fox News Sunday. \"Of course, we didn't interface with the Russians.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hVF8v8 Most Popular ",

By Greg Jaffe December 18 at 6:16 PM Follow @GregJaffe For eight years, it has been the most exclusive, and arguably most important, daily meeting in Washington. Each morning, President Obama gathers his inner circle for the Presidential Daily Briefing, a run-through of the most important intelligence from around the world. The rules under Obama have been strict and unyielding: No substitutes are permitted if one of the six regular attendees is out sick or traveling. No straphangers are allowed to linger in the Oval Office and watch. Unlike just about every other meeting involving Washington officialdom, this one rarely, if ever, leaks. Now it looks as if the PDB\u2019s status as Washington\u2019s most indispensable briefing could be coming to an end. \u201cI get it when I need it,\u201d said President-elect Donald Trump, who so far is taking the PDB only a few times a week . \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person. I don\u2019t need to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years.\u201d Those remarks have set off fears that Trump could miss a critical piece of intelligence and raised bigger questions about the president-elect\u2019s attention span and interest in foreign policy. Some Democrats have expressed alarm at Trump\u2019s decision not to sit through the PDB each morning with his staff members. \u201cI think it is totally irresponsible in a post-9/11 world,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former senior official in the Obama administration. \u201cIt is a kind of malpractice.\u201d Some Republicans downplayed those concerns, noting that retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, could summarize the intelligence for him. \u201cThat\u2019s a legitimate way to do it,\u201d said Stephen Hadley, who held the same position under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt really depends on how the president likes to take information.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] This much is clear, however: Trump\u2019s decision to skip the morning briefing with his top staff members could upend how big foreign policy decisions are made in Washington and shift the balance of power in a city obsessed with access, influence and power. Not all presidents have summoned their most trusted staff members to the Oval Office for the daily intelligence briefing. President John F. Kennedy received a daily President\u2019s Intelligence Checklist, known as the PICL or \u201cpickle,\u201d which he tucked into his suit jacket and consulted over the course of the day. Other commanders in chief, such as Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, depended on their national security advisers to slog through the PDB for them and fill them in on its contents. President Bill Clinton liked to mark his briefing up with questions and comments for his secretary of state and national security adviser. Perhaps the best-known PDB arrived at the White House on Aug. 6, 2001, and warned \u201cBin Ladin Determined To Strike U.S.\u201d That PDB was prepared in response to questions that Bush had asked his CIA briefer about whether any intelligence reports pointed to a possible al-Qaeda attack inside the United States. Under Obama, who centralized foreign policy decision-making in the White House and loathed leaks, the PDB took on an even larger role. Typically, Obama will read his version of the PDB on his iPad before he sits down with staff members. The actual briefing takes about only 10 minutes each morning, followed by a longer discussion between the president and his immediate staff members. [ President-elect Donald Trump is about to learn the nation\u2019s deep secrets ] A couple of dozen senior administration officials receive a hard copy of the PDB each morning that is also presented by a CIA briefer. \u201cWhen you are out of government and aren\u2019t getting it, you feel like you are operating without oxygen,\u201d said Julie Smith, a former foreign policy adviser to Vice President Biden and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cYou felt left out.\u201d An even smaller group sits down with the president each morning to discuss the briefing and the administration\u2019s top foreign policy priorities. \u201cFor me personally, the most valuable insights I could get about the president\u2019s priorities and views came out of that meeting,\u201d said Smith, who was never admitted to the meeting but would often get a readout from the vice president. Senior White House officials described the daily briefing and the conversation that follows, which lasts about an hour, as a \u201cforcing function.\u201d Most of the issues that cross the president\u2019s desk are domestic in nature. The morning briefing was a guaranteed block of time on Obama\u2019s calendar every day in which he was \u201claser-focused on foreign affairs,\u201d said a senior administration official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal practices. The morning meeting under Obama was more than just an intelligence download. Over time, it became a way for the president \u201cto pull the levers of government in real time,\u201d the official said. Obama would use the briefing to ask questions of his senior staff members or press them for new approaches to the biggest problems of the day. For those on the outside, including Obama\u2019s defense secretary and secretary of state, the morning meeting was also a source of grumbling. Upon leaving government, former defense secretary Robert Gates blasted the Obama White House as \u201cby far the most centralized and controlling in national security of any I had seen since Richard Nixon.\u201d Some of that micromanaging no doubt originated with the morning PDB. Over the past eight years, senior White House staff members have lobbied to get into the Oval Office for the PDB, almost always with no success. \u201cSo much of our time is wasted fighting for seats in meetings,\u201d said a former top White House official who never made it into the morning meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s the currency of our business. We don\u2019t have weapons. We can\u2019t deploy troops. It\u2019s words and seats in meetings. That\u2019s how you determine your value, and if you don\u2019t make the cut it is soul crushing.\u201d Before she lost the election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy team was talking about how she might want to restructure the PDB to suit her leadership style. Among the questions being debated by her team was whether she should include the secretaries of state and defense. Now, a big question is how Trump\u2019s decision not to sit down every day for a top secret intelligence briefing will change the way foreign policy is run in Washington. The absence of a daily meeting will probably shift some power to Cabinet secretaries at the State Department and the Pentagon. \u201cThe president\u2019s input might not come until the end of the process after it has already been chewed up by the bureaucracy,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former CIA analyst. Washington insiders have begun to wonder what the Trump equivalent to the prized meeting will be. \u201cMaybe it is a visit to his penthouse in New York for a meeting or maybe you get to fly with him?\u201d Smith wondered. \u201cMaybe people will be trying to get in Flynn\u2019s office?\u201d Others have speculated whether the CIA might adjust the PDB to better suit Trump\u2019s tastes. The CIA made short films to prepare Reagan, a former actor and well-known film buff, for his foreign trips and overseas summits. Asked where he turned for military advice last year, Trump told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd, \u201cI watch the shows.\u201d Maybe the CIA could use Trump\u2019s love of cable news to better hold his attention, Chollet said. \u201cThey could do a Fox News-style PDB?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that would be more interesting for him.\u201d Read more: ",
