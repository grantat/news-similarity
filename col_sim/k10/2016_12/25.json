    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 23, 2016 8:08 PM EST The UN Security Council passed a resolution 14-0 condemning the construction of Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. The resolution called continuing construction in the Palestinian territory a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international law, and it called on Israel to halt all settlement activities in order to salvage a two-state solution. The U.S. abstained from the vote, in a departure from past U.S. diplomatic practice of vetoing such a resolution in support of Israel.\u00a0 \u00a0 U.N. passes resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, \u201cWe would not have let this resolution pass if it hadn\u2019t addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians.\u201d And she added that the vote \u201cdoes not in any way diminish the United States\u2019 steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.\u201d \u00a0 Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan reports.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades,\u201d Power said. The U.S. abstention was the stunning culmination of years of icy relations between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And it put Mr. Obama in open conflict with President-elect Trump on a key foreign policy matter at a time when they\u2019ve been promising a smooth transition. Netanyahu\u2019s office called the vote \u201cshameful\u201d and said the U.S. \u201cfailed to protect Israel.\u201d Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon argued it will make a peace deal harder. He was also deeply critical of the Obama administration in tweets following the vote.\u00a0 It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share - \u2014 Ambassador Danon (@dannydanon) December 23, 2016 and would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution. \u2014 Ambassador Danon (@dannydanon) December 23, 2016 Danon also said he looked forward to the \u201cnew era\u201d Mr. Trump would bring. I have no doubt that the new US administration will usher in a new era \u2014 Ambassador Danon (@dannydanon) December 23, 2016 Mr. Trump also tweeted after the vote, promising change in January. As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 Congressional leadership also condemned the vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the vote \u201cshameful.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s vote is a blow to peace that sets a dangerous precedent for further diplomatic efforts to isolate and demonize Israel,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who will be the new Senate minority leader, says he has urged the administration to veto the resolution -- \u201can abstention is not good enough,\u201d he wrote in a statement Friday, and he accused the U.N. of \u201cone-sidedness\u201d and an \u201canti-Israel bias\u201d on the settlements issue.\u00a0 Trump \"feels very warmly\" about Israel and Jews, says Netanyahu On Friday, an Israeli official said Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry \u201csecretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel\u2019s back, which would be a tail wind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory.\u201d The official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to be quoted by name, also praised Trump for heading off the resolution on Thursday. Israel knew the U.S. was coordinating an \u201cambush\u201d with the Palestinians, said another Israeli official, who similarly demanded anonymity. A senior Obama administration official fired back, saying Egypt championed the resolution \u201cfrom the start\u201d and crediting \u201cother Security Council members, not the United States,\u201d for the renewed push. Friday\u2019s resolution was sponsored by New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela. The U.S., along with the Palestinians and nearly all of the international community, considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem obstacles to peace. Some 600,000 Israelis live in the two territories, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Mr. Trump has signaled he will be far more sympathetic to Israel. His campaign platform made no mention of the establishment of a Palestinian state, a core policy objective of Democratic and Republican presidents over the past two decades. He also has vowed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, potentially putting the U.S. at odds with the Palestinians and almost the entire remainder of the international community. Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador to Israel, Jewish-American lawyer David Friedman, is a donor and vocal supporter of the settlements.

Wielding scalpels, irons, seam rippers and permanent markers, an undercurrent of logo-conscious shoppers are removing and hiding the decals from their clothing. \"Why would I do someone else's advertising for free?\" Max Ilich, a 47-year-old consultant from New Hampshire told the Wall Street Journal . He painstakingly removes every stitch of the Lacoste crocodile with a scalpel, saying he likes the shirts for their quality but didn't want to be co-opted as a walking billboard. With the iconic Crocodylus porosus as perhaps the sartorial ancestor, clothing logos have evolved and swelled in the past decades. On mid-tier brands like Abercombie & Fitch or Juicy Couture they could take up an entire sweatshirt or posterior. But, perhaps as a sign of a branding backlash, those lines are now pivoting, or struggling. Abercrombie has overhauled its look to revamp its logo and downplay where it appears, and Juicy shuttered all its U.S. stores. Brand-snubbers are trading how-to tips via YouTube videos and online forums. Some don't want to broadcast the brand they're wearing. Some think the the logo mars an otherwise good piece of clothing. Others have a different motive for hiding their brand affiliation. YouTube user Steph Nonsense shared how to take the logo off a pair of Old Navy sunglasses with nail polish remover. \"It makes your cheap sunglasses look less cheap!\" she wrote. It's only a matter of time before a trendy new clothing line capitalizes on the movement. Ben Popken ",

Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. State Department has issued travel warnings to Americans, asking U.S. citizens to consider the risks of terror threats before travel to Egypt or Jordan. Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. State Department issued travel warnings for Egypt and Jordan on Friday, citing terrorist threats in both countries. The State Department recommends that U.S. citizens traveling in Egypt avoid the Western Desert and the Sinai Peninsula beyond the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh. In the case of Jordan, the State Department warned against traveling to and throughout the entire country. At Least 10 Die In Shootout At Crusader Castle In Jordan As NPR's Nate Rott reports, \"Earlier this month, a bombing near St. Mark's Coptic Cathedral in Cairo killed at least 25 people. And just earlier this week, an attack at a popular tourist destination in Karak, Jordan, killed 10\" \u2014 including a Canadian tourist. Those attacks were the biggest in Egypt and Jordan in the last month, but far from the only ones. The Islamic State has claimed credit for both. The State Department reminded U.S. citizens that terrorist organizations in Jordan often target Westerners. \"Within the last year, Jordanian authorities have notified the U.S. Embassy of several disrupted terrorist plots targeting U.S. citizens and Westerners. In addition, terrorist entities continue to express interest in attacking malls, hotels, restaurants, and other soft targets in country.\" The State Department warnings note that, despite heavy security around major tourist sites, terrorist attacks can happen anywhere. The tourism industry in Egypt has suffered in recent years due to political instability, threats of terrorism and accusations of human rights violations by the state. NPR's Malaka Gharib recently wrote about the decline in tourism and its impact on Sharm El-Sheikh, where she spent childhood summers while her father managed the Hilton Fayrouz.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story \u201cThe resolution that was passed by the U.N. yesterday is part of the swan song of the old world that is biased against Israel,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at a Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony honoring wounded soldiers and terrorism victims. \u201cBut, my friends, we are entering a new era and, as President-elect Trump said yesterday, that is going to happen a lot faster than people think.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, in Mr. Trump, Mr. Netanyahu will have a far more supportive ally in the White House than Mr. Obama, who views Israeli settlement policy as counterproductive. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s clarion call supporting Israel on settlements and his promise to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem could easily stir new antipathy among the Sunni Arab states Mr. Netanyahu has been courting most, analysts said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot to imagine an American move that could provoke violence on the ground or just demonstrations on the ground with potential to become violent,\u201d said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy. \u201cAnd that would not only create an Israeli-Palestinian crisis, but it would create a broader Israeli-Arab crisis.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s election and his choice of David M. Friedman , an ardent settlement supporter, as ambassador to Israel have already emboldened the Israeli right to push for more assertive policies in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. Some have even declared the death of the two-state solution that for years was thought to be the way to settle the conflict. Since the American election, pro-settlement leaders in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet have pushed for legislation retroactively legalizing outposts on privately owned Palestinian land that had been declared illegal by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court. Mr. Netanyahu has been reluctant, even warning colleagues that it could lead to an investigation by the International Criminal Court, according to the newspaper Haaretz. \u201cIsraeli leaders have used American pressure as an excuse to avoid doing something they really don\u2019t want to do but are being pressured to do by coalition members,\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel teaching at Princeton University. If Mr. Trump advances views to the right of Mr. Netanyahu, \u201cthis will put the prime minister in an awkward position with no excuses for not doing what right-wingers want him to do,\u201d Mr. Kurtzer said. Now in his fourth term, Mr. Netanyahu has focused lately on keeping the Palestinian conflict relatively contained while he forges new bonds around the world. He travels widely these days, and has just returned from a trip to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, two predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 a demonstration, he said, of Israel\u2019s transformed global relations. He boasts that so many foreign delegations are coming to Israel that he barely has time to meet them all. Even Fiji, he says, wants him to visit. He attributes this to what he calls T.T.P. \u2014 terrorism, technology and peace. Other countries, he argues, see Israel as an ally in fighting Islamist terrorism, a source of technological innovation and not an obstacle to peace, as it was once viewed. If so, though, the unopposed United Nations resolution could chip away at that impression. In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged that his drive to change Israel\u2019s status was incomplete. \u201cWe are on a journey to improve our relations with the countries of the world. It is going to take more time,\u201d he said. Photo Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in his office. Mr. Netanyahu celebrates the ascension of President-elect Donald J. Trump, but may find that it complicates management of his own conservative coalition. Credit Uriel Sinai for The New York Times But he predicted that friends would rally to Israel after the United Nations vote. \u201cIt could be that the scandalous resolution from last night will expedite that process because this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His critics thought not, calling Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s failure to win any support at the Security Council a sign that his diplomatic campaign involved more puffery than progress. \u201cThe man who just a month ago told us that the world worships him declared war this evening on the world, on the United States, on Europe, and is trying to calm us with conceit,\u201d Isaac Herzog, leader of the center-left Zionist Union and the parliamentary opposition, wrote on Facebook . For Mr. Netanyahu, the most important goal has been improving Israel\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, not just Egypt and Jordan, with which it has peace treaties, but with Sunni states like Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. While those states still maintain a public reserve about Israel, they have quietly collaborated out of a shared belief that the greater threat is the theocratic Shiite leadership in Iran. But that could quickly change if the Palestinian issue returns to prominence. Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said in a conference call sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars this past week that an embassy move would prompt the Palestine Liberation Organization to withdraw recognition of Israel that was granted as part of the Oslo peace accords. While many Arab leaders have tired of the Palestinian leadership, they may have to respond if their citizens are stirred to outrage. \u201cIf the street\u2019s reactions get too heated, it will be easier for these Arabs to jettison the Israeli relationship than to stand in the way of their own people\u2019s anger,\u201d Mr. Kurtzer said. That may explain why even some conservatives in Israel are nervous that Mr. Trump may push provocative policies. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, known as a hard-liner, said at a recent Brookings conference that there were other pressing issues aside from moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital. Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the United States from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party, doubted that an embassy move would set off a major backlash, but said an invigorated political right could press for more aggressive policies that would. \u201cIf that were to happen, that would create a problem for Netanyahu,\u201d Mr. Shoval said. \u201cNetanyahu basically does not want to annex all of the West Bank, does not want to rule over the Palestinians. He realizes the risks of that from Israel\u2019s point of view.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, some allies of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s, including Mr. Shoval, argue that common interests will still matter more than momentary flare-ups of the longstanding Palestinian conflict. \u201cEven when you forge new alliances, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be in sync on every issue,\u201d said Dore Gold, a longtime adviser to Mr. Netanyahu who recently stepped down as director general of the Foreign Ministry. \u201cThings go on inside Arab countries that we don\u2019t agree with, and things go on inside Israel that they don\u2019t agree with. But the fundamental interests are aligning.\u201d Some analysts said it might depend on how new initiatives were presented. Ehud Yaari, a commentator on Arab affairs on Israel\u2019s Channel 2, said moving the embassy would not lead to serious problems with Sunni states beyond ritualistic protests. American encouragement of settlement construction in new areas \u201cwould prove much harder for the Sunni leadership to swallow,\u201d he said. Even so, Mr. Yaari added, \u201cArab public opinion may force rulers to demonstrate objections, but it seems they are all relieved to see Obama go and do not want to start on the wrong foot with Trump.\u201d Others suggested that nuanced diplomacy by Mr. Trump could help Mr. Netanyahu. While the right may press for more settlement construction, the Trump administration could endorse keeping any new housing within established blocs, said Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThat would be a major victory for Netanyahu,\u201d Mr. Satloff said. \u201cAnd if linked to real suspension of growth outside the blocs, it may even advance Israeli ties with Sunnis.\u201d Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.

(Photo: A&E) Cable network A&E\u00a0announced Saturday that it's abandoning plans for its controversial documentary series\u00a0Escaping the KKK. In a statement, the network said that it had decided not to air the program after being\u00a0made aware that field producers had made payments to interview subjects in exchange for access, in violation of ethics policies regarding documentaries. \"A&E learned last night from the third-party producers who made the documentary that cash payments \u2014 which we currently understand to be nominal \u2014 were made in the field to some participants in order to facilitate access,\" the statement read. \" While we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of A&E\u2019s policies and practices for a documentary. \u00a0We had previously provided assurances to the\u00a0public\u00a0and to\u00a0our\u00a0core\u00a0partners\u00a0\u2014 including\u00a0the\u00a0Anti-Defamation\u00a0League and Color of Change \u2014 that no payment was made to hate group members, and we believed that to be the case at the time.\u00a0 We have now decided not to move forward with airing this project.\" A&E changes doc series title to 'Escaping the KKK' The eight-hour docuseries was to have premiered Jan. 10. The network added, \"Escaping the KKK was\u00a0intended to serve as a close look at anti-hate extractors focused on helping people leave the Ku Klux Klan \u2014 the racist hate group with a long history of violence against African Americans and others. Our goal with this series has always been to expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms.\" Though this project is shelved, A&E says it is committed to looking for other ways to address the issues of racism and hate. \"Just because this particular show goes away, the issues of hate in America do not,\" the statement says, \"we will still seek to fight hate in America through on-air programming including town halls and documentary programs produced in partnership with civil rights organizations, as well as continue to work with the civil rights community to facilitate a deeper dialogue on ending hate through comprehensive educational and outreach campaigns.\" Escaping the KKK had drawn criticism \u00a0from the get-go. Five days after the network announced plans for the show on Dec 20, it updated the title from Generation KKK\u00a0in an effort to \"ensure that no one can mistake its intent and that the title alone does not serve to normalize the Klan.\" ",

    "text": "WATCH World Leaders Congratulate President-Elect Donald Trump 0 Shares Email An Israeli official on Friday accused President Barack Obama of colluding with the Palestinians in a \"shameful move against Israel at the U.N.\" after learning the White House did not intend to veto a Security Council resolution condemning settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem the day before. \"President Obama and Secretary Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the U.N.,\" the official said. \"The U.S administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel's back which would be a tail wind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory,\" he said calling it \"an abandonment of Israel which breaks decades of US policy of protecting Israel at the UN.\" Earlier he said Israel's prime minister turned to President-elect Donald Trump to help head off the critical U.N. resolution. Although the U.S. opposes the settlements, it has traditionally used its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council to block resolutions condemning Israel, saying that disputes between Israel and the Palestinians must be resolved through negotiations. But after eight years of failed peace efforts during the Obama Administration, Israel has expressed concern the outgoing president would take an audacious step to leave his mark on the region. In recent weeks, the White House had been especially secretive about its deliberations. The Israeli official's admission marked a final chapter in the icy relations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama over the last eight years, and signaled an era of close ties between Israel and the incoming Trump administration. Israel knew even before the Egyptian draft resolution that the White House was planning an \"ambush\" and coordinating it with the Palestinians, said another Israeli official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal diplomatic conversations. Israeli diplomats believe they were misled by the U.S. during a meeting last week between high-ranking Israeli and Obama administration officials in which the U.S. side offered reassurances about its efforts to support Israel but declined to explicitly state that the U.S. would veto such a resolution if it came up. The Israelis told their counterparts that \"friends don't take friends to the Security Council,\" the official said. The Egyptian-sponsored resolution had demanded that Israel halt settlement activities in occupied territories claimed by the Palestinians and declared that existing settlements \"have no legal validity.\" But under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt called off a planned vote in the Security Council hours before it was to take place. In the diplomatic activity ahead of the postponement, both Netanyahu and Trump issued nearly identical statements urging the U.S. to veto the measure. \"After becoming aware that the administration would not veto the anti-Israel resolution, Israeli officials reached out to Trump's transition team to ask for the president-elect's help to avert the resolution,\" the Israeli official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity. On Friday, Egypt said its president had received a call from Trump in which they both agreed to give the incoming U.S. administration a chance to try and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The call came hours after Egypt indefinitely postponed the U.N. vote. A statement from the Egyptian presidency said the two men spoke by phone early Friday and agreed on \"the importance of giving a chance for the new American administration to deal in a comprehensive way with the different aspects of the Palestinian issue with the aim of achieving a comprehensive and a final resolution.\" A senior Palestinian official, speaking anonymously according to protocol, said Egypt didn't consult with the Palestinians about delaying the vote and it was a \"complete shock\" for them. Egypt represents Arab states on the security council. Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, and the two countries have close security ties in a shared struggle against Islamic militants. The Palestinian mission to the United Nations said the Security Council will vote later in the day on the resolution condemning Israel's settlement construction, now sponsored by New Zealand , Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela. The U.S., along with the Palestinians and nearly all of the international community, opposes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as obstacles to peace. Some 600,000 Israelis live in the two territories, which the Palestinians seek as part of a future independent state. Israel captured both areas in the 1967 Mideast war. Trump has signaled he will be far more sympathetic to Israel. His campaign platform made no mention of the establishment of a Palestinian state, a core policy objective of Democratic and Republican presidents over the past two decades. He also has vowed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that would put the U.S. at odds with the Palestinians and almost the entire remainder of the international community, and his pick for ambassador to Israel, Jewish-American lawyer David Friedman, is a donor and vocal supporter of the settlements. The proposed resolution would have been more than symbolic. While it did not call for imposing sanctions on Israel, its language could have hindered Israel's negotiating position in future peace talks. Given the widespread international opposition to the settlements, it would have been nearly impossible for the Trump administration to reverse it. It remained unclear Friday whether the measure would come up for a vote in the council before Obama leaves office. In a Christmas greeting on Friday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said: \"Despite the Israeli occupation, our presence in our homeland and the preservation of our cultural and national heritage are the most important form of resistance in the face of the darkness of a foreign colonialist occupying power.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Time_Sports Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr (4) throws a pass against the Indianapolis Colts during a NFL football game at Oakland-Alameda Coliseum. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) Derek Carr is out indefinitely after suffering a broken right fibula in the Oakland Raiders' 33-25 win against the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday, coach Jack Del Rio said after the game. Carr is scheduled to undergo surgery on Sunday. Del Rio said he had already been ruled out for the regular-season finale against the Denver Broncos. \"It feels like we lost the game,\" linebacker Bruce Irvin told reporters after the game. \"We lost out leader.\" Early in the fourth quarter Saturday, Carr's leg appeared to be pinned when he was sacked by Colts outside linebacker Trent Cole. Carr had to be helped off the field by trainers and was unable to put any weight on the leg when leaving the game. \"It's very sad,\" left tackle Donald Penn said. \"I'm very disappointed in myself because it was my guy that got him. I've been great all year. I was engaged with my guy, I took another step and my foot just slipped from up under me. I wish I could have that play back.\" After being examined on the sidelines, he was later taken off in a cart. Backup Matt McGloin replaced Carr in the game. \"We have faith in Matt and the weapons around him,\" Irvin said. The Raiders held a 33-14 lead at the time of Carr's injury. Carr suffered a right pinkie finger injury earlier in the season but wore a glove and took snaps out of the shotgun formation rather than under center. Oakland can secure the AFC West and a first-round bye if the Kansas City Chiefs lose to the Denver Broncos on Sunday. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 16 A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Confusion Grows Over Trump\u2019s Nuclear Plan After Possible Hint of \u2018Arms Race\u2019 By Meghan Keneally Dec 23, 2016, 3:23 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Putin Responds to Trump's Nuclear Comments 0 Shares Email Donald Trump \u2019s newly announced press secretary tried to clarify his bosses\u2019 stance on nuclear proliferation after a surprising tweet and a reported conversation Trump had with a cable news host. Questions about President-elect Trump\u2019s stance on nuclear arms had been raised throughout the campaign and arose again Thursday when Trump tweeted that the U.S. \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump's meaning in the tweet was unclear, and his spokesman and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer addressed the issue in interviews. On MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Spicer defended Trump\u2019s speaking out on issues before becoming president, saying that he shouldn\u2019t necessarily follow the examples of some other recent presidents-elect who waited until inauguration to weigh in on foreign and domestic policy. Carlo Allegri/Reuters Sean Spicer arrives in the lobby of Republican president-elect Donald Trump's Trump Tower in New York, Nov. 14, 2016. But more confusion arose when MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski reportedly spoke to Trump by phone -- a conversation that was not broadcast -- after Spicer's interview on the show. Brzezinski and her co-host Joe Scarborough recounted her conversation with Trump on the air afterward. \u201cMika asked the president-elect while we had the opportunity what his position was on trying to clarify the tweet yesterday regarding the nuclear arsenal, and the president-elect told you what?\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough said. \u201cLet it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cAnd outlast them all,\u201d Scarborough said. Spicer gave more interviews this morning after that and when asked about the comment Trump allegedly made to Brzezinski, Spicer told CNN, \"That was a private conversation. I was not privy to that.\" \"But the bottom line is this, the president [elect] is going to put our nation's security and safety first. And he's not going to worry about how it's -- he's going to do it. That's what every American should understand, that he's not going to be a passive president. He's going to be active and make sure that our safety is number one,\u201d Spicer said. \"If another country expands theirs, the United States will act in kind,\u201d he said of nuclear arsenals. On NBC's \"The Today Show,\" Spicer said, \"There's not going to be [an arms race] ... because he is going to ensure other countries get the message that he is not going to sit back and allow that. And what's going to happen is they will come to their senses, and we will all be just fine.\" \"There [have] been several countries -- Russia among them -- that have talked about expanding their nuclear capability.\" ABC News' Alana Abramson contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Image CreditChad Batka for The New York Times Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week\u2019s most notable new songs and videos \u2014 and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here . Like this Playlist? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com , and sign up for our Louder newsletter (coming soon!) here . Nine Inch Nails, \u2018Not the Actual Events\u2019 Interactive Maybe this is the anti-Christmas: the Nine Inch Nails release that Trent Reznor promised for 2016, a five-song EP arriving barely under the wire on Dec. 22. Nine Inch Nails is now the team of Mr. Reznor and Atticus Ross as both songwriters and studio band, and they've made a sharp turn away from Nine Inch Nails' 2013 album, the relatively skeletal, electronic and dance-beat-driven \"Hesitation Marks.\" The new songs are furious, grating blasts of guitars and electronics, bristling with noise that arrives from all registers and directions. Mr. Reznor sings\u00a0\u2014 and whispers and rants\u00a0\u2014 about sickness, rot, insanity and annihilation, and about consciousness trapped in crumbling bodies and minds. \"Branches/Bones\" is an electropunk buzzbomb; \"Dear World,\" uses insistently blippy electronic dance music behind what may be a suicide note or the testimony of a splitting personality. \"She's Gone Away\" is a booming, hollow-eyed, two-chord death march eventually flooded by distortion; \"The Idea of You\" pummels one chord and a six-beat rhythm over Mr. Reznor's desperate muttering. And \"Burning Bright (Field on Fire)\" is a slow, pitiless, formidably layered rock stomp that could be about immolation or rebirth. It's Nine Inch Nails at its least melodic and most balefully efficient. JON PARELES Jeremih and Chance the Rapper, \u2018Merry Christmas Lil\u2019 Mama\u2019 Interactive The year\u2019s final high-profile surprise release (I hope) is this holiday collection from two young Chicago stars. They\u2019re a good pair \u2014 both smear out words in complementary fashion, Jeremih with tension and Chance with pointed cool. \u201cI\u2019m Your Santa\u201d is one of the high points here; Jeremih is in full sassy Jackson 5 mode, and Chance is charmingly expository. For the most part, this collection is lo-fi and smooth, but on the title track, which features a bit of Chicago footwork, there\u2019s holiday bite. JON CARAMANICA Josh Groban, \u2018Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u2019 For a while there, Josh Groban owned the Yuletide season: \u201cNo\u00ebl\u201d sold some 4 million copies within just the last few months of 2007, making it that year\u2019s best-selling album. (It has sold a couple million more copies since.) Unlike some other holiday-album success stories (ahem, Pentatonix ), Mr. Groban hasn\u2019t tried to replicate the win. But this season, he found enough time away from his current Broadway gig to record a version of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\u201d luxuriating in the bittersweet pathos of the song. NATE CHINEN Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, \u2018Please Come Home for Christmas\u2019 It\u2019s a bluer Christmas without the soul singer Sharon Jones, who died on Nov. 18 . This Claymation video highlights the power of her voice and the retro-R&B; savvy of the Dap-Kings band; it also has an ecumenical twist. J.P. Kelsea Ballerini with Joey Alexander, \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019 Ms. Ballerini\u2019s voice, sweet, strong and clear, is a natural fit for this Rodgers and Hammerstein holiday staple, which provided the title of Mr. Alexander\u2019s debut album last year. They\u2019re otherwise a bit of an odd couple \u2014 glittery young country spark plug meets soft-spoken jazz pianist, a decade her junior \u2014 but stranger things have happened in the name of holiday synergy. N.C. Dej Loaf and Kodak Black, \u2018All I Want for Christmas\u2019 A gentle, surprisingly touching and warmly nostalgic duet by two of hip-hop\u2019s rising stars. Dej Loaf preaches the virtue of family, and Kodak Black \u2014 out of jail but still facing a criminal sexual conduct charge in South Carolina \u2014 humbly offers thanks for his talents. J.C. Best Coast, \u2018Christmas and Everyday\u2019 A few chords, some sleigh bells and a heavy dollop of reverb: welcome to the new song by Best Coast, released in conjunction with a new holiday special for kids on Amazon. (The special, \u201cAn American Girl Story \u2014 Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas\u201d is a tie-in to the American Girl doll company.) Sonically, it\u2019s Best Coast in classic retro form, evoking a Phil Spector girl group; lyrically it\u2019s a boilerplate message about the power of imagination. \u201cDid you know, when you fall asleep,\u201d Bethany Cosentino sings, \u201cYou can be anything?\u201d She adds: \u201cDreams become reality/On Christmas, and everyday.\u201d N.C. Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra Featuring Wynton Marsalis, \u2018God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\u2019/\u2018Little Drummer Boy\u2019 Last year the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra released an album of recent highlights from Big Band Holidays, its seasonal concert program. This year, in addition to a 10-city tour, the band issued a limited-edition vinyl single in the shape of a Christmas tree. Side A features a surging arrangement of \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\u201d while Side B consists of a stylish \u201cLittle Drummer Boy.\u201d The playing is sharp and committed, and the holiday spirit is palpable. N.C. Robert Glasper Featuring Kim Burrell, \u2018Joy to the World\u2019 The gospel singer Kim Burrell hails from Houston, Tx., which also happens to be the hometown of the keyboardist and producer Robert Glasper. Their collaboration on this ubiquitous Christmas carol is a low-simmering stock, full of comfort and easy charisma. Ms. Burrell sings it entirely in the sweet spot of her range, never showing a trace of strain, and Mr. Glasper adds a sinuous R&B; chord progression, with help from his regular band mates, the drummer Mark Colenburg and the bassist Derrick Hodge. N.C. Julien Baker, \u2018Decorated Lawns\u2019 Jingle Yay! by Julien Baker Julien Baker copes with holiday depression in a gradually self-consoling song for \u201cJingle Yay,\u201d a benefit album for the mental-health service provider Punk Talks . Strumming an acoustic guitar and sometimes joined by a sprinkling of piano, tentative at first, she recalls moving back in with her parents \u2014 \u201cstill haven\u2019t figured anything out\u201d \u2014 and imagines hanging herself with Christmas lights on someone\u2019s decorated lawn. But she finds companionship that pulls her through, just barely, in a chorus that rises to become a small victory: \u201cI loved you more than I hate me.\u201d J.P. Nellie McKay, \u2018WEED (All I Want for Christmas)\u2019 There may not be a more insistent new ode to holiday escapism than the new song by Nellie McKay. It\u2019s a Christmas inducement to light up an aromatic botanical (not frankincense), arranged as a lite-reggae ditty. Ms. McKay sings the melody in tandem with the Minneapolis soul singer Maurice Jacox, and in the video she cheerfully takes her message to the streets of New York, costumed as a cannabis leaf. She can\u2019t help but insert some pointed commentary about the prison-industrial complex, but her main point is more lighthearted, at least on the surface. \u201cYou want the strife of humankind to finally cease?\u201d she raps. \u201cStart getting sublime on the peaceful leaf.\u201d N.C. Stevie Wonder feat. Ariana Grande, \u2018Faith\u2019 Despite the title, and a chorus that declares \u201cHallelujah!,\u201d this isn\u2019t a Christmas song. From the soundtrack of the animated movie \u201cSing,\u201d it\u2019s a joyous, uptempo declaration of love that\u2019s also a very savvy update of 1960s soul and rock, written by the 21st-century producers and hitmakers Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco and Francis Farewell Starlite (a.k.a. Francis and the Lights). The drums have the crispness of hip-hop, but the structure is based in the blues and there are strong hints of Ray Charles, James Brown and the Beatles. Ariana Grande, flirting and swooping up to high notes, may not know those sources first-hand, but Stevie Wonder most assuredly does. J.P. Popcaan, \u2018Christmas Gift\u2019 This year\u2019s most joyfully raunchy holiday number, bar none. Unruly! J.C. Silver Lake Chorus, \u2018Sister Winter\u2019 Sufjan Stevens\u2019s \u201cSister Winter\u201d is a study in regret and estrangement that ends in holiday greetings; it starts out fragile and apologetic but turns hearty. The Silver Lake Chorus, which devises elaborate arrangements of indie-rock songs, makes it a communal a cappella piece full of ethereal oohs and ahs, making way for handclaps and la-las as it prettily revs up. The video clip captures the music-nerd charm of the project, with smiling, slightly rumpled, slightly gawky singers glancing away from the camera\u2019s long tracking shot in a white-walled house without a stick of furniture. J.P. L.E.J., \u2018Game of Bells\u2019 Well, sooner or later someone had to realize that traditional minor-mode \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d could align neatly with the cellos in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theme. The three French women who sing in L.E.J. (also known as Elijay) specialize in clever, precise mashups, and they execute this one neatly, harmonizing or trading phrases and switching between the carol and the theme. The merry tidings get a wry, ominous undercurrent. J.P. Low, \u2018Some Hearts (at Christmas Time)\u2019 Low, a long-running indie-rock band from Duluth, often writes quiet songs that move in slow motion. But \u201cSome Hearts (at Christmas Time)\u201d is far eerier than usual. A lone electric guitar is picked slowly in a sustained electronic ambience, mostly a drone that\u2019s flecked with bits of voices run backwards. With gently keening vocals, the song works out a kind of emotional equation, gazing at peaceful hearts and ones that are tormented even at Christmastime with equally serene sympathy. J.P. Onyx, \u2018Jingle Bells, Shotgun Shells\u2019 Interactive Hip-hop holiday music enthusiasts have a bounty in the new compilation \u201cHip-Hop & R&B; Christmas Gold,\u201d a set of unlikely seasonal music from a wide and not totally orderly range of rap stars and almost-stars. Take this borderline comic Onyx song about holiday hostility \u2014 \u201cSanta wanna know if i\u2019m naughty or nice/I\u2019m in the trap blowing trees with the 40s on ice.\u201d It\u2019s an encouragingly disruptive take on tradition, on a collection that also includes Cam\u2019ron, Camp Lo, Celly Cel(!) and the Ying Yang Twins. J.C. Carla Morrison, \u2018Jes\u00fas\u2019 Interactive The Mexican singer Carla Morrison\u2019s six-track Christmas EP, \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a del Tambor,\u201d includes this new song among familiar ones. It\u2019s a prayer of gratitude and devotion, sung in her pristine soprano, building almost like a power ballad before returning to humility. J.P. Big Freedia, \u2018Make It Jingle\u2019 On the plus side, we have arrived at the point where a New Orleans bounce song can be on the soundtrack of a mainstream Hollywood production (in this case, \u201cOffice Christmas Party\u201d). On the down side . . . well, let\u2019s not dwell on the details. Big Freedia does an effective translation of bounce bawdiness into holiday exuberance. And in the video, every square person who comes into the frame ends up a licentious reveler \u2014 Big Freedia\u2019s powers remain undimmed. J.C. What's Next ",

    "text": "AP December 24, 2016, 3:58 PM More states consider circumventing the Electoral College North Carolina Electors rehearse for tomorrow\u2019s electoral college vote in the North Carolina State Capitol building in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S., December 18, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Drake - RTX2VLBV Email HARTFORD, Conn. -- Frustrated after seeing another candidate secure the presidency without winning the national popular vote, mostly Democratic lawmakers in several capitols want their states to join a 10-year-old movement to work around the Electoral College . In states including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Mexico, legislators have said they plan to introduce legislation that would require their state\u2019s Electoral College voters cast ballots for the presidential candidate who earns the most votes nationwide, regardless of the statewide results. \u201cEvery vote in this country should have equal weight. The Electoral College is a relic of a bygone era, and we need to change this system,\u201d said Connecticut state Sen. Mae Flexer, who filed a bill with several fellow Democrats requiring Connecticut to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Since 2006, 11 states have signed onto the compact, which require their Electoral College voters to cast ballots for the national popular vote winner. In theory it would take effect once it involves states representing at least 270 electoral votes, the threshold to win the presidency. When people vote for president, they are really choosing the electors from the political parties. The college is made up of 538 electors, which corresponds to the number of a state\u2019s seats in the U.S. Senate and House, plus the three votes allotted to Washington, D.C. The states that have already passed legislation to join the group represent 165 electoral votes. Typically reliably Democratic states, the list includes California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and D.C. \u2014 all where Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump. Advocates note the measures have cleared several Republican-controlled legislative chambers, including the Arizona House this year. That bill did not come up for a vote in the GOP-controlled state Senate. The compact wouldn\u2019t benefit any one party, said Patrick Rosenstiel, a consultant to National Popular Vote, the group that has been pushing for the compact since 2006. Rather, the Republican said, it will encourage candidates to campaign in every state, regardless of its politics, and make every voter relevant. \u201cRight now we\u2019ve got a system where the battleground states have all the political influence,\u201d he said. Clinton is the fifth presidential candidate to win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College. She received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, according to an Associated Press analysis Tuesday after vote totals were certified, giving her the largest popular vote margin of any losing presidential candidate and bringing renewed calls to abolish the Electoral College. She benefited from solid wins in populous California and New York, while Trump narrowly won some battleground states . U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said she will introduce legislation in January to do away with the Electoral College through a constitutional amendment, but it\u2019s a longshot. An amendment would have to pass Congress and then be ratified by three-fourths of the states within seven years. Supporters of the compact are aiming to get enough states on board before the 2020 presidential election. Some critics question, among other issues, whether Republicans will have the political desire between now and 2020 to push for national popular vote compacts in their states. The GOP now holds majorities in 33 legislatures. Recent polling shows support for the Electoral College among Republicans is high following Trump\u2019s victory, said Robert Alexander, a political science professor at Ohio Northern University and author of a book on the Electoral College. \u201cCertainly among Democrats, yes,\u201d Alexander said of the will to join the compact. \u201cBut a lot of the state legislatures are controlled by Republicans, and there is way too much uncertainty for them to take that issue on for their own political futures.\u201d If there had been a recent instance of a Republican candidate losing the Electoral College but winning the national popular vote, there likely would be more support from GOP lawmakers for the legislation, Alexander said. According to National Popular vote, in 2016 there were 154 Republicans who sponsored the measures and 162 Democrats. Battleground states like Ohio have little motivation to give up the attention they receive from presidential candidates, Alexander said. And he wondered what would happen if a state with a law binding its electors to vote for the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote \u2014 as is the case in more than half the states \u2014 joins the compact. \u201cWhich would take precedence?\u201d he said. \u201cThe state\u2019s binding law or the interstate compact?\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Stephens Convention Center on August 21, 2016 in Rosemont, Illinois.\u00a0 Getty Images for Wizard World / Daniel Boczarski Todd Fisher said Friday night that his sister is receiving excellent care, but that he could not classify her condition. He had earlier told The Associated Press that she had been stabilized and was out of the emergency room. In a subsequent interview he said many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency are unknown. Fisher, 60, experienced medical trouble during a flight from London and was treated by paramedics immediately after the plane landed in Los Angeles, according to reports citing unnamed sources. Several people who were on the flight tweeted that they saw the veteran \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress receive CPR from passengers who may have been nurses. The plane was then met by paramedics at LAX who provided advanced life support and aggressively treated the patient. United Airlines said that medical personnel met United flight 935 from London to Los Angeles upon arrival Friday and after the crew reported that a passenger was unresponsive. Sources have told CBS News that Fisher was that patient. TMZ \u00a0first reported that Fisher had gone into cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles Times\u00a0 reported \u00a0that Fisher was in critical condition. Actress Anna Akana, who also calls herself a fan of Fisher\u2019s, said she was on the flight and tweeted, \u201cDon\u2019t know how else to process this but Carrie Fisher stopped breathing on the flight home. Hope she\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d She also added that the flight crew and doctor and nurse passengers jumped into action during the episode. Her boyfriend, comedian Brad Gage, tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m in complete shock. @AnnaAkana and I sat in front of Carrie Fisher on our flight from London and she was just taken off the plane by EMTs.\u201d Don't know how else to process this but Carrie Fisher stopped breathing on the flight home.

    "text": "Turnovers, defensive ineptitude plague Bears in another lopsided loss Photos from the Bears-Redskins game at Soldier Field on Dec. 24, 2016. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd on Christmas Eve was a 41-21 loss, the team's 12th this year and the latest reminder of how flawed this Bears group remains. Bad news: Receivers Josh Bellamy, Alshon Jeffery and Cameron Meredith, running back Jordan Howard and left tackle Charles Leno all made tackles Saturday. That's never a good sign with the offense losing the ball over and over and over again. Quarterback Matt Barkley threw five interceptions as the Bears lost the turnover battle for the 10th time this season. But equally disappointing, the defense had few if any answers to slow the Redskins. A week after allowing 451 total yards to the Packers, the Bears were gashed for 478 more yards Saturday, allowing 7.5 yards per play. Within that debacle, the Redskins converted eight of their 13 third-down attempts. Four of those eight conversions came in situations in which the Redskins faced third-and-6 or longer. \"Third-and-long, we've got to be way better than that,\" inside linebacker Jerrell Freeman said. \"Come on, man. We've got to be. When you get them in third-and-long, you have to get the ball back. You have to understand situations, know the route combinations, know what they can give you and what they can hurt you with. And then go make a play.\" Bears could frame summing up 2016, fewer than 10,000 fans filled Soldier Field during the final minutes of Saturday's 41-21 loss to the Redskins in the last game of a lousy season on the lakefront. The McCaskeys should hang that picture in a board room at Halas... In the most fitting holiday photo the Bears could frame summing up 2016, fewer than 10,000 fans filled Soldier Field during the final minutes of Saturday's 41-21 loss to the Redskins in the last game of a lousy season on the lakefront. The McCaskeys should hang that picture in a board room at Halas... (David Haugh) The Redskins' first touchdown came on third-and-9, a 17-yard screen pass from Kirk Cousins to Chris Thompson to beat a Bears blitz. Still, Freeman said, it was more than just a well-timed play call against the extra pressure the Bears brought. \"At the same time, on those screens when you're blitzing, you have to feel that,\" he said. \"You have to know what can hurt you and what can be coming.\" Good news: The best news for Bears fans is that only one line remains on the schedule. But in the spirit of the holidays, it's important to acknowledge at least a couple of bright spots from Saturday's game. So here goes. Both Howard, the rookie running back, and Meredith, the second-year receiver, topped 100 yards against the Redskins. Howard turned his 18 rushes into 119 yards. It was his sixth 100-yard rushing game this season and pushed him to 1,178 yards for the season, just 60 short of Matt Forte's franchise rookie rushing record. Meredith's nine catches went for a career-best 135 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown grab late in the first half. Barkley has appreciated Meredith's development. \"The way he always wants to keep moving after the catch is impressive,\" Barkley said. \"He has grown in a lot of ways in regards to finding open windows and feeling the defense, not just running his route like it says on paper.\" Bears , be careful to differentiate between legitimate progress that offers hope for the future and more of the same, which has had the franchise in a downward spiral for much of the last decade. You cannot make a judgment at the end of this... When digging through the layers of issues affecting the Bears , be careful to differentiate between legitimate progress that offers hope for the future and more of the same, which has had the franchise in a downward spiral for much of the last decade. You cannot make a judgment at the end of this... (Brad Biggs) Extra point: The Bears announced 18,116 unused tickets for Saturday's game, the latest indication of fan apathy as the team pushes to the end of another last-place season. Over the Bears' final four home games, the team had a used-ticket average of 44,867. As a reminder, Soldier Field's capacity is 61,500. With fewer than 10,000 fans hanging around late into the fourth quarter Saturday, the sight of a mostly empty stadium proved jarring in the home finale. \"The fans expect more,\" Meredith said. \"We expect more of ourselves. So we can't blame them.\" Up next: The Bears will make their first visit to U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on New Year's Day, facing a Vikings team that is sputtering to the finish line. After starting the season 5-0, the Vikings are 7-8 and were eliminated from playoff contention with Saturday's 38-25 loss in Green Bay. For whatever it's worth, the Bears claimed the season's first meeting against the Vikings, winning 20-10 on Halloween night at Soldier Field. Final word: \"Obviously it's very disappointing. It's disappointing to everyone, ourselves included. I feel bad for our fans.\" \u2014 Bears coach John Fox.

Sunday Alamba/AP hide caption toggle caption Sunday Alamba/AP Women displaced by Islamist extremists wait for food to be handed out to them at the Bakassi camp in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Boko Haram's uprising has killed more than 20,000 people, and displaced some 2.3 million more. Sunday Alamba/AP In a victorious statement on Saturday, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced the \"long-awaited and most gratifying news of the final crushing of Boko Haram terrorists in their last enclave,\" declaring, \"the terrorists are on the run, and no longer have a place to hide.\" The president congratulated Nigerian troops for \"finally entering and crushing the remnants of the Boko Haram insurgents at Camp Zero,\" deep in the Sambisa Forest in northeast Nigeria. The Sambisa Forest is where it is thought Boko Haram was holding some of the more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April of 2014 from Chibok. The mass kidnapping brought international attention, and sparked the social media movement #BringBackOurGirls. A deal brokered by the Swiss government and the International Red Cross in October freed 21 girls, but some 197 remain missing as of late December, according to The Associated Press. President Buhari said \"further efforts should be intensified to locate and free our remaining Chibok girls still in captivity. May God be with them.\" Though the president's message was celebratory, there are already reports that insurgents are regrouping in Taraba and Bauchi states, south of their stronghold in Borno state. The AP reports that it is unlikely that Nigeria will soon see an end to the deadly suicide bombings and attacks that have plagued the country for years. Article continues after sponsorship Boko Haram's seven-year uprising has killed more than 20,000 people, and driven some 2.3 million people from their homes, creating a massive humanitarian crisis. The United Nations warned last month that 75,000 children were in danger of starving in communities inaccessible because of insecurity. ",

By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd... (Dan Wiederer) \"I just go with whatever the coach calls,'' Howard said. \"I'm always going to have faith.'' All the Bears should want for Christmas this year is a new offensive coordinator. Their list is longer, of course, but starts with the baffling play-caller. The head-scratching, inconsistent reality of the Bears' play-calling made the positive perception shaped this week by an ESPN.com report all the more curious. \"It's not often a 3-11 team gets some respect, but there have been a fair amount of compliments about Bears offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains,'' the story said. Huh? Former Redskin Chris Cooley sounded closer to the truth locals know when the analyst called the Bears the easiest offense to prepare for on  Washington radio station  WTEM-AM. The Bears' only inspiring offensive call that caught anybody off guard came on a fake punt. Fans still awake booed Fox's decision to punt on fourth-and-1 from the 48 and he rewarded the naysayers when the snap went to safety Chris Prosinski , who gained 2 to keep the chains moving. If the Bears bring Loggains back to oversee the development of their starting quarterback in 2017 \u2014 a player not currently on the roster if general manager Ryan Pace takes the smart approach \u2014 they are asking for imbalance. They are rewarding inconsistency. They are settling. Barkley presented evidence worth remembering the next time somebody calls a sports-talk radio station or emails a columnist injecting him into next year's starting quarterback competition. He threw five more interceptions, several showing poor judgment he mostly has avoided. You sensed it might be one of those days when Barkley heaved his first interception into triple coverage. Barkley's fourth-quarter floater picked off by Redskins cornerback Josh Norman also will be hard to forget when evaluating how the quarterback fits into the Bears' future. Speaking of the future, Fox promised progress, which is hard to envision for those who aren't on the McCaskeys' payroll. \"We're closer than people think,'' Fox said. \"Hang with us. ... Better days are to come.'' They cannot get much worse than Saturday. dhaugh@chicagotribune.com Twitter @DavidHaugh Caption Halas Hall Pass: Kyle Fuller's future The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss the future of Bears cornerback Kyle Fuler in their Halas Hall Pass video.\u00a0 The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss the future of Bears cornerback Kyle Fuler in their Halas Hall Pass video.\u00a0 Caption Halas Hall Pass: Kyle Fuller's future The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss the future of Bears cornerback Kyle Fuler in their Halas Hall Pass video.\u00a0 The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss the future of Bears cornerback Kyle Fuler in their Halas Hall Pass video.\u00a0 Caption Bears fans tailgate before Packers game in single-digit temperatures Chicago Bears fans tailgate outside Soldier Field in single-digit temperatures before their team faced the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, Dec. 18, 2016.

(Photo: Don Campbell, The Herald-Palladium, via AP) A major holiday\u00a0winter storm packing heavy snow and the threat of\u00a0blizzard conditions\u00a0was bearing down on the northern-tier states from the Rockies to the upper Midwest and was likely to\u00a0shut down major\u00a0highways in parts of the\u00a0northern Plains as it rolls eastward Christmas Day and Monday. The stretch of Northern\u00a0states could expect blowing snow and drifts from strong winds, possibly in excess of 60 mph,\u00a0making travel hazardous, the National Weather Service warned. In addition, snow and a wintry mix\u00a0were possible from the Great Lakes to the Northeast, with rain and a few thunderstorms likely from the\u00a0lower/mid-Mississippi Valley to the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday, the weather service said. A winter storm was forecast to cause travel concerns on Christmas Day. \u00a0(Photo: AccuWeather) In the West and mountain\u00a0states,\u00a0over a foot of snow was expected in the Sierra, Cascades and parts of\u00a0Utah and southern Colorado, while at least 6 inches was likely in the northern Rockies,\u00a0and high elevations of\u00a0Arizona and Southern\u00a0California, The\u00a0 Weather Channel reported. Several\u00a0inches of snow, possibly heavy at times, was also forecast for low-elevation cities such as Boise, Salt Lake City and Flagstaff, according to The Weather Channel. Over a foot of snow was possible in\u00a0parts of North Dakota, northern and western South Dakota and even as far as northwest Minnesota,\u00a0with at least 6 inches of snow in the high plains of Montana and northern Wyoming. Forecasters warned that many roads, including major interstates, would likely be shut down Christmas\u00a0Day and into Monday in the northern Plains and high Plains, as high winds kicked up blizzard conditions in the area. The Weather Channel also warned of the danger of tree damage and power outages from the high winds and heavy snow. An early-morning snowstorm works its way into the mountains as the clouds envelop the trees south of Glenwood Springs, Colo., on Dec. 23, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Chelsea Self, Glenwood Springs Post Independent, via AP) 116 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2irkoYs NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Robert Allen/Detroit Free Press A line of bushes that previously was straight now slopes toward a nearby street, an indicator of the sinkhole that opened Dec. 24, 2016, in Fraser, Mich., and is endangering the house behind it. (Photo: Robert Allen, Detroit Free Press) FRASER, Mich. \u2014 A sinkhole split open in a Detroit suburb Saturday, partially collapsing a home, endangering other structures and forcing the closure of 15 Mile Road in both directions, police said. The sinkhole is in the same general area as a massive one that opened on the same road in 2004, and authorities said they would have to cut power to almost 900 customers for several hours so electric service could be rerouted around the affected area. It was unclear how large the new sinkhole could be, but the source of the problem begins 55 feet underground, said Lt. Mike Pettyes of the Fraser Public Safety Department. A state of emergency was in the process of being declared for the city, and it was unclear how long would be needed for the area to be stabilized. \"We're kind of in sit-around-and-wait (mode),\" he said. \"A lot of people are convinced that it's just a matter of time \u2014 and it's not if the house is going to come crumbling down, it's when.\" Texas sinkhole swallows two cars, killing a sheriff\u2019s deputy The 1,800-square-foot home with three bedrooms and 2\u00bd baths last sold in 1999 for\u00a0$207,500 and was estimated to be\u00a0worth about $250,000 in 2016, according to Zillow. It was built in 1998 on a little more than a quarter acre lot. The city first received a call about the collapsing home at 6:30 a.m. ET, \"then we realized it was more than just a house problem here,\"\u00a0Pettyes said. No one was injured. \u201cYou get a break in that line; it's just washing away dirt down there. It creates a void. When it creates a void, it moves the dirt out. The ground gives way.\u201d Lt. Mike Pettyes, Fraser (Mich.) Public Safety Department A line of shrubs near the house that previously was straight now slopes toward Eberlein Drive. The house is on the corner, and shingles have buckled. The gutter also was bent. Homeowner Sue Albu said she and her husband awoke to popping noises at 4 a.m. Saturday and two hours later she had trouble opening doors. That's when she called police. Evacuation orders were issued for the house and two neighboring homes. Most of the street was evacuated, and all of the cars moved away, Pettyes said. Some 55 feet underground is an 11-foot-wide sewer line, \"the biggest one they have,\" he said. \"You get a break in that line, it's just washing away dirt down there. It creates a void,\" Pettyes said. \"When it creates a void, it moves the dirt out. The ground gives way.\" DTE Energy, the area's electric and natural gas utility, was dispatched to the sinkhole about 12:20 p.m.\u00a0though no power outages were reported, spokesman John Fosson said. In August 2004, a sinkhole opened up suddenly in the same area when a sewer line collapsed, leaving a hole that was 160-by-60-feet on 15 Mile at the entrance to a nearby subdivision. 'Terrifying' sinkhole nearly swallows Uber driver, family in San Francisco The road was shut down between Moravian and Utica roads while crews repaired it. It reopened nearly 10 months later. John Roach, spokesman for Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's Office, referred to Detroit Water and Sewerage Department officials for comment and they could not be immediately reached. With the road closed, a Macomb County Mobile Command Center and emergency vehicles were in the middle of 15 Mile near the road block. Officers, city workers and a number of neighbors were watching to see if the house sunk further. 90-foot hole in Fla. forces residents to evacuate homes The state of emergency was declared to prepare \"us if things do get worse in the future,\"\u00a0Pettyes said. As police lights flashed on 15 Mile, people could be seen carrying things on the sidewalk. Two cousins, Andrea Gerard, 28, and Rosemary Bagnasco, 24, were taking a detour from a nearby shopping-center parking lot to a family Christmas party around the corner. They walked with Bagnasco\u2019s mother, Dawnw Bagnasco, 58, all of Clinton Township, Mich., because the road closure kept them from driving to the home where Gerard\u2019s family was hosting the party. Though the roadblock affected the plans of 30 to 35 people attending the party, they\u2019re worried for the neighbors whose home is in danger. \u201cMy prayers go out to the people that, you know, their house is in trouble right now,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cIt is really sad.\u201d Follow Robert Allen and Emma Ockerman on Twitter\u00a0 @rallenMI\u00a0 and\u00a0 @EOckerman Related: ",

Sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Wanda Samuel says law enforcement officials are in the process of identifying the victims and notifying their families. No details have been released yet. People living in the neighborhood had many questions as they tried to wrap their minds around what happened, CBS affiliate WNCN reported. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve. It\u2019s shocking,\u201d said a woman named Brenda, who did not want to give her last name.

By Philip Rucker December 24 at 12:09 AM Follow @PhilipRucker President-elect Donald Trump. (AP/Evan Vucci) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump late Friday publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacking Trump\u2019s former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In a striking statement that seems to further align Trump with Putin, the incoming U.S. president tweeted that he agreed with the Russian leader\u2019s assessment that Clinton and the Democratic Party generally have not shown \u201cdignity\u201d following widespread losses in the November election. \u201cSo true!\u201d Trump tweeted of Putin\u2019s comments, apparently referencing statements the Russian made at his year-end news conference. Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: \"In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.\" So true! [ Putin to Democratic Party: You lost, get over it ] Trump\u2019s expressed admiration of Putin came only hours after he released to the media a warm letter the Russian sent him. The Friday night tweet sparked cries of alarm from former U.S. officials and other Trump critics on social media. President-elect Donald Trump has called nuclear weapons \"the single greatest problem the world has\" \u2013 but he's also made some controversial statements about them. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) In Putin\u2019s letter, dated Dec. 15, the Russian leader wrote that he hopes he and Trump can act \u201cin a constructive and pragmatic manner\u201d following the Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump was pleased with the correspondence, saying in a statement Friday, \u201cA very nice letter from Vladimir Putin; his thoughts are so correct.\u201d [ Trump shares a \u2018very nice\u2019 Christmas letter he received from Vladimir Putin ] Trump has long spoken admiringly of Putin and what he considers the Russian president\u2019s strong leadership qualities. Some of Trump\u2019s incoming advisers have past connections to Putin and the Russian government, including Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the White House national security adviser designee. Trump has so far rejected the conclusions of the CIA, FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia intervened in the 2016 campaign in part to help Trump secure the White House. The agencies believe Russia is responsible for the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails as well as the private emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. [ FBI in agreement with CIA that Russia aimed to help Trump win White House ] Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia under President Obama, tweeted Friday night that Trump\u2019s praise of Putin was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d So now the President-elect and an autocrat in the Kremlin team up to trash an American. Unprecedented. Will Republicans speak up? https://t.co/Vef1g5tiFK \u2014 Michael McFaul (@McFaul) December 24, 2016 Evan McMullin, a Republican former CIA operative who ran unsuccessfully against Trump as an independent candidate, called Friday night for Republican leaders to condemn Trump\u2019s \u201calliance\u201d with Putin. Republican leaders must condemn @realDonaldTrump 's alliance with Putin, a foreign adversary who is actively undermining our democracy. https://t.co/7q0OkzNF2T \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) December 24, 2016 powerpost ",

Jolly Old Saint Nick has already delivered more than 2 million presents (and counting) to homes in Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Kabul and he's continuing to make his magical journey around the globe. Children and families can visit the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Santa Tracker website , or download the app, to find out exactly when Santa Claus will be coming to town. Santa Claus riding a sleigh led by reindeers on a cloudy night Getty Images/iStockphoto NORAD has been tracking Santa and his sleigh for more than 60 years \u2014 all because of an incorrectly listed number. In December 1955, Colonel Harry Shoup, was on duty at the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center when the infamous red phone rang. Knowing that calls to that line only came from the Pentagon or a general, Shoup answered immediately. But the line was quiet. Then, a small voice asked, \"Are you really Santa Claus?\" Shoup recalled in a 2009 interview with NORAD. Related: Gay Senior Cherishes Gift of Friendship on Christmas Shoup said he thought someone on his staff was playing a joke. But when the little girl asked if he was Santa again, he decided to play along. \"I said, 'Yes, I am, have you been a good little girl?'\" he recalled. \"She had a big long list of what she wanted ... I just get thrills thinking about it!\" It turns out, a local department store had placed an advertisement in the newspaper encouraging children to call Santa \u2014 but the number had a typo . Instead of dialing the store, dozens of children mistakenly called the Command Operations Center that night, according to NORAD. Related: Essay: This Christmas, We'll Leave Santa Mochi and Dumplings The happy mistake began the tradition of the NORAD Santa Tracker \u2014 and the \"Santa Colonel,\" too. Shoup died in 2009 but now, every year, one colonel is assigned the task of overseeing a team of NORAD volunteers track Santa for children around the world. NORAD and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Charles D. Luckey joins other volunteers taking phone calls from children around the world asking about Santa during the annual NORAD Tracks Santa Operation at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. Brennan Linsley / AP file For more than 60 years now, children have been able to call the Santa Tracker hotline to find out exactly where Old Saint Nick is on his journey. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Paul Noel told the Associated Press that 1,500 volunteers answered nearly 141,000 phone calls and more than 2,800 emails last year. The NORAD spokesman was quick to say his name really is Noel. A call placed to the hotline this morning was answered by a cheerful volunteer named Diane, who said Santa had just finished delivering presents in China and was working his way across Russia. Santa will be coming down chimneys in the United States around 9 p.m. EST, she added, so make sure the cookies are out, stockings are hung, and the kids are tucked-in before he arrives!

    "text": "30 Years Later, 'Hoosiers' Still Has Major Impact in Milan By michael marot, ap sports writer MILAN, Ind. \u0097 Dec 24, 2016, 6:09 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Dec, 6, 1985, file photo actor Gene Hackman gives fictional Hickory High basketball players instructions during filming of the final game of the movie \"Hoosiers\" at Hinkle Fieldhouse on the Butler University campus in Indianapolis. Thirty years after the movie came out and six decades after Milan shocked the world with a 32-30 come-from-behind win over Muncie Central, the legacy of that team and those players has lasted longer than anyone could have imagined in 1954. (AP Photo/Tom Strickland, file) 0 Shares Email Jordan Burton's first serious history lesson about Milan basketball came in first grade. His parents plopped him in front of a television set, showed him \"Hoosiers\" and spent the next two hours separating fact from fiction. He heard a lot more about it during another conversation with the grandfather of a friend: Glenn Butte, who played on the state championship team portrayed in the popular film that hit theaters 30 years ago this month. Now a four-year starter at Milan, Burton looks at the two large banners in the school's 2,300-seat arena \u2014 Milan Finalist 1953 and Milan State Champs 1954 \u2014 and finds his daily motivation. \"It's been too long,\" he said before a practice that the rest of the varsity players missed because they were still playing football. \"I've been looking at those banners for four years. I'm just waiting for my chance.\" Three decades after \"Hoosiers\" inspired millions, the high school team from this rural community in southeastern Indiana and its players remain the biggest stars in town. There is a pride here that will never fade for the Milan Miracle, when the Indians came from behind to stun Muncie Central 32-30 at Butler University's field house in Indianapolis, back when Indiana still had its any-team-can-win-it, all-classes-welcome tournament. Of course, the Hollywood version strayed from the actual story line. Screenwriter Angelo Pizzo didn't have a choice. He and director David Anspaugh started plotting their project as Indiana University students, but it wasn't until Pizzo returned to his home state in 1981 that he started seriously putting together the script. His research began with a drive to Milan and the realization that there was a major problem with the story. \"I took a class at USC grad school called the art of dramatic writing and I'll never forget that the first thing the teacher wrote on the blackboard was that the essence of all drama is conflict, whether it's internal or external,\" Pizzo said before describing a conversation he had with Gene White, another player on the 1954 title team. \"I remember asking, 'Did everyone get along with the coach?' He said, 'Oh, we all loved him.' I said, 'What about the players, did everyone get along with the players?' He said, 'We all played together from the time we were in second grade. We were all best friends.' And I'm thinking, 'This is going to be the most boring story of all time.'\" Pizzo did much better than that, creating one of the best sports flicks ever by combining pieces from Milan's improbable tale with some of his own high school experiences. Star player Bobby Plump acknowledges the movie more closely resembles the story of the '53 team that reached the semifinals \u2014 until the final 18 seconds , which he calls accurate, right down to his game-winning jumper from 15 feet with three seconds left. When \"Hoosiers\" actually hit theaters in late 1986, Plump and his teammates never dreamed how much the Hollywood adaptation would change their lives, not to mention the traffic in this little town, population 1,900. The movie starring Gene Hackman helped the team become as revered as any champion in sports history, an unforgettable example of David beating Goliath. The stories prove it, and Plump makes sure everyone hears the best of the best. His favorite is the one about late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner insisting former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca watch \"Hoosiers\" on his private plane. As the story goes, Iacocca wasn't initially interested but Steinbrenner put it on anyway. By the time the plane landed, Iacocca wanted to see it a second time. There's the one from last summer when swimmer Michael Phelps acknowledged watching the movie twice before adding yet another Olympic gold medal to his collection. Since September alone, Plump says he's received autograph requests from three people in France, and Milan coach Josh Blankinship still has practices occasionally interrupted by tourists trying to re-enact the last-second shot sequence. Around these parts, nobody really minds. \"There are not very many things that small communities have that attract people to their community, and that's something Milan has,\" said the 80-year-old Plump, referring to the Milan 1954 Hoosiers Museum. \"That story and the movie 'Hoosiers' and that museum are why people go there, and it can't be overlooked.\" The movie wouldn't have happened without Pizzo's determination. He cut the original 3 1/2-hour version to 2 1/2 hours. Orion Pictures demanded it be trimmed to less than two hours, and eventually the editors cut it to 1 hour, 54 minutes. There was a battle over the title, too. Pizzo wanted \"Hoosiers\" while Orion's preference was \"The Last Shot.\" Around Milan, it's even hard to find someone who doesn't have a tie to the team. Jeff and Greg Holt attended Milan in the 1960s and learned sixth-grade history from Mark Combs, an assistant on the '54 team. They loaded fertilizer onto trucks for White's business. Today, they are co-owners of The Reservation Restaurant, just a stone's throw from the 400-student high school. They've decorated the restaurant with photos and mementos from the championship season, an old letterman's jacket and a photo montage of other sports and activities in Milan. But you can't have many discussions around here without talking about the championship team or the movie. \"It's the most talked-about thing in our town,\" said Jeff Holt, who remembers the day the town almost re-enacted one of the movie scenes with a parade streaming to Indianapolis for the premiere. \"I've never heard anything negative (about the movie).\" And that's how they like it. \"We talk about the historical perspective of what it means to be a Milan basketball player and how recognizable you are,\" Blankinship said. \"We went to a team camp in Kentucky one summer and when the local newspaper guy found out we were coming, he wanted to do an interview with me, first thing. As a coach, you understand that and appreciate it.\" Burton hears trash talk on the court every now and then, but understands why. \"Some kids like to say, '54 no more.' We get a lot of that, but we take it as a compliment,\" Burton said. \"I think a lot of teams know our story and a bunch of people love the movie, so they want to beat you for bragging rights. But I think if they lose, they don't take it too hard because they liked the movie.\" Plump and his teammates understand, too. After attending Butler, he opened his own restaurant, Plump's Last Shot, not far from Butler's campus in Indianapolis. Meanwhile, Milan's title team still goes home for fundraisers and reunions. They've held autograph sessions around the state and were a feature attraction at the last two NCAA Final Fours played at Lucas Oil Stadium. Thirty years after the movie came out, the legacy of the 1954 team has lasted longer than anyone could have imagined. \"You know what we thought as a team even when 40,000 people showed up in the streets back home the next day? We said, 'Look at all these people, isn't this cool?'\" Plump said. \"The day after that we all went back to our usual lives, and not one of us thought this would last this long.\" 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Sports Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota (8) warms up prior to the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at EverBank Field. (Photo: Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports) Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota is out for the year after fracturing\u00a0his right fibula in Saturday's 38-17 loss\u00a0to the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Titans said Mariota would undergo surgery in \"the next few days.\" Mariota was carted off in the third quarter of Saturday's game, and an air cast was placed on his right ankle. He was ruled out for the remainder of the game and replaced by Matt Cassel. Mariota had 99 yards on 8-of-20 passing before exiting the game. Cassel threw for 124 yards and a touchdown, but his pick-six to cornerback Jalen Ramsey helped Jacksonville seal the game in the final minutes. \u201cHow would I describe (the loss)? First word that comes to mind is bull----,\u201d Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan told reporters, according to The Tennessean. \u201cCome out as flat as we did, play a different game plan than we did, the heart not on the sidelines.

Lawyers are now taking \u201cthe necessary steps to effectuate the dissolution,\u201d the statement said. What We Know About the Trump Foundation Under Investigation But that process might not be as straightforward as the president-elect would like it to be. In a statement shortly after Trump's announcement, New York State Attorney General Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick said that \"the Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete.\" In September, the office confirmed that it was investigating the foundation . The probe is said to concern \u2013 among other things \u2013 a 2013 donation made from the foundation to the fundraising campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. That contribution has drawn concerns of impropriety after Bondi\u2019s office decided not to take legal action against Trump over his now-closed school, Trump University . Both Trump and Bondi said the contribution had no link to her office's decision. ABC News\u2019 Aaron Katersky contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power at the U.N. Security Council meeting on Dec. 23, 2016.</p> Close UNITED NATIONS -- The U.S. green light that allowed the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem could spur moves toward new terms to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it also poses dangers for the United Nations with the incoming Trump administration and may harden Israel\u2019s attitude toward concessions. The Obama administration\u2019s decision to abstain and allow the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body to approve a long-sought resolution calling Israeli settlements \u201ca flagrant violation under international law\u201d was a sharp rebuke to a longstanding ally and a striking rupture with past U.S. vetoes. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said \u201cit is because this resolution reflects the facts on the ground - and is consistent with U.S. policy across Republican and Democratic administrations throughout the history of the state of Israel - that the United States did not veto it.\u201d She cited a 1982 statement by then-President Ronald Reagan that the United States \u201cwill not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements\u201d and that \u201csettlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel.\u201d The Security Council vote Friday, however, was anything but routine for Washington, which traditionally vetoes all resolutions related to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict on grounds that differences must be solved through negotiations. It was the first resolution on the conflict approved during President Barack Obama\u2019s nearly eight years in office and shone a spotlight on his icy relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. decision to abstain on the 14-0 vote followed months of intensely secret deliberations in Washington, a spate of fresh Israeli settlement announcements that sparked exasperation and anger from American officials, and recent attempts by Israel\u2019s government to have parliament legalize thousands of homes built on privately owned Palestinian land. After Egypt suddenly postponed a scheduled vote on the resolution Thursday, reportedly under pressure from Israel and supporters of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump , four new sponsors stepped up and pushed it through - Malaysia, New Zealand, Venezuela and Senegal, each representing a different region and reflecting the wide support for the measure. Trump demanded that Obama veto the resolution and tweeted after the vote, \u201cAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th\u201d - when Trump takes office. It would be virtually impossible, however, for Trump to overturn the resolution. It would require a new resolution with support from at least nine members in the 15-member Security Council and no veto by one of the other permanent members - Russia, China, Britain or France, all of whom supported Friday\u2019s resolution. Republicans, who control Congress, immediately threatened consequences. Sen. Lindsay Graham, who heads the Senate panel in charge of U.S. payments to the U.N., said he would \u201cform a bipartisan coalition to suspend or significantly reduce\u201d funding. He added that countries receiving U.S. aid could also be penalized for supporting the resolution. Under U.N. rules, failure to pay dues leads to the loss of voting privileges in the General Assembly. The vote on settlements sparked behind-the-scenes discussion in the usually divided Security Council on what else might be achieved on the Israeli-Palestinian issue while Obama is still in the White House. New Zealand has been pressing for the council to consider a resolution that would set out the parameters for a settlement of the conflict, and its draft ideas remain on the table. But Israel\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon warned the council after the vote that the resolution would not spur peace efforts. \u201cBy voting \u2018yes\u2019 in favor of this resolution, you have in fact voted \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Danon said. \u201cYou voted \u2018no\u2019 to negotiations. You voted \u2018no\u2019 to progress, and a chance for better lives for Israelis and Palestinians. And you voted \u2018no\u2019 to the possibility of peace.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately retaliated against some of the nations that proposed Friday\u2019s resolution. He recalled his nation\u2019s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal for consultations, canceled a planned January visit to Israel by Senegal\u2019s foreign minister and ended Israeli aid programs to the West African nation. \u201cIsrael rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. and will not abide by its terms,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement. The Israeli leader blamed Obama for failing to \u201cprotect Israel against this gang-up at the U.N.\u201d and even colluding with its detractors. He said, \u201cIsrael looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\u201d By contrast, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat hailed the result as a \u201cvictory for the justice of the Palestinian cause.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s choice was now between \u201cinternational legitimacy\u201d or siding with \u201csettlers and extremists.\u201d Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, urged the Security Council to \u201cstand firm by this decision\u201d and \u201cnot be cowed by negative threats or spin.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Fahrenthold December 24 at 5:12 PM Follow @markberman Follow @Fahrenthold President-elect Donald Trump plans to shut down his charitable foundation, which has been under intense scrutiny for months. (Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump said he plans to shut down his charitable foundation, a decision that comes after repeated controversies over how it collected and disbursed funds . In a statement Saturday, Trump offered no timeline for when his\u00a0foundation would close down, but said he had directed his attorney to take the steps needed to close the charity. It was also not immediately clear when the foundation\u00a0would be able to\u00a0dissolve, given an ongoing investigation in New York. \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" Trump said in the statement. \"However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" 1 of 76 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption Trump has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. \u00a0Dec. 23, 2016 A motorcade carrying President-elect Donald Trump arrives at Trump International Golf Club, in West Palm Beach, Fla. Andrew Harnik/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. [ Trump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words. ] New York's attorney general has been investigating the charity after some of these reports, and a spokeswoman for that office said the foundation\u00a0could not officially\u00a0shut down until\u00a0that probe is over. \u201cThe Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d\u00a0Amy Spitalnick, the\u00a0spokeswoman, said in an email Saturday. The foundation is unusual in that it largely collects and donates money from other people . In fact, from 2009 to 2014, Trump told the Internal Revenue Service that he'd given his namesake foundation no money at all. The biggest donors in recent years were Vince and Linda McMahon, the pro-wrestling moguls, who gave the Trump Foundation $5 million between 2007 and 2009. Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. Trump said Saturday that he was \"very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity.\" The Trump Foundation has no paid employees and a board of five, consisting of Trump, three of his children and a longtime\u00a0Trump Organization employee. They all work a half-hour per week, according to\u00a0an IRS filing. The president-elect\u00a0added that \"because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don\u2019t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest.\" The foundation told the IRS it had $1.16 million in total assets by the end of 2015, the most recent tax filing available. A spokeswoman for Trump said she had no additional information Saturday regarding where any remaining money might be sent. Trump's foundation\u00a0has\u00a0 admitted in IRS\u00a0tax filings for 2015 that it violated a prohibition against \u201cself-dealing\u201d that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charity's funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. In these tax filings,\u00a0the charity\u00a0checked \u201cyes\u201d in response to a question asking whether it had transferred any income or assets to \u201ca disqualified person\u201d \u2014 a description that could have meant Trump, a relative or a Trump-owned business. Trump has not said what exactly he did to violate the rule, or what he has paid the IRS in penalty taxes as a result. The IRS has not commented when asked whether it was investigating the Trump Foundation. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters this week at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.. (Andrew Harnik/AP) Trump's charity has been prohibited from fundraising by the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D), an action that\u00a0came after The Post reported that the foundation had failed to register with the state . This meant the foundation had dodged annual audits required in the state of New York. Schneiderman's office is also investigating the Trump Foundation after reports in The Post describing apparent cases of self-dealing that date back to 2007 . The Trump Foundation spent $30,000 to buy two large portraits of Trump himself, including one that was hung up in the sports bar at a Trump-owned resort. Trump also appears to use $258,000 of his foundation's money \u2014 legally earmarked for charitable purposes \u2014 to settle lawsuits involving two of his for-profit clubs. In addition, the Trump foundation gave a $25,000 gift to a campaign committee backing Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) even though nonprofits like the charity are not allowed to give political gifts. That gift was made\u00a0as Bondi's office was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. A consultant who worked on Bondi's reelection effort\u00a0has said that\u00a0Bondi was not aware of the complaints when she solicited the donation from Trump.\u00a0Ultimately, Bondi's office did not pursue those allegations. [ Trump Foundation admits to violating ban on \u2018self-dealing,\u2019 new filing to IRS shows ] The move to shut down Trump's foundation, first reported Saturday by the New York Times , comes as the president-elect and his family are facing intense questions regarding how they will avoid conflicts of interest while he is in the White House. \"The announcement that the Foundation will be shut down is a necessary first step for the incoming administration to avoid massive ethics problems, but it does not come close to ending the story,\"\u00a0said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington,\u00a0a\u00a0watchdog group aligned with allies of Hillary Clinton. The group's tips and research helped reveal some of the Trump foundation's apparent violations of the law. In a statement, Bookbinder said that the Trump charity's \"past instances of wrongdoing must be fully investigated\" and called on the president-elect to \"sell his businesses and take comprehensive steps to prevent conflicts of interest for him and his administration. Trump has said his two adult sons will run his company, but he has not provided details yet regarding how he will extricate himself from his complex network of businesses . He postponed a news conference this month meant to address the issue and has not rescheduled it. In another case of Trump apparently trying to wrap up lingering questions and legal issues before he takes office, he agreed to settle fraud claims against his defunct Trump University real estate seminars. A federal judge this week gave preliminary approval to a deal in which Trump would pay $25 million as part of the settlement. [ How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people\u2019s money ] Earlier this week, Trump's eldest son, Eric, said he was suspending his charitable foundation after facing questions about whether donors could receive special access. The Eric Trump Foundation, founded in 2007, raises more than $1.5 million a year through a golf tournament and other events, and it passes on the bulk of its money to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , a pediatric-cancer center in Memphis. The president-elect was critical of the decision regarding his son's foundation, describing it as unfair in a pair of messages this week on Twitter . \"Isn't this a ridiculous shame?\u201d the elder Trump wrote. \u201cHe loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!\u201d This story, first published at 4:28 p.m., has been updated. Further reading: ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic \u201cThe Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, the press secretary, said. Mr. Trump gave little thought to what to do with his business in the event of a victory on Election Day. But embarrassing reversals by his children highlighted concerns that access to the incoming administration could be for sale, and pressed the family to respond. A charity auction for coffee with Ivanka Trump, his daughter, was canceled , and Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect\u2019s sons, pulled out of another charity event that asked donors to give as much as $1 million in return for access to their father and a hunting expedition with his sons. In interviews late last week, executives at the Trump Organization, advisers on the Trump transition team and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family said they were determined to move aggressively in the remaining days before the inauguration to clear as many of these potential conflicts as possible. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t deny there is a greater desire to sort of clear the decks as much as possible to avoid distractions,\u201d said Alan Garten , the general counsel at the Trump Organization, in an interview, pointing to the recent $25 million settlement of fraud claims against Mr. Trump\u2019s for-profit educational program, Trump University. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Among other measures: \u25a0 Both the Trump Organization and the Ivanka Trump brand \u2014 a line of jewelry, clothing, handbags and other items \u2014 are exploring options for an outside monitor to help oversee operations, block inappropriate contacts between the companies and the federal government, and provide independent voices for management decisions, executives involved in the efforts said. One option is a trustee who would run the business alongside Eric and his brother, Donald Jr. The Trump Organization has discussed turning to legal experts such as former Attorney General Michael Mukasey as potential trustees. \u25a0 The Trump Organization, in some cases citing deficiencies in the work performed by some of its foreign partners or other clauses in contracts with them, is terminating pending or nearly completed hotels and apartment buildings in Brazil , Azerbaijan, Georgia and Argentina, while also forgoing other early-stage ventures in places such as India. Photo From left, Trump children Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric all have businesses or other activities that might stand to benefit from their father\u2019s presidency. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times \u25a0 Ivanka Trump is looking at donating proceeds from a soon-to-be-published book , \u201cWomen Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,\u201d to charity. \u25a0 A labor dispute with hundreds of workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 which generated calls for a national boycott of Trump properties and protest rallies \u2014 was suddenly settled on Wednesday , with the hotel agreeing to provide pensions, health insurance, annual wage increases and other benefits that it previously refused to offer. Another agreement with employees at the just-opened Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington will allow them to organize a union. \u25a0 The Trump Organization has shelved a planned 15-foot-tall sea wall at its oceanfront golf course in Ireland after the proposal provoked angry protests from environmentalists both in Ireland and in the United States. \u25a0 Eric Trump said he no longer intended to participate in any meetings \u2014 business or policy-focused \u2014 organized by his father, as the president-elect prepared to move to the White House, and would not interact with him or anyone in his administration on government matters once he was in office. \u201cI\u2019ll have no role in government,\u201d he said, describing a division of \u201cchurch and state\u201d but saying he will still talk to his father about other things. The turnaround on the labor union dispute demonstrates just how sudden the shift has been. In November, four days before Election Day, the Trump hotel filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals challenging a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board that ordered his hotel in Las Vegas to recognize a labor union that workers voted for in late 2015 and to negotiate a new contract. A month later, company officials invited labor negotiators to Trump Tower for a three-day negotiation. Graphic: What Donald J. Trump Owns and Owes On Wednesday, the union ratified a deal that gave the 500 workers generous health care coverage, pensions, a guaranteed workweek and other protections, and set up a grievance system if they objected to conditions. The lawsuit was also dropped , as were outstanding matters pending before the labor relations board, which will soon be under Mr. Trump\u2019s control. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt is everything the workers have been fighting for for over for a year,\u201d said Bethany Khan, a spokeswoman for the Culinary Workers Union . While the family may be removing some of the most obvious problems, critics say Mr. Trump will still know what properties his family owns and which policy decisions will benefit them, no matter how careful he is. The portfolio of assets might influence his interactions with leaders in nations such as Turkey and the Philippines , where Mr. Trump has prominent marketing deals. In places where he has allowed the use of his family name and even his image, Mr. Trump will soon be confronting foreign policy decisions, such as how to confront human rights violations or fight terrorism . The family, at least so far, has not announced how it will resolve other issues , such as the lease at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which was issued by the federal government\u2019s General Services Administration , an agency Mr. Trump will soon oversee. Trump-owned hotels and golf courses across the globe could benefit from business sent to them by foreign governments or other corporate players seeking to try to influence Mr. Trump . Loans that help finance his companies and permits issued by local government or foreign entities \u2014 even on projects that are already built \u2014 could be perceived as special favors. Payments by foreign governments to his hotels \u2014 for diplomatic soirees or overnight stays \u2014 might violate the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits gifts to federal employees from foreign government entities. Representative Elijah E. Cummings , Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who has called for an investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s potential conflicts , said he was glad to see that the Trump family appeared to have acknowledged that the conflicts issues were real. But he said much more must be done. \u201cHe is headed in the right direction, but he has to reach the right destination, which is to divest of everything like Democratic and Republican ethics experts have said he must do,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cThe presidency is probably the most difficult job in the world. Why would you want almost every decision you make to be questioned? You have more than 111 companies operating in 18 countries. That is a minefield, and sadly it will take away from his credibility.\u201d Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Steve Eder contributed reporting from New York, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi. ",

In a statement it said legal action had been taken against 3,710 people identified by police. Beside those arrested, 1,203 people were released on probation, 767 were released and 84 others are still in detention. Charges include provoking hatred among the people; praising terrorist organizations; disseminating terrorist propaganda; openly declaring allegiance to terrorist groups; insulting statesmen; and targeting the indivisibility of the state or safety of citizens. Investigations and legal procedures are underway against an additional 10,000 people reported to public prosecutors. Turkey declared a state of emergency soon after a failed coup in July, detaining thousands of citizens and purging tens of thousands of public servants over alleged ties to outlawed groups. Western governments, human rights group and legal experts have repeatedly expressed concern over the crackdown, which some say has begun targeting political opponents and critics. Ankara defends its actions saying they are necessary precautions in the face of ongoing nationwide terrorism . This year Turkey has seen a series of attacks and bombings in major cities that were the work of either the Islamic State group or Kurdish militants. Turkey frequently restricts access to social media websites to prevent the spread of graphic images and other material authorities say would harm public order or security. Such restrictions usually follow a major crackdown or a terrorist attack. On Friday access was restricted to social media websites for several hours after the Islamic State group released a video purportedly showing two Turkish soldiers being burned alive. 0 Shares ",

The three are between the ages of 18 to 27, and were all being held on suspicion of belonging to an organization linked to terrorist crimes. It's unclear whether any of them helped Amri escape police in Berlin. Meanwhile, demonstrators took to the streets of Milan on Saturday, some calling for more security and scrutiny of foreigners. Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's Northern League, stands behind a banner reading \"No To Terrorism, More Security\" in Milan on Saturday. Claudio Lavanga / NBC News Italian police also provided some details of Amri's journey to Italy, based on train tickets found on the slain suspect. On Thursday evening, Amri took a train at at 5:24 p.m. (11:24 a.m. ET) from Chambery, France, to Turin, Italy, where he arrived at 8:18 p.m. (2:18 p.m. ET). It is not known how and when he got from Berlin to Chambery. Amri then got on a train destined for Milan, Italian police said, arriving at 12:45 a.m. on Friday (6:45 p.m. ET Thursday). He walked to a bus stop nearby, and took a shuttle bus to Milan's Sesto San Giovanni, where he eventually encountered police. While intelligence agencies are asking themselves how Amri managed to travel across Europe via train unnoticed, Italian authorities are looking to establish the reasons behind his decision to go to Sesto San Giovanni, a relatively quiet residential area.

In some cases, studios are even flying actors, costume designers and producers to megachurch discussion groups. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hollywood\u2019s awareness of its need to pay better attention to flyover-state audiences has grown even more urgent of late, as ultraliberal movie executives, shocked to see a celebrity-encircled Hillary Clinton lose the presidential election to Donald J. Trump, have realized the degree to which they are out of touch with a vast pool of Americans. Tens of millions of voters did not care what stars had to say in support of Mrs. Clinton. Are those voters also ignoring the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Meryl Streep when they promote movies? Would they listen if it were a church leader telling them to buy a ticket instead? Film companies can no longer afford to take any audience for granted. Despite a growing population, North America\u2019s moviegoing has been more or less flat \u2014 not exactly what investors want to hear. Last year, 1.32 billion tickets were sold, up from the year before but down from the 10-year high of 1.42 billion in 2009, according to the Motion Picture Association of America . More troubling, cheaper and more convenient in-home entertainment options are threatening the grip that multiplexes have long had on young adults; the number of frequent moviegoers ages 12 to 24 has fallen for three consecutive years. Hollywood is under pressure to reverse that trend. Churches may seem like an unusual path toward young people, but 41 percent of millen n ials engage in some form of daily prayer, according to a 2010 Pew Research paper. To reach them, many ministers have built vast social media networks. The Rev. Jamal H. Bryant, a megachurch pastor in Baltimore, has 250,000 followers on Twitter . ( H is church also has a smartphone app.) Studios used to sell movies by bombarding television networks with advertising on the eve of release. That tactic is still used for summer blockbusters, but it is expensive and increasingly ineffective in the DVR age. As a result, studios are aggressively trying to plumb niche markets that can be reached through word of mouth. \u201cSomeone like Jamal Bryant, because he has such a prodigious network online, becomes a pipeline to other youth pastors,\u201d said the Rev. Marshall Mitchell , a pastor in Jenkintown, Pa., and a founder of Wit PR.

Credit Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times In the coming weeks, Mr. Bryant plans to bring up to 300 parishioners to a Wit PR-organized screening of \u201cHidden Figures\u201d in Northwest Baltimore. Afterward, Mr. Bryant intends to lead a discussion connecting the plot to a theological message. \u201cMost studios, to be honest, have no idea how to market to us,\u201d Mr. Bryant said. \u201cThey\u2019re still doing the Sammy Davis Jr. tap dance: \u2018Look at me! Aren\u2019t you impressed?\u2019 Well, no, not really. But if you bring us into the tent, we are often excited to spread the word.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story People of faith and their sheer numbers \u2014 by some estimates, the United States has roughly 90 million evangelicals \u2014 are not a new discovery in Hollywood. Moviedom\u2019s leading Christian consultancy, Grace Hill Media , was founded in 2000 by a former publicist for Warner Bros. Studios woke up to the power of the market in 2004, when Mel Gibson\u2019s $30 million \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d came out of nowhere to sell $612 million in tickets worldwide.

Even in the wake of several flops \u2014 among them this summer\u2019s \u201cBen-Hur,\u201d which cost at least $150 million to make and market and collected $94 million \u2014 studios are working on at least a dozen movies in this arena, including \u201cThe Star,\u201d an animated film about the animal heroes of the first Christmas. Last month, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced the introduction of Light TV, a faith and family broadcast network. Other media companies are considering the creation of faith-based streaming services, essentially Netflix for the pious. At the same time, consultants are refining their efforts. Kevin Goetz, the chief executive of the movie research company Screen Engine/ASI, recently initiated a proprietary Faith Tracker that monitors moviegoing in a sample of 800 people \u2014 evangelical, traditional Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon and those whom he calls \u201cspiritual but not necessarily religious.\u201d It\u2019s a tool designed to help studios understand whether their faith-based advertising and publicity efforts are connecting with the target audience before a film\u2019s release. An even bolder Screen Engine/ASI initiative involves a 1,000-member \u201cinfluencer\u201d service made up of movie-attuned pastors. Some of those will be invited to view unfinished films online, to offer feedback that may help filmmakers shape them and marketers sell them. And film studios, desperate to assemble large crowds on opening weekends, have newly realized that religious Americans, if approached on their own terms, can be captured for movies that would, at first glance, seem to be an unusual fit. Mr. Mitchell and his Wit PR partner, Corby Pons, have recently been hired to use their clergy connections to tout \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d a Sony remake of the classic Western; \u201cSully,\u201d the Warner Bros. hit about the 2009 emergency landing of a US Airways jet in the Hudson River; and \u201c Rules Don\u2019t Apply ,\u201d a period romance directed by Warren Beatty.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story With the exception of crude comedies, the majority of studio offerings \u2014 even certain R-rated horror movies \u2014 have qualities that can resonate with faith audiences, Mr. Pons said. But the merits have to be called out. Otherwise, Christian audiences may take one look at mainstream marketing materials and decide that a film is not for them. Photo Marshall Mitchell, left, and Corby Pons are partners in Wit PR, which pitches movies to churches. Credit Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times For instance, Fox broadly positioned \u201cThe Revenant\u201d as bloody revenge thriller, but Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Pons emphasized themes of man\u2019s inhumanity toward his fellow man and honor versus greed. The R-rated movie collected $533 million worldwide for Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing watching people in Hollywood discover there is interest in their content they never knew existed,\u201d Mr. Pons said. \u201cOn the faith side, some people are surprised to learn that, hey, there is good content coming from studios. Hollywood isn\u2019t always the enemy.\u201d Movie executives tend to view the Christian audience as monolithic. It is not, of course. That may be why \u201cNoah\u201d sold fewer tickets in 2014 than Paramount had hoped. The studio figured the big-budget movie about the biblical figure would attract religious viewers en masse, but \u201cNoah\u201d landed poorly with more literal interpreters of Scripture, who objected to the film\u2019s depiction of fallen angels as \u201cTransformers\u201d-style rock monsters. The increasing number of consultants arriving in Hollywood to help forestall such problems \u2014 for fees starting at about $300,000 per film and going up to $3 million \u2014 is also leading to gridlock at church offices. Some megachurch pastors, for instance, complain that they are being inundated with film-related requests. \u201cNobody wants to feel used, and sometimes the movie business acts like people of faith are there to be turned on and off as the marketers see fit,\u201d said DeVon Franklin, an ordained minister, an author and a producer of films like \u201cMiracles From Heaven.\u201d Undoubtedly aware of that perception, studios try to keep a tight lid on their efforts, sometimes even insisting that no faith outreach is happening on behalf of a film, when there is actually a coordinated effort. Studios live in equal fear that obvious appeals to religious audiences will alienate more secular ticket buyers. Almost all studio executives contacted for this article rejected repeated interview requests, citing policies not to publicly discuss marketing strategies of any kind. But the basic rules in selling a film are the same, said Jonathan Bock, the founder of Grace Hill, which has quietly marketed movies to spiritually minded people, including \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d \u201cWhat religious people want most when they go to the movies, like people who aren\u2019t religious, is to be entertained,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For decades, religious audiences had little tolerance for many of the movies produced by Hollywood. By the 1990s, when films like Quentin Tarantino\u2019s violent \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d entered the mainstream, the culture gap seemed unbridgeable. But a pronounced swing toward family fare, helped by a growing overseas appetite for animation and PG- or PG-13-rated superhero fantasies, opened the door to new connections between Hollywood and faith audiences. If \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d showed that a mass audience existed for overt religious stories on screen, \u201c The Blind Side ,\u201d a 2009 family sports drama about a young black man taken in by a white family, showed the promise of less obvious storytelling. Video The Blind Side \"Blind Side\" depicts the remarkable true story of Michael Oher, a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, taken in by the Touhys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential.

Mr. Bock and Grace Hill circulated film clips and sermon outlines to 22,000 pastors, some of whom preached its story of personal determination and racial conciliation. One suggested \u201csermon starter\u201d involved a scene where the lead character, played by Sandra Bullock, abruptly persuades her husband to stop their car and offer a young man a ride. \u201cHas God ever nudged your heart?\u201d the notes read. Mr. Bock, who is Presbyterian, is credited with being the first Hollywood marketer to realize that churches had started to install enormous screens to use during their services, sometimes just to display hymn lyrics. More recently, $35,000 video walls have become more common in sanctuaries. \u201cIt makes church feel more contemporary,\u201d Mr. Bock said, adding that ministers are becoming adept at \u201cbuilding vibrant social media communities that expand their reach far beyond Sunday morning.\u201d Photo Promotional efforts for \u201cHidden Figures\u201d included a free concert by Pharrell Williams at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. The film has no obvious religious method, but some pastors endorse its inspirational message. Credit Taylor Hill/Getty Images Sony\u2019s faith-based unit, Affirm Films , has lately been working to tap Christian audiences overseas, an area that studios have largely ignored. \u201cThere are pockets of evangelical Protestants around the world, but it takes a lot of preplanning,\u201d said Rich Peluso , a Sony executive vice president. \u201cYou have to develop a relationship with them.\u201d In some cases, Sony has bypassed film distributors and made release deals for dramas like the prayer-focused \u201cWar Room\u201d with Christian media companies in countries including Italy and Australia. \u201cPeople are sometimes surprised to find me, a conservative Christian guy, working in Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Peluso said. \u201cThere are a lot of us, actually. More than people think.\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, has been marketed with all of the usual Hollywood bells and whistles. A trailer came out in August. In September, Fox staged a publicity stunt at the Toronto International Film Festival , showing 20 minutes of the film followed by a free concert by Pharrell Williams, who contributed to the score. Another trailer followed. Ads popped up on TV, billboards, bus shelters, websites. Fox, which is releasing the film in 15 cities on Christmas Day, also lined up a partnership with Pepsi and has backed the film with a robust Oscar campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story So why also employ Wit? Elizabeth Gabler, the president of Fox 2000, the studio division behind \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d said in a statement, \u201cCorby and Marshall help to locate these important faith audiences and leaders who are hungry for aspirational content without feeling like they are going to church.\u201d Mr. Mitchell, 46, and Mr. Pons, 39, went to work early last year, reading the \u201cHidden Figures\u201d script, written by Theodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder (and based on Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s book). They decided that this film, because it was not overtly religious, needed to be \u201cpoured with Dixie cups instead of buckets,\u201d as Mr. Pons put it. Translation: Spread the word by facilitating discussion rather than hammering home a message through blanket ads in Christian publications. \u201cWe see this as a healing movie,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cAt a moment when so many people \u2014 right and left, black and white \u2014 are arguing over what America is or what America isn\u2019t, here is a chance to come together in a theater and look up, to space quite literally in this case, but metaphorically too.\u201d Wit PR operates with one foot inside Hollywood and one foot out. Mr. Pons, lanky and self-deprecating, lives in Los Angeles with his wife and is the five-person company\u2019s primary contact with studios. He works from a home office. Prone to folksy sayings that charm the slick Hollywood crowd \u2014 \u201cyour cheese done slid off your cracker\u201d is a frequent one and means \u201cyou\u2019re out of your mind\u201d \u2014 Mr. Pons grew up in the rural North Carolina hills, where his parents run the Christian Training Center International . Mr. Mitchell, quick-witted and single, operates from an office near the historic Salem Baptist Church in Jenkintown, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb; he has served as the church\u2019s pastor since 2012. He sometimes speaks with the fiery conviction of a preacher but has a secular background. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as a senior enrollment and operations official at Wilberforce University in Ohio. The two men met in Washington. Mr. Mitchell, already at Wilberforce, had served as chief of staff to the Rev. Floyd Flake , then a New York congressman and now senior pastor at a Queens megachurch. Mr. Pons was a young aide to a North Carolina congressman, helping him to scrutinize public relations efforts around the Iraq war, work that ended up as part of a Rolling Stone expos \u00e9 . In 2008, along with a third friend, they formed a publicity company called Different Drummer. Mr. Pons and Mr. Mitchell split from that firm in 2014 and founded Wit PR, picking a name that is meant to convey smarts but also stands for \u201cwhatever it takes.\u201d That kind of gumption was recently on display on a Wit PR conference call. The principals were going through a list of \u201cactivations\u201d planned for \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d Mr. Mitchell announced that he had just arranged with two Christian sororities to bring students and alumnae together for \u201cHidden Figures\u201d screenings and discussions on opening weekend. \u201cThrough those faith relationships, we\u2019re going to end up selling at least 1,000 tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cDelivering a measurable result like that is the goal.\u201d Michael Cieply contributed reporting.

Displaced when the Islamic State group seized their town, Bartella, in August 2014, the Christians were bused into town from Irbil, capital of the self-ruled Kurdish region where they have lived for more than two years, to attend the lunchtime service in the Assyrian Orthodox church of Mart Shmoni. Torched by IS militants, church-supervised volunteers recently cleaned it up after government forces retook Bartella as part of an ongoing campaign to liberate the nearby city of Mosul and surrounding areas in Nineveh province. But the church is still missing its icons, electrical wiring hangs perilously from its ceiling and most light fixtures are gone. The headless statue of a late patriarch stands in the front yard, its pedestal surrounded by shards of glass. On Saturday, women joyously ululated when they stepped into the marble-walled church. Almost everyone held a lit candle. Many took photos with their mobile phones. A handful of gas heaters were brought in, but they did little to warm the place on a wet and windy December day. For many of them, the sight of their hometown in almost complete ruin was shocking. Only a few homes in the once vibrant town of some 25,000 people stand unscathed. Most have been damaged by shelling or blackened by fire. On one street wall, IS's black banner remains visible under the white paint. Next to it, someone wrote: \"Christ is the light of the world. Bartella is Christian.\" \"Our joy is bigger than our sadness,\" said university student Nevine Ibrahim, 20, who was in Bartella Saturday for the first time since she, her parents and four siblings left in 2014. They found their house badly damaged. Everything they owned was gone. \"I don't think we can return. The house can be fixed but the pain inside us cannot,\" she said, seated among three of her siblings. \"Who will protect us?\" Halfway through the service, conducted in Assyrian and Arabic, it became something of a wartime mass. Roughly a dozen U.S. military servicemen and a 100-man contingent from the Iraqi military led by several top generals descended on the church in a show of solidarity. Unlike their Americans counterparts, the Iraqi troops came armed. Iraqi soldiers \u2014 with one wearing a skull-face balaclava \u2014 searched people coming into the church. Inside, soldiers frisked anyone moving close to the Iraqi generals, who arrived in some two dozen armored SUVs and Humvees. The distant thud of explosions could be heard after mass. But none of that seemed to dampen the worshippers' joyous spirit. The soldiers photographed each other and took selfies. Many of them held lit candles, and the congregation warmly applauded when Bishop Mussa Al-Shamani thanked the Iraqi military for \"liberating\" Bartella. The Christians of Nineveh are members of an ancient and once-vibrant community. They enjoyed protection under Saddam Hussein, but their numbers rapidly dwindled after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq toppled the regime of the late dictator in 2003. Since 2003, Sunni militants have targeted Christians and their churches, terrorizing the community and forcing many of its members to flee to the West, neighboring nations or the northern Kurdish region. IS's onslaught across northern Iraq in 2014 devastated the unique communities of Christian-majority towns like Karamlis, Bartella and Qaraqosh \u2014 all in the Nineveh plains. Of the estimated 1.5 million Christians who lived in Iraq on the eve of the U.S.-led invasion, about 500,000 are left. \"This is the mass of defiance,\" Assyrian priest Yacoub Saady told the congregation at the end of the service. \"We, the Christians, are the oldest component of this country. We are staying put and no power can force us to leave.\" His words, however, were more hopeful than realistic. The Bartella Christians attending Saturday's Christmas Mass spoke of the community's woes and their slim hopes of returning home. With the central Baghdad government strapped for cash because of low oil prices and the spiraling cost of the war against IS, it is unlikely that monetary compensation will be dispensed to residents who lost their homes, or that large scale reconstruction will be undertaken in Bartella anytime soon. Residents also have deep security concerns, arising mostly from the Iraqi military and security forces' meltdown in the face of IS's blitz across northern and western Iraq in the summer of 2014. \"People must first be compensated and services like water and electricity restored before they come back to live here,\" said Ramsen Matti, a 28-year-old accountant who now lives in Irbil with his wife and their only child, a daughter born in Bartella less than two months before they fled the town. Altar boy Masar Jalal arrived with his father on Saturday, the 16-year-old's first visit to Bartella since he fled with his family to Irbil in 2014. \"I cried for what has become of the town,\" said Jalal. \"I will only come back to live here if there is security.\" He found some of his old clothes when he visited the family home, but the furniture was gone. \"The clothes I found are too small for me now, but I also found a mug with my photo that a cousin of mine snapped. No one took that.\" Advertisement ",

The radio personality, whose real surname is Bassolino, was found unresponsive in his Bronx apartment Friday, report TMZ \u00a0and \u00a0 CNN . The NYPD later confirmed his death to the\u00a0 Hollywood Reporter . Bassolino, who was part of the rogue's gallery known as the Wack Pack, grabbed attention by shouting \"Baba Booey\" on Stern's show and during live TV reports. He even managed to successfully defend his right to do so in a New York court . His friends learned of his death after they began\u00a0Friday's taping of his podcast,\u00a0The Joey Boots Show. Fellow Wack Packer Erik \"High Pitch \" Bleaman told CNN that he had gone to check on his friend when he failed to show for taping. He entered Bassolino's apartment with the help of a building manager. Bleaman\u00a0then called into the show and asked them to stop recording so he could deliver the bad news, but they kept rolling tape, which was obtained by TMZ . \"Me and the building manager opened Joey's door,\" he told them. \"And Joey was slumped over his chair. He was ice cold.\" The team then ended the show and called 911. Emergency responders pronounced Bassolino, who had openly discussed his diabetes, dead at the scene. A medical examiner will determine his cause of death. Stern promised via Twitter that the show would honor \"the one and only Joey B\" with a tribute show in the new year. 859 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 44 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2irOueh NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

Sue Ogrocki/AP hide caption toggle caption Sue Ogrocki/AP Oklahoma State University President Burns Hargis gets his blood pressure checked in a mobile medical unit parked at the state Capitol. Sue Ogrocki/AP The Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block, likely to be one of the first casualties when President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month. \"We will repeal the disaster known as 'Obamacare' and create new health care \u2014 all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family,\" Trump promised in Florida last week. Before that happens, President Obama and his aides want to put a marker down on what they see as the law's accomplishments over the last six years. \"When I came into office, 44 million people were uninsured,\" Obama told reporters during his pre-Christmas news conference at the White House. \"Today, we've covered more than 20 million of them. For the first time in our history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.\" So far, more than 6.4 million people have signed up for insurance coverage in 2017 through the federal exchange. Enrollments are on track to exceed last year's total, with many coming from states like Florida, Texas, and North Carolina that were carried by Trump. While expanded insurance coverage is the yardstick most often cited, defenders argue the Affordable Care Act has also helped limit rising health care costs and put more emphasis on the quality of care, not just how much is done. Article continues after sponsorship President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences \"While multiple factors are likely playing a role, payment reforms introduced in the [Affordable Care Act] have made substantial, quantifiable contributions to slowing the growth of health care costs in both Medicare and private insurance,\" White House economists wrote in a report this month. The report cites estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that Obamacare has shaved 1.3 percentage points off the annual growth in per-person Medicare spending. CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration For people who get health coverage through their employer, the slowdown has been even sharper, the report says. The cost of family coverage has grown just over 3 percent per year since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. That's a 45 percent reduction from the pace of the previous six years. While many workplace insurance plans now include higher deductibles and co-pays, workers' out-of-pocket costs are still growing more slowly than they were before Obamacare, White House economists say. The law also encourages payment reforms that reward doctors and hospitals for high-quality care, not simply performing a lot of tests and procedures. More than 30 percent of Medicare payments are now based on these \"alternative payment models,\" along with about 10 percent of payments for workers covered by private insurance. To be sure, the Affordable Care Act remains deeply controversial. Americans who dislike the law slightly outnumber those who approve of it. That's partly a reflection of the law's partisan history. It was passed without a single Republican vote. Implementation has also been rocky \u2014 especially the disastrous debut of the government's insurance exchange website in 2013. Nineteen states \u2014 most with Republican leadership \u2014 declined to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. Organizers Hope Women's March On Washington Inspires, Evolves What's more, after losing money in past years, many insurance companies have stopped offering policies on the government-run exchanges. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , about 20 percent of people shopping for coverage on the exchanges this year have just one insurance company to choose from. With less competition, premiums on the exchanges have risen sharply: about 25 percent on average. Despite these drawbacks, supporters say the Affordable Care Act has been a net-plus, both for individual customers who can no longer be denied access to health insurance and for the federal government which has steadily reduced its forecast of long-term health-care costs. At the same time, the law has not proven to be the drag on job growth that many Republicans warned of. Proposed Fundraiser Featuring Trump's Sons Raises Questions \"Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,\" Obama noted. The president can point to a number of other positive indicators as he prepares to leave office, including long-awaited wage gains in the last year and a modest decrease in income inequality, stemming, in part, from higher taxes on the wealthy. The president and his team are trying to document those gains, mindful that the next occupant of the White House wants to reverse much of what Obama has put in place. \"What the president-elect is going to be doing is going to be very different than what I was doing, and I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what worked for the American people,\" Obama said during his year-end news conference. \"I hope that, building off the progress we've made, that what the president-elect is proposing works. What I can say with confidence is that what we've done works.\" ",

    "text": "Better hope Bears aren't fooled by their defense Photos from the Bears-Redskins game at Soldier Field on Dec. 24, 2016. Brad Biggs Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune When digging through the layers of issues affecting the Bears , be careful to differentiate between legitimate progress that offers hope for the future and more of the same, which has had the franchise in a downward spiral for much of the last decade. You cannot make a judgment at the end of this ruinous year without considering the myriad factors that have them here, one loss away from the worst 16-game season in franchise history. But after the Redskins , with their playoff hopes wobbling following an uninspired effort on Monday night, came in on a short week and throttled the Bears 41-21 Saturday at Soldier Field with an announced attendance of 39,837, it's fair to wonder if the defensive progress that has been trumpeted is everything the Bears would like you to believe. A week after surrendering 451 yards and a back-breaking 60-yard bomb to Jordy Nelson with less than 30 seconds to play, the Bears (3-12) were smoked by the Redskins, who were without tight end Jordan Reed, one of Kirk Cousins' top targets. Washington (8-6-1) rolled up 478 yards of offense with 208 rushing yards. The Bears have surrendered more than 200 rushing yards in back-to-back games for the first time since the 2013 season. Before that, you have to go all the way back to the Abe Gibron era and 1973 to find a defense that was shredded like that in consecutive weeks. DeSean Jackson had five receptions for 114 yards and could have gone over 200 if Cousins hadn't overshot him a couple of times. Pierre Garcon had 94 yards and Mack Brown ripped off a 61-yard touchdown when all the Redskins were trying to do was run out the clock. The Bears allowed four rushing touchdowns for just the second time since 1997. The pass rush that has been successful at times this season was nonexistent. Bears could frame summing up 2016, fewer than 10,000 fans filled Soldier Field during the final minutes of Saturday's 41-21 loss to the Redskins in the last game of a lousy season on the lakefront. The McCaskeys should hang that picture in a board room at Halas... In the most fitting holiday photo the Bears could frame summing up 2016, fewer than 10,000 fans filled Soldier Field during the final minutes of Saturday's 41-21 loss to the Redskins in the last game of a lousy season on the lakefront. The McCaskeys should hang that picture in a board room at Halas... (David Haugh) \"I think a lot of it is who you're playing,\" coach John Fox said about his defense, which has allowed 929 yards the last two weeks. \"How you execute, the matchups you have ... You're going to run into those type of games.\" The Bears were without nose tackle Eddie Goldman, who became the 19th player to be placed on injured reserve, but he has appeared in only six games. Inside linebacker Jerrell Freeman returned from his four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing drugs and was credited with a team-high nine tackles. But Freeman has contributed to exactly zero takeaways, and you shouldn't forget that when framing his overall value to the defense. This was the eighth game the defense has failed to record a takeaway. The Bears have 10 takeaways for the season to rank 32nd. Unless they force seven turnovers Sunday at Minnesota, the Bears will set a franchise record for futility in creating takeaways after getting only 17 last season. Does anyone have the number for Lovie Smith in Champaign? Maybe when he's done recruiting he can pick up a consulting gig with his former team. By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd... By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd... (Dan Wiederer) Yes, the Bears need upgrades throughout the secondary and have to find players with better ball skills as they have only seven interceptions, which ranks 31st ahead of only the Jaguars . But let's not overlook the fact the defense has created only three takeaways by fumble. That's probably a lack of awareness to go for the strip, a lack of brute force and plain bad bounces when the ball hits the ground. \"We were going to try to keep them off the field,\" Fox said. \"With five giveaways to none, that kind of spoiled that plan. That has nothing to do with effort.\" In the big picture, injuries are a major storyline for this season and simply cannot be overlooked. The organization needs to take a look at them in a comprehensive review of what went wrong. It's also worth noting they've had youth on the field with inexperienced players pressed into action at all levels of the defense. But something more has to explain how the Bears have only 27 takeaways in their last 31 games. This isn't a rut, it's a consistent pattern that should no longer be acceptable. They talked about being No. 7 in the league in total defense two weeks ago, but they're trending in the wrong direction. The worst mistake the Bears can make when this season ends is a misevaluation in a desperate search for positives. They need to at least ask themselves if the defense has fooled them.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 24, 2016 10:42 AM EST LOS ANGELES -- Carrie Fisher, beloved by legions of fans for nearly 40 years since she first walked the corridors of a \u201cStar Wars\u201d spacecraft as Princess Leia Organa, is being treated in an intensive care unit after a serious medical emergency on a flight, according to her brother. Fisher went into cardiac arrest on a flight from London to Los Angeles amidst her\u00a0 book \u00a0tour, a law enforcement source told CBS News. \u00a0 Todd Fisher told The Associated Press on Friday night that his sister was receiving excellent care, but said that he could not classify her condition. He had earlier told the AP that she had been stabilized and was out of the emergency room. In a subsequent interview he said many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency are unknown, and much of what had been reported was speculation. \u201cWe have to wait and be patient,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so little information ourselves.\u201d Carrie Fisher, 60, experienced medical trouble during the flight and was treated by paramedics immediately after the plane landed in Los Angeles, according to reports citing unnamed sources. Carrie Fisher Celebrity website TMZ, which first reported the incident, said anonymous sources told them the actress suffered a heart attack. Fisher\u2019s publicists and representatives for her mother, Debbie Reynolds, and her daughter, Billie Lourd, did not immediately return calls from the AP. Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott said paramedics administered advanced life-saving care to a patient at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday and transported the person to a nearby hospital. He did not identify the patient. Passengers who were on board the flight reacted to the incident on social media. Don't know how else to process this but Carrie Fisher stopped breathing on the flight home. Hope she's gonna be OK \uf61e \u2014 Anna Akana (@AnnaAkana) December 23, 2016 So many thanks to the United flight crew who jumped into action, and the awesome doctor and nurse passengers who helped \u2014 Anna Akana (@AnnaAkana) December 23, 2016 I'm in complete shock. @AnnaAkana and I sat in front of Carrie Fisher on our flight from London and she was just taken off the plane by EMTs \u2014 Brad Gage (@bradgage) December 23, 2016 The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Ryan Parker tweeted that \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-star Harrison Ford said he was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d to hear about Fisher\u2019s situation: Harrison Ford sent me this statement concerning Carrie Fisher: https://t.co/Cus9WOegQ7 pic.twitter.com/tDymzAPSmI \u2014 Ryan Parker (@TheRyanParker) December 24, 2016 Anothe of Fisher\u2019s co-stars, Mark Hamill, was among the celebrities to weigh in on Twitter: as if 2016 couldn't get any worse... sending all our love to @carrieffisher \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 23, 2016 Thoughts and prayers for our friend and everyone's favorite princess right now.. @carrieffisher \u2014 Peter Mayhew (@TheWookieeRoars) December 23, 2016 I ask everyone to stop for a moment and send special thoughts to @carrieffisher . \u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) December 23, 2016 A large gathering of reporters was camped outside Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles hospital, where TMZ and the Los Angeles Times reported she had been taken. Fisher is considered by many to be a member of Hollywood royalty - her parents are Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher. Catapulted to stardom when the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d was released in 1977, Fisher reprised the role as the leader of a galactic rebellion in three sequels, including last year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d The author and actress may be best known for her portrayal of Leia, but she is also an accomplished writer known for no-holds-barred accounts of her struggles with addiction and mental illness. Her thinly veiled autobiography \u201cPostcards from the Edge\u201d was adapted into a 1987 film version starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep. She also transformed her one-woman show \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d which played on Broadway and was filmed for HBO, into a book. Most recently, Fisher has been promoting her latest book, \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d in which she reveals that she and co-star Harrison Ford had an affair on the set of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mr. Trump issued the decision in a press release, which said the Donald J. Trump Foundation has contributed millions of dollars to groups that support veterans, law enforcement officers and children. \u201cHowever, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,\u201d he said in the statement. Putin sends Trump Christmas letter after exchange over nuclear arms race The announcement said the president-elect has directed his counsel to take the necessary steps to dissolve the foundation. The foundation, however, cannot formally shut down until after the New York state attorney general\u2019s office completes its investigation of the foundation. \u201cThe Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\u201d the office\u2019s spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, told The Washington Post in an email Saturday. \u201cI am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need, and I am also very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity, but because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don\u2019t want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,\u201d he added. This comes after Mr. Trump said that he would not be subject to conflict of interest laws as president and after he said that his children would be taking over his businesses. \u201cThe law\u2019s totally on my side, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d Mr. Trump told The New York Times in a meeting last month. \u201cIn theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There\u2019s never been a case like this.\u201d Earlier this month, he postponed a planned announcement regarding how he would separate from his business empire . Soon after, he tweeted that he would be leaving his businesses before his inauguration next month, that his two sons would manage them while he serves in the White House and that there will be \u201cno new deals\u201d during that time. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "For those of you who missed Jay Cutler\u2019s bad and stupid play, here\u2019s Matt Barkley Photos from the Bears-Redskins game at Soldier Field on Dec. 24, 2016. For those of you who\u00a0have missed Jay Cutler \u2019s special brand of bad and stupid, there\u2019s Matt Barkley executing Cutler's Deluxe Mommy-Make-It Stop Package. Throwing into triple coverage for an interception? Check. Overthrowing a receiver for an interception? Twice, baby. Underthrowing a receiver for an interception? Natch. And of course, there was the kill-me-now pick on which Barkley was trying to avoid a sack, so as he was being dragged down, of course he threw it awkwardly anyway, allowing Josh Norman to intercept it. Please, someone, anyone, plug that massive leak of stupid gas at Halas Hall.\u00a0 For those of you\u00a0scoring at home, that\u2019s a Barkley strip-sack-lost-fumble on the first drive of last week\u2019s second half against the Packers and a Barkley interception on the first drive of this week\u2019s second half. This is the guy some people believe should be the Bears \u2019 starter next year? That massive leak of stupid gas has spread beyond Halas Hall, I fear. By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd... By the end of Saturday's game, the Soldier Field stands had emptied significantly. So, too, it seemed had the Bears ' energy reserves. In an abysmal performance befitting a woeful season, the Bears were outclassed and outperformed by the visiting Redskins. And so the parting gift for the home crowd... (Dan Wiederer) The Bears looked as bad and stupid\u00a0Saturday at home as you would\u2019ve expected Washington to look after playing on Monday night and then traveling to play a game on an even shorter week. Instead, the Washington football team killed the Bears early, killed them on third down, and killed them with one of the league\u2019s worst defenses. So, let\u2019s talk about all of John Fox\u2019s \u201ccompetitive\u2019\u2019 hooey and thumbsucking try-hard stuff. That\u2019s always his default setting: His guys didn\u2019t quit. Yeah. So what. Big deal. That\u2019s their job. Shut up about that. They\u2019re playing for their NFL lives. But there was no case to make for that Saturday, and besides, it\u2019s an idiotic stance because this is about winning. It\u2019s about being prepared to play the first halves of games. Forget the tripe about showing some fight to try to come back from a 17-point deficit against the Washington football team. How could the Bears get down 17 points against one of the worst defenses in the NFL?\u00a0 Here\u2019s an idea, John: Make your team try harder to be smarter and execute better from the start. Maybe in your next job. Washington third-and-2\u00a0at the Bears 7, and Chris Thompson blasted up the middle for a TD that made it 7-0 because the Bears decided to forfeit the linebacker position. The Choice\u00a0(and remember, death is not an option): The Bears third-and goal from the 4 or the Bears fourth-and-goal from the 4? Washington third-and-2\u00a0at the Bears 7, and Robert Kelley was stopped short. But Deiondre\u2019 Hall was flagged for illegal hands to the face for the second time on the drive. Two plays later, Washington made it 31-14. Hall was one of the Bears\u2019 three fourth-round picks not used on quarterback Dak Prescott. The Bears announced 18,116 no-shows,\u00a0but it was actually one more: hope. And they should\u2019ve\u00a0drug-tested the people did show up.

Leading by 14 points early in the fourth quarter, the Rams gave up two touchdowns -- and a two-point conversion with 31 seconds left -- in a 22-21 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday at the Coliseum. The Rams lost for the 10th time in their last 11 games and fell to 4-11. The 49ers improved to 2-13, their only victories coming against the Rams. They shut out the Rams, 28-0, in the season opener. On Saturday, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick led his team to two clutch drives and also ran the ball in for the decisive two-point conversion. The Rams led, 14-7, at halftime, and appeared to take control in the fourth quarter after cornerback E.J. Gaines forced running back Carlos Hyde to fumble after catching a pass. Defensive lineman Morgan Fox recovered the ball at the 25-yard line. A pass interference penalty against the 49ers moved the ball to the nine, and Jared Goff fired a short touchdown pass to rookie tight end Tyler Higbee for a 21-7 lead. But Kaepernick\u2019s 13-yard scramble for a touchdown pulled the 49ers to within a touchdown with about five minutes left. The Rams then went three and out, and the 49ers took over at their 27. Kaepernick masterfully drove his team down the field, connecting with receiver Rod Streater for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 31 seconds left to pull the 49ers to within\u00a021-20. Kaepernick then scrambled and dove into the end zone for the winning points. The Rams\u2019 hopes for a possible game-winning field goal ended when Rashard Robinson intercepted Goff\u2019s pass. Kaepernick completed 28 of 38 passes for 257 yards and two touchdowns\u00a0with an interception. Goff completed 11 of 24 passes for 90 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. Running back Todd Gurley rushed for 67 yards and a touchdown in 23 carries. The Rams overcame an early deficit to lead, 14-7, at halftime. The 49ers went ahead early after cornerback Tramaine Brock intercepted a Goff pass on the Rams\u2019 first possession. The turnover set up Kaepernick\u2019s19-yard touchdown pass to Hyde. On the Rams\u2019 next possession, they drove to the 49ers\u2019 30-yard line and faced fourth down. Interim coach John Fassel went for it, and Goff completed a 24-yard pass to tight end Lance Kendricks . Two plays later, Gurley ran for a on-yard touchdown to tie the score. The Rams kept the momentum when safety Cody Davis intercepted a Kaepernick pass and returned it 29 yards to the 30. The Rams wasted no time capitalizing. Goff handed off to Austin on a fly sweep from right to left, and Austin kept his feet inbounds along the left sideline and got inside the pylon for a touchdown and a 14-7 lead.

(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Dec. 24, 2016, 4:42 p.m. Rams collapse and fall to 49ers, 22-21 Lindsey Thiry Rashard Robinson intercepted a pass by Jared Goff, then the 49ers took a knee before punting and defeating the Rams, 22-21. It was a complete implosion for the Rams, who held a 21-7 lead\u00a0until the final 5:06 of the game. The Rams fall to 4-11 and\u00a0the 49ers improve to 2-13. Their two victories are against the Rams. Pharoh Cooper returned the ensuing kickoff 24 yards after the late 49ers score to give the Rams\u00a0good field position to try to get into field-goal range. But Goff's first-down pass fell incomplete and his second-down pass was intercepted. Dec. 24, 2016, 4:35 p.m. The 49ers lead the Rams, 22-21, in the fourth quarter Lindsey Thiry The Rams just imploded and will have 31 seconds to dig themselves out of a hole. Colin Kaepernick completed a 10-yard pass to Rod Streater for a touchdown and Coach Chip Kelly elected to go for a two-point conversion. The 49ers converted on a Kaepernick keeper\u00a0to take the lead, 22-21. The scoring drive covered 73 yards in 10 plays and took 2:39. The 49ers\u00a0managed to dig themselves out of another self-inflicted hole, with a false start on the first play, then caught a break from the Rams a few downs later when Cody Davis was called for a personal foul after an incomplete pass. Kaepernick played out of his mind in the series, completing passes of 12, 11, nine, two, seven and 10 yards. The Rams defense, which played so stout through 3 1/2 quarters, went silently into the night. Dec. 24, 2016, 4:20 p.m. Jared Goff sacked on third down Lindsey Thiry The 49ers fans chanted \"defense\" loud and clear. Defense is what their team gave them. The Rams went three and out after Todd Gurley rushed for five yards in consecutive carries and Jared Goff was sacked - for the fourth time - on third down. The 49ers now have a chance to tie the game and will start from their 27-yard line. Dec. 24, 2016, 4:16 p.m. The Rams lead the 49ers, 21-14, in the fourth quarter Lindsey Thiry This game just got intereseting. With 5:06 remaining, Colin Kaepernick scrambled 13 yards for a touchdowns and the Rams lead the 49ers, 21-14. The scoring drive covered 75 yards in 13 plays and took 5:26. The 49ers did all they could to set themselves back by committing two consecutive penalties, but they managed to dig themselves out of a first-and-25 hole. Kaepernick completed a 13-yard pass and then a seven-yard pass on fourth-and-seven to setup the touchdown run. Dec. 24, 2016, 4:04 p.m. The Rams lead the 49ers, 21-7, in the fourth quarter Lindsey Thiry Morgan Fox recovered a fumble and the Rams' converted the turnover into a touchdown. Jared Goff threw a dart to Tyler Higbee for a two-yard touchdown on third down. The Rams lead the 49ers, 21-7, in the fourth quarter. Carlos Hyde caught a short pass before\u00a0E.J Gaines hit him hard, forcing the fumble. Fox recovered\u00a0at 49ers' 25-yard line. The Rams' four-play, 25-yard drive was aided by a pass interference penalty called against the 49ers\u00a0on a throw to Lance Kendricks. That setup first-and-goal. Todd Gurley rushed for seven yards in consecutive carries before the touchdown pass. Gurley has rushed for 62 yards and a touchdown in 21 carries. Hyde is questionable to return because of a knee injury. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:51 p.m. Rams lose receiver Kenny Britt because of a shoulder injury How the Rams have been unable to move the football against the NFL 's worst defense in the second half is a bit unfathomable. Todd Gurley rushed for 15 yards in three carries and gained six yards on a short pass. Jared Goff was sacked on third down. Goff has been sacked three times. Johnny Hekker\u00a0punted for a seventh consecutive series. Tackle Rob Havenstein\u00a0was injured during the drive. Kenny Britt has been downgraded to out because of a shoulder injury. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:42 p.m. Aaron Donald sacks Colin Kaepernick on third down The way the 49ers' started the series, it looked like they might tie the game. That ended quickly, though. Aaron Donald sacked Colin Kaepernick on third down and once again the defensive line celebrated so hard that Dominique Easley fell over in joy. Rod Streater\u00a0caught a 17-yard pass on the first play before a false start set the 49ers back. Easley tackled Carlos Hyde for a two-yard loss and then Jeremy Kerley caught a 12-yard pass. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:35 p.m. Johnny Hekker is at it again for the Rams This game has become nearly unwatchable. But don't worry, I'm still watching it for you. The Rams went three-and-out, simple enough. Johnny Hekker punted for a sixth consecutive series. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:31 p.m. The 49ers and Rams show no offense to start second half Lindsey Thiry The 49ers' offense is almost as insufferable as the Rams. It did, after all, rank 29th in the NFL coming into the game. The Rams' ranked 32nd, also known as last. The 49ers went three-and-out and punted for a sixth consecutive series. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:27 p.m. Johnny Hekker is unofficial Rams MVP again Lindsey Thiry Johnny Hekker, the man of the day. Hekker punted for a fifth consecutive series. He set the NFL record earlier in the game for most punts down inside the 20-yard line with 47. The offense, big surprise, went three-and-out. Kenny Britt is questionable to return because of a shoulder injury. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:23 p.m. The 49ers punt for a fifth consecutive series The Rams' defense continues to play tough. The 49ers went three-and-out, including a penalty for tripping, and punted for a fifth consecutive series. The Rams have held them to 149 yards of offense (Though they've only been able to gain 155 yards themselves). Colin Kaepernick has completed 11 of 15 passes for 100 yards and a touchdown, with an interception. Dec. 24, 2016, 3:17 p.m. The Rams offense can't get moving to start second half The NFL's worst defense is now outplaying the league's worst offense. Johnny Hekker\u00a0punted for a fourth consecutive series. The Rams went three-and-out, until the 49ers\u00a0were called for a personal foul when a defensive back shoved Kenny Britt in the face. The free first down served little help, though, as Hekker punted after three plays that went nowhere. For a little comic relief in the series, the Rams were called for a false start and the official said: \"False start, everyone but the center.\" Dec. 24, 2016, 2:54 p.m. The Rams lead the 49ers, 14-7, at halftime This game definitely hit a lull\u00a0in the second quarter. Jared Goff took a knee to end the half after the 49ers went three-and-out and punted. Shaun Draughn rushed for nine yards in three carries. Dec. 24, 2016, 2:49 p.m. Rams offense slows down in second quarter The Rams offense has been stagnant since the first quarter. Johnny Hekker\u00a0punted another ball inside the Rams' 20-yard line. Todd Gurley rushed for 13 yards in two carries, Lance Kendricks caught a six-yard pass and then Jared Goff's third-down pass was knocked down at the line of scrimmage. The 49ers will have 38 seconds to try to score some points before halftime. Dec. 24, 2016, 2:45 p.m. The Rams defense forces the 49ers to punt E.J. Gaines tackled Aaron Burbridge \u2014\u00a0hard \u2014\u00a0after he caught two-yard pass, short of a first down and the 49ers punted for a fourth time. The Rams' defense, as it has most of the season, came to play. Carlos Hyde rushed 13 yards in three carries. Colin Kaepernick completed\u00a0passes for 13 yards and\u00a0nine yards. Dec. 24, 2016, 2:37 p.m. Johnny Hekker makes NFL history A Rams punt resulted in history for Johnny Hekker, who now holds the NFL record for punts inside the 20-yard line with 47. The Rams followed the 49ers' three-and-out with one of their own. Tyler Higbee caught a three-yard pass, Malcolm Brown rushed for two yards and then Jared Goff's third-down pass \u2014 intended for Tavon Austin \u2014 sailed out of bounds. If only Jeff Fisher were here to see Hekker's\u00a0historic moment. Dec. 24, 2016, 2:30 p.m. The 49ers go three and out Lindsey Thiry The 49ers went three and out and punted for a third time. Eugene Sims tackled Colin Kaepernick\u00a0after he gained three yards in the first play. Then Carlos Hyde was tackled at the line of scrimmage by William Hayes , and Kaepernick's third-down pass was dropped. Dec. 24, 2016, 2:24 p.m. Jared Goff hit twice; Rams punt Jared Goff is taking a beating again today. In five plays, he was hit twice \u2014\u00a0hard. The Rams punted. Todd Gurley\u00a0caught a nine-yard pass and then was tackled for a five-yard loss on the next play because of a blitz. Goff's third-down pass slipped through the fingertips of Tavon\u00a0Austin. The throw appeared a bit high. ",

(Photo: Twitter, for USA TODAY) There's already been a shake-up on President-elect Donald Trump's communications team Jason Miller, just announced this week as the incoming White House communications director, said Saturday he won't be joining the White House after all, citing family reasons. \u201cAfter spending this past week with my family, the most amount of time I have been able to spend with them since March 2015, it is clear they need to be my top priority right now and this is not the right time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications director,\u201d Miller said in a statement. He added: \"My wife and I are also excited about the arrival of our second daughter in January, and I need to put them in front of my career.\" Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer will assume his communications duties, Miller said.

    "text": "The Google Chromecast Logo Stream These Family-Friendly Classic Holiday Movies Summon the ghosts of Christmas movies, past and present, for some good cheer. That burning \u201cYule Log\u201d video keeps visiting friends and family entertained for only so long. By Monica Castillo It\u2019s a Wonderful Life It\u2019s not all good tidings in Bedford Falls, the setting of this Frank Capra classic from 1946. Poor George Bailey (James Stewart) is contemplating suicide after a terrible business deal threatens his family\u2019s well-being just before Christmas. Lucky for him, a benevolent angel (Henry Travers) is there to show him what\u2019s truly important. The film starts light, turns dark, and contains one of the most life-affirming endings of all time. Add to Watchlist White Christmas There\u2019s nothing like a classic Christmas tune to warm up a party. In the 1954 film \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d named after Irving Berlin\u2019s yearning song, a song-and-dance duo (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) team up with two\u00a0equally talented sisters (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to save a failing hotel. And if you\u2019re really into the title song, seek\u00a0out\u00a01942\u2019s \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d starring Crosby and Fred Astaire. Add to Watchlist A Christmas Story Follow a child\u2019s topsy-turvy midcentury memories as a now-grown Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) remembers the best Christmas present he ever got (a Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred-shot range-model air rifle!), the trouble he went to get it, and several misadventures along the way. The 1983 movie\u2019s catchphrase comes from the answer Ralphie gets for his gift request: \u201cYou\u2019ll shoot your eye out.\u201d Add to Watchlist The Muppet Christmas Carol Michael Caine plays the grouchy Ebenezer Scrooge in this Muppet-filled adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s the less frightening Muppet ghosts that make this version so kid-friendly. Regardless, Caine\u2019s performance is a delight for all ages. Add to Watchlist Miracle on 34th Street There have been \u00a0a few remakes of this 1947 film, but accept no substitutes. A man claiming to be Santa (Edmund Gwenn) is taken to court, and an upstart lawyer (John Payne) tries to prove he\u2019s right. The little girl in the movie is played by a young and precocious Natalie Wood. Add to Watchlist Meet Me in St. Louis Break open the MGM vault for this heartfelt 1944 film, in which Judy Garland plays a loving older sister in a family that\u00a0is told they will be leaving the titular Midwestern city to move to the East Coast. Garland\u2019s rendition of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d remains one of the most melancholy holiday songs ever. Add to Watchlist Elf This endearing story follows a human raised by elves (Will Ferrell) who ventures from the North Pole to the streets of New York City in search of his real dad (a delightfully grumpy James Caan). As is the case with many Ferrell movies, it\u2019s very quotable. And if you say otherwise, then you are sitting on a throne of lies. Add to Watchlist Home Alone By yourself\u00a0for the holidays? Take some home security tips from Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin), the smart kid in this 1990 John Hughes film,\u00a0who devises\u00a0elaborate booby traps to fend off robbers after his parents accidentally leave him behind\u00a0during their rush to the airport. Take Kevin\u2019s dietary and personal hygiene tips only under advisement. Add to Watchlist Love, Actually Love it or hate it, you probably have some opinion about this 2003 holiday movie. Alternating between different characters during\u00a0the Christmas season, its stories\u00a0can be\u00a0sad, sweet and\u00a0bittersweet, but in the end, there is\u00a0love. Or, at least some form of it. And a sad\u00a0dude with handwritten signs and a boom box. An\u00a0ensemble cast includes\u00a0Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. Add to Watchlist National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation Everything that can go wrong went wrong in \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\u201d which followed the Griswold clan on its\u00a0disastrous trip to a theme park. Ditto on their trip to Europe. This third installation in the \u201cVacation\u201d series offers no break for Clark the patriarch (Chevy Chase) and his beleaguered family. Of course the Christmas tree will be ruined, the turkey will be overcooked, and the in-laws will be most displeased. Best not to\u00a0speak of what happens to the cat. Add to Watchlist The Nightmare Before Christmas Halloweenland\u2019s Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington, wants to play Santa Claus (whom he calls Sandy Claws) on Christmas Eve, despite not quite understanding the concept. Based on a story by Tim Burton, this darkly sweet and whimsical\u00a0stop-motion-animation film by\u00a0Henry Selick\u00a0imagines\u00a0what happens when Halloween\u2019s monsters recreate Christmas with typically Burtonesque flair.

By Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horwitz December 24 at 7:46 PM Follow @nakashimae Follow @sarihorwitz Jeff Sessions cheers as he is introduced as the nominee for U.S. attorney general by President-elect Donald Trump in Mobile, Ala., during a \u201cThank You Tour 2016\u201d rally on Dec. 17, 2016. (Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Evelyn Turner is 80 now and a stroke survivor, but she can still recall sitting in a packed courthouse in Selma, Ala., facing a jury that could send her and her husband, an aide to Martin Luther King Jr., to prison for 150 years. The charges: mail fraud, voting more than once, and changing absentee ballots. The trial \u201cwas nerve-racking,\u201d recalled Turner, a mother of four. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to go to jail and leave my family.\u201d The U.S. attorney bringing the election fraud case was Jeff Sessions, today a four-term Republican senator from Alabama who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general. Back in 1985 when his prosecutors tried the Turners and a third activist, black Americans were gaining ground in elective offices across the South. Sessions\u2019s office charged the \u201cMarion Three\u201d \u2014 named after the Perry County town where the voter fraud allegedly took place \u2014 with tampering with absentee ballots cast by mostly elderly black voters to favor the activists\u2019 preferred candidates. [ The facts about the voter fraud case that sank Jeff Sessions\u2019s bid for a judgeship ] Sessions\u2019s team lost the case. After deliberating for three hours, a jury of seven blacks and five whites found the defendants not guilty on all charges. The case and allegations of racial insensitivity figured prominently at a Senate hearing a year later at which Sessions\u2019s nomination to be a federal judge was defeated by a vote of the Judiciary Committee. Some 30 years later, he will appear before the same committee \u2014 of which he is now a senior member \u2014 as the nominee to become the next attorney general. After coming of age in the Deep South during the darkest days of the civil rights movement, Sessions has struggled to reconcile the racial politics of his region with the changing national discourse that lifted long-standing legal barriers for minorities. Sessions\u2019s long record in public life reveals a man who has hired African Americans for senior positions who speak highly of him, but who has been sharply criticized by civil rights groups for his positions on voting rights, same-sex marriage and gender equality. In 1986, for instance, when he testified before Congress, he called the Voting Rights Act \u201cintrusive\u201d but \u201cnecessary.\u201d Then in 2006, as a U.S. senator, he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. But seven years later, he said it was \u201cgood news . . . for the South\u201d when the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the law, which made it more difficult for the federal government to protect people from racial discrimination in voting. In Sessions, Trump found a man who holds deeply conservative views. He positions himself as a champion of the working class and expounds the same populist message that has come to dominate the Republican Party: a belief that the world is divided between working people and elitist \u201cmasters of the universe,\u201d and that illegal immigration poses an existential threat to the country. A diminutive, silver-haired figure, known among Senate colleagues for his courteous manner, Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump, back in February. Sessions donned a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, stumped at rallies and tried to coax his colleagues on board. Many of his positions mirror those of the president-elect, whether it is building a wall along the Mexican border or restricting immigration from Muslim countries that harbor terrorists. At a 2006 congressional hearing, Sessions said that an entire group of people wouldn\u2019t thrive in America. \u201cFundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming because they have a skill that would benefit us and would indicate their likely success in our society,\u201d he said. In 2009, he voted against a hate crimes bill named after Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming student murdered in 1998, that extended federal hate crime protections to people victimized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. [ Voting rights advocates brace for \u2018biggest fight of our lifetime during Trump administration ] As state attorney general in 1995, he argued against a decision by the Alabama Circuit Court to order the state to remedy funding inequities between the poorest school districts, which were heavily black, and their wealthiest, which were predominantly white. He did so on the grounds that taxing and spending power lay with the legislature, not the courts. Sessions\u2019s staff members say that while Sessions was U.S. attorney, he filed a host of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama. But Sessions did not initiate the lawsuits. Rather, he signed off on paperwork from the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, supporting continuing federal desegregation lawsuits, which in some cases were decades old. He also signed off on election lawsuits brought by the Justice Department to convert countywide elections to multiple district elections so that African Americans could be represented on county commissions and schools boards. Supporters point out that as U.S. attorney, he worked hard on the successful 1983 prosecution of two Ku Klux Klan members for killing a black youth. Former FBI director Louis J. Freeh, in a letter of support to the Senate Judiciary Committee, also noted Sessions\u2019s \u201cfierce determination\u201d to solve two civil rights murders: the 1989 killings of a federal judge in Alabama and an official with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And as a U.S. senator, Sessions co-sponsored legislation to honor civil rights activist Rosa Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal. But that doesn\u2019t convince Rose Sanders, a lawyer and civil rights activist in Selma whose husband was on the Marion Three defense team. Sanders is adamant: \u201cHe is racist to the core.\u201d In sharp contrast, former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson, who is African American, considers Sessions a good friend of more than 30 years. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an African American man for 71 years,\u201d said Thompson, who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cI think I know a racist when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He\u2019s a good person, a decent person.\u201d \u2018The knee-knocker\u2019 As a young man, Jeff Sessions was active in Boy Scouts and then became an Eagle Scout. (Family photo) Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, 70, is a third-generation Alabamian born in Selma. He was raised in a tiny town called Hybart, in Monroe County, the setting for the novel \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d His mother called him \u201cBuddy\u201d to distinguish him from his father, who ran a country store and then a tractor dealership. An only child, he attended a segregated school. \u201cWe never knew anything else,\u201d recalled Les Johnson, a longtime friend and a retired banker. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it was.\u201d Sessions was active in Boy Scouts and became an Eagle Scout. To this day he has the motto \u201cBe Prepared\u201d on the back of his nameplate on his desk in his Senate office. He played linebacker on the high school team. He wasn\u2019t big, \u201cbut he could sure tackle \u2019em!\u201d recalled Kay Ivey, a friend. \u201cSome people called him \u2018the knee-knocker.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cbottom line,\u201d said Ivey, who is now Alabama\u2019s lieutenant governor, \u201cis Jeff Sessions is a man of his word. If he tells you something, you can take it to the bank. He\u2019s straight as an arrow and believes in the rule of law. Just like in football, when he grabs onto something, he hangs on tight.\u201d Sessions left home for college, attending a Methodist liberal arts college in Montgomery, Ala., called Huntingdon. He met his wife-to-be, Mary Blackshear, during his freshman year, and they married after graduation. Sessions organized a chapter of the Young Republicans, at a time when Democrats ruled the state, and became student government president. \u201cThat quiet friendliness and courtesy to everyone\u201d is what got him elected, said Lindora Snyder, a college friend. Jeff Sessions met his wife-to-be, Mary Blackshear, during his freshman year at college. (Family photo) Jeff Sessions as a boy in a toy police car. (Family photo) After graduating from Huntingdon, Sessions earned a law degree from the University of Alabama and then joined a small law firm before becoming an assistant U.S. attorney in Mobile. After a stint at another firm, in 1981, he was appointed U.S. attorney by President Ronald Reagan. As U.S. attorney, Sessions worked with some minority communities. Robert Battles Sr., who was a neighborhood organizer in Mobile in the 1980s, said Sessions helped set up a \u201cdrug court\u201d in the county to help first-time offenders clear their records. The effort primarily helped black youths who had minor drug convictions. The Marion Three Alabama state troopers swing nightsticks to break up a civil rights voting march in Selma, Ala., on March 7, 1965. (Associated Press) The voter fraud case made national news, and it was emblematic, voting rights advocates say, of a push by officials in several Southern states to try to disenfranchise black voters. Sessions was, former Justice Department officials say, the first U.S. attorney in the country to prosecute civil rights activists for voter fraud since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Albert Turner was the son of a sharecropper who rose to become King\u2019s field secretary in Alabama. In 1965, Turner was in the front lines of the voting rights marchers who were attacked on a bridge in Selma by billy-club-wielding state troopers in what came to be known as \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d In the 1980s, activists such as Turner sought to raise black voter participation by helping those who could not readily get to the polls, especially the elderly, the disabled, those who were barely literate and those who worked outside of the district in which they were registered to vote. The activists also would drop the absentee ballots in the mail. The case arose out of complaints to the district attorney brought by local black officials that Turner, who led the Perry County Civic League, and associates were taking absentee ballots and altering the votes. At the time, there was a split between two factions, both black, that were vying for power in the county, according to congressional testimony. Sessions testified to Congress in 1986 that the number of absentee ballots cast in Perry County in the primary was extraordinary: 729 out of 4,000 total. At his suggestion, he said, the FBI staked out the Marion post office before the primary and watched as the Turners and an associate, Spencer Hogue, drove up. Under a court order, election officials secretly numbered the ballots and matched them to the envelopes. \u201cThese are the sort of tactics,\u201d defense attorney J.L. Chestnut told the jury at the trial, that make \u201cyour American spines . . . tingle.\u201d Sessions explained what the authorities found. \u201cWhen those ballots were opened, there was a substantial number of them that had candidates\u2019 names crossed out,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere would be an \u2018X\u2019 by one candidate and both the name and the X would be crossed out and an X placed beside another candidate\u2019s name.\u201d A total of 75 ballots had been changed, he said. Any changes were made by the voters of their own volition, Evelyn Turner said in an interview. Her husband, she said, would tell the voter: \u201cIf this is not the person you want to vote for, then just draw a line through it. And he would even make them initial it,\u201d she said. Such voter assistance was permitted by state law. Albert Turner died in 2000. But his younger brother, Robert Turner, 65, who is a lawyer in Marion and was also part of the defense team, is convinced that Sessions wanted to use his brother\u2019s visibility to send a message. \u201cYou got a person like Albert Turner that\u2019s out front, spearheading all these voter registration drives, why not put him in jail and see how many people get scared?\u201d he said. Sessions has said he believed the prosecution was \u201cwell founded,\u201d and he denied accusations that he was seeking to suppress black turnout. \u2018Hospital humor\u2019 Beulah Donald wipes away tears as she enters the funeral for her son Michael, 19, in Mobile, Ala., on March 28, 1981. (Mark Foley/Associated Press) Sessions\u2019s views on race burst onto the national stage a year later, in 1986, when Reagan nominated him to be a federal judge. Not only did the Turner case get rehashed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but remarks he had made in other cases emerged, too. [ Jeff Sessions\u2019s comments on race: For the record ] One of the most controversial was a quip he made during the 1983 investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. A 19-year-old African American, Michael Donald, had been attacked by two members of the Klan, who snatched him at gunpoint while he was walking home in Mobile, drove him to an empty field, beat him with a tree limb, slit his throat and hanged him from a tree. It was the last recorded case of a Klan lynching. After local officials botched the investigation, the Justice Department intervened. Barry F. Kowalski was a white lawyer in the department\u2019s civil rights division when he traveled to Mobile to work for four months on the investigation. In the South at that time, not all U.S. attorneys welcomed department lawyers from Washington, but Sessions was \u201centirely supportive,\u201d said Kowalski, who is now retired. \u201cHe was instrumental in making sure that both the state and federal prosecutions happened,\u201d Kowalski said in an interview. Both men were convicted. One, after pleading guilty to criminal conspiracy in federal court, was sent to prison for life. The other, convicted in state court, was executed. \u201cYou get close to somebody when you\u2019re working together on a sensitive case,\u201d Kowalski said. \u201cI got close enough to him that I am convinced that he sincerely cared about solving that vicious murder and lynching of an African American.\u201d At one point in the investigation, Kowalski told Sessions that the Klansmen had been smoking marijuana and drinking on the night of the attack. Sessions seemed surprised that Klansmen would smoke marijuana, and Kowalski said he teased him that it was the 1980s. To which Sessions replied, as Kowalski remembers: \u201cI used to respect them, but if they smoke pot, I sure can\u2019t.\u201d Kowalski took it as a joke between two men working on a grim murder. \u201cIt was hospital humor,\u201d he said. Later, in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, Sessions made the same comment, but this time, two other lawyers were also present: Thomas H. Figures and Albert Glenn. Figures, the only black prosecutor in the office, who was also working on the case, later testified before the Judiciary Committee that he was deeply offended and did not think the comment was a joke. Kowalski and Glenn, also white, testified they thought the comment was intended to be humorous. Other allegations of insensitive remarks were aired at the more than 19-hour hearing. One witness said that Sessions called the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired.\u201d Sessions denied making some statements, said others were taken out of context, and at one point said he could be \u201cloose with my tongue.\u201d Finally, he said, forcefully: \u201cI am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create. I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks. I have supported civil rights activity in my state.\u201d The Republican-led committee, including his home-state senator, Howell Heflin, rejected his nomination by a vote of 10 to eight. In 1995, Sessions became state attorney general. A year later, he ran for the U.S. Senate, winning the seat vacated by Heflin, who retired. Sessions joined the committee that had rejected him. As a senator, Sessions hired William Smith, the first black Republican chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Smith said that he never saw any indications of racially insensitive behavior. \u201cJeff Sessions is a man who cared for me, who looked out for me and who had my best interests in mind,\u201d said Smith, who is now the chief of staff for Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.). \u201cSo, anybody who says anything different doesn\u2019t know Jeff Sessions. \u2018I should have stepped forward more\u2019 Sen. Jeff Sessions, left, with Evelyn Turner, center. Also pictured are civil rights foot soldiers Ethel Ford, right, and James Avery. (Albert Turner Jr.) In February, Evelyn Turner traveled to Washington to represent her husband in a ceremony awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the \u201cfoot soldiers\u201d who took part in the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery. Sessions had sponsored the legislation in the Senate. Civil rights activists and their families, along with leaders of the Senate and the House, filled the grand Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitors Center. Sessions rose to speak. \u201cI was a teenager at the time of this march growing up 35 miles south in the little town of Camden, attending all-white segregated schools,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw evidence of discrimination virtually every day. I think even the youth of our time were aware of the historic events that were beginning to unfold in Selma, but maybe probably not fully understanding the significance of it. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, looking out at the sea of faces, \u201cI feel like I should have stepped forward more and been a leader and a more positive force in the great events that were occurring.\u201d [ Watch the Gold Medal ceremony ] He invoked the name of the man he had once tried to send to prison years after the march. \u201cSeeing that film [footage of the march], I always see Albert Turner Sr. in the front with his white hat going down when the troopers attacked.\u2019\u2019 Sessions praised the foot soldiers for their \u201ccourage and fidelity\u201d and added: \u201cMore needs to be done. We need to join closer hands.\u201d Afterward, he greeted the Alabama delegation. He reached out to hug Evelyn Turner. But she held him off. \u201cI told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hug you. You tried to send us off for . . . years,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, Mrs. Turner,\u201d he said, as she recalled. Her son, Albert Turner Jr., who was at her side, turned to her. \u201cMama, that\u2019s over with. You\u2019re old now. You\u2019ve got to forgive him,\u201d he said. \u201cI might forgive him,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I won\u2019t forget.\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Julie Tate and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.

The Rockettes' union announced late Friday that no dancer would be obligated to perform at the president-elect's inauguration last month. Scott Gries/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Scott Gries/Getty Images Updated Dec. 24th, 11:00 a.m. ET The Radio City Rockettes deal in precision, but the story of the group agreeing to perform at Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony next month is a bit of a mess. Let's break it down: The latest Late Friday, following negotiations with the Rockettes owner, the Madison Square Garden Co., and the performers' union, The American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), announced on Facebook that no Rockettes would be obligated to perform. \"Fortunately, the Company has agreed that ALL participation in this particular event will be voluntary. We are greatly relieved and hope to work with our Members to inform them and alleviate the anxiety and fears that this has caused.\" How we got here: Thursday Donald Trump's transition-team and the Madison Square Garden Co. confirmed that the Rockettes would perform at the president-elect's inauguration next month. Almost immediately, the Rockettes were coming under criticism on social media \u2014 including from one Rockette herself . In a since deleted post on Instagram, dancer Phoebe Pearl said she was \"embarrassed and disappointed\" to learn of the decision. Article continues after sponsorship \"The women I work with are intelligent and are full of love,\" Pearl wrote. \"The decision of performing for a man that stands for everything we're against is appalling.\" She added, \"We have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts,\" with the hashtag #notmypresident. Thursday night Any talk of boycotting the performance seemed to be quashed by the Rockettes' union \u2014 the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). In an email obtained and published by Broadwayworld.com , a union representative wrote that \"Everyone is entitled to her own political beliefs, but there is no room for this in the workplace.\" The letter noted that dancers who are not full time did not have to sign up to perform, but \"if you are fulltime, you are obligated.\" The story was widely circulated by news outlets, including CNBC , Rolling Stone , the BBC, and NPR. Friday The Madison Square Garden Co. released a statement stating that all performances were voluntary: \"The Radio City Rockettes are proud to participate in the 58th Presidential Inaugural. For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural. It is always their choice. In fact, for the coming inauguration, we had more Rockettes request to participate than we have slots available. We eagerly await the inaugural celebrations.\" In a post on the AGVA's Facebook page, the union stated that following a meeting, the Madison Square Garden Co. had agreed that all participation would be voluntary (though the MSG Co. seems to be saying that was the case all along.) The AGVA also clarified the language of their Thursday email, stating: The Union never \"demanded\" that the Rockettes perform at the inauguration. A message was sent to the Rockettes last evening that stated the terms of their contract. There is a small group of year round Rockettes who are contractually obligated to perform at scheduled events throughout the year. We are pleased that Radio City has agreed that for those Rockettes with year-round employment, participation in this event will be voluntary as well. College dance team faces similar backlash So, it seems that Rockettes who don't want to participate are off the hook. But the dance troupe is not the only group coming under fire for being involved in the inauguration celebrations. The Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday that Texas State University's dance team, The Strutters, had shut down its Twitter account following harsh criticism for agreeing to participate. It remained deleted as of midday Saturday. Thoughts were mixed on the group's announcement on Facebook. Several major acts, including Elton John, Garth Brooks, Celine Dion and Idina Menzel, have reportedly refused to participate in the inauguration celebrations. In response to a question from Vanity Fair about Trump's difficulty locking down performers , Menzel said, \"It's karma, baby.\" ",

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. \u2014 More than 1,000 volunteers are tracking Santa's Christmas Eve flight around the world and relaying his status to kids excited for a visit from\u00a0St. Nick. Top U.S. military agency NORAD stages the tracking effort annually on behalf of kids across the Earth, taking calls from children who want to know if they're on the Naughty or Nice list (only Santa knows that), whether he got their last-minute present request (he gets regular updates) and whether the weather will stop him from coming. (Nope, because Rudolph.) Phones ring constantly in the command center as volunteers remind kids to be thankful, stay asleep tonight no matter what they hear\u00a0and do their best to stay on the Nice list all year. Oh, and don't forget to\u00a0go to bed early to ensure Santa has time to get his work done. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I thought it would be,\u201d said grinning first-time volunteer Maj. Brian Tuzzolino of the U.S. Air Force. \u201cI\u2019m 42, but I feel like I\u2019m 12.\u201d NORAD Tracks Santa volunteer Camille Bazin gives an update on St. Nick's location to a caller on Christmas Eve. \u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) The Santa tracking tradition began in 1955 after a Colorado Springs-based Sears, Roebuck & Co. advertisement misprinted the telephone number for children to call Santa. Instead of Santa, children reached the commander in chief's hotline at CONAD, the U.S.\u00a0Continental Air Defense Command. Col. Harry Shoup, the director of operations back then, instructed his staff to check the radar for signs of Santa traveling south from the North Pole and give the children updates. The practice continued and was taken over in 1958 by NORAD, the binational air defense command for North America, run by the governments of Canada and the United States. The\u00a0 website \u00a0is available in eight languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Chinese. On-site volunteers were averaging 4,000 calls every half-hour Saturday. NORAD operates the Santa tracker with help from corporate partners, including\u00a0Microsoft and\u00a0Verizon.\u00a0 Google also offers a Santa tracker. The NORAD Tracks Santa line is a lighthearted way to showcase the capabilities of the men and women -- and technology -- that protect North America every moment, including during the holidays. \u00a0(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Beyond its Santa tracking duties,\u00a0NORAD monitors the skies above North America for attacks and UFOs. It uses a combination of land- and sea-based radar, infrared-sensitive satellites and aircraft to monitor the skies. \u201cIt\u2019s a way we can showcase to the world the capabilities we have at NORAD,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Reynold Hoover, the deputy commander of NORTHCOM, who is also vice commander at\u00a0NORAD. 251 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2irB9D0 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Francis has spent much of the year denouncing the Islamic extremist violence that has driven Christians from Mideast communities that date to the time of Christ. He has also demanded Europe in particular do more to welcome refugees, saying Jesus himself was a migrant who deserved more than being born in a manger. And he has called out the wasteful ways of the wealthy when children and the poor die of hunger every day.\u00a0 Pope steps out to buy his own shoes In his homily, Francis urged his flock to reflect on how children today aren\u2019t always allowed to lie peacefully in a cot, loved by their parents as Jesus was, but rather \u201csuffer the squalid mangers that devour dignity.\u201d Among the indignities, he said, are \u201chiding underground to escape bombardment, on the pavements of a large city, at the bottom of a boat overladen with immigrants.\u201d \u201cLet us allow ourselves to be challenged by the children who are not allowed to be born, by those who cry because no one satiates their hunger, by those who do have not toys in their hands, but rather weapons,\u201d he added. The Mass late Saturday was the first major event of the Christmas season, followed by Francis\u2019 noon Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) blessing on Christmas Day. In another appeal, Francis called for the faithful to not get caught up in the commercialization of Christmas -- \u201cwhen we are concerned for gifts but cold toward those who are marginalized.\u201d Materialism has \u201ctaken us hostage this Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to free ourselves of it!\u201d\u00a0 Last week, Francis \u00a0celebrated his 80th birthday by sharing breakfast with eight homeless people before celebrating Mass with cardinals as greetings flowed in from around the world. \u00a0\u00a0 Pope Francis celebrates 80th birthday with the homeless The pope chatted individually with each of the homeless guests -- four Italians, two Romanians, a Moldovan and a Peruvian -- at the Vatican hotel where he resides, and shared Argentinian cakes with them before heading to Mass, the Vatican said.\u00a0 The guests offered the pope a bouquet of sunflowers. They were invited from among those staying around St. Peter\u2019s Square and at nearby showers for the homeless established by the pope\u2019s almsgiver.\u00a0 Speaking to the cardinals, Francis contemplated the aging process, telling them, \u201cFor some days now, I have had in mind a word that seems ugly: Old age, a thought that frightens.\u201d But then he recalled his words during his first papal greeting in 2013, when he said: \u201cOld age is the thirst for knowledge.\u201d\u00a0 He added: \u201cI hope it will be the same for me.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

A provincial governor offered roasted pigs to entice villagers to move to emergency shelters. Typhoon Nock-Ten packed maximum sustained winds of 114 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) and gusts of up to 158 mph (255 kph), and was expected to smash into the island province of Catanduanes Sunday night. It's then forecast to blow westward across the southern portion of the main Luzon island and pass close to the capital, Manila, on Monday, before exiting into the South China Sea. Nock-Ten may weaken after landfall and hitting the Sierra Madre mountain range in southern Luzon. Stranded passengers from Tabaco port are evacuated by the local government in Tabaco City, Albay province on December 24, 2016 after their seafaring vessels were prohibited from sailing ahead of typhoon Nock-Ten's expected arrival. CHARISM SAYAT / AFP - Getty Images Heavy rainfall, destructive winds and battering waves were threatening heavily populated rural and urban regions, where the Philippine weather agency raised typhoon warnings. Officials warned of storm surges in coastal villages, flash floods and landslides and asked villagers to evacuate to safer grounds. But Christmas is the biggest holiday in the country, Asia's bastion of Catholicism, giving officials a hard time getting people's attention away from the holidays to heed the warnings. With many refusing to leave high-risk communities, some officials said they decided to carry out forced evacuations. In the past 65 years, seven typhoons have struck the Philippines on Christmas Day, according to the government's weather agency. Gov. Miguel Villafuerte of Camarines Sur, which is on the typhoon's forecast path, offered roast pigs, a popular Christmas delicacy locally called \"lechon,\" in evacuation centers to entice villagers to move to emergency shelters. \"I know it's Christmas ... but this is a legit typhoon,\" Villafuerte tweeted on Christmas Eve. \"Please evacuate, we'll be having lechon at evacuation centers.\" Filipino villagers with their belongings walk at a coastal village on Christmas Day in Cavite city, Cavite province, Philippines, 25 December 2016. FRANCIS R. MALASIG / EPA Camarines Sur officials targeted about 50,000 families \u2014 some 250,000 people \u2014 for evacuation by Saturday night, but the number of those who responded was far below expectations. In Catanduanes province, Vice Gov. Shirley Abundo said she has ordered a forced evacuation of villagers, saying some \"are really hard-headed, they don't want to leave their houses because it's Christmas.\" \"We need to do this by force, we need to evacuate them now,\" she told ABS-CBN television. The Department of Social Welfare and Development, which helps oversee government response during disasters, said only about 4,200 people were reported to have moved to six evacuation centers by Sunday morning in the Bicol region that includes Camarines Sur. She expects more people to heed evacuation orders as the weather begins to deteriorate. \"It's difficult to force celebrations when our lives will be put at risk. Please prioritize safety and take heed of warnings by local government units,\" welfare official Felino Castro told The Associated Press by telephone. Residents sit inside a classroom at the Central Elementary School which was turned into an evacuation centre in Santo Domingo, Albay province on December 25, 2016 due to approaching Typhoon Nock-Ten. CHARISM SAYAT / AFP - Getty Images He said food, water and other emergency supplies had been pre-positioned in areas expected to be lashed by the typhoon. His department was to activate an emergency cluster composed of the military, police, coast guard and other agencies Sunday to oversee disaster-response plans. About 20 typhoons and storms, mostly from the Pacific, lash the Philippine archipelago each year and provincial governments have long laid down a contingency system to launch war-like logistical preparations each time a major typhoon approaches. But in an impoverished nation of more than 100 million people, where many live near the coast and on and around mountains and volcanoes, deadly natural catastrophes are a part of life in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines with ferocious power, leaving more than 7,300 people dead and missing and displacing more than 5 million others after leveling entire villages despite days of dire warnings by government officials.

    "text": "After UN vote, Kerry suggests Israel's West Bank foray spawning 'terrorism' Published               December 24, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Secretary of State John Kerry is defending the Obama administration\u2019s decision to effectively allow the United Nations to condemn Israel for attempting to build more settlements in the disputed West Bank, saying the \u201cunprecedented\u201d effort has spawned terrorism and violence that jeopardizes lasting peace in the region. The United States on Friday abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote to adopt a resolution condemning Israel\u2019s settlement expansion, which allowed for the measure\u2019s passage and resulted in the disapproval of incoming Republican President Donald Trump. \u201cThings will be different after Jan. 20,\u201d Trump tweeted minutes after the vote. Kerry said Israel\u2019s continued and stepped-up attempts to build more settlements, or communities, in the region, which includes East Jerusalem, risks the so-called \u201ctwo-state\u201d solution between Israelis and the Palestinians, who also lay claim to the region.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution, which every U.S. administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\" Kerry said Friday. \u201cTwo states is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors, and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.\u201d He also said the administration does not agree with \u201cevery aspect\u201d of the resolution but that it \u201crightly condemns violence\u201d and calls on both sides to take constructive steps to reverse current trends and advance the prospects for a two-state solution. The resolution was put forward by four nations a day after Egypt withdrew it Thursday under pressure from Israel and Trump. The U.S. not vetoing the measure is being considered a snub to the country\u2019s key Middle East ally and attributed to outgoing Democratic President Obama, who has had chilly relations with Israel throughout his eight-year tenure. Reaction from U.S. Republicans and Jewish leaders around the world was swift and sharp. \"It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share and that they would have vetoed this disgraceful resolution,\" said Israel's Ambassador Danny Danon. \"I have no doubt that the new U.S. administration and the incoming UN Secretary General will usher in a new era in terms of the UN's relationship with Israel.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the administration for appearing to undermine America's historic Middle East ally. \"This is absolutely shameful,\" he said. \"Today's vote is a blow to peace that sets a dangerous precedent for further diplomatic efforts to isolate and demonize Israel.\" Former GOP presidential candidate and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called the administration\u2019s move \u201ca big mistake.\u201d Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, said the contention that settlements, and not Palestinian terrorism, is the obstacle to peace is false. \"This UN resolution represents the Big Lie of modern anti-Semitism,\" Bayefsky said. \"Palestinians' backers on the Council, New Zealand and Malaysia, made today's slander clear, claiming Jews living peaceful, productive lives on Arab-claimed land was the 'single biggest threat to peace' and \"primary threat to a two-state solution.\u2019 \"Seven decades of violent Palestinian rejection of a Jewish state prove otherwise.\" The measure was adopted with 14 votes in favor, to a round of applause, after U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power abstained. It is the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years. Powers said the U.S. used its veto power in 2007 on a similar matter but that \u201ccircumstances have (since) changed dramatically.\u201d \u201cOne cannot simultaneously champion Israeli settlements and champion a viable two-state solution,\u201d she said. \u201cOne has to make a choice.\u201d The Obama White House, under heavy pressure from the Israeli government and its supporters to veto the resolution, kept everyone guessing until the vote whether it would stop shielding Israel from council resolutions and permit it to pass by abstaining. After the vote, White House officials acknowledged on a conference that Obama made the decision himself after several rounds of discussions with top administration officials. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said afterward that the U.S. has only one president at a time. Israel believes it has the right to expand settlements in the disputed territories as populations within them expand. Palestinians do not believe the settlements should exist at all, and world condemnation of expansion is seen as a possible first in that direction. \u00a0The resolution calls on Israel to \u201cimmediately and completely cease all settlement activity in occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.\u201d And it repeated the longstanding U.N. position that all settlements on land Israel conquered in 1967 are illegal under international law. A senior Israeli official accused the U.S. of a \"shameful move\" after learning that it did not intend to veto the text, the BBC reported. As one the council five permanent members of the council, the U.S. has veto power and has used it to sheltered Israel from condemnatory resolutions. But the Obama administration has long made clear its opposition to Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory, even though it gives Israel tens of billions annually in assistance. \u00a0\u201cThis last minute political maneuvering is shameful,\" said Ric Grenell, former spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. and a Fox News contributor. \"Today\u2019s abstention by the Obama administration will make it harder to find a peaceful solution because it imposes outside positions on Israel without letting them negotiate directly.\u201d Fox News' Eric Linton and Jonathan Wachtel contributed to this report.

    "text": "GOP on taxes: Cut rates, brackets but what about the deficit Published               December 24, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the nation's tax system next year, a heavy political lift that could ultimately affect families at every income level and businesses of every size. Their goal is to simplify a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants, and corporations that can easily shift profits -- and jobs -- overseas. It won't be easy. The last time it was done was 30 years ago. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have vowed to pass a tax package that would not add to the budget. The Washington term is \"revenue neutral.\" It means that for every tax cut there has to be a tax increase, creating winners and losers. Lawmakers would get some leeway if non-partisan congressional analysts project that a tax cut would increase economic growth, raising revenue without increasing taxes. Nevertheless, passing a massive tax package will require some tough votes, politically. Some key Republican senators want to share the political risk with Democrats. They argue that a tax overhaul must be bipartisan to be fully embraced by the public. They cite President Barack Obama's health law -- which passed in 2010 without any Republican votes -- as a major policy initiative that remains divisive. Congressional Democrats say they are eager to have a say in overhauling the tax code. But McConnell, who faulted Democrats for acting unilaterally on health care, is laying the groundwork to pass a purely partisan bill. McConnell and Ryan said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill. McConnell says he wants the Senate to tackle a tax plan in the spring, after Congress repeals Obama's health law. House Republicans are more eager to get started, but haven't set a timeline. Some things to know about Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code: THE HOUSE PLAN House Republicans have released the outline of a tax plan that would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The gist of the plan is to lower tax rates for just about everyone, and make up the lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits. The plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children. The standard deduction would be increased, giving taxpayers less incentive to itemize their deductions. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says the plan would reduce revenues by $3 trillion over the first decade, with most of the savings going to the highest-income households. That's not revenue neutral. Small business owners would get a special top tax rate of 25 percent. Investment income would be taxed like wages, but investors would only have to pay taxes on half of this income. SENATE PLAN Senate Republicans have yet to coalesce around a comprehensive plan, or even an outline. TRUMP'S PLAN Trump's plan has fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. The Tax Policy Center says Trump's plan would reduce revenues by a whopping $9.5 trillion over the first decade, with most of the tax benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers. Trump has disputed the analysis. Like the House plan, Trump would reduce the top income tax rate for individuals to 33 percent, and he would reduce the number of tax brackets to three. He would also increase the standard deduction. Trump has embraced two ideas championed by Obama but repeatedly rejected by Republicans over the past eight years. Trump's plan would cap itemized deductions for married couples making more than $200,000 a year. It would also tax carried interest, which are fees charged by investment fund managers, as regular income instead of capital gains. CORPORATE TAXES The top corporate income tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world. However, the tax is riddled with so many exemptions, deductions and credits that most corporations pay much less. Trump and House Republicans want to lower the rate, and pay for it by scaling back tax breaks. Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Ryan says 20 percent is more realistic, to avoid increasing the budget deficit. BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX This is one of the most controversial parts of the House Republicans' tax plan. It is also key to making it work. Under current law, the United States taxes the profits of U.S.-based companies, even if the money is made overseas. However, taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company either reinvests the profits in the U.S. or distributes them to shareholders. Critics say the system encourages U.S.-based corporations to invest profits overseas or, more dramatically, to shift operations and jobs abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. House Republicans want to scrap America's worldwide tax system and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm's products are consumed, rather than where they are produced. Under the system, American companies that produce and sell their products in the U.S. would pay the new 20 percent corporate tax rate on profits from these sales. However, if a company exports a product abroad, the profits from that sale would not be taxed by the U.S. There's more: Foreign companies that import goods to the U.S. would have to pay the tax, increasing the cost of imports. Exporters love the idea. But importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say it could lead to steep price increases on consumer goods. The lobbying has already begun.

Visitors to the Bolsa Chica Wetlands enjoy a chilly, blustery day beneath puffy clouds and a backdrop of the snow-covered San Gabriel Mountains. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Matt Stevens Contact Reporter A powerful storm brought record rainfall to parts of Southern California and closed Interstate 5 in the Grapevine for hours Saturday because of snow, officials said. The California Highway Patrol said the 5 was closed in both directions at Parker Road about 4:25 a.m. Around 8 a.m., officers began escorting traffic through the area, CHP Officer Peter Nicholson said. More than an hour later, they were continuing to escort vehicles northbound starting at Parker Road and southbound at Grapevine Road.\u00a0 Traffic was moving at about 25 mph through the 40-mile stretch, Nicholson said. The storm, the second of two systems that dumped rain in the drought -plagued region, left an inch or more of precipitation in some areas. Together, the fronts\u00a0helped make December the wettest in Los Angeles\u00a0in six years, with 4.08 inches of rain \u2014 265% above normal, according to the\u00a0 National Weather Service . New rain records for the day were set at Los Angeles International Airport \u00a0(0.96 inches), Long Beach Airport (1.07) and\u00a0Camarillo (1.6), among other places. Overall, the region got between 0.75 and 2.5 inches of rain, weather service\u00a0meteorologist\u00a0Curt Kaplan said. The storm \u201cleft its mark,\u201d\u00a0Kaplan said. \u201cWe had quite a punch.\u201d Southern California has experienced several years of record dry conditions, so the pair of storms has provided a welcome relief to many. Some experts think the storms are a precursor of wetter weather later in the winter.

After dropping a friend at LAX airport, Mike Che, from West Hollywood, stopped at Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area to take in the skyline of downtown Los Angeles, CA, following a winter storm, Christmas Eve morning. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) The overnight front moved in with force, flooding streets and causing some power outages. Mudslides closed the California Incline in Santa Monica and jammed traffic on Interstate 15 through the Cajon Pass. Firefighters rescued a man\u00a0in a floating device in the Los Angeles River near Glassell Park, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. Modest mudflows also were reported in some hillside communities hit by wildfires earlier this year, but no major damage was immediately reported. Kaplan said mud and debris came down hills in Duarte early Saturday, temporarily prompting a flash-flood warning. Nicholson said CHP officers responded to two mudslides. One occurred late Friday near Soledad Canyon and Capra roads in Santa Clarita; the other forced a closure near Sloan Canyon and Hasley Canyon roads in Castaic\u00a0\u2014 about five miles from where CHP officers were escorting traffic through the Grapevine on Saturday. One local news reporter tweeted that some motorists who bypassed the Grapevine traffic were instead getting stuck in the mud. The snow level fell to 3,000 feet, forcing the temporary closure of the Grapevine as well as traffic alerts on some mountain roads. In Kern County, Frasier Park and Pine Mountain Club got between 4 and 6 inches of snow, the NWS said.\u00a0Mountain High got as much as 16 inches, while Big Bear Mountain Resort received between 12 and 18 inches of fresh powder, its website said. Meanwhile, snow will continue to fall along the Grapevine periodically Saturday evening and overnight, Kaplan said. The most-recent storm moved south and east out of the area around 8 a.m. Saturday, bringing sunny skies with highs expected in the 60s. On Christmas Day, there will be partly cloudy skies with highs around 60 in L.A. Despite the storms, Southern California remains under severe drought conditions, even as Northern California begins to rebound. Steady rain since the beginning of October has pulled 30% of the state \u2014 almost all areas of Northern California \u2014 out of\u00a0 drought conditions , according to National Weather Service \u00a0and U.S. Drought Monitor\u00a0reports. The rains have helped revive reservoirs that feed the two massive systems that move water from the northern Sierra into cities and farmlands.

    "text": "Trump announces he will close controversial charitable foundation Trump in Florida Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla. (Associated Press) Tracy Wilkinson Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday announced he was dissolving his controversial foundation, which claimed to raise\u00a0money\u00a0for\u00a0charitable\u00a0causes but\u00a0has been accused of improperly using funds. Trump said he was shutting the foundation \u201cto avoid even the appearance of any conflict\u201d with his role as president. \u201cI have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,\u201d\u00a0Trump said in a statement released Saturday evening from his Florida home. The Donald J. Trump Foundation had been an important issue during the campaign, generating\u00a0questions about how it raised and distributed money. However, since Trump unexpectedly won the race,\u00a0his business holdings have created more\u00a0potential conflicts of interest and other controversies. Trump has still not explained to the public how he will disentangle his myriad business interests\u00a0from his duties as head of the U.S. government. Already, questions have arisen about his investments in Russia, India, the Middle East and Latin America, and his apparent willingness to discuss deals with foreign officials at the same time he is\u00a0preparing to take office. The charitable foundation, meanwhile, is under \u00a0investigation by the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which in October ordered the charity to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from fundraising because it was in violation of state law. The Washington Post reported this year that some of the funds raised by the charity were used to defend Trump\u2019s for-profit businesses against lawsuits. In\u00a0tax filings, Trump admitted he violated rules against \u201cself-dealing,\u201d using charitable contributions to benefit those controlling the charity. Trump reported to the IRS that he had given no money to his charity between 2009 and 2014 but that one of the biggest donors was\u00a0wrestling mogul\u00a0Linda McMahon, the Post reported.

    "text": "That longstanding principle has largely collapsed since the victory by Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a strategy of breaking all the rules and has continued to speak in unmodulated tones. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIn some ways, Trump is neutering the Obama administration,\u201d said Douglas G. Brinkley, a professor of history and a presidential historian at Rice University in Houston. \u201cThey\u2019ve avoided personally attacking each other, but behind the scenes, they\u2019re working to undermine each other, and I don\u2019t know how the American people benefit from that.\u201d For its part, the Obama administration on Tuesday announced a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling along wide areas of the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, invoking an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act , to claim that Mr. Trump had no power to reverse it. White House officials asserted a similar privilege in their decision not to veto the Security Council resolution. Israel\u2019s aggressive construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they said, puts at risk a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to the measure, and the likelihood that his administration will reverse the position, played no part in the decision, they said. \u201cThere\u2019s one president at a time,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. \u201cThere\u2019s a principle here that the world understands who is speaking for the United States until January 20th, and who is speaking for the United States after January 20th.\u201d In the last week, Mr. Trump has written on Twitter that the United States \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability\u201d; accused China of an \u201c unprecedented act \u201d in seizing a United States Navy underwater drone in the South China Sea; and then, after the Pentagon and the Chinese negotiated the drone\u2019s return, suggested that the United States should \u201c let them keep it! \u201d He condemned the deadly truck rampage at a Christmas market in Berlin as an \u201cattack on humanity,\u201d which he also said vindicated his proposed ban on immigration from countries plagued by Islamic extremism. On Friday, Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post that the suspect in the attack had made a religiously motivated threat. \u201cWhen will the U.S., and all countries, fight back?\u201d he wrote. Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements are often so vague and offhand that their long-term impact on policy is open to debate. But his intervention to press Egypt to delay the Security Council vote disrupted a sensitive diplomatic negotiation, and muddied perhaps Mr. Obama\u2019s final opportunity to make a statement on the stalled Middle East peace process. When Egypt buckled, the same resolution was brought to a vote by four other countries on the Security Council: Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela. The United States watched the proceedings largely from the sidelines. On Friday morning, Mr. Obama, from his vacation home in Hawaii, directed his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, to tell the ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, not to block the resolution. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIn a practical sense, the message this sends is that the Obama administration is over,\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to both Egypt and Israel. \u201cEverybody knows this resolution doesn\u2019t carry any weight. The assumption has to be that the Israeli government will take some retaliatory measures. Knowing that Trump is coming into office, and knowing that Trump tried to oppose this, they will do so with impunity.\u201d This role reversal between the departing and incoming presidents deepened what was already an unsettled moment in American foreign policy: a sense that the White House\u2019s policies toward the world\u2019s most troubled places had run out of steam and were about to change radically, but in ways that were wholly unpredictable. Mr. Trump has been careful to be respectful of his predecessor, and the president-elect\u2019s aides have said that the two men have spoken often. When people at his rallies jeer at the mention of Mr. Obama\u2019s name, Mr. Trump hushes them \u2014 a courtesy he does not extend to his former opponent, Hillary Clinton. But Mr. Trump has shown little patience for the traditions of the interregnum between presidents. \u201cPresident Obama and his team have been unbelievably gracious to the president-elect and his team, but at the end of the day, he\u2019s not someone that\u2019s going to sit back and wait,\u201d Sean Spicer, whom Mr. Trump named on Thursday as White House press secretary, said on CNN. Noting the close alliance between Israel and the United States, Mr. Spicer said, \u201cIt is something that we should protect, and he wanted to make it very clear that anything that undermined Israel, which is a great friend of the United States, he was going to make sure his voice was heard.\u201d It is not unprecedented for future presidents to dip into foreign affairs before taking office. During his transition in 1968, Richard M. Nixon dispatched two aides, Henry A. Kissinger and Robert Ellsworth, to meet with Soviet officials to pass along his views on a nonproliferation treaty and a summit meeting, an idea that was being pushed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Nixon later wrote that he \u201cdid not want to be boxed in by any decisions that were made\u201d before he took office. More often, though, incoming presidents have been hands-off. In December 1932, the departing president, Herbert Hoover, was deeply frustrated when Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had won a landslide victory a month earlier, declined to work with him on the issue of war debts owed to the United States by Britain and France. \u201cGovernor Roosevelt considers it undesirable for him to assent to my suggestions for cooperative action,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Eliot A. Cohen, a Republican foreign policy expert who worked in the George W. Bush administration and is a critic of Mr. Trump, said the president-elect was still communicating in the style of a political candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has a good sense of how every word that comes out of his mouth can have real consequences,\u201d he said. Whatever their frustrations about his interference, White House officials were careful not to criticize Mr. Trump after the Security Council vote. And in his Twitter message promising change at the United Nations, Mr. Trump pointedly did not criticize Mr. Obama or his administration. Still, Mr. Trump has shown no sign that he will surrender his Twitter account or curb his public statements in the next 28 days, which could lead to more mixed messages and tension with the White House. Experts have said Mr. Trump would do well to follow the example of his reticent predecessors. \u201cThis is not politesse,\u201d said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian. \u201cEven a president-elect who has been in public life for a long time has not been fully briefed or fully staffed, and hence may be in a position to do this better once he\u2019s in the White House.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d he said.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway stands beside President-elect Trump as he speaks to the crowd at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Ala. on Dec. 17, 2016. The stop is a part of Trump's 'Thank You Tour' rally. (Photo: Dan Anderson, European Pressphoto Agency) President-elect Donald Trump said he is shuttering his controversial charitable foundation, a subject of intense criticism over how it collects and dispenses money. \"The foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" Trump said in a statement issued Christmas Eve. \"However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as president, I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" Trump did not provide a timeline for when the foundation will close. He said he has asked his lawyer to take actions necessary to shut it down. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, heavily scrutinized during the 2016 presidential campaign, is under investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The probe was prompted in part by a series of reports in The Washington Post\u00a0outlining its dealings, including instances in which Trump apparently used charity money to settle lawsuits involving his for-profit businesses. The New York AG's office said the foundation cannot be dissolved until its probe is completed. Trump Foundation apparently admits to self-dealing in new tax filing Trump informed the Internal Revenue Service that he had given no money to the foundation from 2009 to 2014, according to the Post report. Donations came from other people, including World Wrestling Entertainment owners Vince and Linda McMahon, who contributed $5 million between 2007 and 2009. Linda McMahon was recently nominated by Trump to head the Small Business Administration. Trump is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. The foundation also admitted it violated a \u201cself-dealing\u201d prohibition that bars nonprofits from using charity funds for themselves, families or businesses, according to an IRS tax filing in 2015. A look at the $20K portrait of Trump paid for by his foundation The decision to dissolve the foundation comes amid concerns over how the billionaire president-elect and his family will avoid conflicts of interest after he is sworn in as the 45th president on Jan. 20, 2017. Trump's oldest son, Eric, this week said he was suspending his charitable foundation after questions arose about\u00a0donors potentially gaining\u00a0special access.

Recent tests have continued to show lead levels in Flint water are lower than federal requirements , according to state officials. Residents are advised to continue using filters \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Even with filters, many residents have expressed fear and concern about the safety of the water. As long as the current lead pipes remain in place, many people in the community won't feel safe to drink from the tap. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver started the FAST Start initiative to replace lead and galvanized steel pipes that lead from the street to individual homes earlier this year. As of this month, they have replaced lines at 625 homes, the mayor's office said in a statement, and their goal is to replace lines for about 1,000 homes in this phase. But, as many as 29,100 Flint residences have lead or galvanized steel water service lines that likely need replacement. Residents remain guarded about if and when enough work will be completed to make their home tap water safe again. \"I think we're just anxious for answers and for consistent answers and for resources so we can get the pipes fixed,\" Dotson told ABC News. \"To get back to a place of normalcy or at least have a time line of when that might occur.\" Jake May/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP Flint resident Tiesha Taylor and her daughters Mariah, 7, and Kaerya, 12, laugh aloud together at an event inside a Meijer store in Burton, Mich. on Dec. 6, 2016. Earlier this week, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette made clear that the investigation into the water crisis has not ended. He charged the four officials with multiple felonies, including conspiracy to commit false pretenses and false pretenses over their roles in the crisis. Each of those charges carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. \"Flint deserves better. The people of Flint are not expendable,\" he said in a press conference Tuesday announcing the charges. \"People in positions of responsibility, who broke the law, must be held responsible.\" Elevated lead levels were found in Flint's municipal water supply when it was drawing water from the Flint River in April 2014, after disconnecting from Detroit's municipal water system. The move was intended as a stopgap measure until the completion of a pipeline to Lake Huron as the source for Flint's municipal water. Lead from Flint's old pipes was leaching into the water because of improper treatment of the water from the Flint River, which had a different mix of elements that were more corrosive. Though the city switched back to the Detroit water supply in October 2015, residents are advised to keep using filters out of an abundance of caution and officials are continuing to monitor lead levels at multiple sites in the system. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declared a state of emergency on Dec. 14, 2015 and extended it indefinitely last month. A CDC study published in July of this year found that after the water switch was made, children under the age of 6 were 46 percent more likely to have elevated lead levels in their blood than before.

Many people still plan their lives around finding clean water, Nayyirah Shariff, a resident of Flint and director community coalition Flint Rising said. She uses filtered tap water to clean her dishes, but only bottled water to clean and cook food. Shariff is wary of using the standard tap water filters since common mistakes and using hot water can greatly diminish their effectiveness. \"You have the capability to inject human error,\" Shariff said, explaining some people didn\u2019t know they were supposed to change the filter once a month and it\u2019s easy not to realize when a friend or child has run hot water through the filter. \"You're basically playing Russian roulette,\" she said. Like many other people, Shariff said she also picks up packs of bottled water from state-run centers on her weekend time. She has changed the meals she cooks, giving up pasta for other items that use less water. Without reliable, clean tap water she doesn't can in-season fruits as a hobby anymore. Callaghan OHare/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP Kylan Pouncil, 10 months, is passed to Santa Claus as members of the community gather for a tree lighting on Dec. 2, 2016 in Flint, Mich. Another common fear is bathing or showering with hot water. Cases of the bacterial infection Legionella increased during the water crisis. The bacteria can cause serious or even deadly infections if breathed in through hot steam. \"When I go out of town, I\u2019m very happy to take a hot shower or a bath,\" said Shariff, who said she hasn\u2019t taken a hot shower in her own home in three years. Community groups working with Flint Rising advocate the complete replacement of the city's water pipes, for unpaid water bills to be forgiven, for residents to receive a refund for the months when the water was not drinkable and for health and education services to be provided to the affected community. \"In my opinion, I\u2019m happy it got international attention,\" Shariff said about the Flint water crisis. But since time has passed, \"People erroneously make the assumption that things are fixed.\" Government leaders from the state of Michigan and the city of Flint, as well as community organizations have taken steps to protect the community. Currently 13 people have been charged the state attorney general over their role in the water crisis. After the water was deemed dangerous in 2015, the city tapped into the Detroit water supply. It will be switched to Lake Huron water when the pipeline is completed. The water treatment plant now uses anti-corrosive chemicals to help diminish the chance that lead will end up in the water. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver started the FAST Start initiative to replace lead and galvanized steel pipes that lead from the street to individual homes earlier this year. A Pediatric Public Health Initiative was created in January to help give kids exposed to lead access to medical and nutritional help. Among the projects, families with children can receive waivers to pick up healthy food at local markets. Flint residents can also apply for credit for discounted water bills through the Water Credit Refund program. Congress approved a bill to authorize water projects across the country, which includes provision to give $170 million to Flint, according to the Associated Press. Marc Edwards, professor of civil engineering at Virginia Tech and head of the team that first sounded the alarm of lead levels in Flint, said he has been heartened by progress. But, much more is needed. Overall, water quality has improved tremendously, but the stubborn problem is the remaining old pipes. Edwards said health officials may never really be able to give the all clear while the chemically dangerous infrastructure is still in use. \"Basically we're not going to fool ourselves anymore,\" he said. \"Drinking water through a 30 foot long lead straw?\" Edwards said. \"It\u2019s a hazardous activity.\" But the city must remain vigilant. Small pieces of rust or particles can end up in the water even if it is well treated, he explained. As a result, a single site can test for safe water \"10 or 20 or 30 times\" and test positive for a high level of lead later. \"It's the same dose as if your kid ate eight or 10 paint chips,\" Edwards explained. \"The one unlucky glass of water to cause health harm.\" Filters have worked very well in their experiments and often last longer than their expiration dates, he said. The legacy of Flint may be drawing attention to how much harm decaying and outdated infrastructure can cause -- and how water safety laws need to be better enforced. \"We have laws,\" Edwards said. \"If the laws were followed none of this would have happened.\" Doctors are also hopeful that the attention surrounding Flint will ultimately help other communities, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician whose research showed children in Flint with elevated lead levels, told ABC News. \"It led to recognition that lead in water is problem in other communities,\" Hanna-Attisha said in an interview last month. \"I want to prevent future Flints and [protect] future children from being exposed.\" An initiative to diagnose and help children who have developmental delays after lead exposure is in progress. Hanna-Attisha along with others at the Hurley Medical Center are working with Michigan State University and the Genesee County Health Department as part of the Pediatric Public Health Initiative, which started in January. Though Hanna-Attisha is excited about the progress the program has made in getting children access to healthier foods and other medical attention, she acknowledged residents remain traumatized and angry about the situation and the danger to their children. \"This trauma is so raw,\" Hanna-Attisha said. \"The people in Flint just want to be regular normal people.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP December 24, 2016, 3:42 PM Israel's Netanyahu lashes out at Obama over UN vote Email JERUSALEM -- Israel\u2019s Prime Minister has lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama, accusing him of a \u201cshameful\u201d move at the United Nations over West Bank settlements. Benjamin Netanyahu said he is looking forward to working with his \u201cfriend\u201d President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0 On Friday, the U.S. allowed the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory. ... Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel rejects the \u201cdelusional\u201d U.N. resolution which demanded an end to Israeli settlement building. It got the green light after the U.S., Israel\u2019s closest ally, abstained from voting. It was a jarring break from U.S. practice. Though opposed to the settlements, it has traditionally used its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council to block such resolutions. \u201cThe Obama Administration conducted a shameful anti-Israel ambush at the U.N,\u201d Netanyahu said. He also said he spoke with U.S. leaders who vowed to fight the move.\u00a0 U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power has defended the U.S. abstention. She warned on Friday that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan reported. \u201cThe United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades,\u201d Power said. Power also said, \u201cWe would not have let this resolution pass if it hadn\u2019t addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians,\u201d and added that the vote \u201cdoes not in any way diminish the United States\u2019 steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.\u201d \u00a0 Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon argued on Friday it will make a peace deal harder. He also looked ahead to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI have no doubt that the new US administration will usher in a new era,\u201d Danon tweeted . The U.S. decision to abstain on the 14-0 vote followed months of intensely secret deliberations in Washington, a spate of fresh Israeli settlement announcements that sparked exasperation and anger from American officials, and recent attempts by Israel\u2019s government to have parliament legalize thousands of homes built on privately owned Palestinian land. \u00a0 After Egypt suddenly postponed a scheduled vote on the resolution Thursday,\u00a0 eportedly under pressure from Israel and supporters of Mr. Trump , four new sponsors stepped up and pushed it through - Malaysia, New Zealand, Venezuela and Senegal, each representing a different region and reflecting the wide support for the measure. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 On the second day of 2016, Otto Warmbier was minutes away from boarding a plane back to America when armed security officers reportedly dragged him\u00a0out of Pyongyang airport and into a yearlong nightmare that has left his loved ones and even the U.S. government powerless to save him. Like most news out of North Korea, a lot about what occurred in the airport on Jan. 2, 2016 remains a mystery. One witness remembered a commotion as an armed official yelled at the 21-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate student from Ohio and had him hauled out of the terminal. Hours later, the rogue dictatorship issued a vague update: A tourist had been \u201ccaught committing a hostile act against the state.\u201d The legal proceedings that followed were just as vague. Prosecutors charged that Warmbier was caught stealing a political sign and committed \u201ccrimes against the state.\u201d He was given a one-hour trial in March at which the government presented fingerprints, CCTV footage and pictures of a political banner to make its case against the American. \u201cI beg that you see how I am only human,\u201d Warmbier begged at trial. \u201cAnd how I have made the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d Despite his pleas, Warmbier\u00a0was convicted , and sentenced to 15 years' hard labor. In a post-trial video released to the world, Warmbier, under obvious duress,\u00a0praised his captors for his treatment and for handling of the case \u201cfair and square.\" Little is known about Warmbier's fate over the last year, and critics say the Obama administration has not done enough to bring the American home. In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been held on trumped-up charges for varying periods of time by the current regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as that of his father, Kim Jong Il. Their release has typically been won by pledges of aid or diplomatic gestures from American dignitaries. Former President Bill Clinton journeyed to the Hermit Kingdom in 2009 in a successful bid to convince the late Kim Jong Il to release of Current TV journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling , who had been captured after straying across the border from China and held prisoner for five months. The younger Kim is less predictable, and the U.S. has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. Kim Jung Un, the third generation of his family to lead the impoverished and belligerent nation, routinely issues threats against the U.S., \u00a0launches missiles to provoke South Korea and Japan, e xecutes top military officials and, occasionally, seizes Western prisoners. Although they are subjected to what passes for judicial procedures, they are for all intents and purposes, hostages. In addition to Warmbier, it is believed that Pyongyang is holding Kim Dong-chul, 62, a naturalized U.S. citizen and a Canadian. Like Warmbier, he was charged with spying. Gordon Chang, an expert on Asia and author of \u201cThe Coming Collapse of China,\u201d said autocratic regimes, like the one in Pyongyang, are famous for their insecurities and treat any slight against its government as an especially serious offense. An Irish national who visited the country told The Independent that he was told \u201cconstantly that the smallest thing was considered a hostile attack. \"I bought lots of magazines and books there, and we were told not to fold them in a way that creased Kim Jong-un\u2019s face,\u201d he recalled. Chang believes the North Koreans are taking reasonably good care of Warmbier, but the student likely feels forgotten. \u201cI assume he feels isolated,\u201d Chang said. \u201cHe\u2019s likely only reading propaganda and feels abandoned by the outside world.\u201d Warmbier's family, including his father, Fred, did not respond to requests for comment, perhaps out of concern that publicity could anger Warmbier's captors or upset back-channel efforts by the State Department or private parties to win his release.\u00a0The U.S. will often tell these families to avoid talking to the media so it can better control the situation, Chang said. \u201cI agree with that,\u201d he said. Yet, media attention in the past seemed to work favorably in some cases. Ling and Lee faced 12 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts, yet were freed after five months when a visit from Clinton seemed to provide the rogue regime with the diplomatic legitimacy it craved, at least under the elder Kim, who died in 2011. Kenneth Bae, a 47-year-old missionary who spent 19 months in prison for evangelizing, was released in 2014 after former NBA star and self-professed pal of Kim Jong-un Dennis Rodman took up his cause.\u00a0Bae, who worked on a soybean farm and lost 30 pounds during the ordeal, told The New York Times that his interrogators would tell him that nobody in the U.S. cared about him and there were no negotiations. Friend Trey Lonneman: We need to get Otto #Warmbier back. We must keep him in the public eye as much as we can \u2013TCT #Tucker @FoxNews \u2014 Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) December 20, 2016 He said he was questioned \u201cfrom 8 in the morning until 10 or 11 o\u2019clock at night, every day for four weeks,\" yet his treatment was better than that of North Korean felons. Bae told FoxNews.com\u00a0that he prays daily for American prisoners\u2019 release from North Korea.\u00a0 Former U.S. ambassador to the UN and ex-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, founder of the nonprofit Richardson Center for Global Engagement , told Fox News that the progress in getting Warmbier back has been slow but said North Koreans accepted a delegation from his foundation in September. He said the White House has been supportive of his group's efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this on a humanitarian basis,\u201d Richardson told Fox News, \u201cnot a government-to-government basis.\u201d Communicating with North Korea has long been more challenging under the younger Kim. \u201cThere\u2019s just silence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing coming back.\u201d Julia Mason, a State Department spokeswoman, told FoxNews.com a statement that the administration is aware of the situation, and \u201cnow that Mr. Warmbier has gone through this criminal process, we urge the DPRK to pardon him and grant him special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds.\u201d In November, the Associated Press reported that a North Korean Foreign Ministry official met with the Swedish ambassador to talk about access to Canadian Christian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim, who was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor, according to Pyongyang\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency. The Swedish ambassador used the meeting to also talk about the Americans and was reportedly told Pyongyang treats them as war prisoners, possibly in light of U.S. sanctions on the country. John Bolton, a Fox News contributor and the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson that North Korea keeps a close eye on U.S. relationships around the world. It likely made note of the Obama administrations clandestine payments to Iran earlier this year which coincided with the release of four Americans held by Tehran on bogus charges. \u201cWhen Obama pays $1.7 billion in ransom for four people being held hostage in Iran, obviously the North Koreans see this as a bargaining chip as well,\u201d he said.

USA TODAY Carrie Fisher in October. (Photo: Andy Kropa, Invision/AP) Carrie Fisher is being treated in an intensive care unit after a serious medical emergency on a flight, according to her brother. On Friday night, Todd Fisher told The Associated Press that his sister was receiving excellent care, but said that he could not classify her condition. He had earlier told the AP that she had been stabilized and was out of the emergency room. In a subsequent interview,\u00a0he said many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency are unknown, and much of what had been reported was speculation. \"We have to wait and be patient,\" he said. \"We have so little information ourselves.\" TMZ and the\u00a0 Los Angeles Times \u00a0reported that the actress, best known for playing Princess Leia in the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0film franchise, was on a flight from London to Los Angeles when she went into cardiac arrest.

Associated Press Peace activist Arno Michaelis, left, speaks with Chris Buckley, the Grand Knighthawk for the North Georgia White Knights, on A&E's documentary series 'Escaping the KKK.' Peace activist Arno Michaelis, left, speaks with Chris Buckley, the Grand Knighthawk for the North Georgia White Knights, on A&E's documentary series 'Escaping the KKK.' (Associated Press) Steven Zeitchik Contact Reporter \u00a0The A&E network has announced that it is pulling a reality show about the Ku Klux Klan, which was set to air next month, after executives discovered that outside producers for the series paid members of the group for their participation.\u00a0 The network said that \u201cEscaping the KKK,\u201d a series about people who want to leave the group \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0which has elicited a fierce backlash \u2014 will be shelved. \u201cA&E learned last night from the third-party producers who made the documentary that cash payments \u2014\u00a0which we currently understand to be nominal \u2014\u00a0were made in the field to some participants in order to facilitate access,\u201d the network said in a statement Saturday. \u201cWhile we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of A&E\u2019s policies and practices for a documentary.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe had previously provided assurances to the public and to our core partners \u2014\u00a0including the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change \u2014\u00a0that no payment was made to hate group members, and we believed that to be the case at the time.\u00a0We have now decided not to move forward with airing this project.\u201d Paying reality subjects has become common practice in unscripted television. But the recipients of these payments distinguish this situation from nearly every other previous series. It takes on an added charge in the wake of white-supremacist groups hailing the election of President-elect Donald Trump .\u00a0(Trump has disavowed the support of these groups.) The eight-part series created a stir when it was announced earlier this week as \u201cGeneration KKK\u201d with a Jan. 10 air date \u2014 a controversy A&E sought to quell by releasing a  trailer Friday\u00a0that attempted\u00a0to more fully explain the show\u2019s premise.\u00a0\u00a0 The series was being produced by the production company This is Just a Test and its co-founders\u00a0Aengus James\u00a0and\u00a0Colin King Miller, who executive produced with Cynthia Childs and Paul Lima. James is\u00a0a documentary filmmaker and reality-show producer who had previously made the nonfiction series \u201cIce Lake Rebels\u201d and directed the doc \u201cAmerican Harmony,\u201d about barbershop singing groups; he had also collaborated with Barry Levinson as a cinematographer. James did not respond to a text or voicemail message seeking comment Saturday. A&E executive vice president and general manager Robert Sharenow and A&E spokesman Dan Silberman declined to comment for this story. From the moment it was announced, civil rights groups and public figures slammed \u201cGeneration KKK,\u201d saying it would normalize the hate group. A Change.org petition was launched, and stars such as  Ellen Pompeo of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spoke out volubly\u00a0against the A&E move on Twitter, questioning why the network gave a \u201cplatform\u201d to hate groups. A&E quickly sought to position the show as a documentary along the lines of its hit series on addiction, \u201cIntervention,\u201d\u00a0hoping people would view it more as a look at the evils of hate groups than a reality-television exploitation of them. The network noted its participation with the ADL and, more recently, the civil rights group Color of Change. It also changed the title to \u201cEscaping the KKK: A Documentary Series Exposing Hate in America.\u201d The trailer, looking to underscore the series\u2019\u00a0ambitions, opened with the on-screen lines:\u00a0\u201cIn the KKK hatred is passed down as legacy. It must stop\u2026. This series is about a group of activists working to expose hatred and end it.\u201d\u00a0In a statement Friday, the network also said that the show\u2019s name was changed so \u201cno one can mistake its intent.\u201d \u201cEscaping the KKK\u201d quietly began production about 18 months ago, when the 2016 presidential election had a very different shape. In one early episode, a member of the KKK is shown to be leaving the group. In a later episode,\u00a0that person then convinces a more senior member of the Klan to do the same.\u00a0The series also centered on relatives of KKK members uncomfortable with the choices of their loved ones.

The plan may quickly run into a snag, however. \"The Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\" New York Attorney General spokesperson Amy Spitalnick said in a statement released Saturday. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office ordered the Donald J. Trump Foundation to \"immediately cease soliciting contributions\" in October , after a report that the charity lacked the proper authorization to seek public donations. Trump has not donated to the foundation since 2008 but it has received tens of millions of dollars over the past 10 years. \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" Trump said in a statement. \"However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" The statement did not clarify the means in which he planned to continue his charitable interests. Trump's foundation came under scrutiny during the election over how its funds were used, with money going toward settling legal disputes among Trump's business empire. Some charity experts consider this act unethical and it could violate federal tax law . A Trump campaign spokesman has called the New York investigation \"partisan.\" Schneiderman is a Democrat and endorsed Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Related: What We Know About the Trump Foundation Controversies Trump appeared to dispute any conflicts or misuse of funds in his statement Saturday. \"I am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need, and I am also very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity, but because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don't want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,\" Trump said. However, documents first reported by the Washington Post and later reviewed by NBC News showed that Trump had used $258,000 to settle two separate lawsuits . One such lawsuit was with the town of Palm Beach over the height of Trump's Mar-a-Lago flagpole. The Post also reported that the foundation had purchased a $20,000 six-foot portrait of Trump, which may also violate federal tax law. The foundation became embroiled in an additional controversy and was fined by the IRS for donating $25,000 to a political organization connected to Florida's attorney general, Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general is now a member of Trump's transition, but at the time her office was considering investigating Trump University for fraud, which raised another instance for the president-elect about a potential conflict of interest. Bondi's office did not open an investigation. A Bondi spokeswoman has said due diligence was done in the case and similar litigation in New York would provide relief to consumers nationwide. Trump has denied that the donation had anything to do with Bondi's office mulling an investigation, and a spokesperson called it a \"minor issue.\" The IRS fine was levied after an ethics group complained that the donation had not been disclosed to tax officials. Since their father won the election, his children have tried to raise money for their own foundation by putting their name and access up for sale. Play ",

The network said Saturday it was dropping \"Escaping the KKK: A Documentary Series Exposing Hate in America\" a day after discovering that \"nominal\" cash payments were given by third-party producers. \"While we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of A&E's policies and practices for a documentary,\" the network said in statement. \"Escaping the KKK\" was to follow people trying to extract themselves from the racist and anti-Semitic hate group. The network had promised that no payments would be made. In this undated photo provided by This Is Just A Test (TIJAT) Media and the A&amp;E Network, peace activist Arno Michaelis, left, speaks with Chris Buckley, the Grand Knighthawk for the North Georgia White Knights, on A&amp;E's documentary series \"Generation KKK.\" The series, renamed \"Escaping the KKK,\" was canceled after the network said it learned cash payments were made by a third party. TIJAT / A&amp;E via AP \"We had previously provided assurances to the public and to our core partners \u2014 including the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change \u2014 that no payment was made to hate group members, and we believed that to be the case at the time,\" the network said. \"We have now decided not to move forward with airing this project.\" The project triggered wide criticism as soon as it was announced earlier this month. The network, which originally titled the series \"Generation KKK,\" changed the name and enlisted civil rights groups to collaborate on in-show educational content after getting heat for allowing the KKK's hate speech to be aired. In the opening scene of a trailer for the now-scrapped series, the Imperial Wizard of the North Mississippi White Knights is shown giving his young children red Klansman hoods and said he hopes his daughter becomes the first woman Imperial Wizard. \"Our goal with this series has always been to expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms,\" A&E said. \"A&E takes the authenticity of its documentary programming and the subject of racism, hatred and violence very seriously.\" We have a statement on the show \"Escaping The KKK.\" Please read it here: https://t.co/fl6h7xmSfv \u2014 A&E Network (@AETV) December 24, 2016 While U.S. newspapers, magazines and television news divisions do not generally pay subjects for their interviews, some documentary filmmakers do, though the practice is frowned upon. Errol Morris, the Oscar-winning filmmaker, triggered a debate over the issue in 2008 when he acknowledged that during the making of his film \"Standard Operating Procedure,\" soldiers who were convicted of tormenting inmates at Abu Ghraib in Iraq were paid for their time.

    "text": "advertisement For president-elect Donald Trump, \"Happy Holidays\" is apparently nothing more than politically correct nonsense. For many conservatives, the phrase is just another example of the \"war on Christmas\" perpetrated by liberals. Trump's attitude may be a welcome change for the evangelicals who helped him win the GOP primary and capture the White House. Trump won 81 percent of evangelicals, according to exit polls \u2014 more than Romney in 2012 or even Bush in 2004. \"You go into a department store,\" Trump said at Liberty University in January . \"When was the last time you saw 'Merry Christmas'? You don't see it anymore. They want to be politically correct.\" An analysis of four years of Twitter data \u2014 more than 400 million tweets \u2014 by NBC News with linguistic and geography researchers from the University of South Carolina and Aston University found usage of \"Merry Christmas\" still common, especially in areas that were key to Trump's primary and general election wins. The below map shows rural areas in the South and Rust Belt still say \"Merry Christmas\" much more than \"Happy Holidays\" on Twitter. In many cities won by Democrats, \"Happy Holidays\" is said more frequently, though it is still generally said less than \"Merry Christmas.\" On average, 86 percent of holiday greeting tweets said \"Merry Christmas.\" So why does Trump continue to claim \"Merry Christmas\" is waning in popularity? While Twitter is not a perfect sample \u2014 only about 21 percent of adults use it and it skews younger and more urban, according to The Pew Research Center \u2014 it is considered one of the best ways to understand language use in real-time . One simple reason Trump champions \"Merry Christmas\" is because it appeals to key parts of his base. The greeting is very popular among Bible Belt evangelicals , who, as shown in the below maps, tend to live in the states that formed Trump's core support in the primaries. The term's use is also contested in these areas. Many evangelicals in the South live in areas with high religiosity but where there are racial and cultural divisions over which term to use. African-Americans in these areas prefer \"Happy Holidays\" and evangelical whites prefer \"Merry Christmas,\" according to past polling , so while \"Merry Christmas\" is very popular in these communities among the majority populations, underlying that are diverse demographics with conflicting opinions. Trump struggled with and needed to make inroads with evangelicals , who may have appreciated his support for the greeting. Eventually, he did , faring well with the group in the election. \"Merry Christmas\" is also popular in areas where white voters came through decisively for Trump in the general election \u2014 Western Pennsylvania, most of Ohio and Appalachia, as well as rural North Carolina. Although people in these places attend religious services less frequently, they say \"Merry Christmas\" a lot more and are in areas more likely to support businesses saying \"Merry Christmas\" instead of adopting \"Happy Holidays.\" Voters in these areas are credited with having put Trump over the top in the general election . Although the map below depicting areas of higher religiosity correlates well with \"Merry Christmas\" usage on Twitter, it should be interpreted with caution. The country's more religious states as a whole support saying \"Merry Christmas\" \u2014 but many are also religiously diverse or home to diverse urban centers that say \"Happy Holidays\" more often. And these areas may have communities experiencing ethnic or cultural tension , one of the major themes of the 2016 campaign covered by NBC News . That conflict is at the heart of why the term takes on extra meaning among some groups, like evangelicals. Polling and the geographic Twitter analysis also support the notion there is more upside than downside for Trump in taking a hard stance on the phrase. A Public Policy Polling poll taken in early December found that Republicans strongly support saying \"Merry Christmas\" by a 65 percent margin. Sixty-three percent of Democrats, on the other hand, say it \"doesn't make a difference\" either way which term is used, and nationally only 4 percent of respondents say they are offended by the phrase. Independents were more likely to agree with Republicans that stores or businesses should not change their greeting to \"Happy Holidays\" from \"Merry Christmas.\" Geographically, \"Happy Holidays\" is found more often in urban areas with higher minority populations won handily by Clinton. As the map below shows, Clinton tended to win the coasts and the cities , areas where \"Merry Christmas\" usage is less popular. Methodology Twitter data is provided by Diansheng Guo and Yuan Huang (University of South Carolina), Jack Grieve (Aston University) of Spatialdatamining.org . An original corpus of November and December tweets taken from 2012 to 2015 was used to identify roughly 900,000 unique user Tweets containing variants on \"Merry Christmas\" or \"Happy Holidays.\" Low-levels of spatial smoothing were applied to account for areas with lower numbers of tweets. Tweets from Spatialdatamining.org project has been used for past projects, like \"The Great American Word Mapper,\" which have opened-sourced large datasets for those looking to do further analysis.

Tributes and well-wishes continued to pour in for the \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress on Saturday, as she spent Christmas Eve in a Los Angeles hospital. \u201cPrincess Leia can survive anything!\u201d one fan wrote on Twitter. \u201cHold on, Carrie Fisher. We\u2019re taking you into 2017 with us,\u201d wrote another.\u00a0 Her \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-star Harrison Ford said, \u201cI\u2019m shocked and saddened to hear the news about my dear friend. Our thoughts are with Carrie, her family and friends.\u201d Another co-star, Mark Hamill, said he was \u201csending all our love.\u201d\u00a0 as if 2016 couldn't get any worse... sending all our love to @carrieffisher \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 23, 2016 Todd Fisher, the actress\u2019 brother, said Friday night that his sister was receiving excellent care, but that he could not classify her condition. He had earlier told The Associated Press that she had been stabilized and was out of the emergency room. In a subsequent interview he said many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency are unknown.\u00a0 Fans on Twitter hoped she would pull through. One wrote: \u201cCarrie Fisher survived alcoholism, addiction, depression, bipolar disorder & 60 years in Hollywood. If anyone can survive 2016, it\u2019s her.\u201d\u00a0 Carrie Fisher survived alcoholism, addiction, depression, bipolar disorder & 60 years in Hollywood. If anyone can survive 2016, it's her. \u2014 Ryan Sloane (@RyanFSloane) December 23, 2016 The actress\u2019 former co-star Peter Mayhew, who played \u201cStar Wars\u201d character Chewbacca, called her \u201ceveryone\u2019s favorite princess right now.\u201d\u00a0 A law enforcement official told CBS News Fisher went into cardiac arrest. Celebrity website TMZ, which first reported the incident, said anonymous sources told them the actress suffered a heart attack. She was treated by paramedics immediately after the plane she was taking from London landed in Los Angeles, according to reports citing unnamed sources.\u00a0 Todd Fisher said much of what had been reported about the incident was speculation.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to wait and be patient,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so little information ourselves.\u201d Fisher\u2019s publicists and representatives for her mother, Debbie Reynolds, and her daughter, Billie Lourd, did not return calls from the AP. Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott said paramedics administered advanced life-saving care to a patient at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday and transported the person to a nearby hospital. He did not identify the patient. A large gathering of media personnel was camped outside Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles hospital, where TMZ and the Los Angeles Times reported she had been taken.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., shown in a 2015 file photo from Orlando, said Dec. 23, 2016, that he will work to pull congressional funding for the United Nations if its Security Council does not repeal a resolution condemning Israeli settlements as illegal. (Photo: John Raoux, AP) Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Saturday that he will\u00a0propose a bill\u00a0in Congress to pull U.S. funding for the United Nations unless the U.N. Security Council repeals its\u00a0just-passed resolution\u00a0condemning Israeli settlements as illegal. The resolution, a major rebuke to Israel, passed Friday in a\u00a014-0 vote. The U.S., which has vetoed similar resolutions in the past, abstained, allowing it to\u00a0be adopted. The measure demands Israel \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\" It declares that the establishment of settlements by Israel has \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.\" The Republican senator from South Carolina told CNN on Saturday that he had been\u00a0planning to work\u00a0with the U.N. to create a Marshall Plan to support countries emerging from conflict\u00a0but won't do it unless the council overturns the resolution. \"I am a huge supporter of foreign aid and the U.N.,\" he said. \"I want to do more, not less. But I can't support funding a body that singles out the only democracy in the Middle East who shares our values.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the measure as \"shameful\" and said Israel will\u00a0not abide by its terms. Graham told CNN that trying to defund the U.N. is a new approach. \"This is a road we haven't gone down before,\" said Graham, a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee. \"If you can't show the American people that international organizations can be more responsible, there is going to be a break. And I am going to lead that break.\" In a statement \u00a0Friday\u00a0following the vote, Graham said\u00a0President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry went from \"na\u00efve and foolish to flat-out reckless\" in allowing the resolution to be adopted. White House officials said the administration's decision not to veto was\u00a0consistent with long-standing U.S. opposition\u00a0to Israeli settlements, calling them an incitement to violence and an impediment to peace. The resolution \"makes clear that both Israel and the Palestinians have to take steps to preserve the two-state solution,\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. Rhodes said the U.S. had nothing to do with the U.N. resolution, and that the Obama administration has been warning Israel for years that settlements were increasing its international \"isolation.\" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, in remarks to the council after the vote, said the U.S. position on the settlements has remained unchanged for five decades. She quoted a 1982 statement by then-president Ronald Reagan, which declared Washington \u201cwill not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements.\u201d \"The U.S. has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for five decades,\" Power said. She said settlement activity \"harms the viability of a negotiated two-state outcome and erodes prospects for peace and stability in the region.\u201d Under international law, Israeli settlements \u2014 built on Palestinian land occupied by Israel \u2014 are considered\u00a0illegal. Some 600,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank, which the Palestinians seek as part of a future independent state. Israel captured both areas in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel argues that the final status of the territories should be determined in any future talks on Palestinian statehood. Graham, in his statement,\u00a0said the U.S.\u00a0diplomatic move amounted to abandoning Israel and that\u00a0he expects it will \"create a backlash\" against the U.N. in Congress. \"The organization is increasingly viewed as anti-Semitic and seems to have lost all sense of proportionality,\" he said. The senator told CNN\u00a0he discussed the resolution before the vote with Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the incoming\u00a0U.N. secretary-general, and also lobbied members of the Security Council not to support it. In addition, he\u00a0raised the issue with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations. Trump, in an unprecedented move for a president-in-waiting, tried to block the vote by persuading Egypt, the initial sponsor of the measure, to withdraw it Thursday. The following day, however, other co-sponsors of the measure brought it up for a vote. Afterward, Trump \u2014 who takes office in four weeks \u2014 tweeted:\u00a0\"Things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" 245 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 131 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2irABNm NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "UN Security Council Votes to End Israeli Settlements as US Abstains By Meghan Keneally Dec 23, 2016, 3:25 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH UN Security Council Votes to End Israeli Settlements After Trump Called for Veto 0 Shares Email The United Nations Security Council has passed a previously postponed vote to end Israeli settlements after the U.S. abstained from voting. U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power gave a statement after the vote saying that the U.S. chose not to vote on the resolution \"because the resolution is too narrowly focused on settlements.\" She began her statement in the Security Council with the words of Ronald Reagan in 1985 that settlements are \u201cin no way necessary for the security of Israel\u201d and \u201conly diminishes the confidence of Arabs.\u201d Justin Lane/EPA The U.N. Security Council votes to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction, Dec. 23, 2016, as Samantha Power, center at top, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, abstains. The Obama administration vetoed a very similar resolution in 2011, but Power today said the circumstances have changed dramatically because the growth of settlements has accelerated and efforts to pursue peace have failed. The controversial vote occurred a day after President-elect Donald Trump called for the resolution in question to be vetoed and after he had a call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. Egypt had previously sponsored the resolution but are no longer one of the sponsors. The meeting was listed on the revised Security Council schedule as being about \"the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.\" Trump Weighs In on Israeli Settlements While White House Stays Mum Israel is against the resolution. Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N., made it clear before the vote took place that he did not want it to pass. \u201cThis resolution is a Palestinian initiative which is intended to harm Israel,\u201d Danon, who has in the past supported groups raising money for settlements, said in a statement after the announcement was made that the vote was back on. \u201cWe call on the United States to stand by us and we expect our greatest ally to continue with its long-standing policy and to veto this resolution,\" Danon said in the statement. For his part, Trump has made it clear that he thinks it should be vetoed. \"As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations. This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis,\" Trump said in a statement on Thursday. His call to El Sisi also touched on the subject. \"They agreed on the need to allow the new U.S. administration to deal in a comprehensive manner with all aspects of the Palestinian issue so as to achieve a comprehensive and final settlement for this issue,\" El Sisi's office said in a statement about the call. Trump sent a new tweet shortly after the resolution passed, saying \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J.

Iraqis attend Christmas Mass at the Mar Shimoni church in Bartella, a predominantly Christian town recently recaptured from Islamic State. (Chris McGrath / Getty Images) Ten white buses sped west from the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on Saturday morning, packed with\u00a0displaced\u00a0Assyrians\u00a0intent on spending\u00a0Christmas Eve in their mostly Christian hamlet, recaptured in October from Islamic State .\u00a0 \u201cI miss my church and my town,\u201d said one of the drivers, Ibrahim Behnam, 50. When they arrived for an 11 a.m. Mass at the Mar Shimoni church, they found a Christmas tree at the entrance, flanked by armed guards. Snipers perched on the roof. Two days earlier, suicide bombers had attacked a busy market just a few miles west, killing 23 people.\u00a0But that didn\u2019t stop several hundred of the faithful\u00a0from making a pilgrimage home. \u201cI know all of them,\u201d said Father Yacoub Saad Shamas, noting that the church once served 2,000 families. The priest darted across the church courtyard in his black cassock, welcoming worshipers as gray skies threatened rain. I am happy, but with a broken heart. \u2014 Samira Aziz, former resident of Bartella. An elderly woman kissed his hand. Iraqi military commanders greeted him warmly, as did U.S. Army Lt. Col. Ed Matthaidess III, who brought a dozen members of the 101st Airborne Division. The Americans sat at the back of the sanctuary with an interpreter. As the church filled, women slipped on lacy black mantillas and filed up into the balcony, past singed walls still spray-painted with warnings of bombs, since removed. Windows and crosses were broken, but the crystal chandelier was unharmed, reflecting the glow of the altar as they prayed in Assyrian and Arabic. \u201cGod protect us and clean us from the inside,\u201d the priest intoned. \u201cYou are the almighty God, our God forever.\u201d It was Samira Aziz\u2019s first visit since Bartella was freed.\u00a0The 50-year-old maid thought of her mother, who had always wanted to be buried here next to her son, a soldier killed years ago in the Iran-Iraq war. She died last year, after the family fled east to the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq,\u00a0and had to be buried in Irbil. \u201cI am happy, but with a broken heart,\u201d said Aziz. Christmas in Iraq Displaced Assyrians returned to Bartella to celebrate Mass in the mostly Christian town that was recaptured from Islamic State. Displaced Assyrians returned to Bartella to celebrate Mass in the mostly Christian town that was recaptured from Islamic State. Sgt. Maj. Mokhles Salem Yousef, a local police officer,\u00a0brought his two sons, ages 8 and 5, to see a hometown\u00a0they barely remember. Before Mass, they stopped by\u00a0their old house, now empty, their toys destroyed. The church bells rang and drowned out, for a time, the boom of fighting in nearby Mosul. Behnam, the bus driver, stepped outside for a break. During the drive in, he was upset to see Shiite Muslim flags hanging\u00a0from empty homes, installed there by the Iraqi forces who ousted Islamic State from the town.\u00a0 \u201cWe just want the Iraqi flag,\u201d he said. Behnam feared most of his neighbors would not rebuild. At least 400 homes were destroyed, hundreds more burned and looted, according to the priest. There\u2019s no electricity or running water. Some former residents have already moved abroad. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I will return,\u201d Behnam said. He pointed to a statue of a church patriarch, its head knocked off by militants. Beyond that lay the church cemetery, where Islamic State fighters dug into graves and planted a rocket. Many here fear the fighters could return if Mosul isn\u2019t captured and secured soon. Nearby Gogjali, where the suicide bombers struck this week, was supposed to have been\u00a0freed Nov. 1. (Nabih Bulos) Behnam said he felt safe with all the soldiers at the church. \u201cBut to come back and sleep here as a family? No.\u201d His family of eight has\u00a0settled into two trailers at a camp in Irbil that is full of Assyrians who fled Islamic State\u2019s lightning advance across parts of northern and central Iraq two years ago. The camp has expanded to include restaurants, a barbershop and a\u00a0room where elderly men play cards. Khaled Ishak Matti, 46, a mechanical engineer whose house was destroyed by the militants, was more defiant. Assyrians have endured here for 6,000 years, he said, surviving Arab, Mongol and Persian rule. He intends to rebuild\u00a0and wants the U.S.-led coalition to help protect the town. \u201cThis is our land,\u201d he said. \u201cBut life cannot be like before. We need security, safety.\u201d Neama Aggula, a 42-year-old civil engineer, said militants stole everything from her house, \u201ceven the doors.\u201d She has not had a Christmas tree since she fled to Irbil and is holding off getting one until she moves back home. As Mass ended, Saida Hama, 75, walked quickly out the door and down a nearby alley strewn with pots, pans, fans, heaters and other debris, toward what remained of her small orange house. Hama\u00a0wore a large wooden cross and a green scarf that barely shielded her from the rain. At home, she found her disabled son, Mazin Danou, who uses leg braces, sorting through the dusty remains of their household. \u201cDaesh took what was in good condition,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. They stole\u00a0the refrigerator, stove, water pump,\u00a0gas drums. As the pair stood under an olive tree in the yard, a boom sounded in the distance.\u00a0\u201cFrom Mosul,\u201d he said. Hama hurried off to\u00a0another church, where she had arranged to meet neighbors to pray. She passed the ruins of a priest\u2019s house, then the downtown shopping district, showrooms all smashed, including a mini-mart her son once ran. Finally, she reached St. George\u2019s, doors gaping, rubble strewn across the floor, the altar charred black. It was past 3 p.m. Soon the buses would depart for Irbil. On Sunday, there would be more Masses for other families and Assyrian troops stationed in nearby towns. Bashir Shamon Sadea, a tribal council leader, said the community\u00a0needs help\u00a0fighting \u201cdark forces.\u201d \u201cDaesh came to kill the soul. But they couldn\u2019t. They killed the body,\u201d Sadea said\u00a0outside Mar Shimoni. \u201cWe are back now.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption Mothers who lose a second child to violence \"You wash the pain.

Trump Foundation \"to avoid even the appearance of any conflict\" with his role as president. Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump plans to dissolve his foundation, his transition team announced on in a statement on Saturday. Soon after, though, the New York attorney general's spokesperson tweeted that he legally can't, until the state's investigation of the Trump Foundation is complete. . @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Foundation still under investigation by @AGSchneiderman , cannot legally dissolve until investigation complete \u2014 Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) December 24, 2016 Press Secretary Amy Spitalnick was responding to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who asked if the investigation would continue . In October, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York, saying the charity was not registered to do so under state law. In Saturday's statement, Trump is quoted as saying: \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children. However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" The announcement comes shortly after a report from The New York Times discussing the president-elect's many potential conflicts of interest . The Times reports that Trump and his family \"are rushing to resolve potential controversies \u2014 like shuttering foundations and terminating development deals \u2014 even as the president-elect publicly maintains that no legal conflicts exist.\" Article continues after sponsorship An NPR report from earlier this year compared the work of the Trump Foundation with that of the Clinton Foundation, which came under fire during the campaign, noting the similarities seem to end with their names. As NPR's Joel Rose reported, \"The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as it's formally known, is huge. It has hundreds of employees and a $90 million budget. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, by contrast, is fairly small. It has no full-time employees and a budget of about $600,000.\" Reporting from the Washington Post shows Trump hasn't given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008 . The Post says Vince and Linda McMahon, owners of World Wrestling Entertainment, have been major donors; Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. ",

    "text": "How to Get a Better Night\u2019s Sleep By Tara Parker-Pope @nytimes Email Most people know they need to eat right and exercise to be healthy. But what about sleep? We spend about one-third of our lives asleep, and sleep is essential to better health. But many of us are struggling with sleep. Four out of five people say that they suffer from sleep problems at least once a week and wake up feeling exhausted. So how do you become a more successful sleeper? Grab a pillow, curl up and keep reading to find out. Why is Sleep Good? Advertisement How Much Sleep Do You Really Need? If you wake up tired, chances are you\u2019re not getting enough sleep. These strategies may help you determine your sleep needs. The Magic Number The best person to determine how much sleep you need is you. If you feel tired, you probably need more sleep. But science does offer some more specific guidance. People who sleep seven hours a night are healthier and live longer. Sleeping less than seven hours is associated with a range of health problems including obesity, heart disease, depression and impaired immune function. But sleep needs vary greatly by individual. Age, genetics, lifestyle and environment all play a role. The National Sleep Foundation recently updated its sleep recommendations based on age. While these numbers are useful guidelines, they really don\u2019t tell you anything about your individual sleep needs, which are largely determined by genetics \u2014 and strongly influenced by your habits. Ask Yourself: \u2018Are You Sleepy?\u2019 This simple question is the best way to determine if you\u2019re getting adequate sleep. If you often feel tired at work, long for a nap or fall asleep on your morning or evening commute, your body is telling you that it\u2019s not getting enough sleep. If you\u2019re getting seven or eight hours of sleep a night but still feeling tired and sleep-deprived, you may be suffering from interrupted sleep or a sleep disorder and may need to talk to a doctor and undergo a sleep study. Keep a Sleep Diary Even if you think you\u2019re getting enough sleep, you may be surprised once you see your sleep patterns in black and white. Some of the new activity trackers will monitor your sleep patterns for you, but you can also do it easily yourself. For the next week, keep a sleep diary: 1. Write down the time you go to bed and the hour you wake up. 2. Determine the total number of hours you sleep. Note whether you took naps or woke up in the middle of the night. 3. Note how you felt in the morning. Refreshed and ready to conquer the world? Or groggy and fatigued? Not only will a sleep diary will give you important insights into your sleep habits, but it will be useful to your doctor if you think you are suffering from a sleep disorder. \u200bTake a Vacation From Your Alarm Clock Want to really identify your individual sleep needs? Try this \u201csleep vacation\u201d experiment. To do this, you will need two weeks when you don\u2019t have somewhere to be at a specific time in the morning. If you have a flexible job, you can do this any time, or you may have to wait until a vacation. The experiment requires a little discipline: 1. Pick the same bedtime every night. 2. Turn off your alarm. 3. Record the time you wake up. Chances are, you will sleep longer during the first few days, because you are catching up on lost sleep, so the first few days of data won\u2019t be useful. But over the course of a few weeks, if you stick to the scheduled bedtime and allow yourself to wake up naturally, you\u2019ll begin to see a pattern emerge of how many hours of sleep your body needs each night. Once you determine your natural sleep needs, think about the time you need to wake up to get to work or school on time and pick a bedtime that allows you enough sleep to wake up naturally. More Tips On Sleep Advertisement Morning Lark or Night Owl? Do you pop out of bed bright and early, ready to take on the world? Or do you find yourself making friends with the snooze button after staying up all night? Take the Quiz Do you wake up hungry? What\u2019s your best time of day? Those and other questions are part of a test commonly used by sleep experts to determine whether you are a lark, a night owl or somewhere in between. You can take this quiz to find out what type of person you are. How to Become a Morning Person Like most creatures on earth, humans come equipped with a circadian clock, a roughly 24-hour internal timer that keeps our sleep patterns in sync with our planet \u2014 at least until genetics, age and our personal habits get in the way. Even though the average adult needs eight hours of sleep per night, there are so-called \u201cshortsleepers,\u201d who need far less, and morning people, who, research shows, often come from families of other morning people. Then there\u2019s the rest of us, who rely on alarm clocks. For those who fantasize about greeting the dawn with a smile, there is hope. With a little focus, discipline and patience, you have the ability to reset your own internal clock. But be warned, it\u2019s not easy. Changing your sleep pattern requires commitment, and it means changing old habits. No more TV-watching marathons late into the night. Changing your internal sleep clock requires inducing a sort of jet lag without leaving your time zone, and sticking it out until your body clock resets itself. And, most importantly, not resetting it again. Here\u2019s how to become more of a morning person. Step 1: Set a goal for your wake-up time. Step 2: Move your current wake-up time by 20 minutes each day. For example, if you regularly rise at 8 a.m., but really want to get moving at 6 a.m., set the alarm for 7:40 a.m. on Monday. On Tuesday, set it for 7:20 a.m. and so on until you are setting your alarm for 6 a.m. Step 3: Go to bed when you are tired. Avoid extra light exposure from computers or televisions as you near bedtime. Step 4: When your alarm goes off in the morning, don\u2019t linger in bed. Hit yourself with light \u2014 open your shades, turn on the lamp. Step 5: Go to bed a little earlier the next night. In theory, you should get sleepy about 20 minutes earlier each night. A word of warning: While this method works for many, it doesn\u2019t work for everyone. Very early risers and longtime night owls have a hard time ever changing. How to Wake Up If you are struggling to wake up in the morning, sleep experts suggest a few simple ways to train your body. Buy a Louder Alarm: It may sound silly, but if you regularly sleep through your alarm, you may need a different alarm. If you use your phone alarm, change up the ring tone and set the volume on high. Sunlight: One of the most powerful cues to wake up the brain is sunlight. Leaving your blinds open so the sun shines in will help you wake up sooner if you regularly sleep late into the day. Eat Breakfast: Eating breakfast every day will train your body to expect it and help get you in sync with the morning. If you\u2019ve ever flown across time zones, you\u2019ll notice that airlines often serve scrambled eggs and other breakfast foods to help passengers adjust to the new time zone. Don\u2019t Blow It on the Weekend: Besides computer screens, the biggest saboteur for an aspiring morning person is the weekend. Staying up later on Friday or sleeping in on Saturday sends the brain an entirely new set of scheduling priorities, so by Monday, a 6 a.m. alarm may feel like 4 a.m. It\u2019s tough, but stick to your good sleep habits, even on the weekends.

Sign up now Sick and Tired Tired people are not happy, healthy or safe. Here are some of the things that go wrong when you don\u2019t get enough sleep. Sleep and Illness People who get less than seven hours of sleep a night are more likely to have chronic health problems like obesity, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, depression and premature death. While the long-term health risks of bad sleep are enough to keep you awake at night, there\u2019s more bad news. You\u2019re also more likely to catch a cold. In one surprising study, researchers found 164 men and women who were willing to take nose drops that exposed them to the cold virus. (And that\u2019s not the most surprising part of the story.) You might think that everyone who willingly puts a cold virus in their nose would get sick, but they don\u2019t. A healthy immune system can fight off a cold. But not a sleep-deprived immune system. The people most likely to get sick from the cold-infused nose drops? Those who got six or fewer hours of sleep. The Tired Brain A tired brain is not a wise brain, and people who are sleep deprived make more mistakes. The American Insomnia Survey, published in 2012, estimated that 274,000 workplace accidents were directly related to sleep problems. The bill for these sleep-deprived mistakes? $31 billion annually. Why does this happen? While the body goes into rest mode during sleep, the brain becomes highly active. Think of your brain like a computer or a smartphone that uses the nighttime to back up all your data. One of its big jobs is to consolidate memories, link with old memories and create paths for you to retrieve memories. It also forms connections between disparate thoughts and ideas. That\u2019s why sometimes, when you wake up, a big idea suddenly pops into your head. And it\u2019s why, when you don\u2019t sleep, your thinking and memory are fuzzy. Some research suggests that when you don\u2019t sleep (like when students pull an all-nighter), your ability to learn new information drops by almost half. Toxins in the Attic Another important function of sleep is that it allows the brain to do some mental housekeeping. Yes, sleep helps you clean up the cerebellum, polish the parietal and flush the frontal lobe. Sleep cleans out the toxic junk in your brain. In mouse studies, researchers found that during sleep, the space between brain cells gets bigger, allowing the brain to flush out toxins. While more study is needed, the research suggests that not sleeping can allow toxins to accumulate and may be linked with brain diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. Driving While Tired Drowsy driving is as much of a safety risk as drunk driving or texting and driving. Studies show that going without sleep for 20 to 21 hours and then getting behind the wheel is comparable to having a blood alcohol level of about .08 percent, the legal limit in most states. If you\u2019re awake for 24 hours and then try to drive, you\u2019re at a blood alcohol equivalent of 0.1 percent, which is higher than the legal limit in all states. You are at risk for drowsy driving if you get less than six hours of sleep at night. Another risk factor is snoring. Snorers also are at risk for drowsy driving because snoring is a sign of sleep apnea and interrupted sleep. (See our section below, \u201cCall a Doctor,\u201d for more on sleep apnea.) In 2009, an estimated 730 deadly motor vehicle accidents involved a driver who was either sleepy or dozing off, and an additional 30,000 crashes that were nonfatal involved a drowsy driver. Accidents involving sleepy drivers are more likely to be deadly or cause injuries, in part because people who fall asleep at the wheel either fail to hit their brakes or veer off the road before crashing. Groggy drivers often blast the radio or roll down the window to stay awake, but those measures don\u2019t really work, say experts. Coffee or a caffeinated drink may help, but some individuals don\u2019t get much of an effect. The best advice if you find yourself sleepy at the wheel: Pull over for a quick cat nap. Sleep and Weight Gain For years researchers have known that adults who sleep less than five or six hours a night are at higher risk of being overweight . Among children, sleeping less than 10 hours a night is associated with weight gain . Some research even shows that losing just a few hours of sleep a few nights in a row can lead to almost immediate weight gain. Part of the reason may be that sleep-deprived people eat more. Staying up late and skimping on sleep leads to more eating in general, and a hankering for carbohydrates. In one study, sleep-deprived eaters ended up eating more calories during after-dinner snacking than in any other meal during the day. By the end of the first week the sleep-deprived subjects had gained an average of about two pounds. Over all, people consumed 6 percent more calories when they got too little sleep. Once they started sleeping more, they began eating more healthfully, consuming fewer carbohydrates and fats. More on Sleep and Your Health ",

Continue reading the main story Photo Amer Alfayadh, a senior case manager, and Orion Hernandez carrying a dresser for the house.

Some comes from the donations hoarded in a cluttered garage, where a \u201cWelcome Home\u201d sign in Arabic is on display. Other items were acquired cheap \u2014 chairs for $5, tables for $20 \u2014 at Root\u2019s Old Mill Flea Market. New paint and flooring give the house the smell of a fresh start, thanks to the landlord, John Liang, who came to Lancaster as a child, one of the \u201cboat people\u201d who fled Vietnam on dangerously overcrowded vessels after the war. He spent a year in a notoriously hellish refugee camp before coming to Lancaster, where he and his family delivered newspapers, shoveled snow, did sewing and assembly-line work. Anything. Now 45, Mr. Liang works overtime at a nearby Kellogg\u2019s cereal plant and manages several properties he owns, including this house, which he wants to be \u2014 just so.

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times \u201cThere are other people living a lot harder, tougher, than what I went through,\u201d he says. A History of Acceptance Mr. Digrugilliers applies his checklist to the kitchen, where the counter is crowded with mismatched dinnerware, new appliances and clutches of flatware bound with rubber bands. Draped over the oven handle is a dish towel printed with a calendar for 1968, another tumultuous year. Then to the bedrooms upstairs. The children\u2019s twin beds, bought at discount from the Lancaster Mattress Company, are covered with the black G of the Georgia Bulldogs, the winged wheel of the Detroit Red Wings and other invitations to sleep in cocoons of American culture. Armed with a list of what he needs, he and a colleague, Orion Hernandez, climb into a beat-up van reeking of McDonald\u2019s. They head to Walmart, where Mr. Digrugilliers recognizes a thin man \u2014 a Nepalese refugee who resettled here two years ago \u2014 leaving as he is walking in.

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d Mr. Digrugilliers calls out. \u201cHello,\u201d the man calls back. Such encounters happen often in Lancaster, whose rich history of acceptance is rooted, in part, in the influence of the Mennonites, Amish and other faiths. A glimpse of the local worldview came in January when a supportive rally of more than 200 people drowned out a much smaller anti-immigrant protest outside the Church World Service office here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sheila Mastropietro, the group\u2019s longtime supervisor in Lancaster, took heart in the moment. It reflected a communal understanding of both the global refugee crisis and the rigorous screening process that refugees undergo before coming to the United States. Still, given a president-elect who seems averse to the country\u2019s modest commitment to refugee relocation, Ms. Mastropietro says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo The landlord, John Liang, 45, fled Vietnam as a child. \u201cThere are other people living a lot harder, tougher, than what I went through,\u201d he said.

Decades of resettlement work have transformed the Lancaster area into a medley of cultures so rich that Amer Alfayadh, 34, a senior case manager, struggles to name them all: \u201cSyrians, Iraqis, Somalis, Congolese, Ukrainians, Belorussians, people from Kazakhstan.

He is accustomed now to urgent late-night calls from fresh arrivals unfamiliar with, say, locks on doors. New clients are often at their breaking point, uncertain what to make of this exotic land called Pennsylvania. Knowing how difficult it can be for anyone in crisis to see ahead \u2014 to jobs, school, a future \u2014 Mr. Alfayadh says he tries to impart a simple message: \u201cO.K. Tomorrow will be better.\u201d At Walmart, Mr. Digrugilliers and Mr. Hernandez commandeer two shopping carts each and begin racing through the cavernous store like contestants on the old \u201cSupermarket Sweep\u201d game show, grabbing specific items, down to umbrellas and sanitary pads. His purchases complete, Mr. Digrugilliers mounts his cart and wheels it into the dusk like a skateboard, exuberant with hope that some refugee family\u2019s journey will be just as smooth. Continue reading the main story Photo The home was prepared for a family of six: a father, a mother, three daughters and a boy. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times It is not. The Church World Service soon receives word that this particular family\u2019s resettlement has been delayed \u2014 a not-uncommon development that could be caused by something as simple as a spike in an asylum-seeker\u2019s blood pressure at the airport. Advertisement But there is no shortage of tempest-tossed refugees. Mr. Alfayadh\u2019s supervisor, Valentina Ross, remembers that another Syrian family is arriving in a few days: a father, a mother, three daughters and a boy. They will need a home. Holiday Spirit Abounds Today is the day. A holiday spirit has taken hold in downtown Lancaster, with a colossal Christmas tree glittering in Penn Square and ancient brick houses swathed in festive lights.

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times A mile away, a Church World Service caseworker named Gaby Garver, a focused college graduate of 22, is collecting provisions for the new family at a food pantry. Signing some paperwork, she says, \u201cAnd no meat products for the family, please.\u201d As Ms. Garver prepares to leave with milk, vegetables and other items, a pantry volunteer asks: \u201cSince you didn\u2019t take any meat, would you like some extra rice?\u201d Yes, please. More food is needed. Ms. Garver guides her 1999 Pontiac through the cold rain to the Save-A-Lot supermarket, where many goods sit in cut-open cardboard cases. She leaves 10 minutes later with bread, fruit, beans, sugar, tea and a receipt for $26.58, to be deducted from the family\u2019s grant money.

After stocking the refrigerator and cabinet, she conducts a last-minute inspection. The fridge is cold. The tap has hot water. The burners on the gas stove ignite. Everything upstairs is fine as well, with even more homey touches added. New pajamas and towels. New clothes hangers. New picture frames, showing stock photos of cheerful families, on the shelves. And on one twin bed, a child\u2019s soccer ball, still in its box. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hugs and Handshakes The rain has stopped, a slice of moon risen. Ms. Garver is driving now to the home of a Syrian family that arrived seven months ago. The mother has cooked a hot meal for the refugee family that is about to land any minute in New York, a good three-hour drive away. Photo Light from a window beckoned the new occupants. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Inside, where five young children zip and waddle about, the prepared meal sits in expectation on the dining-room table: a large aluminum tray bountiful with chicken and rice and a huge bowl of salad. The oldest child, Mohamad, 14, helps Ms. Garver carry the food out to her vehicle, and she thanks him. He responds with the formality given to a new language being tried on for size. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the boy says, and smiles. Returning to the gray house, Ms. Garver fumbles in the dark to open the door while holding the tray of still-hot food. When she returns with the salad bowl, she stoops to collect a clump of junk mail, including a come-on addressed to \u201cOur Neighbor.\u201d Later tonight, Ms. Garver and Mr. Alfayadh will drive a Ford van to Lancaster Airport, where they will meet two representatives from the local Islamic Center. Soon after, another van will arrive from Kennedy International Airport. Hugs and handshakes will be exchanged in the December air. Luggage will be collected. And six Syrian refugees will be driven the 20 minutes to a warm home perfumed by warm food, in a city made radiant by the multicolored lights of the season.

    "text": "Tennessee Titans So much for the Bears continuing to compete and keep games close at the end of this wretched season. Matt Barkley threw five interceptions and the Redskins\u2019 high-powered offense had 317 yards in the first half, as the Bears lost 41-21 in their home finale. Whatever optimism existed about Barkley\u2019s potential and possible place with the team next season was replaced by coal in the stocking. In making several ill-advised throws into coverage, some of them off balance, Barkley became the first Bear to throw five interceptions in a game since Jay Cutler did it against the 49ers in November 2009. The Bears defense wasn\u2019t much better. They surrendered conversions on seven of 12 third downs. Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins usually had plenty of time to survey the field, and the Bears, once again, did not force a turnover. The Redskins kept their playoff hopes alive, improving to 8-6-1. The Bears, meanwhile, fell to 3-12. The silver lining: the Jaguars beat the Titans to move into a tie with the Bears for the third-worst record in the NFL. And because the Bears\u2019 opponents have won more games this season, they are now positioned to have the third overall pick in next April\u2019s draft. In injury news, Bears rookie outside linebacker Leonard Floyd left the game in the first half with a concussion and did not return. Safety Deon Bush departed with an ankle injury. rcampbell@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Dec 24 2016, 4:41 pm ET To End Decades on Death Row, Inmate Makes an Agonizing Choice by Jon Schuppe advertisement After 25 years on death row for a killing he said he didn't do \u2014 and three years after a federal judge threw out his conviction \u2014 James Dennis was brought to a Philadelphia courtroom Thursday to make a harrowing choice: plead no contest to the crime and go home, or gamble on another trial. He didn't want to admit to the 1991 shooting of 17-year-old Chedell Williams. A federal judge had already ruled he'd been condemned \"for a crime in all probability he did not commit.\" But that didn't guarantee that another jury wouldn't find him guilty. So he took the only path he knew would keep him from execution. \"I need to do what I need to do for my family,\" Dennis told his brother, Greg, before entering the plea. As part of his agreement with prosecutors, Dennis was able to maintain that he hadn't killed Williams. Jimmy Dennis. Courtesy of Justice for Jimmy \"James Dennis entered a no-contest plea, not a guilty plea, because he maintains the same position that he has maintained for 25 years: that he is innocent of this crime,\" one of his lawyers, Karl Schwartz, told the judge. \"He and his family have made this incredibly difficult decision based on his and their strong desire to have him home and free, [in] lieu of potentially years of continuing litigation.\" The no-contest plea is not uncommon in claims of wrongful conviction. It allows prosecutors to keep a conviction without a new trial. The defendant, meanwhile, acknowledges there may be enough evidence for another guilty verdict but can still claim innocence. To some, no-contest can seem like a good deal. To others, it can feel like less than justice. Samuel Gross, a University of Michigan law professor who runs The National Registry of Exonerations, said the offer of a no-contest plea puts defendants in an agonizing bind. Related: Inmates Hope for Last-Ditch Shot at Obama's Clemency Program \"Typically, when someone has been on death row or general prison population for most of his adult life and is now offered an opportunity to leave prison right away, their family and friends and lawyers ... urge them to take the plea and not take a chance,\" Gross said. \"Quite a few refuse.\" The results are impossible to predict. Gross cited the case of Terry Harrington, who was convicted with a friend, Curtis McGhee, of the 1977 murder of a retired police captain in Iowa. Both were granted new trials. McGhee took a no-contest plea and was released. Harrington chose to go to trial, but prosecutors dismissed the case instead. The dismissal resulted in his release, but only later, after a lawyer found evidence that the prosecutors had improperly handled McGhee's plea, was he exonerated as well. Lawyers also negotiated no-contest pleas in the case of the West Memphis 3 \u2014 men who were convicted of killing three Arkansas Cub Scouts in 1993. Not all of the three men wanted to enter the plea, but they agreed because one of them, Damien Echols, was suffering severely from 18 years on death row. Related: President Obama Commutes Another 79 Inmates' Prison Sentences Dennis was convicted in 1992 of shooting Williams during a robbery, primarily on the testimony of three eyewitnesses. Decades of appeals followed, in which his lawyers argued that investigators and prosecutors withheld evidence that undermined his innocence. It landed before U.S. District Judge Anita Brody, who in 2013 ripped into the prosecution and ordered a new trial. \"The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has committed a grave miscarriage of justice in convicting Dennis and sentencing him to die for this crime,\" Brody wrote. A photograph of Jimmy Dennis as used by the Justice for Jimmy campaign. Courtesy of Justice for Jimmy Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, who was not in office when Dennis was convicted, challenged the ruling. An appellate court sided with her in August. That forced Williams to decide whether to retry Dennis or drop the case. Unwilling to say Dennis was innocent, his office began negotiations with Dennis' lawyers. One of Dennis' lawyers, Stephen Cozen, said in an interview that he considered the state's witnesses as \"shaky\" and Dennis' alibi \u2014 that he was a on a bus miles away when the murder took place \u2014 was strong. Ultimately, Dennis agreed to the plea because it allowed him to continue to assert that he didn't kill Chedell Williams. \"Our main goal was to try to get Jimmy out of prison after having served 25 years,\" Cozen said. Prosecutors said they remained convinced of Dennis' guilt. \"In our system of justice, the defendant is always free to state otherwise. Under the law, however, he stands convicted of this murder,\" Williams' office said in a statement. \"We accepted this plea not because of doubts about guilt, but because of the inherent difficulties of retrying a complex case more than a quarter century after the crime.\" Jimmy Dennis poses while holding a photograph of his mother. Courtesy of Justice for Jimmy The remaining complication was an unrelated robbery conviction, according to Dennis' lawyers. Dennis didn't dispute that one. But that punishment remained on the books. The two sides worked out a deal where prosecutors would recommend that Dennis receive parole, possibly in time to be home by Easter, Cozen said. He praised Williams' office for negotiating the deal. Dennis' older brother, Greg, said the family is now planning a homecoming. But the reunion will be bittersweet. He criticized Williams for not dismissing the case. \"We're happy that we'll get to spend some time with Jimmy and be with him, but we also feel very disrespected,\" he said. Jon Schuppe ",

    "text": "Germans Must Leave Home as WWII Bomb Is Defused By The Associated Press FRANKFURT, Germany \u0097 Dec 24, 2016, 12:12 PM ET 0 Shares Email More than 54,000 people in the southern German city of Augsburg must leave their homes Christmas morning while authorities defuse a giant 1.8-ton aerial bomb from World War II . The city's medieval cathedral and City Hall are in the area to be sealed off. Police said Saturday that no one will be allowed into the surrounding streets from about 8 a.m. Sunday and everyone must be out by 10 a.m. Police say it's impossible to say exactly how long it will take to make the bomb safe. Schools are being opened for people who can't stay with relatives or friends. Police said people can bring their pets to shelters and that public transportation will be free Christmas morning. Finding bombs from the war is not unusual in Germany . This evacuation, however, is even bigger than the 45,000 people temporarily evacuated to remove a bomb in Koblenz in 2011. Large parts of Augsburg were destroyed on Feb. 25-26, 1944, when the city was attacked by hundreds of British and U.S. bombers. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Singapore Teen Critic in US Reportedly Wants Asylum By The Associated Press CHICAGO \u0097 Dec 24, 2016, 11:53 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Tuesday, May, 12, 2015, file photo, Singapore teen blogger Amos Yee speaks to reporters while leaving the Subordinate Courts after being released on bail in Singapore. Yee whose video posts and blogs mocking his government and its late founder landed him in jail twice has been detained in the U.S. where he is seeking asylum. Human Rights Watch called on the U.S. to recognize Amos Yee\u2019s asylum claim, saying he has been consistently harassed in Singapore for publicly expressing his views. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, File) 0 Shares Email A teenage blogger from Singapore whose supporters say is seeking asylum is in custody after being detained last week at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, U.S. immigration officials said Saturday. Amos Yee, 18, was detained Dec. 16 and remains in custody \"pending federal immigration court proceedings,\" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gail Montenegro said in a written statement. Separately, Marilu Cabrera with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles some asylum requests, said the agency \"cannot confirm or deny\" details of any asylum case. The Human Rights Watch deputy director for Asia, Phil Robertson , called on the U.S. to recognize Yee's asylum claim, saying he has been consistently harassed by the Singapore government for publicly expressing his views on politics and religion and severely criticizing the city-state's leaders, including late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew . Yee was imprisoned for six weeks in September on charges of hurting religious feelings of Christians and Muslims after repeatedly breaching bail conditions following a four-week prison sentence he served in July last year on the same charges. He was also due to be called up for mandatory military service. His U.S. lawyer, Sandra Grossman, told the South China Morning Post on Saturday that Yee was likely detained because he entered the country on a tourist visa despite an intention to apply for asylum. She said Yee would have to undergo a \"credible fear interview\" by an asylum official who would assess if he faces a credible fear of persecution or torture back home. She said the process usually takes a few days, but the holiday season could delay it. He would then appear before an immigration judge, but that could take years because of backlogs in the immigration system. Yee, who won a local filmmaking prize at age 13, ruffled feathers in Singapore with a video blog laced with expletives as the city-state was mourning Lee's death in March last year. Such open criticism and lampooning of leaders is rarely seen in Singapore, where laws are strictly enforced. The government of the multiethnic state says Yee crossed the red line on religion when he mocked Christians and Muslims and the law had to be enforced on him to protect racial and religious harmony. Robertson said Yee has faced intensive government surveillance and monitoring of his public and online comments. \"Amos Yee is the sort of classic political dissident that the U.N. Refugee Convention was designed to protect, and Human Rights Watch hopes the U.S. will recognize his asylum claim,\" he said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

That\u2019s what I used.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Gebbie joined the Santa trade two years ago after crossing paths in a Costco store with another man who looked a lot like St. Nick. That man was Timothy Connaghan, a member of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas and the creator of School4Santas.com . Interested in extra income after retiring from a career as a customs broker, Mr. Gebbie enrolled in Santa school, where the coursework included lessons on how to talk with children (yes, this Santa has undergone a background check), winning over Santa skeptics and building his business. 9:30 a.m.: The commute begins. Photo Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times Mr. Gebbie lives in Port Jefferson, on Long Island, which is about 70 miles from today\u2019s gig, a fitness complex called MatchPoint in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Mr. Gebbie begins his trip by clearing snow off his sleigh, a blue 1996 Subaru Impreza. \u201cI tell the kids the dents are from the reindeer,\u201d he said. 11:24 a.m.: The transformation. Photo Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times Some events offer valet service and changing rooms, but MatchPoint is a no-frills affair. Mr. Gebbie lugs a garment bag and a rolling suitcase to the gym\u2019s entrance. Still a relatively new Santa, Mr. Gebbie has personally booked about 15 events during this year\u2019s 40-day season, ranging from a stint at Cipriani 42nd Street to home visits. He can earn $200 to $1,000 per appearance. (This event will pay him toward \u201cthe high end\u201d of what he makes.) MatchPoint has been transformed into a festive wonderland. Mr. Gebbie finds a space to change behind a curtain. \u201cI want to lose a little more weight next year,\u201d he said of his red velvet suit. \u201cI might get a 2XL instead of a 3XL.\u201d On his belt is a magic key to every house \u2014 this is crucial for warding off questions from children who don\u2019t have chimney access. Advertisement 12:13 p.m.: Taking the stage. Photo Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times Mr. Gebbie emerges from behind the curtain to take his place on Santa\u2019s throne, where he plugs in a portable fan (Santas can easily overheat). Children wander near him, murmuring Ded Moroz \u2014 Santa Claus in Russian. This is an over-the-top event, stuffed with more than a dozen performers. Parents have paid up to $60 to spend the day here with their children. Troy Curtis , a performer who was once part of the boy band Menudo, is singing a Bruno Mars hit. The event is flashy, but the day\u2019s success hinges on Santa, according to Dennis Jaigobin , who produced the event. The work is surprisingly physical: To beckon star-struck children, Mr. Gebbie hams it up on stage by clapping, waving and cupping his hands around his mouth. One of Mr. Gebbie\u2019s visitors, Gabriel Haskel, 5, is a professional. \u201cThis is the fourth Santa this year,\u201d his father, Oleg Haskel, said. \u201cSome of them he believes and others he\u2019s like, \u2018Nah, that\u2019s a costume.\u2019\u201d Onstage, the boy confers with Santa for a moment, and afterward, Mr. Gebbie cups his hands: \u201cA piano!\u201d he mouths to the boy\u2019s parents. Gabriel says this Santa is the real deal. 1:24 p.m.: Santa takes a break. Photo Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times There are a few cardinal rules for being Santa, and one is that a break is mandated every hour. As gymnasts dance to Russian music, Mr. Gebbie disappears behind a blue tarp. An ice princess materializes with a plate of boiled hot dogs and a few pieces of fried food. \u201cYou never refuse it because you never know,\u201d he says, accepting sustenance. 6:30 p.m.: The car ride home. After his shift is over, Mr. Gebbie faces a long drive back to Port Jefferson. Spending six hours working a bilingual event has reminded him of his goal for the next year. \u201cI want to learn foreign languages,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want the kids to come in and feel comfortable.\u201d Advertisement Another goal: less travel. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll drive the 70 miles back to Sheepshead Bay and become Santa all over again. It\u2019s not easy being Santa. Dolly Faibyshev contributed reporting.
