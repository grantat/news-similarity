Lisa Marie Naegle, who appeared on the E! reality show \u201cBridalplasty,\u201d went missing after attending a birthday party Saturday night. She called her husband early Sunday and said she would be grabbing food on her way home. She never arrived. On Tuesday, Los Angeles police detained Jackie Jerome Rogers for questioning and later placed him under arrest, according to LAPD spokesman Officer Tony Im. Rogers, who\u00a0was held in lieu of\u00a0$2-million bail, gave information that led investigators to believe she was murdered. Investigators with the L.A. County coroner\u2019s office searched a property in the South Bay\u2019s Lennox neighborhood and found a woman\u2019s corpse, Im said. The woman is believed to be Naegle, and the coroner\u2019s office will make the final determination into how she died, he added. The coroner\u2019s office was first notified about the possibility of a buried body near a home in the 5000 block of West 106th Street about 11 a.m., coroner\u2019s spokesman Ed Winter said. Coroner\u2019s investigators were called out by 2:30 p.m. The discovery of Naegle\u2019s body draws to close a dramatic search, but much of the circumstances around her death are shrouded in mystery. Naegle\u00a0went to a birthday party at Alpine Village restaurant Saturday night, her husband told KTLA. About 2:30 a.m., Naegle called her husband, Derek Harryman, saying she was going to grab a bite to eat on her way home. He said his wife sounded drunk. But the 36-year-old San Pedro resident never arrived home, her husband told the television station. Naegle, a registered nurse, also didn\u2019t show up to the nursing class she was teaching. Harryman told the Daily Breeze that he tried to hack into his wife\u2019s electronic devices\u00a0so he could access her Find my iPhone app and locate her. Calls made to her cellphone went to voicemail, he said. \u201cThis is extremely rare and unlike her,\u201d Harryman said on Facebook. She was reported missing Monday. A photograph taken from surveillance cameras at Alpine Village shows Naegle at the restaurant at 2:15 a.m., according to the Facebook account\u00a0Finding Lisa Marie Naegle. The footage shows Naegle entering a black SUV, her husband said. In the 2010 reality show, Naegle competed with other brides for a dream wedding and a plastic surgery procedure. Naegle was eliminated in Episode 7.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook The truck that was used to plow through a Christmas market in Berlin on Dec. 19, 2016, that killed 12 people and wounded more than 50 more. (Photo: Tobias Schwarz, AFP/Getty Images) If the truck attack on a crowded Berlin market that killed a dozen people sounded familiar, that's because it follows a disturbing trend of terrorism that requires little organization, manpower or technological know-how. Whether the Berlin rampage represents the latest lone wolf attack\u00a0or is the latest example of an Islamic State operative able to conceal his ties to the terrorist organization worries authorities. German officials are still searching for the unknown driver who plowed a truck loaded with steel beams into a popular Christmas market Monday night. Whatever his identity, his method has become commonplace. ISIL calls Berlin attacker a 'soldier' as manhunt for killer resumes In July a Tunisian resident of France, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel,\u00a0used a rented cargo truck to run through a crowd in Nice, France, killing 86 people and wounding hundreds more. And Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a Somali-born student at Ohio State University, crashed his car into a crowd of pedestrians in November before getting out and stabbing several of them with a butcher knife. Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, said the Islamic State has been heavily promoting the use of trucks in recent years. The group even dedicated a three-page feature in the November edition of its online magazine explaining the right way to carry out such an attack, including a picture of a U-Haul truck, a list of suggested targets and tips on what kind of truck to use.

Milton said the Islamic State is light years ahead of the grainy propaganda videos used by al-Qaeda that mostly featured inspirational messages to encourage recruits to find their way to an al-Qaeda training camp. Now, the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, uses\u00a0social media, its online magazine and instructional videos to\u00a0teach would-be supporters how to do everything from choosing the right knife to picking the ideal target. Milton said that has inspired many \"lone wolves\" who need no formal contact with the Islamic State to inflict their own terror. And with the battle in Syria continuing to rage, he said there's plenty of anti-Western motivation. \"ISIS has been far better at mobilizing people using interesting and provocative propaganda than any group we've ever seen,\" Milton said. \"You see them putting a better pitch out there, and people are responding to that.\" Other security experts see something else going on. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said many Islamic State followers are incorrectly labeled lone wolves\u00a0because there is little evidence showing\u00a0any direct contact with the militant group. Maybe the attackers have\u00a0never been to a country known to house terrorist training camps, or maybe there's no sign they communicated with an Islamic State operative online or over the phone. But Gartenstein-Ross said the anonymity of social media and easy access to encryption software has made it easier for people to have regular conversations with terrorism groups without raising suspicions from law enforcement. \"You can be in touch with a lot of operatives now,\" he said. \"It's not the immediate go-to-jail card that it used to be.\" Gartenstein-Ross is focusing on the timing of the Berlin attack. The Islamic State has made a habit of clustering attacks around holidays. He said the militant group\u00a0attempted a series of attacks last year around New Year's Eve that were disrupted by intelligence agencies. He said an intended attack around the Easter turned into the Brussels attack, when three suicide bombings killed 32 people on March 22. A coordinated attack around Ramadan was also carried out, including a car bombing in Iraq that killed more than 300 people. German media say boy, 12, planned twin bomb attacks He sees a similar pattern leading up to Christmas and New Year's. Last week, German officials claimed a 12-year-old boy tried to set off dual bombs near a Christmas market in the southern city of\u00a0Ludwigshafen. Monday's attack in Berlin\u00a0could have been the next step of the Islamic State's holiday campaign, according to\u00a0Gartenstein-Ross. The Islamic State's\u00a0Amaq News Agency added to that theory Tuesday, claiming responsibility for the Berlin attack, calling the unknown driver who's still at-large a \"solider of the Islamic State.\" \"It's possible that we already are seeing a cluster in Germany,\"\u00a0Gartenstein-Ross said. 48 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 45 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i7kw3d NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Outcry at Loyola after students learn athlete accused of rape was enrolled for three years The Washington Post For three years, Benjamin Holm walked the Catholic campus at Loyola University in Chicago like any other student, pursuing a double major in finance and economics and playing for the school's golf team. But his life in Chicago hid the reality he faced back home in the suburbs of Atlanta. There, he was being investigated in a rape case. Holm had been accused of and arrested for the crime in the spring of 2013, weeks before his high school graduation and five months after he had committed to playing golf at Loyola, but his trial didn't start until the end of last month \u2014 more than three years after the sexual assault. And it seems throughout that lengthy span, nobody at the university knew of Holm's pending rape trial, not as his charges were upgraded to felony status while he was already on campus or even when he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and statutory rape on Dec. 5. Media reports about the rape case published last week \u2014 in which the university refused comment \u2014 were followed by days of outrage from Holm's former Loyola classmates, which included a change.org petition signed by more than 1,200 people demanding an explanation from the university. \"Students at Loyola University Chicago are disgusted by the institution's actions and do not feel safe on campus,\" wrote sophomore student Ashley Kennedy. \"The administration's silence is only making things worse.\" University of Virginia administrator $3 million Monday for her portrayal in a now-discredited Rolling Stone magazine article about the school's handling of a brutal gang rape a fraternity house. The 10-member jury's decision came after it concluded Friday that the magazine, its... Jurors awarded a University of Virginia administrator $3 million Monday for her portrayal in a now-discredited Rolling Stone magazine article about the school's handling of a brutal gang rape a fraternity house. The 10-member jury's decision came after it concluded Friday that the magazine, its... (Associated Press) On Dec. 16, 11 days after Holm plead guilty to the sexual assault, the university issued a statement from Title IX coordinator Thomas M. Kelly, who oversees sexual assault education and enforcement on campus.\u00a0 \"To our knowledge, we neither received information about the crime, nor had any awareness that it occurred until Monday, December 12, when we received a media inquiry. Based on media reports, the individual is in police custody in Georgia. The individual is not registered for classes in the Spring Semester. \"Violence of any kind is not tolerated at Loyola, and the safety and security of all members of our campus community remain a top priority.\" \u00a0 The uproar comes at a critical juncture in the national controversy about sexual assault at America's college campuses, an issue that in 2016 became more prominent in part because of White House initiatives, publicity about Rolling Stone's now-retracted article about a gang rape that wasn't at the University of Virginia and several high profile cases. (Tribune news services) Just this week, the California judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a woman on the Stanford University campus was cleared of judicial misconduct by an independent state agency after critics called for him to resign because of what they considered an unjustly light punishment. At the University of Minnesota, the football team for two days last week refused to play in an upcoming bowl game because players disagreed with the way campus officials handled the suspensions of ten of their teammates accused of sexual assault. An ongoing investigation at Baylor University in Texas this year revealed a widespread, chronic pattern in the football program of covering up alleged sexual assaults involving football players. And in recent months, athletic teams at a handful of colleges, including several Ivy League universities, have faced discipline for digital conversations deemed inappropriate by officials that included lewd language and physical rankings of women or other female athletes. Other, less high profile incidents have been chronicled in lawsuits challenging the fairness of Title IX investigations for both the accuser and the accused. But what sets Holm's case apart is that the assault occurred before the student-athlete stepped onto campus - something the university emphasized in its statement. \"In the past few days, Loyolans have expressed concern following media reports related to a student-athlete who was charged and pled guilty to a gender-based violent crime that occurred in his home state of Georgia,\" the Dec. 16 statement said. \"This crime occurred prior to the individual joining Loyola.\"\u00a0 Critics in the online petition argued that the university should keep closer tabs on its student-athletes, who are often offered additional resources and scholarship money not granted to an average student. A 2012 article published in the North Fulton Herald reported that Holm was offered an athletic scholarship when he committed to playing golf at Loyola, but the university Athletic Department would not confirm that information in an interview with the student newspaper. The university publication, the Loyola Phoenix, wrote: \"The Loyola Athletic Department had no comment on the situation, wouldn't disclose information regarding Holm's possible scholarship and didn't confirm whether he had athletic or academic scholarships. Loyola's Athletic Director Steve Watson and Deputy Director of Athletics Jermaine Truax, the administrator in charge of the golf program, declined multiple interview requests from The PHOENIX.\" According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Holm's case began in April 2013, when during a high school party weeks before his graduation, the then 18-year-old sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl at a playground at the Country Club of the South, Johns Creek police said. The victim's friends grew worried when she disappeared, police told the AJC, and eventually found her at the playground. Her pants were down, police said, and Holm was on top of her. \"They observed the sexual assault taking place and heard her clearly saying 'No, stop,'\" Capt. Chris Byers with Johns Creek Police told the AJC. He was initially charged with statutory rape, a misdemeanor in Georgia, and pleaded not guilty. He bonded out of jail and headed to Loyola's campus several months later. Nearly two full years after the incident, in April 2012, according to a timeline from the Loyola Phoenix, the county solicitor determined Holm should have been charged with felony rape, and a year later, a grand jury issued an indictment on the upgraded, more severe, charges. Holm plead not guilty again, according to the Phoenix, and on Nov. 28 his trial began. It wasn't until jury deliberations that Holm, now 21, reversed course and decided to take a deal offered by the prosecution, pleading guilty to aggravated assault and statutory rape. He received a 20-year sentence, 10 of which he would serve in prison and the other 10 on probation, according to the AJC. He was booked into the Fulton County Jail. ",

USA TODAY Sports New York Giants head coach Ben McAdoo coaches against the Dallas Cowboys during the second quarter at MetLife Stadium. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports) The NFL fined the New York Giants $150,000 and coach Ben McAdoo $50,000 for violating the league\u2019s game operations policy by using walkie-talkies on the sideline for five plays in their Dec. 11 game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Giants also will have their fourth-round pick in the 2017 draft moved to the end of the fourth round after compensatory picks, with a maximum drop of 12 spots. \u201cIt was a clear violation of the rules, and we accept full responsibility and the penalty,\" the Giants said in a statement. The team had no previous violations and cooperated with the league\u2019s investigation, which surely helped its case. The discipline \u2013 particularly the financial aspects \u2013 still ended up being significant given the relatively limited scope of the violation. League policy says coaches aren\u2019t permitted to hold a radio during the game because it won\u2019t cut out with 15 seconds left on the play clock, as the approved coach-player headsets do.

    "text": "US Cities Increase Security After Incidents in Berlin and Ankara By Adam Kelsey Dec 20, 2016, 1:53 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH New York Increases Security Following Incidents in Berlin and Ankara 0 Shares Email Cities across the U.S. are heightening security after a series of deadly incidents abroad, including an attack in Berlin, where a truck plowed into a crowd at a busy Christmas market. Additional police officers are being deployed in New York and Chicago , with emphasis on crowded public areas and holiday gatherings. Both cities cautioned that the increased presence of law enforcement was a preventive measure and that no specific threats were received. \u201cThe NYPD is monitoring the events in Germany and around the world today,\u201d the New York Police Department said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe department has moved highly trained teams, including the critical response command, to high-profile locations around New York City.\u201d In a statement, the Chicago Police Department said it is \u201cadding police resources to Daley Plaza, including additional foot and bike patrols and specialized units.\u201d Daley Plaza in the Loop, a busy commercial neighborhood in the city, hosts a holiday marketplace as well. 3 Injured in Shooting at Zurich Islamic Center, Police Say In Berlin on Monday evening, 11 people were killed after a truck plowed through Breitscheidplatz, a public square hosting a Christmas market. A 12th victim was discovered dead in the cabin of the truck, and at least 48 others were injured. German Chancellor Angela Merkel later said, \u201cWe must assume that it was a terrorist attack.\u201d The incident capped a deadly day, as earlier on Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at a museum in the Turkish capital, Ankara, by a man who appeared to be protesting Russia\u2019s involvement in the Syrian civil war. Also on Monday, three people were wounded after a gunman opened fire at an Islamic center in Zurich, Switzerland. In a memo distributed last month, U.S. intelligence officials noted the possibility of holiday celebrations being targeted by terrorist organizations. A joint intelligence bulletin distributed by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 18 read, \u201cLaw enforcement, military and security personnel\u201d are reminded \u201cto remain vigilant and aware of upcoming public and private events this holiday season and during the presidential inauguration.\u201d \u201cWe continue to monitor threats with an unspecified attack date emanating from foreign terrorist organizations ... in the event that these groups advance their plotting efforts in the near term to coincide with the holidays,\u201d read the bulletin. \u201cBased on historical precedence during past holiday seasons and presidential transition periods, we expect to see an increase in threat reporting between now and the end of January 2017.\u201d In addition to the NYPD, police departments in Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C., indicated that they would continue to monitor events in Berlin and elsewhere around the world as they continue to prepare for possible residual effects in those cities. The NYPD said it \u201cwill look to learn more about what occurred to inform operations, deployments and training of officers.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Jonathan Berr CBS/AP December 20, 2016, 3:25 PM Fraudulent online ad scheme considered biggest ever Email A New York-based cybersecurity firm today announced that it uncovered the largest-ever fraud network targeting online publishers and advertisers. The scheme, dubbed \u201cMethbot,\u201d has earned as much as $5 million daily, according to researchers at White Ops. Methbot used a network of servers in the U.S. and Europe to create as many as 300 million phony video ad \u201cimpressions\u201d daily on bogus websites to trick advertisers into paying the fraudsters instead of legitimate sites the marketers thought their ads were showing up on. James Norton, founder and president of Play-Action Strategies, a cybersecurity firm, joins \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" to discuss the New World ... \u201cIn a unique twist, these impressions appear for sale on programmatic advertising markets as premium ad spots on name brand websites,\u201d White Ops said in a statement, referring to automated ad-placement auctions publishers use. The group added that \u201c6,111 domains, drawn from the most popular sites on the web, have been victimized this way.\u201d Methbot made it look like hundreds of thousands of people, mostly in the U.S., were watching real video ads from real companies on more than 6,000 fake websites that mimicked well-known publishers, including CNN, ESPN, Vogue and The New York Times. The criminal ring\u2019s gains come out of the pockets of companies paying for digital ads and also, potentially, of the websites that could have hosted those ads if they were legitimate. The revelation of the fraud and ongoing anxiety about where ad dollars are going could make it harder for legitimate web publishers to make money from ads if brands become more suspicious, said Forrester digital publishing expert Susan Bidel. \u201cIt\u2019s the advertiser\u2019s money that\u2019s being stolen, it\u2019s the publisher\u2019s reputation. It punishes all of publishing,\u201d she said. Facebook is taking on software that shuts out advertisements. Ad-blocking software removes commercial posts from your page, but the world's bigge... Brands need to insist that advertising-technology platforms and ad agencies show them exactly what they are paying for -- where ads end up, Bidel said. Right now, that\u2019s difficult to determine because of the number of companies and networks involved in automatically placing digital ads on sites that have ad holes to fill. Fraud has long been a problem in the roughly $187 billion global digital-ad market. White Ops, which sells antifraud software to ad agencies and other advertising players, estimated in January that \u201cbot\u201d ad fraud would amount to $7 billion globally this year. The company will put out a 2017 estimate in May. White Ops President Eddie Schwartz said he can\u2019t assign a total value on the amount the Russian group has stolen because it\u2019s not clear when the Methbot scam began. But the firm estimates that the scammers were getting $3 million to $5 million per day since roughly early October, and the fraud is still going on. \u201cWhite Ops is very well respected company, and I would imagine that is as serious as they are saying,\u201d said Susan Bidel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. According to White Ops, Methbot operators are using a customized web browser to avoid detection in an operation whose the size and sophistication are unprecedented. The firm believes Methbot is the work of hackers based in Russia, which coincidentally U.S. intelligence officials have accused of trying to influence the U.S. \u00a0presidential election through cyberattacks. White Ops, however, has no evidence linking the Methbot hackers to the break-ins at the Democratic Natonal Committee and elsewhere. \u201cWe have got physical evidence that we\u2019ve shared with federal law enforcement as part of an active investigation,\u201d said Eddie Schwartz, White Ops president and chief operating officer, adding that the company first made these overtures about a month ago. He wouldn\u2019t name the group or say which law enforcement agency is working on the case. Schwartz said this is more \u201cevidence that there are some very well-organized, well-funded groups that are able to take significant amounts of money out of the U.S. economy.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Erhan Ortac/Getty Images Turkey and Russia have launched a joint investigation into the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Turkey at the opening of a photo exhibit in the capital, Ankara, on Monday. The ambassador, Andrei Karlov, was gunned down as he gave a speech at an art gallery. Turkey has identified the attacker as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a 22-year-old riot police officer, who shouted to the crowd, \"Don't forget Aleppo! Don't forget Syria!\" He was killed by Turkish special forces at the scene. Russia's Ambassador To Turkey Shot And Killed In Ankara An 18-member Russian investigations team has arrived in Ankara and has examined the crime scene as well as the bodies of the ambassador and the gunman, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported . Police arrested \"six relatives and a roommate of the assassin\" but later released his uncle \"under judicial restrictions.\" \"The envoy's autopsy has been completed and his remains have been sent to Ankara's Esenboga International Airport for a state ceremony before repatriation to Russia,\" Anadolu said. Meanwhile, a few more details are emerging about Altintas. This is what a \"senior security official\" told Reuters: \"On Monday morning, Altintas called the division of the Ankara riot police where he had worked for 2-1/2 years and said he was unwell and would bring a doctor's note upon his return, the official said. \"Altintas, who lived in a shared flat in the Demetevler neighbourhood on the outskirts of Ankara, spent the night before the attack at a hotel in central Ankara close to the gallery, the official said.\" Additionally, a senior government official told The Associated Press that Altintas \"was unlikely to have acted alone.\" Article continues after sponsorship Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the street where Russia's embassy lies will be renamed Karlov Street to honor the assassinated diplomat, Anadolu added. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the killing a provocation against warming relations between the two countries, Anadolu reported , and said Turkey would not \"let terror hitch us to its own agenda.\" Additionally, \"hours after the shooting, shots were fired at the American Embassy, which is closed for business along with U.S. consulates in Istanbul and Adana,\" NPR's Peter Kenyon reported from Istanbul. \"Iranian diplomatic missions are also closed.\" Russia is a close ally of the regime in Turkey's neighbor, Syria, and is waging an airstrikes campaign there. Russia is hosting talks Tuesday with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Iran regarding the war in Syria. ",

The likely meddling by Russia \"is a serious issue, but it doesn't require a select committee,\" said McConnell, R-Ky. The Senate intelligence committee is able to investigate the matter, he added. CIA Director John Brennan has said the intelligence community is in agreement that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election , although there's no evidence Moscow succeeded in helping Trump win. \"There's no question that the Russians were messing around in our election,\" McConnell told Kentucky Educational Television on Monday night. \"It is a matter of genuine concern and it needs to be investigated.\" Still, McConnell said the issue should be investigated in \"regular order\" by the Senate intelligence panel, which is \"fully capable of handling this.\" McConnell's comments put him at odds with Arizona Sen. John McCain and other Republicans who have joined with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in calling for a special committee to investigate efforts by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in U.S. elections. A select committee is a high-profile panel created by congressional leaders that taps lawmakers from a variety of committees to focus on a single issue, such as Watergate or the Iran-contra arms deal. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Russian interference in the election threatens to \"destroy democracy,\" adding that a select committee is needed to find out exactly what Russia did and what effect it had on the election. \"We need to get to the bottom of this,\" McCain said. \"We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election.\" He said: \"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we have been totally paralyzed.\" Trump has called reports of Russian hacking \"ridiculous,\" and his transition team dismissed the CIA assessment, saying it was the work of the same people who claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invaded. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that the investigation must be bipartisan. \"We don't want this investigation to be political like the Benghazi investigation,\" he said. \"We don't want it to just be finger pointing at one person or another.\" Schumer added: \"We want to find out what the Russians are doing to our political system and what other foreign governments might do to our political system. And then figure out a way to stop it.\" McCain, Schumer and other senators say a select committee is needed to \"reconcile contradictory information\" and give the issue needed focus. In the interview with KET's Bill Goodman, McConnell spoke of his surprise at the election's outcome. \"I thought we'd come up short\" in the Senate, McConnell said. \"And I didn't think President Trump had a chance of winning.\" Trump won in part because he was able to connect with rural voters in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that had previously voted for Democrats, McConnell said. \"Trump was able to convey \u2014 oddly enough a message from a billionaire who lives in Manhattan \u2014 a genuine concern for people who felt kind of left off, who felt offended by all the political correctness they see around them,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Here are your chances. Doyle Rice , USA TODAY 5:26 p.m. EST December 20, 2016 The USA's fascination with a white Christmas dates back to 1942. when Bing Crosby first crooned the wistful song in the film Holiday Inn. (Photo: Jeff Goodman, Your Take) The Polar Vortex may have been a week early.\u00a0If you thought the recent Arctic blasts increased your chances\u00a0for a white Christmas, you may\u00a0be sorely disappointed. After a frigid couple of weeks across the eastern half of the U.S., a warmer shift is anticipated this week and into the upcoming holiday weekend, said\u00a0 AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Rossio. Still, it'll remain\u00a0cold enough in much of the western mountains, northern Plains, Upper Midwest, Great Lakes and interior sections of the Northeast to retain snow cover through the weekend, thereby securing\u00a0a white Christmas, the Weather Channel said . Following a blast of cold air, milder conditions will return to the East in time for Christmas: https://t.co/s0omSpkvTL pic.twitter.com/zhVgO18HL5 \u2014 AccuWeather (@breakingweather) December 20, 2016 More\u00a0snow is also forecast\u00a0to fall in some of those regions\u00a0this week from a pair of winter storms forecast to track across portions of the northern tier of the country. A quick-hitting system on Wednesday and Thursday will add a few more inches of snow from the northern Plains to northern New England,\u00a0but milder air will be quick to return for the weekend, said\u00a0AccuWeather meteorologist Max Vido. However, warmer\u00a0temperatures in the central and eastern U.S. will continue to erode the existing snow cover,\u00a0Vido added. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, temperatures should be above average for much of the eastern two-thirds of the nation, AccuWeather said. Places like New York City and Philadelphia will challenge 50 degrees. Across the South, temperatures will be mainly in the 60s and 70s. Christmas Day\u00a0travel troubles are possible in the central U.S. due to a storm that\u00a0will mainly bring rain to cities such as Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas. There is even a risk for severe thunderstorms across the south-central U.S. on Christmas Day, the Storm Prediction Center said . Only the northern Rockies and northern Plains will see additional snow Christmas Day. Blizzard conditions are possible in the Dakotas and northwest Minnesota, the Weather Channel said. A storm will bring snow, rain & wind to the central US this Christmas: pic.twitter.com/sHA0V4tu09 \u2014 AccuWeather (@breakingweather) December 20, 2016 Dreaming of a White Christmas? It need not snow Dec. 25 to fit the National Weather Service's definition of a white Christmas : There just needs to be at least 1 inch of snow on the ground. As of Tuesday, about 49% of the 48 contiguous U.S. states were snow-covered, mainly across the nation's northern tier, the weather service said. The USA's fascination with a white Christmas dates back to 1942, when Bing Crosby first crooned the wistful song in the film Holiday Inn. Written by Irving Berlin, the song's lyrics bring out a romanticized image of Christmases past, \"just like the ones I used to know.\" A second movie \u2014 White Christmas, also with Crosby \u2014 came out in 1954. Despite Crosby's wishes, only 25% to 30% of the 48 contiguous states are typically snow-covered by Christmas, according to AccuWeather. Looking for a surefire way to get a white Christmas? Head to Fairbanks, Alaska, which has seen snow on the ground every Christmas since weather record keeping began, according to data from NOAA's\u00a0National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). In the lower 48, your best shot is in\u00a0Minnesota;\u00a0Maine;\u00a0upstate New York;\u00a0the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania and West Virginia;\u00a0practically anywhere in Idaho;\u00a0and of course, the Rockies or the Sierra Nevada Mountains, NOAA said. Thundersnow hits Hawaii Historically, much of northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, most of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and a large portion of the Western mountain areas have a 90% or better chance of a white Christmas. Cities such as Marquette, Mich., or International Falls, Minn.,\u00a0have had snow on the ground almost every Christmas since weather record-keeping began, according to the NCEI. Some of the biggest cities with the best probability for a white Christmas, based on historical averages, include Minneapolis, Green Bay, Buffalo,\u00a0and Burlington, Vt.,\u00a0according to AccuWeather.

By Anthony Faiola,, Souad Mekhennet and Stephanie Kirchner December 20 at 3:19 PM Follow @smekhennet Follow stephi_says BERLIN \u2014 The German capital was on high alert Tuesday with one or more attackers still at large in a deadly truck assault on a Christmas market, an act claimed by the Islamic State that struck at the heart of Europe\u2019s Christian traditions. Chancellor Angela Merkel decried Monday\u2019s assault \u2014 in which a truck carrying a payload of steel plowed into festive stalls and fairgoers in Berlin, leaving 12 dead and dozens injured \u2014 as a presumed\u00a0\u201cterror attack,\u201d even as German police scrambled to find the culprit. The only suspect so far \u2014 a Pakistani asylum seeker taken into custody shortly after the bloodshed \u2014 was released by police Tuesday because of insufficient evidence. Late Tuesday, the Islamic State, through the affiliated Amaq news agency, claimed that the attacker was a\u00a0\u201csoldier\u201d responding to its call to target nations fighting the group in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has wielded the term before to describe lone wolves inspired by its rhetoric, and its level of involvement, if any, in coordinating the attack remained unclear.\u00a0 In Germany and across Europe, revulsion and angst over the strike at a symbol of the region\u2019s Christmas traditions sparked governments to act. The holiday spirit was being replaced by muscle. 1 of 30 A truck rams the crowd at Berlin Christmas market, killing at least 12 people View Photos Caption German authorities late Monday questioned a male suspect; possibility of terrorism being investigated. \u00a0Dec. 20, 2016 A firefighter stands beside the truck that plowed into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin. Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Italy said it would ramp up security for Christmas events, including Pope Francis\u2019s appearance at St. Peter\u2019s Square in Vatican City. The Czechs pledged \u201cmassive\u201d security at public events on Christmas and as the country rings in the new year. French officials said security at Christmas markets had been immediately reinforced, as its lawmakers observed a minute of silence for the all-too-familiar tragedy in Germany. In Berlin, meanwhile, the release of the only suspect left police scrambling for fresh leads in the assault. They accelerated efforts to study forensic evidence, including analysis of bloodstains within the cabin of the truck \u2014 turned into a weapon in a tactic used five months earlier in a similar holiday rampage in Nice, on France\u2019s southern coast. Investigation teams moved to piece together what they described as \u201ccircumstantial evidence,\u201d including witness descriptions and video footage. But no criminal sketches were released to the public, suggesting how much remained unknown. And as night settled over the German capital, Berliners were cautioned to stay on guard. \u201cIt is the case that we possibly still have a dangerous offender in our area,\u201d warned Berlin\u2019s police chief, Klaus Kandt. \u201cThese days it is necessary to be vigilant.\u201d [ After Berlin, security tightens at Christmas markets ] The attack, officials had concluded by Tuesday, was almost certainly deliberate. A Polish national was driving the truck when it left Poland en route to Berlin to deliver a cargo of steel. The driver was found shot dead in the passenger seat.\u00a0 45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized The modus operandi and target, officials said, indicated \u2014 but offered no confirmation \u2014 that Islamist extremists were involved.\u00a0 The Islamic State has previously cited traditional Christmas markets as viable targets in their wave of terrorism in Europe, and the Berlin assault was reminiscent of the truck-on-sidewalk tactic used by a self-proclaimed Islamic State adherent in Nice in July. That attack resulted in the deaths of 86 people on the Promenade des Anglais on Bastille Day. Rita Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, noted that the Islamic State\u2019s claim late Tuesday seemed unique. It is rare for the group to assert responsibility while the perpetrator is still alive. And unlike an official communique \u2014 such as those after attacks in Brussels and Paris \u2014 its claim through Amaq suggested, Katz said, \u201ca little more distance.\u201d She said it could indicate that one or more attackers were inspired by the Islamic State but \u201chad little to no coordination with the group.\u201d German officials were assessing the group\u2019s claim. \u201cThis alleged confession of the so-called Islamic State \u2014 in fact they are a terror gang \u2014 we only just received,\u201d\u00a0Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re told public broadcaster ARD.\u00a0\u201cWe should let the security authorities do their work.\u201d [ WorldViews: Trump cites holy war in Berlin even before facts are clear] For Berliners, who live in a place often billed as Europe\u2019s most progressive and hedonistic city, the struggle Tuesday boiled down to perseverance \u2014 retaining a grip on classic German stoicism in the face of unfolding horror. In a country that eschews displays of patriotism, the colors of the German flag lit up the Brandenburg Gate. Flags flew at half-staff.\u00a0 Late Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered near the attack site, around Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church \u2014 a symbol of the rebuilt, post-World War II Germany \u2014 to light candles, place flowers and listen to a service broadcast from within the house of worship. Gabi Meister, a 54-year-old clerk at a car manufacturer, clutched a pink rose with tears in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to show sympathy, because I\u2019m shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cBerlin is an open, cosmopolitan city. We won\u2019t let our tolerance be destroyed by this. . . . We all have to stand together now even more so, all religions, all cultures.\u201d\u00a0 [ In Nice truck rampage, experts see shift toward cruder acts of terrorism ] Merkel \u2014 who laid white roses at the attack site in the normally bustling plaza at Breitscheidplatz, in a chic shopping district in west Berlin \u2014 called on Germans not to give into fear as the holidays approached. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live with the fear of evil paralyzing us,\u201d said Merkel, dressed in black as she spoke in Berlin. \u201cWe will find the strength for a life as we want to live it in Germany \u2014 free, united and open.\u201d Earlier, Merkel spoke by phone with President Obama, who pledged U.S. aid in the German investigation. As of late Tuesday, only seven of those killed at the market had been identified \u2014 the Polish driver\u00a0and six Germans. German authorities, accused of mishandling other terrorism-related cases this year, were under mounting pressure to catch the culprit as questions arose about security measures at the market.\u00a0 [ With Europe\u2019s open borders, a potential pipeline for weapons ] That a threat existed was well known. The State Department issued a specific travel warning to Americans last month citing \u201ccredible information\u201d that Islamists were targeting holiday season events. Yet the Christmas market attacked Monday appeared to lack basic protections, such as concrete barriers, to ward off a Nice-like attack. \u201cWe cannot turn Christmas markets into fortresses,\u201d Kandt countered. By midday Tuesday, German authorities were losing confidence that they had caught the right suspect.\u00a0 The 23-year-old Pakistani had first arrived in Germany last December before coming to Berlin in February. During their investigation, police raided a refugee shelter housed in Berlin\u2019s old Tempelhof Airport, where the suspect lived. After the raid, officials backtracked until prosecutors issued orders to release him. \u201cThe forensic examinations that were carried out could not prove the presence of the accused in the driver\u2019s cab of the truck at the time of the crime so far,\u201d the prosecutors said in a statement.\u00a0 But the mere prospect of an asylum seeker\u2019s involvement fueled debate in Germany and beyond over Merkel\u2019s decision to allow in nearly a million migrants last year, many of them fleeing war in the Middle East.\u00a0 Merkel, acknowledging the possibility that a migrant might yet be involved, said it would be \u201cparticularly appalling to the many, many Germans who are actively helping refugees every day and to the many people who are indeed needing our protection and are making an effort to integrate in our country.\u201d Pundits were already speculating whether the latest attack could damage Merkel\u2019s reelection bid next year. Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany, tweeted: \u201cWhen will the German legal state strike back? When will this damned hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel\u2019s dead!\u201d The incident occurred as Germans have had to endure a growing threat of terrorism \u2014 including two small-scale attacks in July.\u00a0German officials appeared to bungle at least one major case. In October, Jaber Albakr, a 22-year-old Syrian asylum seeker suspected of plotting a bomb attack on a Berlin airport, evaded police for two days. After being caught, he hung himself in his jail cell, despite being placed on a 24-hour suicide watch. \u00a0Read more\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

    "text": "As Drug Overdose Deaths Escalate, Opioids Continue to Be the Top Killer By Gillian Mohney Dec 20, 2016, 3:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH As Drug Overdose Deaths Escalate, Opioids Continue to Be the Top Killer 0 Shares Email As the drug and opioid epidemic escalates in the U.S., a new study has identified the 10 drugs most associated with fatal overdoses. The study, published today in the National Vital Statics report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that more than 47,000 people in the U.S. died from drug overdoses in 2014 \u2014 an increase from more than 38,000 in 2010. Opioid drugs continue to be linked to the highest percentage of these deaths. The report may spur public health officials and other leaders to focus more on responding to the growing addiction and drug abuse problem, said Dr. Caleb Alexander, a co-director for the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness. The data \"should give patients and providers and policymakers pause,\" he said. \"They underscore the seriousness of the overdose epidemic.\" Canada Approves Prescription Heroin to Combat Opioid Crisis The study's researchers, from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Food and Drug Administration , found that the most frequently mentioned drugs on death certificates in fatal drug overdoses were multiple forms of opioids , stimulants and a class of drugs called benzodiazepines , often used to treat anxiety or insomnia . The researchers examined federal data from death certificates from 2010 to 2014. The 10 most abused drugs on those death certificates were listed in this order: heroin, oxycodone , methadone , morphine, hydrocodone, fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine and two benzodiazepines called alprazolam (a common brand name is Xanax) and diazepam (a common brand name is Valium). Despite work to combat rising numbers of fatal overdoses in the U.S. in recent years, deaths associated with all these drugs, except methadone, increased during the study period. However, the authors clarified, it is possible that some of the increase may be due to improvements in reporting on death certificates. Opioids remained the leading cause of overdose deaths, according to the period and data reviewed in the study, but the specific opioid drugs responsible for the fatal overdoses changed. From 2010 to 2011 oxycodone, a prescription drug , was the leading drug linked to overdose deaths. In the following years the illicit drug heroin caused the most drug overdose deaths. From 2010 through 2014, the number of drug overdose deaths per year increased nearly 23 percent, from 38,329 to 47,055, according to the CDC. In the same period, deaths associated with heroin use more than tripled, from 3,020 to 10,863. \"I think that these findings are important and another indication of just how serious of an issue this is,\" Alexander told ABC News today. \"Opioids are responsible for a disproportionate number of injuries and deaths,\" he said. \"It's only natural that policymakers and public health officials focus on opioids.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Four More Officials Charged With Felonies in Flint Water Crisis Debacle By Gillian Mohney Dec 20, 2016, 2:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Michigan AG Announces Charges Against 4 More Officials in Flint Water Crisis 0 Shares Email Today the Michigan attorney general filed felony charges against four former officials, including two emergency managers for Flint, Michigan, over their alleged roles in the water crisis in the city. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette charged the four officials with multiple felonies, including conspiracy to commit false pretenses and false pretenses over their roles in the crisis. Each of those charges carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. \"Flint deserves better. The people of Flint are not expendable,\" he said in a press conference today announcing the charges. \"People in positions of responsibility, who broke the law, must be held responsible.\" Schuette went on to say that the crisis has led some people in the community to use only bottled water for drinking and cleaning all their food. \"That's not normal, and that's not what Flint's future and expectation should be,\" he said. The Flint water crisis started after elevated lead levels were found in the city's water when it was drawing its supply from the Flint River in April 2014, after it disconnected from Detroit's municipal water system. The move was intended as a stopgap measure until the completion of a pipeline to Lake Huron as the source for Flint's municipal water. But it was later discovered that lead from Flint's old pipes was leaching into the water because of improper treatment of the more corrosive water from the Flint River. The city switched back to the Detroit water supply in October 2015, but residents are still advised to use filters out of an abundance of caution, and officials are continuing to monitor lead levels at multiple sites in the system. Charges filed today from Schuette's office were against Darnell Earley, a former emergency manager for Flint appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder , and Gerald Ambrose, a finance director who succeeded Earley. The two were charged in connection to the mandate to use the Flint Water Treatment Plant, before the plant was ready to effectively clean the water, according to a statement from Schuette. According to the attorney general's office, Earley and Ambrose allegedly claimed the bankrupt city needed to borrow tens of millions of dollars from the state because of an \"environmental calamity.\" However, the office added, the funding was intended not for an \"emergency cleanup of a retention pond,\" as the pair claimed, but for Flint's portion of the water pipeline project. The funding proposal included a requirement that the city use the Flint River as an interim water source and the Flint Water Treatment Plant. The two have also been charged with misconduct in office, a felony with a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and willful neglect of duty in office, a misdemeanor. Two other city officials have also been charged for their alleged roles in the crisis: Howard Croft, the former director of Flint's Department of Public Works, and Daugherty Johnson, who served as the utilities director for Flint's Department of Public Works. Schuette alleged that Croft and Johnson discouraged returning to the Detroit water system, required use of the Flint River water and put pressure on employees at the Flint Water Treatment Plant to start operations before the plant was safe to use. Thus far, 13 state and local officials have been charged in connection with the Flint water crisis, including the four charged today. \"When the deadline closed in, rather than sound the alarm, the defendants allegedly ignored warnings and test results and shut off the pipes pulling clean water from Detroit and turned on the Flint River valves,\" the statement from Schuette's office read. Despite improvements in lead levels, many in the city are wary of using tap water for drinking or even for bathing. Kenyatta Dotson, a resident and community activist who also works in local government, said in an interview earlier this month that none of her family members feel they can safely drink from a faucet. \"My kids won't drink from any faucet,\" she said, explaining that they've come to distrust tap water in general. \"They can't drink from any faucet, even in Alabama,\" Dotson said. \"It's devastating.\" She said the water crisis has so eroded trust in government that many feel hopeless that the situation will ever get better. \"I think people are trying to get to a place of hope,\" Dotson said. \"We're trying to get to a place where we see light at the end of the tunnel.\" 0 Shares ",

Neuroscientists say the specific areas that got pruned appear to be involved in understanding what other people are thinking or feeling. Men did not show the same changes. The bigger the changes, the more attachment the mother seemed to show toward her baby, the team reported. \u201cThese results indicate that pregnancy changes the gray matter architecture of the human brain and provide preliminary support for an adaptive process serving the transition into motherhood,\u201d they wrote. In other words, they help women become better mothers. Related: Having a baby after 35 linked to being mentally sharp later Hoekzema may have special knowledge of what she is talking about. She herself was pregnant while she was analyzing the data from the study. \"I do have the feeling that I am a different person,\" she told NBC News. I cannot pinpoint it and it would not be very scientific to use my own personal experiences,\" she added, laughing. She's pregnant again and says two of her colleagues also were pregnant during the study -- but worked hard to separate their own experiences from the study itself. There\u2019s another stage in life when the human brain is soaked in hormones and undergoes pruning. It comes right after puberty. The researchers note that cutting unneeded or unused brain connections helps the brain focus on what\u2019s important. At least one study has suggested that a failure to trim brain circuitry may underlie some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. \u201cSynaptic pruning in adolescence is generally regarded as an essential process of fine-tuning connections into functional networks and is thought to represent a refinement and specialization of brain circuitry, which is critical for healthy cognitive, emotional and social development,\u201d Hoekzema\u2019s team wrote. \u201cOn the basis of our results, we may speculate that the female brain undergoes a further maturation or specialization of the neural network subserving social cognition during pregnancy,\u201d they added. At least some studies have shown that pregnant women are better at recognizing faces and emotions of others, the team noted. Hoekzema says more work is needed to find out what is going on --perhaps comparing brain scans from adoptive mothers, or women who plan to have their babies adopted. That will help researchers determine if it's the hormonal changes of pregnancy, or perhaps changes that occur while caring for an infant, that are causing the brain reconstruction. ",

Mark Wilson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Darnell Earley, former emergency manager of Flint, Mich., at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in March. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Michigan's attorney general has announced felony charges against two former emergency managers of Flint, Mich., and two other former city officials. The charges are linked to the city's disastrous decision to switch water sources, ultimately resulting in widespread and dangerous lead contamination. \"All too prevalent in this Flint Water Investigation was a priority on balance sheets and finances rather than health and safety of the citizens of Flint,\" state Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a statement. Former Emergency Managers Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose were each charged with two felonies that carry penalties of up to 20 years \u2014 false pretenses and conspiracy to commit false pretenses \u2014 along with misconduct in office, also a felony, and willful neglect of duty in office, a misdemeanor. Howard Croft, who was Flint's director of the Department of Public Works, and Daugherty Johnson, who was the department's utilities director, were each charged with false pretenses and conspiracy to commit false pretenses. Earley and Ambrose each face a total of up to 46 years in prison. Croft and Johnson each face a total of up to 40 years in prison. Article continues after sponsorship This case is rooted in the city's decision to switch water sources, which it justified as a cost-saving measure. City officials decided in 2013 that they would end their contract with Detroit and build their own pipeline to connect to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). That pipeline wouldn't be operational before the original water source was set to be cut off, so officials turned to the Flint River as an interim source of water. They failed to treat the Flint River water with corrosion controls, damaging the city's pipes and causing lead to leach into the city's drinking water. But let's back up a few steps. These charges today are focused on the decision to switch to the KWA at a time when the city was deeply in debt. Controversial Emergency Manager Of Detroit's Public Schools Resigns The city was barred by state law from accumulating any more debt. Earley and Ambrose allegedly circumvented that law \u2014 and were able to borrow tens of millions of dollars \u2014 by arguing that the city faced an \"environmental calamity\" over a retention pond filled with lime sludge that needed emergency cleanup. \"The City of Flint ... used an exception to state law by claiming the bonds were needed to fund an emergency cleanup of a retention pond, when in fact the funds were intended to pay for the KWA,\" a statement from Schuette reads. \"This case is a classic bait-and-switch. ... The lime sludge lagoon was not an emergency,\" special prosecutor Todd Flood said, according to The Associated Press. After it became clear that the KWA pipeline wouldn't be ready in time, Earley implemented the switch to the Flint River . He is also accused of allowing \"the Flint Water Treatment Plant to produce water despite knowledge the plant was not ready for use, allowed Flint to enter into a contract requiring use of the Flint Water Treatment Plant during that time, and authorized false and misleading public statements that the water was safe to drink.\" Earley later became emergency manager of Detroit's public school system; he resigned earlier this year amid mounting criticism over poor conditions. Lead-Laced Water In Flint: A Step-By-Step Look At The Makings Of A Crisis Earley, Ambrose and Croft have not publicly commented on the charges. An attorney for Johnson told The Associated Press that his client is \"going to plead not guilty and we're going to stand by that.\" This is the third set of criminal charges brought by Michigan's attorney general over the Flint water crisis, bringing the total number of defendants to 13. A Year Later, Unfiltered Flint Tap Water Is Still Unsafe To Drink Schuette has his critics \u2014 they say he's \"grandstanding with no real results,\" as Michigan Radio reported . \"They point to the fact that Schuette is actively fighting against a federal court order to deliver bottled water to residents.\" If you're catching up on the crisis in Flint, check out our step-by-step look at how it unfolded. It has now been more than a year since the city's mayor declared a state of emergency in the city, and the water remains unsafe to drink without a filter . ",

The chief prosecutor of Mexico State, Alejandro Gomez, said 26 people were killed in the explosion that sent flames through the pyrotechnics booths at the open-air San Pablito Market in Tultepec, about 20 miles north of Mexico City. Isidro Sanchez, director of Tultepec's civil protection division, told a local TV station that there may be 27 dead. Mexican President\u00a0Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took to Twitter to offer\u00a0his condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the blast and wish\u00a0the injured a speedy recovery. Sirens wailed and a heavy scent of gunpowder lingered in the air after the afternoon blast at the market, where most of the fireworks stalls were completely leveled. The smoking, burned out shells of vehicles ringed the perimeter, and first responders and concerned local residents combed through the ashes. Firefighters hosed down still-smoldering hotspots. The Mexican Red Cross said it sent 10 ambulances with 50 paramedics. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Jean Shepard WTVF Police told the paper they responded to the home in Hendersonville around 3 a.m. Saturday and found the elderly man outside suffering from stab wounds. Inside, they found 21-year-old Travis Sanders dead from a gunshot wound. They also found 18-year-old found Icey Sloan-Hawkins, reportedly Birchfield\u2019s granddaughter, suffering from stab wounds. She was transported to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Police have not released a possible motive for the killings. But Sloan-Hawkins\u2019 mother, Velvet Sloan, told the paper her daughter started dating Sanders earlier this year but broke up with him after a turbulent relationship. She said the girl was living with her grandfather after the death in September of his wife Jean Shepard, a famed member of the Grand Ole Opry. Sloan said Sanders didn\u2019t live at the home. On Saturday, she said Birchfield heard the former couple fighting in the basement. Sanders attacked Birchfield with a knife, and Birchfield shot Sanders, Sloan told the paper. Birchfield was reportedly treated for his wounds and released from the hospital. Hendersonville police have not confirmed the account, or whether any charges will be filed, Detective Sgt. Jim Vaughn told the paper. \u00a0 Jean Shepard became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and last appeared in 2015, when she became the only woman to reach 60 years of Opry membership, reports CBS Nashville\u00a0affiliate WTVF. She died in September at the age of 82. In 2011, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Wilson after LAX takeoff FAA investigates aircraft incident John Antczak / Associated Press In this Nov. 27 photo, a plane takes off at Los Angeles International Airport. On Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said it is investigating another plane that flew north instead of south. In this Nov. 27 photo, a plane takes off at Los Angeles International Airport. On Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said it is investigating another plane that flew north instead of south. (John Antczak / Associated Press) Dan Weikel and Veronica Rocha Contact Reporter The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating an incident in which a passenger jet was given wrong directions\u00a0by traffic controllers and guided toward the San Gabriel Mountains, where it flew just hundreds of\u00a0feet higher than\u00a0the peak of Mt. Wilson before turning around, according to publicly available flight data. Bound for Taiwan, the EVA Air Boeing 777 took off to the east early Friday from Los Angeles International Airport\u2019s\u00a0south runway complex, according to FAA spokesman Ian Gregor. After takeoff, the air crew switched from the LAX control tower to the approach control operations in San Diego, which Gregor said was common practice. \u201cThe air traffic controller at the approach control who was handling EVA instructed the pilot to make a left turn to a 180-degree heading,\u201d he said. \u201cShe meant to tell the pilot to make a right\u00a0turn to a 180-degree heading.\u201d Following the controller\u2019s instructions, the pilot turned left. \u00a0 \u00a0 The move sent the plane in the wrong direction, Gregor said. Instead of flying south, the aircraft flew north toward the San Gabriel Mountains and an Air Canada jet that had departed from the north runway\u00a0complex at LAX. When the controller realized the mistake, she \u201ctook immediate action to keep EVA safely separated\u201d from the second aircraft as well as ground terrain, Gregor said. She issued the EVA pilot a series of instructions to help him turn south. \u201cThe controller wanted to make sure the EVA aircraft was safely above or away from nearby terrain,\u201d he said. The conversation between the pilot of EVA 015\u00a0and the controller was posted by VASAviation on Youtube. At one point during the flight, the controller asks the pilot, \u201cWhat are you doing? Turn southbound now.\u201d\u00a0 A graphic depiction of the aircraft\u2019s flight path, altitude and speed\u00a0on the website Flightradar24.com shows the plane turning north and flying over Pasadena toward the San Gabriel Mountains. Just five minutes after takeoff, the plane is hovering 5,000 feet over Eaton Canyon when it begins turning away from the mountain range and heading south. \u00a0 As\u00a0the aircraft banks\u00a0directly to the south of Mt. Wilson, it continues to gain altitude and appears to fly\u00a0between 500 and 800 feet higher than the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which stands roughly 5,710 feet high, according to the website data. The aircraft\u2019s lateral distance from the mountain peak appears to be between 500 and 600 meters.\u00a0 In a statement issued Tuesday, EVA Air said,\u00a0\u201cOur flight was never too close to other aircraft or to the mountains.\u201d The pilot of the aircraft\u00a0was directed to take off from Runway 7 and\u00a0complied with the air traffic controller\u2019s direction and speed instructions. \u201cEVA is working in full cooperation with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and related authorities in the investigation of this situation,\u201d the statement said. FAA regulations require that airliners be separated by at least 3 miles laterally, or 1,000 feet vertically. The regulations also require airliners to be at least 3 miles away laterally or 2,000 feet vertically above obstacles such as mountains. Asked whether the aircraft had violated those restrictions, Gregor said the FAA was looking into how high the aircraft was flying above the ground northeast of the airport. At least one Altadena resident reported hearing the low-flying plane, KABC-TV reported . \u201cThe question is how close did they come to the terrain?\u201d\u00a0said Jon Russell, an air transport pilot and the Western-Pacific regional safety coordinator for the Air Line Pilots Assn.\u00a0\u201cDid a terrain warning sound in the cockpit?\u201d FAA officials said Tuesday afternoon that they did not know whether such a warning occurred. The flight had 353 people on board, including five infants,\u00a0 an airline spokeswoman said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, Dec. 12, 2016. (Susan Walsh / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rejecting bipartisan calls for a special committee to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election, which American intelligence says was aimed in part at helping Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton . The likely meddling by Russia \"is a serious issue, but it doesn't require a select committee,\" said McConnell, R-Ky. The Senate intelligence committee is able to investigate the matter, he added. CIA Director John Brennan has said the intelligence community is in agreement that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, although there's no evidence Moscow succeeded in helping Trump win. \"There's no question that the Russians were messing around in our election,\" McConnell told Kentucky Educational Television on Monday night. \"It is a matter of genuine concern and it needs to be investigated.\" Still, McConnell said the issue should be investigated in \"regular order\" by the Senate intelligence panel, which is \"fully capable of handling this.\" McConnell's comments put him at odds with Arizona Sen. John McCain and other Republicans who have joined with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in calling for a special committee to investigate efforts by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in U.S. elections. Donald Trump 's first test has come even before he is sworn in, and so far he has responded with denial, equivocation and deflection. The test has come over Russia's brazen intrusion into... Presidents often are tested early, by unexpected crises or provocations by foreign adversaries. President-elect Donald Trump 's first test has come even before he is sworn in, and so far he has responded with denial, equivocation and deflection. The test has come over Russia's brazen intrusion into... (Dan Balz) A select committee is a high-profile panel created by congressional leaders that taps lawmakers from a variety of committees to focus on a single issue, such as Watergate or the Iran-contra arms deal. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Russian interference in the election threatens to \"destroy democracy,\" adding that a select committee is needed to find out exactly what Russia did and what effect it had on the election. \"We need to get to the bottom of this,\" McCain said. \"We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election.\" He said: \"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we have been totally paralyzed.\" Trump has called reports of Russian hacking \"ridiculous,\" and his transition team dismissed the CIA assessment, saying it was the work of the same people who claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invaded. The CIA assessment that Russia waged a cyber-campaign to help elect Donald Trump is based in part on intelligence suggesting that Moscow's hacking efforts were disproportionately aimed at targets tied to the Democratic Party and its nominee Hillary Clinton , U.S. officials said.

U.S. officials said... (Greg Miller, Adam Entous) Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that the investigation must be bipartisan. \"We don't want this investigation to be political like the Benghazi investigation,\" he said. \"We don't want it to just be finger pointing at one person or another.\" Schumer added: \"We want to find out what the Russians are doing to our political system and what other foreign governments might do to our political system. And then figure out a way to stop it.\" McCain, Schumer and other senators say a select committee is needed to \"reconcile contradictory information\" and give the issue needed focus. In the interview with KET's Bill Goodman, McConnell spoke of his surprise at the election's outcome. \"I thought we'd come up short\" in the Senate, McConnell said. \"And I didn't think President Trump had a chance of winning.\" Trump won in part because he was able to connect with rural voters in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that had previously voted for Democrats, McConnell said. \"Trump was able to convey \u2014 oddly enough a message from a billionaire who lives in Manhattan \u2014 a genuine concern for people who felt kind of left off, who felt offended by all the political correctness they see around them,\" he said.

Przybyla , USA TODAY 5:30 p.m. EST December 20, 2016 x Share Hillary Clinton says FBI Director James Comey and Russian President Vladimir Putin are to blame for her presidential election loss. Time In this Sept. 28, 2016, file photo, FBI Director James Comey testifies on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) x Share The FBI warrant on Hillary Clinton just before the election was granted without hard proof classified information was present. Video provided by Newsy Newslook WASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign\u00a0in its final two weeks has been unsealed, and the lawyer who requested it says it offers \"nothing at all\" to merit the agency's actions leading up to the Nov. 8 election. The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy\u00a0Schoenberg, who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer might be incriminating to Clinton. Weiner is the estranged husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin. Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented. The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected \u201cnon-content header information\u201d suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already-completed investigation of Clinton's private email server. The FBI request concludes there is \u201cprobable cause to believe\u201d that the laptop contained \u201cevidence, contraband, fruits and/or items illegally possessed,\u201d without providing specifics. \"I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between\" Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown \"why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,\" he said. \"I am appalled.\" The FBI's Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg's complaints Tuesday. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the \"unsealed filings regarding Huma's emails reveals Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time.\" Read more: FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton's email The FBI concluded in July that there was no \u201cclear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws\u201d and that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d Then, two weeks before the election, Comey\u00a0sent a three-paragraph letter to Congress that said\u00a0in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d to\u00a0Clinton\u2019s private email server. Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was \u201csignificant.\u201d The letter was so vague that Clinton\u2019s opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump, including his\u00a0past treatment of women. Trump called it \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d and predicted that the FBI would \"right the ship\" after previously deciding against criminal charges. Comey\u2019s investigation was the primary cudgel\u00a0for Trump and his supporters, who claimed \u2014\u00a0falsely \u2014\u00a0that Clinton was guilty of \u201ccriminal\u201d activity. His large rallies regularly chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d and Clinton\u2019s motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signs. Hillary Clinton walks off the stage after speaking about her election defeat in New York on Nov. 9, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) Abedin\u2019s lawyers have also been requesting permission to review the warrant, which they say their client never saw and hadn\u2019t or even been alerted to, preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign.\u00a0Two days before the election, Comey confirmed there was no new information. At the same time, Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.,\u00a0accused him of holding back \u201cexplosive\u201d information about Russian interference. The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits \u201cactivity directed towards the success or failure\u201d of a candidate. On Monday, former president Bill Clinton said his wife \u201cfought through everything, and she prevailed against it all.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t endure the combination of the FBI\u2019s interference and Russian meddling. At the end, \u201cwe had the Russians and the FBI deal. But she couldn\u2019t prevail against that,\u201d Clinton told reporters in Albany. Read more: Newly certified Trump feuds with Bill Clinton Republicans have mocked the Clintons\u2019 contention and said it\u2019s an excuse for some of the strategic mistakes the campaign made. Yet the election was decided by the smallest of margins in a handful of Rust Belt states. Nate Silver, a leading elections statistician and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, says \u201c Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race \"\u00a0and that she \u201cwould almost certainly be president-elect if the election had been held\u201d the day before the letter. He cited late-deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest. \"The FBI agent\u2019s name has not been disclosed, but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his/her name and determine what the motivations were, since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime,\" he said in a follow-up email. \u00a0\"It was very wrong for Director Comey to give that impression.\" Schoenberg is a lawyer who gained notoriety by reclaiming Jewish-owned art seized by the Nazis and former president of the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust.

Caption An AP photographer covering the Russian ambassador\u2019s remarks captured his last moments. \u00a0Dec. 19, 2016 Turkish police secure the area near an art gallery where Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, was fatally shot Monday. Umit Bektas/Reuters By David Filipov , Kareem Fahim and Adam Entous December 20 at 11:58 AM Follow @davidfilipov Follow @kfahim MOSCOW \u2014\u00a0A team of Russian detectives arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to join the investigation into the slaying of Moscow\u2019s\u00a0ambassador by a Turkish police officer \u2014 an act portrayed by both countries as an effort to rupture a rapprochement between the two regional powers backing opposite sides in Syria\u2019s civil war. The attack Monday also touched off sweeps across Turkey as authorities hunted for clues in the life of the 22-year-old gunman, who decried the violence in Syria after pumping several bullets into the ambassador at a photo exhibit. Russia is a key ally of Syria\u2019s government, while Turkey has been a stalwart backer of rebel factions, although both nations have worked together on a plan to evacuate civilians and opposition fighters from their last enclave in the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo. Their partnership has effectively sidelined the United States from the diplomatic efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis, and on Tuesday in Moscow, Russia and Turkey, along with Iran, declared their intention to\u00a0secure a ceasefire. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Officer Mevlut Mert Altintas gunned down Ambassador Andrei Karlov as the diplomat spoke before an exhibition of Russian photos at an art gallery in the Turkish capital of Ankara. After killing the ambassador, Altintas, an officer with the riot police, denounced Russia\u2019s role in the Syrian war, screaming: \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo! Don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d\u00a0He was later killed in a gun battle with the police.\u00a0 (Nicki DeMarco,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) The assassination, which was captured\u00a0 in stunning detail by an Associated Press photographer and other journalists, brought into sharp relief the violent worldwide reverberations of Syria\u2019s bloody civil war. The\u00a0ambassador\u2019s killing has also shocked Turkey, adding to a string of recent militant attacks and political turmoil that have hurt the economy and increasingly isolated the country. \u00a0 \u201cI believe that every person who is going to Turkey should think twice before doing so, because terror attacks have been happening there on a practically daily basis,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov told reporters in Moscow.\u00a0 Turkey\u00a0remained on edge on Tuesday, as authorities detained relatives of Altintas and searched his family home in the Soke district, in the west of the country, Turkish media reported. In what appeared to be a separate incident, a man fired shots near the entrance of the U.S. embassy in Ankara overnight. A State Department official said that no one was hurt. \u00a0 Turkey\u2019s semiofficial Anadolu News Agency said that the embassy gunman, who was identified only as Sahin S, fired several shots in the air with a pump-action rifle he had hidden under his coat early Tuesday.\u00a0 He was detained and was being questioned, the news agency said.\u00a0The embassy, as well as the U.S. consulates in Istanbul and Adana, were closed on Tuesday because of the shooting, according to a State Department statement. \u00a0\u00a0 [ Turkish police officer, invoking Aleppo, guns down Russian ambassador in Ankara ] \u00a0Karlov regularly traveled around Ankara without police protection, an unusual decision given the heightened level of threat in the country since an attempted coup in July and a string of terrorist attacks by militant groups, Turkish officials said. While the shooting probe was still in its early stages, investigators are raising the possibility of links between Altintas and a shadowy movement led by Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish preacher who lives in Pennsylvania, according to a senior Turkish official.\u00a0 Erdogan has accused the movement of mounting the failed coup in July, and since then, Turkish officials have frequently implicated the group in various plots to destabilize Turkey. Thousands of suspected Gulenists have been dismissed or suspended from state institutions, as part of a wide-ranging purge by Erdogan that has also swept up political opponents and journalists viewed as too critical of the government. \u00a0 Gulen\u00a0has denied involvement in the coup, and he released a statement on Monday condemning the killing of Karlov. The Turkish official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said investigators had preliminary information suggesting that Altintas had entered a police college in 2012, after getting referrals from suspected Gulenists. Altintas also took two days off from work on the day of the attempted coup and then traveled to Ankara, the official said. \u00a0 He was allowed to carry a weapon into the event with Karlov because he was carrying a police identification, officials said.\u00a0There was not yet any\u00a0evidence to suggest that Altintas belonged to any radical Islamic groups, such as the Islamic State or the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliated group, investigators said. [ The assassination of Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey creates a crisis for Erdogan ] At the time of the shooting, the Turkish foreign minister was on a plane en route to Russia to take part in the meeting with his Iranian and Russian counterparts. The Kremlin has cast the assassination as an attempt by outside forces to sunder ties between Russia and Turkey, but the meeting in the Russian capital on Tuesday served as a reminder of Russia\u2019s growing influence in the region \u2013 at the expense of the United States.\u00a0 Russia, Iran and Turkey said they were ready to help broker a Syrian peace deal after the foreign ministers and defense ministers held a series of meeting on Tuesday. The countries issued a statement, which Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu called the \u201cMoscow Declaration,\u201d that called for an expanded ceasefire for which Russia, Turkey and Iran would act as the guarantors.\u00a0 \u201cIran, Russia and Turkey are ready to facilitate the drafting of an agreement, which is already being negotiated, between the Syrian government and the opposition, and to become its guarantors,\u201d the declaration said. The three countries \u201chave invited all other countries with influence over the situation on the ground to do the same.\u201d\u00a0 Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, hailed the joint initiative as a way to \u201covercome the stagnation in efforts on the Syrian settlement,\u201d a dig at the United States, which was absent from the Moscow meetings.\u00a0 Shoigu said that Russia, Iran and Turkey were the only powers able to make a difference in Syria. \u201cAll previous attempts by the United States and its partners to agree on coordinated actions were doomed to failure,\u201d Shoigu said. \u201cNone of them wielded real influence over the situation on the ground.\u201d Putin's involvement in Syria has significant geopolitical meaning, as a way for Moscow to project power and have a foothold in the Middle East. Putin has cast Russia as protector of legitimate leaders against the turmoil caused by rebellions, and criticized the United States and its support for Assad\u2019s opponents. In a further effort to cement his influence on the Syrian peace process, Putin has said he and Erdogan were trying to organize a new series of negotiations \u2013 without the involvement of the United States or the United Nations \u2013 in Astana, Kazakhstan.

The push to deny Trump the requisite 270 electors and send the election to the House of Representatives seemingly was doomed from the start, though it received significant media attention. In the end, only two Republican electors broke ranks \u2013 more defected on the Democratic side from Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 What comes next for anti-Trumpers isn't entirely clear. Some are preparing to attack him over his business ties, while the \"I\" word already is being bandied about.\u00a0 Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore tried to crowdsource ideas after the Electoral College flop, asking, \u201cHe's not president for four and a half weeks. Next idea?\u201d\u00a0 He's not president for four and a half weeks. Next idea? \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) December 20, 2016 The Hamilton Electors \u2013 the group of electors behind the push to deny Trump 270 votes \u2013 published a statement Monday indicating their fight was not over, urging supporters to \"stay tuned.\" \u201cHamilton Electors hope this watershed moment will lay the groundwork for the emerging grassroots resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d the statement read. Our response. More to come.  Please stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/3SisGIM6y5 \u2014 Hamilton Electors (@HamiltonElector) December 20, 2016 Texas Republican elector Chris Suprun, who voted for Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Monday, hinted that a push for Trump's impeachment could be in the works. \u201cAs a person who has always played fast and loose with the law, Trump will likely be impeached within the first year of his Presidency by responsible Republicans in Congress. For the rest of us Americans, his presence in the Oval Office represents a crisis for the Constitution, the economy and the country,\u201d he said in the statement. Republican lawmakers and mainstream conservative voices for the most part have indicated they're ready to work with Trump. Some were buoyed by conservative picks in his Cabinet such as Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., for Health and Human Services secretary and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general.\u00a0 President Obama and Hillary Clinton, too, signaled immediately after the election that Democrats should give Trump a chance.\u00a0 But some Trump critics remain, if nothing else, on high alert for any constitutional violations from the Trump presidency. Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin tweeted Tuesday what he called a \u201ccall to action\u201d from Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, a former Bush speechwriter. Gerson called on citizens to defend the legislature and judiciary from \u201cany encroachment,\u201d and defend people from \u201corganized oppression, including Muslims and refugees.\u201d A call to action from principled conservative @MJGerson during the Trump years: \"Defend every group of people.\" https://t.co/ppUt4dpeD0 pic.twitter.com/mhRnVTlm1E \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) December 20, 2016 With Trump's inauguration now inevitable, his foes may turn next to battling his Cabinet picks. \u00a0 Some dissent has been bubbling over the choice of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of State, with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., warning that Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Russia is \u201ca matter of concern for me.\u201d\u00a0 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other Democratic allies also are eyeing a fight over Trump\u2019s business interests. Last week, five Democratic senators including Warren announced they would introduce legislation to require Trump to divest assets that could be a conflict of interest, and put them into a blind trust. Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Md., Chris Coons, D-Del., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., are all backing the bill, which would deem a violation of conflict-of-interest laws \u201ca high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d \"The American people do not want the President encumbered by conflicts of interest that put him in violation of the Constitution or US law,\" Cardin said in a statement. This isn\u2019t the only sign Democratic lawmakers are gearing up for an impeachment threat sometime in the future. Politico reported Wednesday that House Democrats have held a mock hearing on Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest, using staging, television cameras and testimony from witnesses. The narrative that Trump could run afoul of the Emoluments Clause -- which bars government officials from receiving gifts from foreign states -- is gaining support from some progressive voices. GQ\u2019s Keith Olbermann said in a video that Trump is a \u201cmoving, breathing conflict of interest who will likely be guilty of impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors within hours if not minutes of his inauguration.\u201d Olbermann went one step further, advising Americans: \"Never address Trump as president. He is Trump. Just Trump. Never president.\"\u00a0 Former 2000 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader also wrote an open letter (published in the Huffington Post ) earlier this month telling Trump to divest or face impeachment. \u201cThe only appropriate response is to completely divest on December 15 and therefore avoid potentially becoming a walking Article of Impeachment beginning on January 20,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Republican officials, meanwhile, argue it's time for those fighting his presidency to stand back.\u00a0 After the Electoral College decision on Monday, RNC Co-Chair Sharon Day said in a statement: \u201cThis historic election is now officially over and I look forward to President-elect Trump taking the oath of office in January. Our unified Republican government will hit the ground running next year so we can deliver real change and make America great again.\u00a0For the good of the country, Democrats must stop their cynical attempts to undermine the legitimacy of this election, which Donald Trump won decisively in the Electoral College with more votes than any Republican since 1988.\u201d\u00a0 Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Paul Farhi December 20 at 2:58 PM Follow @farhip Ed Schultz used to be the bombastic lefty host of a syndicated radio show and daily MSNBC program. He befriended Hillary Clinton, called Donald Trump \u201c a racist \u201d for his birther views, and once beseeched God to take Dick Cheney \u201cto the promised land. \u201d In 2014, he ripped Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s \u201cnasty\u201d human rights record . He also torched American conservatives for siding with the Russian president as a counter to President Obama. \u201cPutie is their new hero, \u201d sneered Schultz. But the times have changed. And so has Ed Schultz. In mid-2015, MSNBC handed Schultz his last paycheck . After six years on the air, the ratings of his daily program, \u201cThe Ed Show,\u201d were soft and MSNBC was going for more news in Schultz\u2019s time slot, not opinion. His daily radio show had ended the previous year. So Schultz went back to his lakefront home in Detroit Lakes, Minn., and took stock. At 61, after a lifetime in broadcasting, he concluded he wasn\u2019t done. In early 2016, he returned to television , albeit in an unlikely place and role for a guy who once styled himself as a \u201cprairie populist.\u201d He became the lead news anchor for RT America, the domestic network of what was once known as Russia Today, a globe-spanning multimedia organization funded by the Russian government. Schultz, in other words, went to work for \u201cPutie.\u201d The transition would require a bit of adjustment. Schultz now hosts RT America\u2019s signature evening newscast, \u201cNews With Ed Schultz,\u201d produced in a studio located three blocks from the White House. Schultz is the American face \u2014 ruddy, beefy, with a megaphone voice \u2014 of a Moscow-based media organization that reports the news a little differently than CNN or NBC. \u201cGood evening, friends,\u201d Schultz boomed on his program one recent evening before swiftly segueing into \u201cthe alleged hacking\u201d of the presidential election by Russia. Schultz skipped the latest details , such as President Obama\u2019s views on the matter or the consensus among American intelligence agencies about the extent of Russian meddling. Instead he went straight to Ed Schultz\u2019s view of the matter: \u201cThis has become a lifeline for Clinton supporters in an effort to reverse the outcome of the election. . . . In the meantime, the story has entered the arena of outrageous.\u201d Schultz quickly threw to a recorded package, in which RT America reporter Alexey Yaroshevsky wondered how long the \u201cspiraling downfall of sanity\u201d over hacking in the U.S. media would continue. \u201cUntil the public sees forensic evidence, if such exists at all, these accusations should carry as much weight as online humor,\u201d Yaroshevsky reported. Next up: A Schultz-led panel discussion of Trump\u2019s appointment of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and Tillerson\u2019s ties to Putin. \u201cWhy is [Tillerson\u2019s] business relationships and successes with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the business world and in the energy industry, why is that a negative on Capitol Hill?\u201d he asked the panel, almost pleading. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a positive thing that he knows Putin?\u201d *** RT, whose slogan is \u201cQuestion More,\u201d arrived in Washington in 2010, five years after being launched in Moscow by its founder, Margarita Simonyan, at the time a 25-year-old state journalist. Simonyan, who remains RT\u2019s editor in chief, was also a member of Putin\u2019s re-election staff in 2012. Schultz, now 62, is one of several Americans who appear on the domestic channel. Others include former New York Times reporter Chris Hedges, who hosts \u201cOn Contact ,\u201d a weekly interview show featuring \u201cdissident voices\u201d; Max Keiser, who has a financial program; and Tyrel Ventura, co-host of public-affairs show called \u201cWatching the Hawks \u201d and the son of former Minnesota governor and RT personality Jesse Ventura. RT America has broad distribution via the Internet, but virtually no presence on cable; only 19 cable systems ( out of 5,208 nationwide ) carry the channel. Nevertheless, RT claimed this year that it had a weekly TV audience of more than 8 million in the United States , a questionable figure given its limited cable carriage. Schultz, who once said on MSNBC that Putin is \u201ccrippling\u201d his country , now has a Russo-friendly, or perhaps American-skeptical, viewpoint on any number of issues on his RT program. So do most of the guests he interviews. The crisis in the Syrian city of Aleppo, besieged by Syrian and Russian military forces? Apparently, it\u2019s the United States\u2019 fault: \u201cYou\u2019ve got [Secretary of State] John Kerry supposedly trying to find the peace while the U.S. is being an arms dealer right into the city of Aleppo,\u201d said Schultz on Dec. 8. Fake online news, allegedly generated by Russian sources? Schultz, a North Dakotan who once considered running for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, thinks it\u2019s all \u201cfear and hype\u201d by the American news media and a smear by the Democratic Party, especially Clinton. \u201cIf they [the American media] want to go after fake news, they can start with the Clinton campaign and their accusations\u201d about Russian involvement, he said on a broadcast in September. RT America\u2019s approach to the news makes some American officials and foreign-policy observers wonder: Is it merely \u201can alternative voice,\u201d as it likes to say, or something more sinister? Stanford professor Michael McFaul , the former American ambassador to Russia, calls RT \u201can instrument of the Russian state. Their mission is to advance the mission of Mr. Putin and the [Russian] government.\u201d By mimicking the look and feel of an American newscast \u2014 even to the extent of permitting an occasional dissent from the Kremlin-centric line \u2014 RT is trying to \u201cdisguise\u201d its real intent, he said. And Schultz is part of the strategy, says McFaul. \u201cThey put on a lot of Americans as hosts and journalists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to obfuscate and confuse people about it being a government entity.\u201d Schultz, a former college quarterback and sportscaster, rebutted the notion that he or RT America were mouthpieces for the Kremlin. He blamed the news media \u2014 and Clinton. \u201cThe Clinton camp is trying to do all it can to connect Donald Trump to Putin,\u201d he said during a phone interview in early September. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to cast anyone on RT in a negative light. I think it\u2019s deplorable. We\u2019re journalists. We\u2019re fair. We have correspondents all over the world. Yes, part of our funding comes from the government. But so does the BBC. So does the Canadian Broadcasting Network. The mainstream depiction of RT is a travesty. It\u2019s dishonest.\u201d A follow-up question: How does Schultz square his liberal r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with his current embrace of a Kremlin-friendly outfit like RT? That question will have to wait. Schultz agreed to another interview in mid-October, and even sounded eager about it. But when a reporter came to RT\u2019s Washington office on the appointed day, he was intercepted in the lobby by a network representative. The interview, she said without explanation, was off. Reporters from Politico and the Daily Beast got the same treatment this year. Their interviews with Schultz were canceled at the last minute, too. Fast-forward to early December. Schultz sounded eager about talking again but deferred final approval to an RT spokeswoman, Tiffany Evans. A few days later, Evans declined via email. *** The RT gig marks another twist in Schultz\u2019s long and winding broadcast career. Schultz began as a radio and TV sportscaster on stations in North Dakota after his days as a football player culminated with tryouts with the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets. In the mid-1990s, he began a second line, hosting a political-talk show on a Fargo radio station. Schultz was no liberal then. As the Los Angeles Times once described it, \u201cBig Eddie,\u201d as he was known, would scoff at local Democratic officials and deride the homeless. \u201cHow about getting a job?\u201d he\u2019d ask on the air. But the budding Rush Limbaugh underwent a stunning political conversion a few years later, switching from conservative talk-show host to a fiery liberal one. Schultz attributed the conversion to his wife, Wendy Noack, a psychiatric nurse who worked in a Fargo homeless shelter and later became his radio producer. Schultz\u2019s longtime friend from Fargo, Don Haney, thinks the transition was sincere. \u201cThe change was gradual, but Ed really meant it,\u201d says Haney, an anchor and reporter at KFGO-AM, Schultz\u2019s old station. But others suspected that Schultz merely smelled an opportunity for counterprogramming in a field dominated by conservatives. In any case, Schultz-the-liberal was no less subtle than his conservative persona. He taunted Limbaugh for his drug addiction and tore into President George W. Bush as an enemy of \u201cthe working stiff\u201d (later on, in 2011, he apologized after calling conservative radio host Laura Ingraham \u201ca right-wing slut\u201d on his radio program). But this second guise was Schultz\u2019s most successful. Backed by donations from Democrats, Schultz took his radio program into national syndication in 2004. \u201cThe Ed Schultz Show\u201d eventually reached about 100 stations, including those in big cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington. Among those who came calling was the senator from New York, Hillary Clinton; she sat for several interviews with him and described him as \u201ca personal friend.\u201d MSNBC hired him in 2009, just as President Obama took office. Brent Budowsky , a columnist for the Hill newspaper and an irregular guest on Schultz\u2019s program, says he still views Schultz \u201cas a strong voice for progressive populism.\u201d Even so, he says, RT promotes the interests of the Russian government, sometimes moving into outright \u201cpropaganda.\u201d Budowsky calls Schultz \u201ca good man in a difficult spot.\u201d But perhaps a comfortable one, too. In October, Haney saw his old friend again when they traveled to Des Moines to interview Bernie Sanders. They flew there on Schultz\u2019s newly purchased jet, whose previous owner was golf legend Arnold Palmer. lifestyle ",

    "text": "(Tribune news services) Numerous German media reported that the suspect, who was picked up about 1\u00bd miles from the crash site, was a Pakistani citizen. Footage showed the suspect, his head covered in a white sheet, being pushed into a police car shortly after the attack. Berlin's public radio station RBB-Inforadio cited security sources saying the man entered Germany on Dec. 31, 2015. News agency dpa, also citing unnamed security sources, said he came to Germany as a refugee in February 2016. Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the man was known to police for minor crimes. Police declined to comment on the reports, referring questions to federal prosecutors who said they would hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon. But Merkel, who has been criticized for allowing in large numbers of migrants, addressed head-on the possibility that an asylum-seeker was responsible. \"I know that it would be particularly hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that a person committed this act who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\" Merkel said. \"This would be particularly sickening for the many, many Germans who work to help refugees every day and for the many people who really need our help and are making an effort to integrate in our country.\" Truck runs into crowded Christmas market in Berlin A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in the center of Berlin on Monday evening killing at least nine people, and causing multiple injuries, police said. (Video credit Greg Foreman \u2013 www.periscope.tv/ltzgohawks) A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in the center of Berlin on Monday evening killing at least nine people, and causing multiple injuries, police said. (Video credit Greg Foreman \u2013 www.periscope.tv/ltzgohawks) See more videos A spokesman for Berlin's office for refugee affairs said police conducted a large-scale search overnight at a large shelter for asylum-seekers at the city's now-defunct Tempelhof airport. Four men in their late 20s were questioned but nobody was arrested, Sascha Langenbach told The Associated Press. Among the dead was a man in the truck, who succumbed as paramedics treated him, Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said. Police said later that the man was a Polish national, but didn't give further details of who he was or what happened to him. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. Germany has not so far experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. Far-right groups and a nationalist party seized on Monday's attack, blaming Merkel. \"Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,\" Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party, wrote. Manfred Weber, a member of Merkel's conservative bloc and leader of the European Parliament's biggest political grouping, cautioned against sweeping verdicts but said it was important to ensure that extremists didn't enter the country. \"The state must be able to check every refugee who comes here,\" he told German public broadcaster ARD. French Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux expressed his sympathy after the attack. \"We are all Berliners today,\" he told Europe-1 radio Tuesday. \"In this type of situation, we need unity to face down terrorists, and on this occasion we need European unity. It must be strong, particularly strong.\" The White House condemned \"what appears to have been a terrorist attack.\" It came less than a month after the U.S. State Department warned that extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events\" in Europe. The German government said Merkel spoke Tuesday with President Barack Obama, who expressed his condolences. The Islamic State group and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ready to help in the investigation and response. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump Islamic extremists must be \"eradicated from the face of the earth\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \"freedom-loving partners.\" Berlin's mayor, Michael Mueller, planned to hold a news conference on the attack at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT). The archbishop of Berlin, Heiner Koch, said he would hold prayers for the victims at the St. Hedwig Cathedral at noon. ",

With Christmas days away, nearly every member of the Senate Democratic Media Center has been fired, a senior Democratic aide confirmed to Fox News. Schumer swung the axe on Friday, according to Politico , which first obtained \u201cgoodbye\u201d emails from staffers, including some with decades' experience. The move comes amid plans to revamp the unit, which handles video content, in an effort to help the Senate Democratic caucus get their message out in the New Year. The party not only lost the presidential race, it failed to capture the Senate or House and lost state legislative races throughout the country. Someone isn't in the holiday spirit: @SenSchumer fires video unit staff @Politico @burgessev https://t.co/AuSftNGsL4 \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) December 20, 2016 Critics, including some within the party, say the party has become dominated by East and West coast elites who can't connect with working class folks in the country's interior. A senior democratic aide told FoxNews.com that Schumer decided Senate Democrats would need to produce sharper, more creative digital content. \u201cAs a result, we are bringing in new people with expertise in digital videos and content for Facebook, Twitter, and other social media,\u201d a senior democratic aide told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe mission of the revamped SDMC will be to produce more content to make content more creative and catchy, and to do so faster than we\u2019ve been able to in the past.\u201d The timing could not be worse, given the holidays. But the 115th Congress begins just two days after the New Year, and Schumer apparently wanted to start fresh, and hit the ground running.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on personnel decisions,\u201d a spokesman from the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC), which serves as an advisory board to the Democratic Leadership in which Sen. Schumer will serve, told FoxNews.com in an email. The aide would not share the number of employees fired, or the official number of employees working at the Senate Democratic Media Center. A Republican Senate aide called the timing \"brutal.\" \u201cJob creation has never been a strength of the Democrats,\u201d a Republican aide told FoxNews.com. \u201cBut firing staffers just days before the holidays so they can play catch-up is pretty brutal.\u201d Advertisement ",

It was only two months ago when the authorities in the state of Saxony failed to catch a dangerous suspect who was preparing bombs in his apartment and arrested him only after three plucky Syrians caught the man, who then committed suicide in custody. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond politics, the assault made plain that Germany, like France and Belgium, is now a primary European target for mass terror attacks. On Tuesday evening, the Islamic State issued a statement through its Amaq news agency describing the driver of the truck as \u201ca soldier.\u201d But the group offered no other details about the driver\u2019s identity, or whether he had directly interacted with it or was just sympathetic to it. The day began with what seemed to be a breakthrough, as the authorities announced that they were interrogating a 23-year-old Pakistani asylum seeker, arrested the previous night, who arrived in Germany last December. Yet within hours, doubts arose that he was the perpetrator, and by evening the federal prosecutor said the man had been released because there was no evidence linking him to the crime. An examination of the cab of the truck turned up no sign that he had been in it, the prosecutor said. Video Merkel: \u2018This Is a Very Difficult Day\u2019 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that, for now, it must be assumed that a truck's plowing into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday night, killing 12 people, was an act of terrorism. By REUTERS. Photo by Tobias Schwarz/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed The attack came at a precarious moment in Germany, amid concerns about Russian meddling in domestic politics and a still angry populist backlash against Ms. Merkel over her decision to open the German border to nearly a million migrants and refugees in 2015. Across Europe on Tuesday, where the threat of terrorism is now a factor in daily life, a familiar anxiety seemed evident in some major cities. Central Rome appeared oddly empty only days after shoppers had filled many streets. In Berlin, several hundred people attended an emotional service held between the wooden stalls of the Christmas market, located beside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a symbolic site whose spire, jagged from bomb damage, was intentionally left unrepaired after World War II. Among those who came were a group of 60 to 70 members of a local mosque. \u201cWe wanted to show our solidarity,\u201d said Hasnen Ahmad, a member of the group, \u201cand that our community stands for peace.\u201d Throughout the day, the German authorities expanded their investigation, even as they offered few details and apparently made fewer breakthroughs. At one point, the authorities pleaded with the public to turn over any videos or other evidence taken from the market during the attack. A basic chronology did emerge: The attacker first hijacked a heavy truck belonging to a Polish company that was en route to Berlin bearing a load of steel girders. At some point, he apparently killed the driver and then, with the body still in the cab, sped east past Berlin\u2019s Zoo Station and onto Budapester Strasse, a main thoroughfare. Around 8 p.m. Monday, the driver swerved off the street and plowed through the Christmas market, steering between the rows of temporary wooden stands, which typically sell items such as handmade Christmas ornaments or mulled wine. Like most Christmas markets in Germany, this one was packed with shoppers, who suddenly tried to flee in horror.

Credit Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters German officials are normally tight-lipped about high-profile investigations, preferring to withhold any information until they have clear answers. Little was known about the 12 victims of the attacks, or about the wounded, though an Italian and an Israeli may have been among the victims. Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, an Italian transportation specialist who has been living in Germany for three years, was missing and her father feared the worst after her cellphone and transit pass were found near the market. \u201cWe are here with my wife, waiting for the DNA results,\u201d Gaetano Di Lorenzo told Corriere della Serra, an Italian newspaper. \u201cWe are waiting for confirmation, but I am not deluding myself.\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the attack \u201cmay have claimed the life of an Israeli citizen,\u201d a reference to a missing woman, Dalia Elkayam, whose husband, Rami Elkayam, was injured in the episode. Ariel Zurawski, the head of the Polish company that owned the truck, said the man found dead inside the cab was his cousin Lukasz, who was 37 and married with a child. Mr. Zurawski said that Lukasz had been driving a shipment of construction materials to Berlin from Italy and that he had identified him from police photographs of the dead man. German officials declined to give further information on the victim. The arrest of the Pakistani suspect came after a witness told the police that he had seen a suspect jump from the truck. The witness tried to follow him through a nearby park to where he was arrested. Video Witness Describes Fatal Crash At Berlin Market A truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday evening, leaving at least twelve people dead and many more injured, according to the police.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb Political opponents of Ms. Merkel quickly seized on his status as an asylum seeker to renew their criticism that her migration policies had made Germany vulnerable to terrorism \u2014 before the man was cleared of suspicion. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cGermany is no longer safe,\u201d declared Frauke Petry, the leader of the Alternative for Germany party. Noting the successive terrorist attacks in France, including the Nice attack in July , Ms. Petry called the carnage at the Berlin market \u201cnot just an attack on our freedom and our way of life, but also on our Christian tradition.\u201d Daniela Schwarzer, the leader of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said the harsh reaction offered a taste of the bitter debate to come in 2017. \u201cThey were very quick to link this directly to Merkel, and they said horrific things, blaming her for the deaths,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cThat gives us a sense of what is coming in the electoral campaign,\u201d she said, adding that after an especially nasty presidential campaign in the United States, German politicians, too, may abandon traditional decorum. Early in the day, a somber Ms. Merkel, dressed in black, briefly spoke to the news media and later lay a white rose at a memorial near the scene of the attack. \u201cWe must assume at the current time that it was a terrorist attack,\u201d Ms. Merkel said on Tuesday, as she vowed to punish those behind the crimes \u201cas severely as our laws demand.\u201d Video Pakistani Let Go in Berlin After Arrest in Attack The German interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, said that a a 23-year-old man from Pakistan was arrested on Monday night after the attack on a Berlin Christmas market. The man was released on Tuesday. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS and REUTERS. Photo by John Macdougall/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed In a country where a painful experience with totalitarianism has placed personal privacy at a premium, the investigation was sure to be complicated by the absence of surveillance cameras that have become the norm in cities like London. In addition to their appeals for tips or crime scene video, officials also pleaded with people to avoid posting them on social media outlets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Security officials have been warning that Germany remains in the sights of terrorists, without naming any specific threats. Coming as many families were winding down their work for the year and readying holiday festivities, the attack left the country in subdued shock. Other Christmas markets in the city were closed on Tuesday, and flags were lowered to half-staff. \u201cTwelve people were among us yesterday and were happy about Christmas and the holidays,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThis is incomprehensible, this act that robbed them of their lives.\u201d She urged people not to bow to fear and suspicion, telling Germans they must continue to uphold their traditions, even when faced with the reality that democracy is vulnerable. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do without Christmas markets, without nice outings together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not wish to let fear and angst take away our freedom to live.\u201d Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, Germany\u2019s interior minister, said that there would be increased security in public places and at key transit hubs, and that local officials would make decisions about events that might need to be curtailed for safety reasons. Officials have been aware for some time of the risk of attacks on holiday-themed events in Europe. The State Department issued a travel alert on Nov. 21 recommending that Americans \u201cexercise caution at holiday festivals, events and outdoor markets\u201d throughout the Continent. \u201cCredible information\u201d indicated that the Islamic State, its affiliates and sympathizers \u201ccontinue to plan terrorist attacks in Europe, with a focus on the upcoming holiday season and associated events,\u201d the alert said. Throughout Tuesday, Berlin residents bearing flowers and candles placed them at makeshift memorials on either side of the church. Oliver Horn said he had written the slogan \u201cM\u00eame pas peur\u201d (French for \u201cNot even afraid\u201d), from the aftermath of the Nice attacks, on a poster and hung it near the site on his way to work on Tuesday. \u201cIt just came to my mind,\u201d he said of the gesture. \u201cI felt I had to do something.\u201d The sign caught the attention of Cyril Leteuil, who was visiting Berlin from Bordeaux. \u201cIt\u2019s just like Nice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in France.\u201d Follow Alison Smale @asmalenyt and Melissa Eddy @meddynyt on Twitter.

But according to astronomers, December 21st marks the start of winter. USA TODAY Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Here comes the cold and dark: The winter solstice, the\u00a0day of the year with the least amount of daylight in the Northern Hemisphere,\u00a0occurs early Wednesday morning. The solstice happens at the same instant everywhere on Earth. In the U.S., it happens at 5:44 a.m. EST Wednesday (or 4:44 a.m. CT, 3:44 a.m. MT and 2:44 a.m. PT). After the solstice, the amount of daylight slowly starts to get longer again each day. The winter solstice is the exact moment that the Northern Hemisphere is tilted the farthest it ever gets from the sun. During the Northern Hemisphere's winter, the land north of the equator is tilted away from the sun. This lowers the amount of the sun's warming energy that reaches Earth, hence, winter! It's the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where Dec. 21 marks\u00a0the beginning of astronomical summer. On the winter solstice, all places south of the equator have more\u00a0than 12 hours of daylight, while all locations north of the equator have less than 12 hours of daylight, AccuWeather said. One of the most famous solstice celebrations occurs at the ancient Stonehenge ruins in Wiltshire, England, where druids, pagans and other revelers gather each year to celebrate the event. The winter and summer solstices, along with the equinoxes,\u00a0loom large in myth and folklore. \"Culturally, the solstices and equinoxes are typically used to denote either the beginnings of the seasons or the center points of the seasons,\" as in England, says Rick Kline, with the Spacecraft Planetary Imaging Facility at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. \"Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and other holidays have arisen out of the solstices, equinoxes and the midpoints between them,\" he said. Speaking of weather ...\u00a0 Hoping for a white Christmas? Here are your odds The solstice marks\u00a0the astronomical beginning of winter, while meteorologists view winter (the three coldest months) as starting Dec. 1.\u00a0The day of the solstice, however, isn't typically the coldest day of the year. There is a weeks-long lag between the solstice and the coldest average temperature for most spots in the USA. This lag in temperature occurs because even though the amount of daylight continues to increase, the Earth's surface continues to lose more heat than it receives from the sun. In most locations across the country, the coldest weather occurs around two or three weeks later, in early to mid-January. For example, the coldest days in Boston, on average, are Jan. 17-26. In Chicago, it's Jan. 17-20, and in Miami, it's Jan. 2-22. At the end of January, more heat finally begins arriving than leaving, and days slowly start to warm up. The Earth's tilted axis causes us to have summer and winter. The tilt is probably the result of collisions with various proto-planets and other massive objects during the formation of the solar system billions of years ago, according to NASA.

Ryan Kingsbery/AP hide caption toggle caption Ryan Kingsbery/AP Walruses rest on the shores of the Chukchi Sea, the vast majority of which was designated off-limits to drilling on Tuesday. Ryan Kingsbery/AP President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters, a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in office. The Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada . \"These actions, and Canada's parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,\" the White House said in a statement. \"They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region's harsh conditions is limited,\" the White House added. \"By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region \u2014 at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.\" This map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off-limits to oil and gas explorations and development activity. White House hide caption toggle caption White House Obama's action designates 31 Atlantic canyons \"off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity,\" totaling 3.8 million acres, according to the administration. It provides the same protections to much of the Arctic's waters, covering the \"vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas,\" totaling 115 million acres. Canada is doing the same to \"all Arctic Canadian waters,\" the joint statement adds. Article continues after sponsorship Obama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act , which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases. But as NPR's Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report, major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this action. The Arctic is a critical and irreplaceable part of our world.

There is no legal precedent for reversal, Jeff reports. \"So if there's a legal challenge, and I'm not going to be surprised if there is one, it's really not clear what a court would decide.\" This map shows the area that the U.S. has designated as indefinitely off-limits to offshore oil and gas leasing. White House hide caption toggle caption White House As Bloomberg reports , the \"statute doesn't include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through court.\" Environmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation. \"President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling,\" as Jacqueline Savitz, the group's senior vice president for the United States, said in a statement. \"The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.\" Representatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news. \"We think it's a very shortsighted decision to take these areas off-limits,\" Andy Radford, senior policy adviser for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute, told Jeff. The action poses \"great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country. \" Earlier this year , the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalists. Then, the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean . Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deep-sea commercial fishing. ",

    "text": "WATCH Suspected Terrorist Attack Kills at Least 12 at Christmas Market in Berlin 0 Shares Email With the news that ISIS has claimed responsibility for Monday\u2019s attack in Berlin, the world is seeing another example of terrorists trading bullets and bombs for cars and trucks as a way to more discreetly unleash carnage across the world. On Tuesday afternoon, SITE Intelligence reported that the ISIS terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack, calling the fugitive terror truck driver a \u201csoldier of the Islamic State,\u201d that worked \u201cin response to calls for targeting nationals of the international coalition.\u201d The attack follows an increasingly familiar pattern. Over the past six months, attackers have used vehicles to mow down crowds during Bastille Day celebrations in Nice, France; to ram a pack of students on the campus of Ohio State University; and, most recently, to plow through a Christmas market in Berlin. These incidents are not coincidental, however. Since at least the summer of 2014, the ISIS terror group has been calling on its followers to use vehicles in attacks on innocents. \u201cIf you are not able to find an IED [improvised explosive device] or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,\u201d ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad Al-Adnani said in Sept. 2014, according to SITE Intelligence. \u201cSmash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.\u201d In Oct. 2014, a Canadian soldier was killed and another was injured when a radicalized man ran them down at a strip mall in Quebec with his car. Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images Forensic police investigate a truck at the scene of a terror attack on the Promenade des Anglais, July 15, 2016 in Nice, France. And this past summer, in what is the deadliest vehicle-borne attack in recent memory, 86 people were killed when a radicalized man used a semi-truck to plow through revelers who had assembled to celebrate Bastille Day in Nice, France. Seemingly finding success in this method of attack, the ISIS terror group has amplified its propaganda. This past November, ISIS released an online guide to vehicular attacks, suggesting targets like the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade as prime targets. \u201cThough being an essential part of modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner\u201d the digital magazine reads, citing the Nice attacker as \u201csuperbly\u201d demonstrating the effectiveness of vehicle-borne attacks. The document goes on to state: \u201cVehicles are like knives, as they are extremely easy to acquire. But unlike knives, which if found in one\u2019s possession can be a cause for suspicion, vehicles arouse absolutely no doubts due to their widespread use throughout the world.\u201d This new method of attack can\u2019t be taken lightly, Matthew Olsen, an ABC News contributor and the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, explained. \u201cThis level of lethality \u2013 this is a real concern because this is a really difficult type of attack to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sophisticated, it\u2019s not hard to pull off, somebody simply has to get hold of a large truck and drive it into a crowd.\u201d And while the booklet evoked imagery of American targets like the parade, U.S. officials have been wide-ranging in their warnings. In guidance issues to Americans abroad on Nov. 21, the U.S. State Department warned of \u201cthe heightened risk of terrorist attacks throughout Europe, particularly during the holiday season.\u201d In particular, the State Department said that travelers and expats \u201cshould exercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets.\u201d In light of the guidebook\u2019s publication, authorities in New York ramped up security around the iconic Thanksgiving parade, which was described as \u201can excellent target,\u201d by the propagandists. And while the parade went down without a hitch, authorities shouldn\u2019t write off the propaganda as hot air, Olsen said. \u201cThe use of propaganda is worrisome because we\u2019ve seen this propaganda have an impact and actually inspire individuals to take action,\u201d he said. John Minchillo/AP Photo A car inside a police line sits on the sidewalk as authorities respond to an attack on campus at Ohio State University, Monday, Nov. 28, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio. Just a few days later, a student at Ohio State University used a car to ram a group of people who had gathered outside a lecture hall after a fire alarm sounded, before going on a slashing spree. Nobody was killed in that attack, but 13 were injured. The FBI later said that the student was inspired by the ISIS and Al-Qaeda terror groups. And, just a few weeks later, on Monday, a truck was used to mow down crowds gathered a traditional Christmas market in Berlin. While authorities in German hunt for the suspect in that case, they are describing the incident as a terrorist attack. In the meantime, ISIS has wasted little time claiming an attack that comes straight from their playbook. ",

    "text": "By Paula Reid CBS News December 20, 2016, 3:34 PM Judge unseals warrant for search of Anthony Weiner's computer Then-New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner leaves his apartment building in New York July 24, 2013. AP/Richard Drew Email A federal judge in New York has unsealed the search warrant obtained by the FBI to search Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer for emails related to Secretary Clinton\u2019s private server. The warrant was issued on Oct. 30, just two days after FBI Director James Comey had sent a letter to Congress revealing the possible existence of new emails related to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The Department of Justice had previously announced that the investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information was closed, with a decision not to bring charges against anyone. Comey\u2019s letter to Congress said the new emails were discovered as part of an unrelated investigatio n, but he did not name or give details about the other investigation. The FBI is combing through disgraced Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer searching for classified information linked to Hillary Clinton. CBS News Just... According to the warrant, law enforcement officials had asked the judge to authorize the search of a silver Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series laptop computer. The warrant states that those officials had information indicating that there were thousands of emails on the laptop that could be related to the Clinton investigation. The FBI\u2019s application for the search warrant said that the laptop had never been authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information and that a complete forensic analysis and review of the device would allow the FBI to determine whether classified information had been mishandled or if the device had been hacked.\u00a0 The warrant was unsealed after E. Random Schoenberg sued to unseal the search warrant. He made it clear he was not interested in the \u201cunrelated investigation\u201d and was only seeking the warrant for the emails related to Secretary Clinton. Lawyers for top Hillary Clinton aide, Huma Abedin are saying that the government never provided her or her ex-husband Anthony Weiner with a copy ... In deciding whether to unseal the warrant, the judge noted that Clinton \u201chas little remaining privacy interest in the release of her documents identify her as the subject of her investigation.\u201d The Department of Justice initially opposed the unsealing, then withdrew its opposition and instead asked only that the documents be unsealed with certain redactions. The warrant was redacted to hide the identity of the subject of that other investigation \u2013 who has been independently confirmed to be Anthony Weiner. The redactions also protect the identity of the law enforcement agents who worked on the case and applied for the warrant. Lawyers for Huma Abedin filed a letter in the case saying that the government never provided Abedin or her estranged ex-husband Anthony Weiner with a copy of the warrant. Under federal law the officer executing the warrant must give a copy to the person whose property is taken.\u00a0 This case is slightly more complicated by the fact that the laptop had already been confiscated for the other investigation , a sexting scandal involving Weiner and a minor.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The explosion in Tultepec was confirmed in an earlier tweet by Luis Felipe Puente, the National Coordinator for Civil Protection. Dramatic video posted to Facebook shows clouds of thick smoke billowing from the market as several fireworks appear to go off at once. Further details on the explosion were not immediately available. In 2005, a fire engulfed the same market, sparking a chain of explosions that leveled hundreds of stalls just ahead of Mexico's Independence Day, The Associated Press reported. A similar fire at the San Pablito Market also destroyed hundreds of stands in 2006, according to The AP. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "A truck mowed down people in the crowd at a popular Christmas market in Berlin Merkel, who has been criticized for allowing in large numbers of migrants, addressed head-on the possibility that an asylum-seeker was responsible. \u201cI know that it would be particularly hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that a person committed this act who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\u201d Merkel said.\u00a0 Authorities arrested a man about 1.5 miles from the crash site on suspicion of having been at the wheel of the truck. Footage showed the suspect, his head covered in a white sheet, being pushed into a police car shortly after the attack. Berlin\u2019s Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the man was known to police for minor crimes. \u00a0 However, the suspect denies involvement in the attack, Berlin police said.\u00a0 Below is the latest information on the attack, the investigation, and the world reaction to the worst terrorist attack in Germany since they began taking in migrants by the hundreds of thousands last year. 8:44 p.m. ET -- Among the injured was Inaki Ellakuria, who underwent surgery Tuesday for a broken tibia and fibula on his left leg. He said he knew immediately it was no accident.\u00a0 \u201cIt came fast, too fast to be driving off the road accidentally,\u201d the 21-year-old student from Spain tweeted only minutes after the attack. \u201cIt has swept me and ran over both of my legs.\u201d Juan Jose Ellakuria told the Associated Press his son also suffered broken bones in his right ankle and instep, as well as damage to his hip. \u201cHe\u2019s come out of surgery and he\u2019s making good progress,\u201d Ellakuria said.\u00a0 5:20 p.m. ET -- Brunella Capitani was walking with her husband to have dinner at the Berlin Christmas market when she heard the ominous sound of a truck plowing through stalls at the busy event. Capitani told The Associated Press at her home in the northern Dutch city of Groningen that she heard the truck crash again and again \u201cso there was this banging, repeating of the banging.\u201d She said she heard the truck but did not see it. \u201cIt was really like a part of a building that crashed down.\u201d The 48-year-old humanitarian volunteer said she was struck by the respect shown by those at the scene who did not immediately reach for their mobile phones to shoot photos or video of the carnage. \u201cIt really touched me and I remember in particular the fact that we were not taking pictures and were not taking videos,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if we have already too much violence everywhere and you didn\u2019t want to see more of this.\u201d 5:18 p.m. ET --\u00a0A top Democrat on the U.S. House intelligence committee also says that ISIS\u2019 claim of responsibility for a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market cannot yet be confirmed. Rep. Adam Schiff said the claim \u201ccannot be verified until the perpetrator or perpetrators are apprehended by German authorities, but ISIS has never shied away from claiming credit for attacks - -even if it knew nothing about them in advance.\u201d Schiff warned that Europe must brace for the \u201cpossibility of further terrorism in the weeks and months ahead as Iraqi forces squeeze ISIS in Mosul and as the group is steadily dislodged from its strongholds in Syria.\u201d 4:55 p.m. ET -- State Department spokesman John Kirby said U.S. officials don\u2019t have enough information at the moment to back up the claim of responsibility by ISIS for a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market that left 12 people dead and nearly 50 injured.\u00a0 Kirby said \u201cthere is no direct evidence of a tie or a link to a terrorist organization, but this bears the hallmarks of previous terror attacks.\u201d The claim of responsibility came not long after German prosecutors said they\u2019d released a Pakistani man picked up on Monday night near the scene of the attack, initially suspected of driving the truck.\u00a0 4:48 p.m. ET -- London police will institute road closures in the area surrounding Buckingham Palace when the popular Changing the Guard military ceremony is taking place -- a security measure rushed into place because of the deadly Christmas market truck attack in Berlin.\u00a0 Police said Tuesday the change in procedure had been planned but is being speeded up. The closures and the new physical barriers are set to be in place by Wednesday.\u00a0 The Changing the Guard has long been popular with tourists and police say it is a high-profile event that attracts large crowds at an iconic location.\u00a0 Under the new plan, road closures will be in place for nearly two hours when the guards are changed in front of the palace in central London. Police said the change is \u201ca precautionary measure\u201d for the next three months and is not based on any specific intelligence.\u00a0 The threat level in Britain is judged to be \u201csevere,\u201d meaning an attack is highly likely.\u00a0 2:44 p.m. ET --\u00a0Six of those killed in the attack have been identified as Germans, and a man found shot and killed in the truck\u2019s passenger seat was Polish. The other five people killed have not yet been identified. Twenty-five people remained hospitalized, 14 with serious injuries. 2:26 p.m. ET --\u00a0The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) has claimed responsibility for the Berlin Christmas market attack. Terrorist monitoring groups report ISIS\u2019 news agency made the claim.

The man arrested -- a Pakistani citizen who came to Germany last year as an asylum-seeker -- matched witness descriptions of the truck driver, but investigators haven\u2019t been able to prove that he was in the truck\u2019s cab at the time of the attack. They noted that witnesses were able to follow the truck\u2019s driver from the scene but lost track of him. The man arrested matched witness descriptions of the truck driver, but investigators haven\u2019t been able to prove that he was in the truck\u2019s cab at the time of the attack. Under German law, prosecutors have until the end of the calendar day following an arrest to seek a formal arrest warrant keeping a suspect in custody. 1:07 p.m. ET --\u00a0German prosecutors said the man who was arrested after Berlin truck attack was released because of insufficient evidence. He has denied any involvement, and a German newspaper reported earlier that no traces of the arrestees blood nor DNA were found in the truck used in the attack. 12:52 p.m ET --\u00a0Security is tightening at Christmas markets across Europe in response to the Berlin attack as pointed questions have arisen over why the German capital was vulnerable despite months of warnings. Christmas markets are a popular tradition throughout Europe for both residents and tourists, and feature stalls with local food, mulled wine, warm chestnuts, scarves and tree ornaments. Police stand at the area where a truck ploughed through a Christmas market on December 19, 2016 in Berlin, Germany.\u00a0 Sean Gallup, Getty Images With no concrete information available about the driver, security officials around Europe were left to draw their own conclusions about an attack with strong parallels to the Bastille Day rampage in France that killed 86 people and was claimed by ISIS. French Christmas markets were already under heightened security. Paris\u2019 Champs Elysees was lined with barriers and large concrete blocks straddled each entrance.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Concrete bollards - upright posts used to block entrances to streets - are increasingly common in France, which not only has struck by deadly extremist attacks in the past two years, but also endured a series of street bombings in the 1990s. Heavy barriers are relatively rare in Germany. Germany\u2019s interior minister left it up to local authorities whether to raise security after Monday night\u2019s attack. In the eastern state of Thuringia and Potsdam, armed police patrolled around the markets and in the eastern city of Dresden, officers put up massive concrete blocks - and said they were planned ahead of the attack. Italy and the Czech Republic promised heightened security to come, while Danish, Norwegian and British police increased their presence at Christmas markets. \u00a011:35 a.m. ET --\u00a0Poland\u2019s prime minister, Beata Szydlo, has called Lukasz Urban, a 37-year-old from the western village of Roznowo, \u201cthe first victim of this heinous act of violence.\u201d Urban\u2019s colleague and cousin, Ariel Zurawski, the owner of the company that owned the truck that rammed into the market, said he was so dedicated to his work and his truck that he could be expected to defend the vehicle \u201cto the end.\u201d ",

Andy Wong/AP Tennis star Petra Kvitova was badly injured Tuesday morning when a man armed with a knife attacked her at her home in Prostejov, Czech Republic. The two-time Wimbledon champion said she sustained \"severe\" injuries to her left hand, which is her playing hand, and that she was \"fortunate to be alive.\" In a series of tweets, Kvitova wrote : \"Thank you for all your messages. As you may have already heard, today I was attacked in my apartment by an individual with a knife. In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I am shaken, but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe and I will need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me I am strong and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support.\" The 26-year-old suffered deep cuts to the four fingers on her left hand and underwent surgery to help repair the ligaments and tendons, as the BBC reported . The BBC also reported some details about the attack, which was characterized as a burglary. It said: \"It is understood she allowed someone posing as a utilities man access to her apartment and while defending herself in a struggle, suffered the injuries to her hand. The intruder is believed to have then run away and is being sought by police.\" Article continues after sponsorship A former world No. 2 and Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014, Kvitova had fallen out of the Women's Tennis Association top 10 this year. But she won bronze in the Rio Olympics, losing in three sets to eventual gold medal winner Monica Puig. In November, along with her Czech teammates, she won the Fed Cup, one of the biggest national team tournaments in women's tennis. Kvitova is currently No. 11 in WTA rankings . Though Kvitova's publicist told the BBC that the attack was \"a random crime, nobody was going to attack or rob her as Petra Kvitova,\" a number of female tennis players have faced violent attacks and threats. The New York Times reports : \"In 1993, top-ranked Monica Seles was stabbed during a match in Hamburg and did not return to the sport for more than two years. When she did, her dominance subsided, and she won only one more Grand Slam title to add to her previous eight. \"In 2007, sixth-ranked Anna Chakvetadze and her family were assaulted during a home invasion in Moscow. Chakvetadze, who had made the semifinals of the United States Open three months before, was unable to replicate that success, and she retired in 2013 at age 26.\" The timeline for Kvitova's recovery is unknown.

Marx's wife, model and former MTV VJ Daisy Fuentes, captured the scary scene Tuesday on her cellphone during a Korean Air flight and posted details on Instagram. \"On our flight from Hanoi to Seoul a guy sitting in the next row from us got crazy & started attacking the flight attendants & passengers,\" Fuentes wrote. \"When he started pushing the female staff and pulling them by the hair @therichardmarx was the first to help subdue him.\" A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) Fuentes said the passenger's behavior went on for four hours and the crew was unable to control him even after pulling out a Taser. \"They didn't know how to use the taser & they didn't know how to secure the rope around him (he got loose from their rope restraints 3 times),\" she added. Fuentes' photos showed Marx with his elbow to the back of the unidentified passenger, and as well as her Grammy-winning songwriter husband holding the rope.

The death chamber of the lethal injection facility at San Quentin State Prison is seen in September 2010. (Eric Risberg / Associated Press) Associated Press The California Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a voter-approved measure intended to speed up the appeals process for the state's death row inmates to give it time to consider a lawsuit challenging the measure. In a one-page decision, the court stayed the \"implementation of all provisions of Proposition 66\" and set a timeline for filing briefs in the case. Proposition 66 would change how appeals are handled, appointing more lawyers to take cases, putting certain types of appeals before trial court judges and setting a five-year deadline for appeals to be heard. Currently, it can take longer than that for an attorney to be assigned to a case and upward of 25 years to exhaust appeals. These are the 749 inmates awaiting execution on California's death row \u00bb The lawsuit by former California Atty. Gen.\u00a0John Van de Kamp and Ron Briggs, whose father wrote the ballot measure that expanded California's death penalty in 1978, said the reform measure would disrupt the courts, cost more money and limit the ability to mount proper appeals. They said the deadlines would set \"an inordinately short timeline for the courts to review those complex cases\" and result in attorneys cutting corners in their investigations. Supporters of the measure have called the lawsuit a frivolous stall tactic. California voters faced two death penalty measures in the November election. They rejected a measure that would have abolished the death penalty and narrowly approved Proposition 66.

    "text": "By James Hohmann December 20 at 11:05 AM Follow @JamesHohmann Donald Trump walks and talks yesterdaywith Reince Priebus at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump appears to have embraced, with gusto, Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cMadman Theory\u201d of foreign policy. He thinks he can use his reputation for unpredictability and lack of respect for long-standing international norms to unnerve and then intimidate America\u2019s adversaries into making concessions that they would not otherwise make. The Chinese government\u2019s decision yesterday to return the naval drone that it had seized in the South China Sea, despite howls of protest about Trump\u2019s braggadocio, might be the first vindication of this approach. -- A generation ago, Nixon wanted to convince the Soviets and their North Vietnamese clients that he was a hot-head willing to use nuclear weapons. The goal then was to scare the communists into negotiating. In some ways, this was the nub of the secret plan he talked so much about during the 1968 campaign \u2013 just as Trump insisted that he had a secret plan to get rid of ISIS during the 2016 race. \u201cI call it the Madman Theory,\u201d the then-president explained to H.R. Haldeman, his chief of staff, as they walked along a foggy beach one day. \u201cI want the North Vietnamese to believe I\u2019ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We\u2019ll just slip the word to them that, \u2018For God\u2019s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can\u2019t restrain him when he\u2019s angry \u2014 and he has his hand on the nuclear button!\u2019 And Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\u201d Henry Kissinger and Richard M. Nixon at Kissinger's swearing-in as secretary of state. (AP/File) -- Elites in Washington and across the world think Trump is crazy, but the president-elect has demonstrated repeatedly that he can be crazy like a fox. He knew exactly what he was doing when he called for a Muslim ban, for instance, or picked fights with people on Twitter to distract the press from much bigger problems. We\u2019ve already learned that Trump\u2019s phone call with the leader of Taiwan was not some spontaneous faux pas but a carefully-planned recalibration of U.S. policy. For Trump\u2019s stratagem to work, foreign leaders must continue to believe that he\u2019s erratic and prone to irrational overreaction. \u201cWe must as a nation be more unpredictable,\u201d Trump often said on the campaign trail. \u201cWe have to be unpredictable!\u201d Andrey Karlov, Russian ambassador to Ankara, lies dead after his assassination. (Stringer/AFP/Getty)\u00a0 -- This is a dangerous gambit in the current geopolitical risk environment. Nixon played the game in a bi-polar world, with two superpowers and nothing like the Islamic State to worry about. The world that Trump must lead is multi-polar. Asymmetric warfare is now a top-tier concern. -- Several events yesterday \u2013 including the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara, the truck attack at a Christmas market in Berlin, the mosque shooting in Zurich, the on-again, off-again evacuation in Aleppo and the riots in Venezuela -- offered timely reminders of the degree to which our interconnected world is a tinderbox, perennially on the verge of bursting into flames. In Europe, they\u2019re already calling it Black Monday. -- What alarms so many foreign policy greybeards is that Trump is a flame thrower, not a firefighter, by his very nature. Since Teddy Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Russo-Japanese War, every American president has prided himself on at least trying to defuse global tensions, not heighten them.

They\u2019ve had long meetings to talk about the world.

She will now return as Michael Flynn\u2019s deputy. Nixon hired Monica Crowley as a research assistant when she was 22. She wrote a tell-all after he died, revealing their private conversations. Now she\u2019ll be the senior director of strategic communications for the NSC. Since Trump plans to eschew the presidential daily briefing, and empower NSC staff to make decisions without his sign-off, both jobs might be even more powerful than they normally would be.

The New York developer literally paid to take out full-page ads in The Washington Post in 1987 to trash Reagan\u2019s foreign policy for lacking backbone. At the exact same time, he was palling around with and trying to ingratiate himself with both Nixon and Kissinger. In fact, Trump admires Nixon so much that he\u2019s planning to hang in the Oval Office a letter that the former president sent him in 1987 (the same year he was slamming Reagan).

After first suggesting the crash may have been an accident, Berlin police said it is being investigated as a terrorist attack. \u201cThe bloodshed came at the height of activity at the Christmas markets, a cherished German tradition that draws locals and tourists to city squares for mugs of mulled wine, grilled sausages and regional sweets,\u201d Anthony Faiola, Souad Mekhennet and Stephanie Kirchner report. \u201cThe scene turned to panic around 8 p.m. as the truck veered onto the sidewalk and crashed between market stalls, reportedly running nearly 80 feet before stopping.

Still, Russian authorities have called for an investigation to reveal whether there was a \u201clarger plot,\u201d with some in Moscow suggesting that the West is to blame for its support of moderate rebel factions in Syria. Putin stopped short of that, saying only, \"We need to know who guided the hand of the murderer.\" -- Turkish police have detained six people in connection with the assassination, widening a probe to include the relatives of the 22-year-old gunman. His mother, father, sister and two other relatives were held in the western province of Aydin, while his flatmate in Ankara was also detained, Reuters reports .

The only thing to be decided is the price Erdogan will have to pay.\u201d -- But there is no immediate indication that Turkey or Russia will alter their aligned policies in Syria. If anything, the attack may cement their partnership even further, the\u00a0 New York Times\u2019 Max Fisher argues. \u201c[Turkey expert Aaron Stein] predicted that President Erdogan would seek to distract attention from his government\u2019s unpopular Syria policy by pinning the [assassination] attack on the United States-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan also blamed for a coup attempt in Turkey this summer. Mr. Gulen has denied the charges, and Washington has refused to extradite him, citing a lack of evidence.\u201d But tensions with the U.S. actually help Erdogan rally support in Turkey, where America is unpopular: \u201cThe biggest loser from this will be Washington,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely counterintuitive, but it\u2019s Washington.\u201d One of the pictures taken by the AP's Burhan Ozbilici. -- A first-person account from\u00a0 AP photographer Burhan Ozbilici , who was there: \u201cThe event seemed routine, the opening of an exhibit of photographs of Russia.

Instead, it was a coolly calculated assassination, unfolding in front of me and others who scrambled, terrified, for cover. \u2026 People screamed, hid behind columns and under tables and lay on the floor. I was afraid and confused, but found partial cover behind a wall and did my job: taking photographs. This is what I was thinking: \u2018I'm here.

No one will ever know what combination of factors, including Clinton campaign errors, Trump campaign strengths, the ham-handed FBI letter and the dissatisfied mood of the country, produced Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.\u00a0But every American should be concerned about foreign intervention in U.S. democratic processes. A select committee could examine all cases of cyber-intrusion, not only against the campaigns but also aimed at voter registration databases. In a calm and rational way, the country needs to learn all it can about attempts to contaminate or corrupt the electoral process.\u201d -- There are several practical reasons why supporting a Russian hacking probe is in Trump\u2019s best interests, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Washington bureau chief Gerald F. Seib argues: \u201cThe first is that a cloud of uncertainty will hang over his election as long as the charges that Russia somehow intervened to help him remain unexplored and unanswered. Mr. Trump may fear that an inquiry will somehow delegitimize his victory, but the Russian role now has become such a visible and dominant topic that the opposite likely is true: Questions will linger mostly if the issue is shoved under the rug. The second reason is more substantive. Mr. Trump shows every sign of wanting to execute a significant shift in America\u2019s strategic posture in the world. He seems to want to get along better with Russia \u2026 But the prospects of making a persuasive case for the kind of change toward [Moscow] that Mr. Trump wants actually will be undercut if it appears that move is part of some kind of payoff for election-year help. Trump loyalists think that suspicion is ludicrous\u2014which is why they should want it addressed head-on.\u201d -- Putin\u2019s best friend in Congress, Rep.

What I have said is that I don't care who provided us those e-mails. The emails were factual and\u2026it did not hurt the American people to have more factual information available to them. This is just a frantic effort to try to discredit an election because the American people rejected the liberal left effort.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s comfortable with Russian hacking against American targets, Rohrabacher stated: \u201cI'm comfortable with the fact that we have systems that are vulnerable to hacking, whether it's the Russians or anybody else. And when you have systems that are available to hacking, information will be provided that perhaps somebody wants to keep secret.\" -- Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, met with the leader of the Austrian far-right Freedom Party, who recently signed a so-called \u201ccooperation agreement\u201d with Putin\u2019s ruling party. The New York Times\u2019 Alison Smale reports : \u201cWord of the agreement with Russia was the latest sign that the Kremlin is forging bonds with political parties across Europe in what some European leaders suspect is a coordinated attempt to meddle in their affairs and potentially weaken Western democracies. Many of these efforts are murky and involve obscure groups, and it is unclear what, if any, direct involvement [Putin] may have.\u201d The Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, reported the agreement signing on Monday, also touting his recent meeting with Flynn at the Trump Tower. Strache\u2019s trips to New York and Moscow were clearly intended to convey the impression that the Freedom Party, which was founded by ex-Nazis, has international standing and intends to continue vying for power. \u201cAside from sowing domestic ferment in Austria, a Freedom Party-led government would press to lift the sanctions imposed on Moscow for its 2014 seizure of Crimea and meddling in war-torn eastern Ukraine,\u201d Smale writes. -- Trump said he was very aware of Russian hacking in a 2014 appearance on Fox News,\u00a0calling it a \u201cbig problem.\" CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski : \u201cI think what he said is fantastic,\" Trump said, reacting to comments James Comey had just made on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI've been talking about China for a long time. You know, they put on the front like, we're your friend and everything, and in the meantime the cash comes out of your back pocket. It's disgraceful \u2026\u00a0He's 100% right, it's a big problem, and we have that problem also with Russia. You saw that over the weekend. Russia's doing the same thing.\" He continued, \"The problem with the Internet and frankly computerization is that there's always some genius that can figure it out,\" continued Trump. \u2026 You say things over a computer and people are going to find out what you're saying. It's very dangerous and very bad in many ways.\" -- \u201cAs for Trump\u2019s newfound friendships with kindred leaders such as Putin, one should expect them to be about as long-lasting as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact,\u201d Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, argued a few weeks ago in a smart take . \u201cRussia and the United States share some common interests, but not a lot of them. Given the temperaments of Trump and Putin, it would not be hard to envision the relationship spiraling out of control if one of them thinks he\u2019s been wronged. Being hot-headed as a tactic only works if other leaders are not hot-headed in response. The very leaders most like Trump \u2014 Putin, Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 are the ones most likely to respond to anger with anger, escalating any dispute.\u201d Valerie Jarrett, David Simas\u00a0and Susan Rice listen to Obama announce the Iranian nuclear deal.

Juliet Eilperin reports : \u201cSimas, a native of Taunton, Mass., has served as President Obama's top political aide since early 2014. The fact that he is helping establish his presidential center in Chicago provides the latest indication that Obama intends to engage in political activism after leaving office. Simas, who worked as director of opinion research for Obama's reelection campaign, served as a liaison between the president and Democratic officials over the past two and a half years. Although Democrats just lost the White House and failed to regain control of either the Senate or House, Obama stepped up his involvement in federal and state races under Simas's tenure.\u201d A women holds a sign that reads \"MAHALO\" as a motorcade with POTUS and FLOTUS passes by in Kaneohe, Hawaii, yesterday.\u00a0(Carolyn Kaster/AP) -- Michelle Obama sat for her final White House interview with Oprah Winfrey, striking a somber tone as she weighed in on everything from parenting teens in the White House to the necessity of maintaining hope in the face of seemingly \u201chopeless\u201d circumstances. Krissah Thompson reports : \u201cIn a wide-ranging interview \u2026 [Michelle Obama] said the weight her husband\u2019s presidency placed on their family has lifted \u2018knowing that we\u2019ve made it this far \u2026\u2019 But she sounded concerned about the future, saying that when it comes to the nation, she said she prays that Americans still have \u2018hope.\u2019 Still, Obama said that she and her husband are doing what they can to help smooth a path for the next administration. \u2018My offer to Melania was, you really don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re here, so the door is open \u2026\u2019 [she said]. \u2018We will do whatever they need to help them succeed.\u2019 Winfrey also asked Obama about the challenges of parenting her daughters in the White House[:] \u2018I was really just cautiously making sure that they felt normal; Obama said. \u2018They felt good. \u2026 Imagine being 18 and you\u2019ve got at least eight men with guns driving you around, walking in your parties. There were those kinds of issues.\u2019\u201d Merrick Garland speaks in the Rose Garden after Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court. He called the moment \"the greatest of his life.\"\u00a0(Reuters/Kevin Lamarque) -- Merrick Garland is officially returning to his job as a judge on the\u00a0D.C. Circuit and will hear cases again next month. Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein reports :\u00a0There is no requirement for judicial nominees to suspend their day jobs during the nomination process, though nominees are typically strapped with a heavy schedule of meetings with senators and preparation for confirmation hearings. Garland took the meetings, but the confirmation prep work seemed unnecessary from day one after both Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley vowed not to grant him confirmation hearings. AMERICA, DIVIDED: Tom Arnold and Arnold Schwarzenegger present an award at the CMT Music Awards in Nashville. (Wade Payne/Invision/AP) -- Actor Tom Arnold claims that he has unreleased outtakes of Trump saying \u201cevery offensive, racist thing ever\u201d on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d including footage of him calling his son a retard. The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Abid Rahman reports : \u201cAsked [in a radio interview] why he was given the tapes in the first place and why he didn't release them before the election, Arnold said that the people who sent the clips to him worked on The Apprentice and put together a compilation of Trump saying controversial things as a \u2019funny\u2019 \u2018Christmas video,\u2019 as they didn't expect the real estate mogul to win \u2026. When it became clear that Trump had a realistic chance of taking the White House, Arnold claims [Clinton] as well as new Apprentice star Arnold Schwarzenegger's agent got involved and wanted the tapes released. \u2018They said, \u2018I need you to release him saying the N-word,\u2019 [he recounted]. \u2018I said, \u2018Well, now these people \u2013 two editors and an associate producer \u2014 are scared to death. They\u2019re scared of his people, they\u2019re scared of they\u2019ll never work again, there\u2019s a $5 million confidentiality agreement.'\u201d -- Vanity Fair, \u201c Inside the desperate, year-long hunt to find Trump\u2019s rumored Apprentice outtakes ,\u201d by Nick Bilton: \u201cThroughout the year, the tapes were a subject of almost mythical fascination within the media. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign would also obsessively try to find the tapes up until Election Day. In fact, one person close to the Clinton campaign told me that he had spoken to someone, on the Sunday before the election, who said he had a damaging clip of Trump. But The Apprentice outtakes, whatever they contained, were never made public. \u2026 Could the tapes have changed that outcome? In the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory, many journalists, political operatives, and even celebrities have told me that they aren\u2019t sure. But they\u2019ve also said that one force impeded their hunt. Curiously, it was just about the most liberal place on earth: Hollywood.\u201d -- A neo-Nazi website called for the harassment of Jewish leaders in the hometown of white nationalist Richard Spencer, unleashing a deluge of violent death threats against the activists. \u201cGo choke on a shotgun and die,\u201d read one threat. \u201cYou would all be of greater worth to society as human fertilizer than as citizens.\u201d City council members have been targeted, and local businesses that support human rights are being harassed on review forums. ( Katie Mettler ) A voter casts an early ballot in Milwaukee. (Morry Gash/AP) -- Voter ID laws likely helped to suppress the black vote in Milwaukee, contributing to Trump\u2019s victory in Wisconsin. From the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Jaweed Kaleem : \u201cStarting with John F. Kennedy\u2019s victory over Richard Nixon in 1960, Delia Anderson had voted in 14 straight presidential elections. She had cast her ballot at the same polling place for years, never with a glitch. This year, however, a volunteer driving her to the polls mentioned that she would be asked to show a state-approved photo ID. \u2018Don\u2019t these poll people already know who I am?\u2019 replied Anderson, who is 77, black and uses a wheelchair, as she frantically sifted through her purse for anything to prove her identity. It was a lost cause. She had planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. Instead, for the first time in 56 years, she did not cast a ballot. Such stories abound in Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold in a state where Trump won by 22,748 votes. \u2026 In a state that saw its lowest turnout in 20 years, nearly 248,000 people voted in Milwaukee, roughly 41,000 fewer than in the last presidential election\u2026 \u201cIn Wisconsin, hundreds of thousands of people were registered to vote but didn\u2019t have ID cards, according to Ken Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To study the impact of the law, he is using public records to survey thousands of state residents who were registered to vote but did not cast ballots. In addition to the university, two heavily Democratic counties, Dane and Milwaukee, are funding the study. \u2026 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has vigorously defended the voter ID law.\u201d Key quote: \u201cI believe it was voter suppression laws from the state government that crushed turnout,\u201d said Milwaukee County Clerk Joe Czarnezki, one of two officials who oversees local elections. \u201cThey tend to hit hardest on people who are poor, who don\u2019t drive and don\u2019t have a license, who are minorities.\u201d Megyn Kelly mingles at a Hollywood Reporter party earlier this month. (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) -- The Post\u2019s Erik Wemple spoke to Megyn Kelly in a wide-ranging interview, discussing everything from diversity on the set of her television show, to her assessment of Fox News\u2019 campaign coverage, as well as the multi-network bidding war that has been the subject of speculation for months. Some highlights: On being the subject of a \u201cnetwork bidding war\u201d: \u201c \u2026 I\u2019ll say this: I do feel fortunate to have some great options. But I\u2019ve been just dismayed to see these reports which are completely just based on speculation or based on \u2026 some random unnamed network executive someplace who wants to see his alleged information in the paper \u2026\u201d On her spat with Trump (and why management didn\u2019t publicly speak out): \u201cI understood the position that management was in and that my colleagues were in because he was the front-runner. He was very upset with me; there was of course no way he was going to come on with me. But what were they going to do: Ban the presidential front-runner from all of Fox News until he decided he\u2019d sit with me? I wouldn\u2019t have expected them to do that. On her desire to leave the 9 p.m. television slot: \u201cI want to see my kids for dinner, I want to put them down at night, I want to see their soccer games after school. We all feel that to some extent, but my problem in my current role is I see them in the morning and \u2026 might not see them at all for the rest of the day.\" PUNDITS WEIGH IN: -- The GOP is at its peak, but conservatism has hit rock bottom, says Post columnist and former Bush adviser Michael Gerson . \u201cIt is one of fate\u2019s cruel jokes that conservatism should be at its modern nadir just as the Republican Party is at its zenith \u2014 if conservatism is defined as embracing limited government, displaying a rational, skeptical and moderate temperament and believing in the priority of the moral order.\u00a0 This is not the political force that has recently taken over the Republican Party \u2026 That has been the result of extreme polarization, not a turn toward enduring values. The movement is authoritarian in theory, apocalyptic in mood, prone to conspiracy theories and personal abuse, and dismissive of ethical standards. The president-elect seems to offer equal chances of constitutional crisis and utter, debilitating incompetence. \u2026 \u00a0Now, not only the quality but also the legitimacy of our democracy is at stake.\u201d -- \u201cPopulism\u201d may be one of the most ubiquitous word of 2016 \u2013 but do we really know what it means? \u201cAcademics have offered differing definitions for decades,\u201d Adam Taylor writes . \u201cThe evidence suggests that a populist in one country may not necessarily look like a populist in another country. \u2018Populism has always been a misused and misconstrued concept, and this has become worse in past years, simply because of the explosion in the use of the term,\u2019 said Cas Mudde, an academic at the University of Georgia \u2026 A distrust of the elite and pandering to the masses has been around before 2016, of course. So how did it come to dominate our understanding of the world over the past year?

We cannot live without these shared moments in public spaces. We must not be limited by fear of evil.

That represented a 46 percent year-on-year increase and is almost as many people who live in Houston , the fourth-largest city in the U.S. Federal prosecutors took over investigation after the truck was driven into Breitscheidplatz, a popular public square where tourists and locals were enjoying a traditional pre-Christmas evening. Police said the truck was \"intentionally directed\" into the crowd in an act of \"probable terrorism.\" Merkel visited the scene, adding to a growing pile of flowers left in tribute to the victims. Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere visit the scene of the market attack in Berlin. HANNIBAL HANSCHKE / Reuters Local media identified the suspect as \"Naved B.,\" a 23-year-old who entered Germany via Austria on Dec. 31, 2015. He was reportedly already known to police for minor offenses. Those reports could not immediately be confirmed by NBC News. De Maiziere said only a few of the victims had been identified so far, and that 18 of the 48 wounded had suffered severe injuries. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday afternoon that they were not aware of any American citizens killed or injured in the attack. Among the dead was a Polish man found shot to death inside the cab of the stolen truck. The weapon has not been found. Bloodstained clothing was also found inside the cab, but the suspect in custody was wearing clean clothes, Frank said. Christmas markets in Berlin were closed Tuesday as a mark of respect for the victims, but the interior ministry said other events around the country would take place with increased security measures.

The site, named MormonWikileaks , went live Monday. The first leaked document was a 2010 memo (PDF) discussing how to reduce the number of unauthorized photographs of the interiors of Mormon temples posted online \u2014 photos that the memo says could be \"anything but helpful in understanding the purpose of the temples.\" Post by NBC News . The site is the creation of a team led by Ryan McKnight of Las Vegas, a former Mormon who began discussing his disillusionment with the church online more than two years ago. In October, he began publishing leaked videos of meetings among top church leaders on a YouTube channel that has amassed 2,200 followers in just a few weeks. Here's the recently leaked 7 min video where Elder Oaks asks \"but he is a confirmed homosexual?\" Worth watching: https://t.co/vFqYliEUUB \"The site is built on the philosophy of 'if you build it, they will come,'\" McKnight said Tuesday in an interview. \"This is a game of patience.\" The church said it had no comment on the site. McKnight said he's not interested in gossip about members of the church \u2014 in fact, he said, he's already turned down offers of information about the church contributions of two famous Mormons. He's interested in \"items that have to do with the institution as a whole,\" he said. \"It can be good or bad.\" Because disclosing church documents is a violation of non-disclosure agreements employees must sign, the site provides detailed instructions on how to install and use the identity-protecting encrypted software Tor. And to avoid actively encouraging church employees to breach their secrecy agreements, it doesn't even ask for specific documents. The sun sets behind the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah. Douglas C. Pizac / AP \"Our message is if a church employee or former employee comes across information that their conscience tells them should be available to the public, we want them to know there is a process to assist them in that process \u2014 and that's all that there is,\" he said. \"We're merely the conduit.\" McKnight said his hope was that \"there will be no need for lots of leaks, because maybe this will motivate the church to be more transparent.\" An example would be the disclosure last year of revisions to the Church Handbook of Instructions \u2014 parts of which are supposed to be restricted only to church leaders. The revisions instructed local church leaders that same-sex couples are apostates and that children living with them can't take part in church activities until they're adults and leave home. Related: Mormon Church Bars Children of Same-Sex Couples From Baptism, Blessings A week after NBC News confirmed the authenticity of the documents, the church issued a statement saying it would leave it up to local leaders to decide whether children already baptized and active in the church are eligible to participate in sacred acts if they live with a same-sex couple. Asked about that controversy in an interview with KKAT radio of Salt Lake City , McKnight said: \"These policies should not be secret. They should not be only for bishops and above. \"If you're a card-carrying member of the LDS church, you should know what the policies and procedures are of your church that you're donating to,\" he told the station. Asked Tuesday whether he thought his site would spur the church to be more open, McKnight told NBC News: \"I suppose time will tell.\" But he added: \"I doubt that.\" Alex Johnson ",

Mexico State chief prosecutor Alejandro Gomez said Wednesday the death toll rose to 31 after several people died at local hospitals. He said some of the dead were so badly burned that neither their age no their gender could be immediately determined. The toll is expected to rise because 11 people were listed as missing and some body parts were found at the scene, Gomez added. A list of nine bodies identified so far showed one of the dead included a 3-month-old baby boy and a 12-year-old girl. Gomez said a total of seven male minors were among the dead. State Health Secretary Cesar Nomar Gomez Monge said 72 people were being treated for injuries including severe burns, in some cases over 90 percent of their bodies.

(Jose Luis Tolentino via AP) The powerful chain-reaction explosion ripped through the stalls at the San Pablito fireworks market, which officials said was especially well stocked for the holidays. It\u2019s the third such blast to ravage the market since 2005 sent up a towering plume of some that was lit up by a staccato of bands and flashes of light. Once the smoke cleared, the open-air bazaar was reduced to a stark expanse of ash, rubble and the charred metal of fireworks stands, casting a pall over the country's Christmas season. Survivor Crescencia Francisco Garcia said she was in the middle of the grid of stalls when the thunderous explosions began. She froze, reflexively looked up at the sky and then took off running through the smoke once she realized everyone was doing so. As she ran she saw people with burns and cuts, and lots of blood. \"Everything was catching fire. Everything was exploding,\" Francisco said. \"The stones were flying, pieces of brick, everything was flying.\" Mexico\u00a0State Gov. Eruviel Avila vowed that \"we are going to identify who is responsible.\" Sirens wailed and a heavy scent of gunpowder lingered in the air well after the thunderous explosions at the market, which were widely seen in a dramatic video. The smoking, burned out shells of vehicles ringed the perimeter, and first responders and local residents wearing blue masks over their mouths combed through the ash and debris. Firefighters hosed down still-smoldering hotspots.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo) Tultepec Mayor Armando Portuguez Fuentes said the market was especially well stocked because demand for noisy firecrackers and rockets soars this time of year. \"We are obviously in the high season,\" Portuguez said. \"There was more product than usual because we are a few days away from Christmas, a few days away from New Year's, and those are the days when the products made here are consumed the most.\" Cesar Ornelas of Atizapan de Zaragoza was only 10 minutes into shopping with his son and his father when he heard the first explosions. He tried to run, but something knocked him to the ground from behind. He tried several times to get up, unsuccessfully, and ultimately his 15-year-old son Francisco had to drag him out. \"We didn't look back,\" said Ornelas, who suffered light burns and a large bruise over his left kidney. His white tank top had a fist-size burn on the chest. \"We heard how the explosion was kind of going off bit by bit.\" Nearly four hours later, he and Francisco limped gingerly out of the market area. Francisco said paramedics told him his leg was likely fractured by flying debris. Ornelas said his 67-year-old father, Ernesto, had run in a different direction and sought refuge in a nearby home. All the father's clothing was burned, and his face and arm were bloodied. An ambulance had spirited him to a hospital, but Ornelas wasn't sure where it was or how serious his injuries were. The Mexican Red Cross said it sent 10 ambulances with 50 paramedics to the scene. National Civil Protection Coordinator Luis Felipe Puente told Milenio television that some nearby homes were also damaged. The scene remained dangerous and he asked people not to come within 3 miles to avoid hampering the emergency response. \"My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this accident and my wishes for a quick recovery for the injured,\" President Enrique Pena Nieto said via Twitter. A similar fire engulfed the San Pablito Market in 2005, touching off a chain of explosions that leveled hundreds of stalls just ahead of Mexico's Independence Day. A year later a similar incident at the same market also destroyed hundreds of stands. Portuguez, the Tultepec mayor, said the manufacture and sale of fireworks is a key part of the local economy. He added that it is regulated by law and under the \"constant supervision\" of the Defense Department, which oversees firearms and explosives. \"This is part of the activity of our town. It is what gives us identity,\" Portuguez said. \"We know it is high-risk, we regret this greatly, but unfortunately many people's livelihoods depend on this activity.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "text": "At least 29 killed and dozens injured as explosions rip through fireworks market outside Mexico City Raw video: Fireworks explosion Raw video captured the scene of a massive explosion at a fireworks market near Mexico City. Raw video captured the scene of a massive explosion at a fireworks market near Mexico City. Patrick J. McDonnell , Nina Agrawal and Laura Tillman Contact Reporters A thunderous series of explosions tore through an open-air fireworks market outside Mexico City on Tuesday, leaving at least 29 dead and 72 injured, many seriously, authorities said. The initial blast occurred at 2:30 p.m., when the market was filled with shoppers looking for fireworks for the holiday season. Video  showed what looked like an aerial bombing attack on the sprawling market, as bright flashes punctuated the blue sky and fireballs burst into the air. The repeated blasts\u00a0sounded like an artillery barrage. \u201cWe thought we were going to die,\u201d said Javier Aylar Valdez, 48, who was shopping for fireworks when the detonations began. He initially hid in a stall, he said, and then jumped a fence in front of the rushing flames and ran for his life. \u201cWithin five minutes everything was burning and we started to run,\u201d he recalled. Beneath giant plumes of black smoke, the market stalls lay in splinters. Firefighters doused the remaining flames, baring an apocalyptic expanse of twisted debris. The death toll rose through the afternoon. By dark, Eruviel Avila, the governor of the state of Mexico, told local news crews that it stood at 29, with an additional 72 people injured. The casualty figures were expected to rise. The injured included three children who suffered burns over 70% of their bodies, he said. \u201cMy condolences to the families who lost lives in the accident and my desires for a quick recovery for the wounded,\u201d President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto wrote on Twitter. It was the latest and among the most fatal in a series of fireworks accidents dating back years in Mexico, where fireworks are an essential part of holiday celebrations. By nightfall, police had cordoned off the area surrounding the market. Arriving near the scene were both the curious and people looking for friends or loved ones who may have been in the market at the time of the incident. Verenice Garcia Rodriguez and her husband were hoping for any word of a friend, David Espinoza, who works at a stand inside the market. \u201cWe were waiting to see if anyone else comes out,\u201d said Garcia. Many were stunned at the scope of the disaster. \u201cI thought the market was safe,\u201d said Arianna Valdovinos, 34, who lives\u00a0less than a mile from the site. The explosion rattled the windows of\u00a0her home, she said. Among those gathered in the chilly evening, there was widespread disbelief about the breadth of the tragedy in a market that was a signature part of the town, a place many had visited \u2014 and where hundreds of others made\u00a0a living. \u201cWe are so sorry about what happened, this was their business, the pyrotechnics,\u201d said Gerardo Macias, 49, who came with his daughter, Seannie Sandoval, 13. The daughter said she had never seen such destruction. \u201cI feel so bad for these people,\u201d she said. Fireworks are a common part of Mexican Christmas celebrations, used by families everywhere from the countryside to the heart of the capital. The San Pablito Market in Tultepec, about 25 miles north of Mexico City, was the best-known place to buy them. With more than 300 retailers, it was also the country\u2019s largest, by some estimates selling 80% of the fireworks nationwide. The local government estimated  this year that between August and Christmas \u2014 the high season for fireworks \u2014 Mexicans would buy 100 tons of them. In 2005, a fire engulfed the same market, touching off a chain of explosions that leveled hundreds of stalls just ahead of Mexico's Independence Day. A similar fire at the market destroyed hundreds of stands in September 2006. After those disasters, various safety measures were put in place, said authorities, who have hailed the market as safe, according to the Univision network. The market was licensed by the Secretariat of National Defense. Juan Ignacio Rodarte Cordero, the director of the Mexican Pyrotechnics Institute, called San Pablito \u201cthe safest pyrotechnics market in all of Latin America,\" according to an August press release from the government of Tultepec, a city of 50,000 in the state of Mexico. The stalls, he boasted at the time, were \u201cdesigned perfectly and with sufficient space\u201d so that a single spark wouldn\u2019t ignite a chain of fires. In a press release last week, the market\u2019s president, German Galicia Cortes, assured visitors that the market was secure, complete with \"fire extinguishers, water, sand, picks,\u00a0shovels and trained personnel who know how to act in case of any incident.\u201d The Mexican attorney general\u2019s office, which is investigating the incident, said in a statement that six explosions shook the market. What set them off remained unclear. But the tragedy seemed certain to raise calls for enhanced safety at San Pablito and other fireworks markets and manufacturing sites.

Firefighters and rescue workers walk through the scorched grounds of Mexico's best-known fireworks market after an explosion Tuesday. (Eduardo Verdugo / Associated Press) The Mexican Red Cross reported that it had dispatched 10 ambulances with 50 paramedics to the scene. Rescue workers were shown on Mexican TV picking their way\u00a0through the ruins of\u00a0 twisted metal, warped roofs and other debris. Ambulance crews rushed the wounded on stretchers to a nearby field, where helicopters were waiting to ferry them off for treatment. The\u00a0scent of gunpowder lingered at the shattered scene, where scores of stalls had been flattened and turned into wreckage. At the Lomas Verdes hospital, north of Mexico City, the waiting room was filled with anxious people hoping for\u00a0word of\u00a0relatives and friends. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about my brother,\u201d said Gloria Arenas, 37, who was looking for Mario Arenas, a fireworks salesman at the market. \u201cMy parents went to other hospitals to look for him and I came here, but they don\u2019t tell us anything. They don\u2019t give us any information. I\u2019m desperate. We don\u2019t know anything about his fate.\u201d Laura Torres, 40, came to look for her father, Gerardo Torres, 64, also a fireworks vendor at the market. She couldn\u2019t hold back tears as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m very worried, the market doesn\u2019t exist anymore, it was destroyed,\u201d said Laura Torres. \u201cAnd my father was right there inside and we don\u2019t know anything about what happened to him. All of my family is looking for him.\u2026 I pray to God that he is alive.\u201d Caption Santa ana police search for suspected thief who steals rolex watch in clever scam David Vasquez lives in Ontario but is now on the run with at least three warrants out for his arrest.

Michael Buholzer/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Michael Buholzer/AFP/Getty Images Ambulance and police cars outside an Islamic center in central Zurich on Monday after three people were injured by gunfire. Police say the gunman later killed himself. Michael Buholzer/AFP/Getty Images Swiss police say a man who shot and wounded three worshippers in a Zurich mosque Monday has no apparent links to radical Islam and appears to have killed himself after the attack. In a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Zurich cantonal police confirmed that a body found under a nearby bridge was the mosque shooter. A pistol was lying nearby. Police say it appears the 22-year-old Swiss man of Ghanaian origin took his own life shortly after storming into the Somali-Islamic center near Zurich's main train station on Monday and opening fire on people praying. Three men, ages 30, 35 and 56, were injured \u2014 two of them seriously. Police say the man, whose name was not released, is also most likely the murderer of a man with South American roots whose body was found in a Zurich playground Sunday morning. The mosque attacker's DNA was found at the playground crime scene. He also seemed to have been acquainted with the playground victim. The attack was a rare case of gun violence in Switzerland and investigators are still puzzling over a motive that set off the chain of events. Article continues after sponsorship \"He is Swiss and we don't know anything about the motives,\" said Christiane Lentjes Meili, head of criminal investigations for the Zurich cantonal police. With the Berlin Christmas market attack claimed by ISIS, terrorism is the first thought in everyone's mind. But Swiss police say there is no apparent link to radical Islam. The man had a juvenile record for assault and bike theft. Lentjes Meili said there are also indications he took an interest in occult sciences. She said it was not clear whether he was mentally ill. Like some other European countries, largely Christian Switzerland has also been wrestling with the role of Islam as its Muslim population grows. Seven years ago Swiss voters approved a nationwide referendum banning the building of new minarets. Worshippers at the mosque, mostly from Somalia, Eritrea and North Africa, were stunned by the intrusion and the shooting. Some told local media they were anxious to know whether they were targeted \"or whether it is just coincidence, that brought him to us,\" said Saad Subaan. One worshipper told newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung that people there were very scared. \"Our children come to the mosque every weekend. But now I wonder if we're still safe here,\" he said. ",

Pat McCrory says he is calling a special legislative session on Wednesday to \"reconsider existing state legislation\" after the Charlotte City Council rescinded its LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance that led to the controversial House Bill 2, known as the bathroom bill. HB2 requires public schools, public college campuses and government agencies to designate multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, such as locker rooms, for use according to the \"biological sex\" stated on people's birth certificate. Under the law, transgender people may not use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity unless they get the sex on their birth certificate changed. The Charlotte City Council voted 10-0 on Monday to rescind the ordinance that led to HB2, The Charlotte Observer reported . After the vote, Gov.-elect Roy Cooper said legislative leaders promised there will be a special session to repeal HB2. Sara D. Davis/Getty Images North Carolina Governor-elect Roy Cooper waves to a crowd at the North Carolina Democratic Watch Party, Nov. 9, 2016, in Raleigh, North Carolina. \"Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore assured me that as a result of Charlotte's vote, a special session will be called for Tuesday to repeal HB2 in full,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"I hope they will keep their word to me and, with the help of Democrats in the legislature, HB2 will be repealed in full. Full repeal will help to bring jobs, sports and entertainment events back and will provide the opportunity for strong LGBT protections in our state.\" Then McCrory said in a video message that he would call the special session for Wednesday. \"Now that the Charlotte ordinance has finally been repealed, the expectation of privacy in our showers, bathrooms and locker rooms is restored and protected under previous state law,\" he said. \"I have always publicly advocated a repeal of the overreaching Charlotte ordinance. But those efforts were blocked by [Charlotte Mayor] Jennifer Roberts, Roy Cooper and other Democratic activists.\" Gerry Broome/AP Photo North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory make remarks concerning House Bill 2 while speaking during a government affairs conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, May 4, 2016. \"This sudden reversal with little notice after the gubernatorial election has ended sadly proves this entire issue, originated by the political left, was all about politics, at the expense of Charlotte and the entire state of North Carolina,\" McCrory said. \"But as I promised months ago, if the Charlotte ordinance was repealed, I would call our General Assembly into a special session to reconsider existing state legislation passed earlier this year. And I'm doing just that for this Wednesday. But it should also be noted that the whole issue of gender identity is a national issue that will be resolved by the courts and the United States Justice Department. Like all of us, I look forward to that resolution and to working with our state legislators in the coming days.\" A statement earlier Monday from McCrory's press secretary Graham Wilson said, \"As promised, Gov. McCrory will call a special session\" but did not give a date. ",

The image was apparently sent in response to Eichenwald\u2019s outspoken criticism of President-elect Donald Trump. Kurt Eichenwald filed a request Monday in Dallas County Court seeking to depose Twitter executives .\u00a0 Eichenwald, who has written about his experience living with epilepsy and having seizures, says in his legal request that the image effectively triggered a seizure. He says the person tweeted a strobe image with the words, \u201cYou deserve a seizure for your posts,\u201d on Dec. 15. The legal filing says Twitter suspended the sender\u2019s account \u201cupon learning of the assault.\u201d In a series of tweets , Eichenwald expressed dismay that anyone would take their disagreement to such extremes. \u201cFolks, if a blind man says things you don\u2019t like, it\u2019s not okay to direct him towards a cliff. Find some humanity,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0 Folks, if a blind man says things you don't like politically, it is not okay to direct him toward the edge of a cliff.

Zurawski said that Urban, who is survived by a wife and teenage son, last had contact with his wife at 3 p.m. local time, but that she couldn\u2019t talk then because she was at work. She said she would call at 4 p.m., but at that point he was no longer answering his phone. Zurawski described unusual movements on the truck\u2019s GPS at 3:45 p.m. that indicate Urban was not in control. \u201cThe car was started up, turned off, driven forward, then backward. As if somebody inside was learning how to drive,\u201d Zurawski said in a separate interview broadcast on TVP Info, the state broadcaster\u2019s all-news network. There was no more movement until 7:40 p.m., when the truck started and traveled some 10 kilometers (six miles), sometimes turning in tight spots or crossing the double line, and arrived at the Christmas market, Zurawski said. Lukasz Wasik, the manager of the Polish trucking company whose truck was used in the attack, described Urban, as a \u201cgood, quiet and honest person\u201d devoted to his work, and the vehicle he drove. \u201cI believe he would not give up the vehicle and would defend it to the end if attacked,\u201d Wasik said in quotes carried by TVP, Poland\u2019s state broadcaster. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "AP December 20, 2016, 8:46 AM Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may have been in wrong spot for two years Details are presented in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in the southern Indian Ocean in this map provided Sept. 24, 2014, by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. AP Photo/Australian Transport Safety Bureau Email SYDNEY - For two years, a handful of ships have diligently combed a remote patch of the Indian Ocean west of Australia in a $160 million bid to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 . On Tuesday, investigators made what was surely a painful admission: They have probably been looking in the wrong place. The latest analysis by a team of international investigators concluded the vanished Boeing 777 is highly unlikely to be in the current search zone and may instead be in a region farther north. But though crews are expected to finish their deep-sea sonar hunt of the current search area next month, the possibility of extending the search to the north appeared doubtful, with Australia\u2019s transport minister suggesting the analysis wasn\u2019t specific enough to justify continuing the hunt. The latest twist in the search for Flight 370 highlights the extraordinary difficulty officials have faced in their attempts to find the aircraft based on the faintest scraps of data. All along, officials have said they are not simply looking for a needle in a haystack - they are looking for the haystack. On Tuesday, the haystack was poised to shift again, with the release of a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the search for the plane. The report is the result of a November meeting of international and Australian experts who re-examined all the data used to define the search area for the aircraft, which vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Investigators say newly-found debris \"almost certainly\" comes from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. One of the two pieces is apparently ... Since the plane disappeared, experts have analyzed a series of exchanges between the aircraft and a satellite to estimate a probable crash site along a vast arc of ocean in the southern hemisphere. A deep-sea search of a 46,000-square mile stretch of water along the arc has so far come up empty. In November, the experts went back over the satellite data, along with the results of a new ocean drift analysis of the more than 20 items of debris likely to have come from the plane that have washed ashore on beaches throughout the Indian Ocean. The analysis, based on where the items washed up and when, suggested the debris originated farther north along the arc from the current search zone. Given the number of aircraft parts found so far, the team concluded that a debris field had floated on the water surface after the plane crashed. So they eliminated areas of the ocean where air crews had searched the surface in the early stages of the hunt. That left a 9,700-square-mile area immediately to the north of the current search zone as the most likely place where the plane hit the ocean, the report said. The investigators concluded with \u201ca high degree of confidence\u201d that the plane is not in the current search area. And they agreed the new area needs to be searched. \u201cThe experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted,\u201d the report said. However, a new search would require fresh funding. The countries involved - Malaysia, Australia and China - agreed in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current effort is exhausted unless new evidence pinpoints the plane\u2019s exact location. Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester suggested an extension was unlikely, noting that the latest report does not give a specific location of the plane. \u201cAs agreed at the Tripartite Ministers meeting in Malaysia in July we will be suspending the search unless credible evidence is available that identifies the specific location of the aircraft,\u201d Chester said in a statement. \u201cThe search for MH370 has been the largest in aviation history and has tested the limits of technology, and the capacity of our experts and people at sea.\u201d The grieving and questions continue over the mystery of what happened to MH370 two years later Malaysia\u2019s Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai did not explicitly rule out a new search, but said in a statement, \u201cWe remain to be guided as to how this can be used to assist us in identifying the specific location of the aircraft.\u201d When asked about the search, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson did not comment beyond noting China\u2019s role in the effort so far. Australian government oceanographer David Griffin, who worked on the analysis of how the debris drifted, said he is confident the plane is in the newly identified search area. And he dismissed the idea that the new analysis means the search to date has been a wasted effort, saying that the current search zone was based on the best available data at the time. \u201cIt could have been where we were searching, absolutely, but the new information does clarify that immediately north is more likely,\u201d Griffin said. As part of their analysis, Griffin and his team built replicas of the first piece of debris that was found - a wing fragment known as a flaperon that was discovered on Reunion Island off the African coast in July 2015. The team then set the replicas adrift, measuring how fast they traveled and noting how much the wind influences their rate of speed. They then ran computer simulations of how the aircraft parts could have drifted, which helped paint a picture of where they originated. The newly identified search zone does include an area that was searched very early on in the hunt, but crews didn\u2019t comb a wide enough area to rule it out, Griffin said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go quite far enough away from the arc to cover all possibilities,\u201d he said. The fact that crews were so close to the area now identified as the likeliest crash site - coupled with the lack of commitment to search the new area - is sure to frustrate families of those on board, who have been pushing the governments to continue searching. \u201cThey should keep searching no matter how much money they will spend,\u201d said Li Jingxin, whose brother was on the plane. \u201cThe cost of the search has nothing to do with us relatives. They should also raise the amount of compensation (to families) to make up for the time lost while they searched the wrong place.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

A new report suggests they might be looking in the wrong place. ATSB The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is probably outside the stretch of ocean that international search ships have scoured for the past two years, a \" first principles review \" has concluded. The findings, based on a fresh analysis of satellite data, recovered debris and other information, suggest that the plane may in fact lie within a roughly 10,000-square-mile (25,000-square-km) patch to the north of the existing search area. \"The experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted,\" the report states.

ATSB Flight 370 vanished from radar on March 8, 2014, during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Fragmentary evidence from military radars and \"pings\" from the plane's own satellite communications system suggested that the Boeing 777 executed a series of turns that eventually led it to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean. Authorities believe it crashed somewhere along a long arc of ocean, after exhausting its fuel supplies. Article continues after sponsorship In July 2015, a fragment of the plane washed up on the shores of La R\u00e9union , a small island off the African coast. Since that time, more than 20 other pieces of debris have been recovered along beaches in places like Madagascar, Mauritius, Tanzania and South Africa. A piece of engine cowling covered in barnacles recovered from a South African beach. Debris such as this has led to a revision of the search area. ATSB hide caption toggle caption ATSB A piece of engine cowling covered in barnacles recovered from a South African beach. Debris such as this has led to a revision of the search area. ATSB The new conclusions appear to be based largely on scientific models of how the debris pieces might have drifted across the ocean. Oceanographers with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation conducted extensive drift analysis which indicated it was more likely the plane had gone down north of the existing search area. The first principles team also took a look at likely flight modes of the aircraft, and new information about how it crashed . The fresh analysis, coupled with the fact that the plane hasn't turned up in the 42,000 square miles (110,000 square km) searched so far, has led to a new search zone. The review team says that \"based on the analysis to date, completion of this area would exhaust all prospective areas for the presence of MH370.\" Still, it remains uncertain whether the new zone will be searched. Last July, Malaysia, Australia and China, which are funding the search, said they would not extend it. Operations are currently set to wrap up in early 2017. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Who knows yet whether the terrorist behind the attack knew much about the site, but before the war, it was the beating heart of western Berlin, a bustling hub bedazzled by bright movie theater marquees and flashing neon signs, thronged by cabaretgoers, echoing, night and day, with the chatter of revelers and the sounds of honking buses and streetcar bells. After the war, it remained a commercial center for the divided city, the West\u2019s version, more or less, of Herald Square or Piccadilly Circus. By then, West Berlin had become a disconnected island in the midst of a hostile country, a cultural petri dish and sanctuary for West Germans who wanted to skip military service and collect a state pension. The pubs were open late. Advertisement Continue reading the main story With reunification, the gravitational energy of the city moved east and the west dimmed. But the area retained its other meaning. I\u2019m talking about the enduring symbolism of the church, which is officially called the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Consecrated in 1895, long before the Second World War, it was built to celebrate Germany \u2019s victory in the Franco-Prussian War. Photo The Christmas market in 1929. Before World War II, the area was the beating heart of western Berlin. Credit Herbert Hoffmann/Ullstein Bild, via Getty Images Fast-forward half a century, when Allied bombs struck the church in 1943. The jagged silhouette of the broken spire became a signpost of German madness. After the war, East Germany rebuilt historic landmarks, hoping to erase the memory of Nazism. But West Berliners preserved the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche as a ruin \u2014 a testament to the destruction and terror Germans brought upon themselves, a daily reminder never to forget. So the site has had layers of meaning. My friend Uli Kempendorff, who grew up in East Berlin, emailed me on Monday night. He described the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche as \u201cemotionally charged, especially for West Berliners.\u201d I wrote to ask him whether Berliners had somehow felt exempt from the sort of attacks that have wracked cities like London, Paris and Nice, France. He replied: \u201cI think people might have felt safer in Berlin because of the enormous civic support here for refugees and because of Germany \u2019s openness. Also we Germans like to tell ourselves we are \u2018clean,\u2019 despite drone attacks flown from Ramstein and the C.I.A.\u2019s extraordinary renditions via Leipzig airport and support in one form or another for all the U.S. wars since Yugoslavia. But to be honest I thought it was just a matter of time before something like this happened.\u201d Then I spoke with Elisabeth Ruge, another longtime Berliner, who expressed heartbreak \u201cfor the people who lost their lives and were severely injured \u2014 but also for Berlin and the way we live.\u201d She explained: \u201cOn the one hand, Berlin is a very unstable city, economically speaking, compared to Munich or Hamburg \u2014 with problems of job security, and gentrification. But on the other hand, it is a place that has dealt well with so many of the problems we face across Western Europe, with immigration, with regards to Russia, in rebuilding ourselves after the collapse of the totalitarian state as a tolerant and open city.\u201d That\u2019s what the crash at the Christmas market really targeted, she said. And as if on cue, right-wing German populists from the surging Alternative for Germany party took to social media on Monday to blame the country\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel , for welcoming migrants, calling the victims \u201cAngela\u2019s dead.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a response that brought to mind an essay written years ago, criticizing the area around the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche for being too cosmopolitan \u2014 a meeting place for different kinds of people, for \u201charlots\u201d and \u201cso-called men\u201d and for people speaking \u201call the languages of the world.\u201d The essayist expressed contempt for what he called \u201cthe spirit of the asphalt democracy\u201d and predicted a \u201cday of judgment.\u201d That was in 1928.

By Darryl Fears and Juliet Eilperin December 20 at 4:21 PM Follow @bydarrylfears Follow @eilperin Hundreds of kayaktivists protest drilling in the Arctic and the Port of Seattle being used as a port for the Shell Oil drilling rig Polar Pioneer (Daniella Beccaria/seattlepi.com via Associated Press) President Obama moved to solidify his environmental legacy Tuesday by withdrawing hundreds of millions of acres of federally owned land in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean from new offshore oil and gas drilling. Obama used a little-known law called the\u00a0Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect large portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in the Arctic and a string of canyons in the Atlantic stretching from Massachusetts to Virginia. In addition to a five-year moratorium already in place in the Atlantic, removing the canyons from drilling puts much of the eastern seaboard off limits to oil exploration even if companies develop plans to operate around them. The announcement by the White House late in the afternoon was coordinated with similar steps being taken by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to shield large areas of that nation\u2019s Arctic waters from drilling. Neither measure affects leases already held by oil and gas companies and drilling activity in state waters. \u201cThese actions, and Canada\u2019s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThey reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region\u2019s harsh conditions is limited. White House officials described their actions to make the areas off limits to future oil and gas exploration and drilling as indefinite. Officials said the withdrawals under Section 12-A of the 1953 act used by presidents dating to Dwight Eisenhower cannot be undone by an incoming president. It is not clear if a Republican-controlled Congress can rescind Obama\u2019s action. [ What President Obama\u2019s executive actions mean for President Trump ] \u201cThere is a precedent of more than half a century of this authority being utilized by presidents of both parties,\u201d a White House aide said. \u201cThere is no authority for subsequent presidents to un-withdraw. . . . I can\u2019t speak to what a future Congress will do.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. is not acting alone today. Canada is acting to put an indefinite stop to activity in its waters as well,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWith Canada, we send a powerful signal and reinforce our commitment to work together.\u201d David Rivkin, an attorney for the Baker and Hostetler law firm who served on the White House Counsel staffs of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, disagreed with the assertion that the decision cannot be overturned. \u201cBasically I say the power to withdraw entails the power to un-withdraw,\u201d Rivkin said, \u201cespecially if you determine the justification for the original withdrawal is no longer valid.\u201d A legal fight would likely follow, Rivkin said. But \u201cit\u2019s not clear why Congress would want to give a president tremendous authority operating only one way.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) responded sharply on Twitter: \u201cYet another Obama abuse of power. Hopefully, on[e] that will be reversed\u2026exactly one month from today\u201d after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Cruz closed his tweet with a hashtag: \u201cTaking away Obama\u2019s pen and phone.\u201d U.S. and Canadian officials have negotiated for months to reach a joint understanding on how to manage adjacent areas in the ocean in an effort to make the new protections as sweeping and politically durable as possible. Meanwhile,\u00a0advocacy groups lobbied Obama to ban oil and gas leasing in the Arctic entirely. President Obama banned oil drilling in large areas of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, using a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. (The White House) Obama already invoked the\u00a0Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to safeguard Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay in 2014, and again last year to protect part of Alaska\u2019s Arctic coast. The president has protected 125 million acres in the region in the last two years, according to a fact sheet issued by the White House. The Beaufort and Chukchi seas are habitat for several species listed as endangered and species that are candidates for the endangered species, including\u00a0the bowhead whale, fin whale, Pacific walrus and polar bear. Concern for the animals has heightened as the Arctic warms faster than anywhere else in the world and sea ice the bears use to hunt continues to melt. The underwater canyons protected by the president cover nearly 4 million acres across the Atlantic continental shelf break, \u201crunning from Heezen Canyon offshore New England to Norfolk Canyon offshore the Chesapeake Bay,\u201d according to a separate fact sheet. They are widely recognized as major biodiversity hotspots that are critical to fisheries. The canyons provide deep water corals used by a wide array of fish. The area also provides habitat \u201cfor . . . deepwater corals, deep diving beaked whales, commercially valuable fishes, and significant numbers of habitat-forming soft and hard corals, sponges, and crabs,\u201d the White House said. The American Petroleum Institute denounced the decision. \u201cThe administration\u2019s decision to remove key Arctic and Atlantic offshore areas from future leasing consideration ignores congressional intent, our national security, and vital, good-paying job opportunities for our shipyards, unions, and businesses of all types across the country,\u201d said Erik Milito, the group\u2019s Upstream director. \u201cOur national security depends on our ability to produce oil and natural gas here in the United States,\u201d Milito said. \u201cThis proposal would take us in the wrong direction just as we have become world leader in production and refining of oil and natural gas and in reduction of carbon emissions.\u201d Contradicting the White House\u2019s statement, Milito said\u00a0George W. Bush removed previous 12-A withdrawal areas with a memorandum and made all but marine sanctuaries available for leasing.\u00a0\u201cWe are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this decision as the nation continues to need a robust strategy for developing offshore and onshore energy,\u201d he said. But a wide range of conservation groups hailed the decision. League of Conservation Voters President\u00a0Gene Karpinski called it \u201can incredible holiday gift,\u201d saying that \u201can\u00a0oil spill in these pristine waters would be\u00a0devastating to the wildlife and people who live\u00a0in the region.\u201d Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it\u00a0\u201ca historic victory in our fight to save our Arctic and Atlantic waters, marine life, coastal communities and all they support.\u201d Carter Roberts, president and chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund, applauded what he called \u201ca bold decision\u201d that \u201csignals some places are just too important not to protect.\u201d Oil production in the Arctic represents a tenth of one percent of the nation\u2019s oil production overall, the White House said. The area is so sensitive and so remote that the economics of exploration is costly. Shell, which said in September 2015 that it would shelve drilling plans after spending $7 billion and not finding significant amounts of oil, still has one remaining lease in the Chukchi Sea where it drilled a well earlier last year. Shell is also part of a joint venture with Italian oil giant ENI and Spanish firm Repsol in the Beaufort Sea that holds 13 leases. Shell held other leases in the Beaufort Sea, which the company transferred to the Arctic Slope Regional Corp., a company belonging to the Native Americans in the region. An earlier plan to allow limited drilling off the Atlantic coast was shelved after state governments along the southern Atlantic coasts \u2014 including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia \u2014 expressed worries over the effect on their beaches, tourist industry and environmentally sensitive marsh. The Navy also objected. The Pentagon provided Interior with a map\u00a0\u201cthat identifies locations \u2026\u00a0areas where the [Defense\u2019s]\u00a0offshore readiness activities are not compatible, partially compatible or minimally impacted by oil and gas activities,\u201d department spokesman Matthew Allen said. The map included nearly the entire proposed drilling area. Live training exercises are conducted off the Atlantic coast, \u201cfrom unit level training to major joint service and fleet exercises,\u201d Allen said in a statement. \u201cThese live training events are fundamental to the ability of our airmen, sailors, and marines to attain and sustain the highest levels of military readiness.\u201d The Obama administration eventually closed the Atlantic to drilling for five years. President-elect Donald Trump could counter Obama\u2019s plan with his own five-year plan, but even so it would be years before drilling could start. The president-elect\u2019s authority to undo a permanent prohibition is unclear. But Congress, controlled by Republicans, could move to rescind the withdrawal of federal lands from oil and gas exploration. Read more at Energy & Environment: ",

Video of the blast showed a dramatic staccato of rockets exploding in flashes of light, leveling the open-air San Pablito Market in Tultepec in Mexico State as it bustled with shoppers stocking up on fireworks to celebrate Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\u00a0 Vendors\u2019 stands were reduced to piles of rubble, ash, and charred metal. It was the third devastating explosion and fire to ravage the market since 2005 and officials still have not said what caused this latest blast.\u00a0 10:39 p.m. ET: Tultepec Mayor Armando Portuguez Fuentes said the market was especially well stocked because demand for noisy firecrackers and rockets soars this time of year.\u00a0 \u201cWe are obviously in the high season,\u201d Portuguez said. \u201cThere was more product than usual because we are a few days away from Christmas, a few days away from New Year\u2019s, and those are the days when the products made here are consumed the most.\u201d\u00a0 9:40 p.m. ET:\u00a0The governor of the State of Mexico says three more people have died from a massive chain-reaction at a fireworks market near the capital, raising the death toll to 29. Gov. Eruviel Avila says that in addition to the 26 people who perished at the market, three more died after being hospitalized. The San Pablito fireworks market was bustling with hundreds of shoppers stocking up on explosives to set off during the holidays when the explosion took place. It is the third such blast to ravage the market on the northern outskirts of the capital since 2005. 8:52 p.m. ET: Mexico State Gov. Eruviel Avila said in an interview with FORO TV that \u201cMexico is in mourning.\u201d 8:36 p.m. ET: Witness Crescencia Francisco Garcia said she was in the middle of the grid of stalls along with a few hundred others when the thunderous explosions began. She froze, reflexively looked up at the sky and then took off running through the smoke once she realized everyone was doing so. As she ran she saw people with burns and cuts, and lots of blood.\u00a0 \u201cEverything was catching fire. Everything was exploding,\u201d Francisco said. \u201cThe stones were flying, pieces of brick, everything was flying.\u201d\u00a0 Cesar Ornelas of Atizapan de Zaragoza was only 10 minutes into shopping with his son and his father when he heard the first explosions. He tried to run, but something knocked him to the ground from behind. He tried several times to get up, unsuccessfully, and ultimately his 15-year-old son Francisco had to drag him out.\u00a0 \u201cWe didn\u2019t look back,\u201d said Ornelas, who suffered light burns and a large bruise over his left kidney. His white tank top had a fist-size burn on the chest. \u201cWe heard how the explosion was kind of going off bit by bit.\u201d Nearly four hours later, he and Francisco limped gingerly out of the market area. Francisco said paramedics told him his leg was likely fractured by flying debris. Ornelas said his 67-year-old father, Ernesto, had run in a different direction and sought refuge in a nearby home. All the father\u2019s clothing was burned, and his face and arm were bloodied. An ambulance had spirited him to a hospital, but Ornelas wasn\u2019t sure where it was or how serious his injuries were. 8:18 p.m. ET: According to local journalist Rodrigo Hernandez Lopez, Avila said there were 29 people killed. Three injured children will be moved to Texas for treatment, Lopez reported.\u00a0 De acuerdo con @eruviel_avila hay 29 muertos en explosi\u00f3n de Tultepec y tres menores de edad que ser\u00e1n trasladados a Texas por quemaduras. \u2014 Rodrigo Hdz L\u00f3pez (@lopezperiodista) December 21, 2016 8:03 p.m. ET: \u00a0As more reports come in from the scene, the death toll remains in flux. The chief prosecutor of Mexico State told the Associated Press that 26 people have been killed in an explosion that tore through a fireworks market near Mexico City. The blast leveled stalls and left rescue workers to comb through ash and charred metal. Similar fires and explosions destroyed hundreds of stands in two other incidents at the same market in 2005 and 2006. 7:07 p.m. ET: President Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted his condolences to the family of the victims.\u00a0 \u201cMy condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this accident and my wishes for a quick recovery for the injured,\u201d Nieto tweeted. Mis condolencias a los familiares de quienes perdieron la vida en este accidente y mis deseos de pronta recuperaci\u00f3n para los lesionados. \u2014 Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (@EPN) December 20, 2016 6:48 p.m. ET: Head of Civil Defense, Isidro Sanchez, a local First Responder, said 27 people had died.\u00a0 Sirens wailed and a heavy scent of gunpowder lingered in the air after the afternoon blast at the market, where most of the fireworks stalls were completely leveled. The smoking, burned out shells of vehicles ringed the perimeter, and first responders and local residents wearing blue masks over their mouths combed through the rubble and ash. Firefighters hosed down still-smoldering hotspots. ",

Orlando Ruiz / Twitter An explosion blasted Mexico's best-known fireworks market on the northern outskirts of the capital Tuesday, killing over two dozen people and injuring scores more while sending a huge plume of charcoal-gray smoke into the sky, officials said. The explosion, which was not being linked to terrorism, happened at the open-air San Pablito Market in Tultepec, in the State of Mexico. \"The death toll increases to 27 dead and more than 80 injured. The most critical are being transported by helicopter to various hospitals,\" Tultepec emergency services said in a Facebook post. Images from the scene showed smoke rising from the scorched ground and fireworks stands. Emergency crews were attending to victims and hosing down hotspots.

Daniella Beccaria / Associated Press An offshore oil drilling rig in Port Angeles, Wash., that had been slated for use in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast. An offshore oil drilling rig in Port Angeles, Wash., that had been slated for use in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast. (Daniella Beccaria / Associated Press) Evan Halper and Evan Halper Contact Reporter Invoking a rarely used provision in federal law, the Obama administration on Tuesday announced a permanent ban on offshore drilling in broad parts of the Arctic and Atlantic coasts \u2014 a sweeping and controversial move that will help secure the president\u2019s environmental legacy even as critics vowed to reverse it. The ban relies on the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which says the president \u201cmay, from time to time, withdraw\u201d federal waters from oil and gas development that are not already leased. It was announced as part of a joint action with Canada, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also made long-term, though not permanent, commitments to protect the Arctic from drilling. Obama cited the Arctic\u2019s \u201cunique ecosystem,\u201d the risk of damage from a spill, the high cost of working in the remote and frigid region and concerns about climate change. \u201cIt would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region \u2013 at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels,\u201d the president said in a written statement. The announcement, coming one month to the day before Obama is to be succeeded by President-elect Donald Trump , is intended to help counter plans by the incoming administration to vastly expand energy extraction by fossil fuel companies. Trump made clear his intentions for robust new drilling during the campaign, and his appointment to key cabinet posts of longtime loyalists to the oil industry has alarmed environmentalists. Major conservation groups had been pushing Obama in recent weeks to put the offshore areas off limits in perpetuity. Few things define California to the rest of the world like its\u00a0coast, from the sandy beaches of Southern California to the stunning vistas of Big Sur and\u00a0the rugged north coast. Nearly 50 years ago, the state got a taste of how damaging an offshore oil spill can be when 3 million gallons\u00a0of crude... Few things define California to the rest of the world like its\u00a0coast, from the sandy beaches of Southern California to the stunning vistas of Big Sur and\u00a0the rugged north coast. Nearly 50 years ago, the state got a taste of how damaging an offshore oil spill can be when 3 million gallons\u00a0of crude... (The Times Editorial Board) Past presidents, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, have invoked the law to issue temporary bans. Obama\u2019s action appears to be the first time the law has been used to impose a permanent drilling ban \u2013 and it is almost certain to be challenged. A senior administration official said Tuesday that the White House was \u201cquite confident\u201d that the decision could not be undone by Trump, noting that the law specifies no provision for reversal. The official suggested that overturning the ban could require years of legal action and the passage of a bill in Congress. Some oil industry leaders said they believed the next administration could easily reverse it. They cited a 2008 memorandum by President George W. Bush that lifted a temporary ban in certain offshore areas imposed by President Clinton. \u201cFortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, and we look forward to working with the new administration on fulfilling the will of American voters on energy production,\u201d wrote Erik Milito\u00a0of the American Petroleum Institute. Yet environmental groups say the\u00a02008 reversal left intact other permanent changes Clinton made. Under the 1953 law, a presidential order that explicitly states that it is intended to be permanent, and is designed to address an \u201carticulated purpose,\u201d would likely stand up to legal challenges, lawyers for two conservation groups, Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote in a legal brief on the issue last month. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0 How much the decision might change the situation in the Arctic is unclear. Only one company, Royal Dutch Shell , has conducted exploratory drilling in the region in recent years. Last year, after spending more more than seven years and $7 billion preparing, Shell abandoned its plan after a single summer of drilling, citing disappointing results. On Tuesday, an administration official estimated it could take decades \u2014 and a doubling or tripling of the price of oil \u2014 to make drilling in the Arctic appealing to many companies. The administration emphasized that oil and gas exploration have thrived in other parts of the country at far less expense. While the Arctic is believed to hold vast reserves, it currently provides 0.1% of the nation\u2019s crude oil production. None of the companies that hold the 42 active leases\u00a0in the Arctic\u2019s Beaufort Sea is currently pursuing drilling. Still, with Trump promising to unleash a wave of fossil fuel development, the announcement is another example of Obama moving to shield his legacy of environmental protection. If and how Trump might undo various policies have been\u00a0constant questions. Some rules are fairly easily reversible;\u00a0others could require years of regulatory processes to change. Trump has suggested he could walk away from the landmark agreement on global warming Obama signed with other countries in Paris last year, as well as scrap the Obama administration\u2019s signature effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants. Trump has promised to champion coal power, eliminate subsidies for green energy programs and broadly relax federal environmental regulations. His pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is a climate change skeptic who has led state efforts to resist the agency\u2019s authority. His choice for Energy Secretary, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has also expressed doubts about human-caused climate change and is a close ally of the oil industry. Canada\u2019s role in the announcement on Tuesday follows a commitment Obama and Trudeau made in March to collaborate on Arctic issues as declining sea ice from climate change is stirring new interest and posing new risks in the region. While Canada also banned drilling in its Arctic region, its ban would be reviewed after five years. The nations also pledged to work together to define \u201clow-impact shipping corridors\u201d to protect the Arctic\u2019s endangered whales and other species as well as the subsistence hunting and fishing practices of indigenous people.\u00a0 The announcement includes a ban on drilling in large parts of the Atlantic, from New England to the Chesapeake Bay, where the U.S. administration is seeking to protect underwater canyons, some deeper than the Grand Canyon. Many are what scientists call\u00a0biodiversity \u201chot spots,\u201d providing homes to corals, beaked whales, fish, sponges and crabs. Officials say preserving the canyons will ensure better health for commercial fish populations. But the big news was in the Arctic, long a stage for conservation battles. While 3.8 million acres are being protected in the Atlantic, 115 million are set aside in the Arctic.\u00a0The ban there includes all of the Chukchi Sea and the vast majority of the Beaufort off the coast of Alaska, leaving out a portion near state waters and the onshore drilling fields of the North Slope. That area, the administration noted, includes known oil reserves, and its proximity to existing infrastructure and spill-response equipment somewhat reduces risks of serious damage from a drilling mishap. That area already had not been designated for leasing in the federal government\u2019s upcoming five-year program for the Outer Continental Shelf, which begins in 2017. Just last month,\u00a0the administration said it would not sell new leases for drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic through 2022. That announcement also blocked expansion in the Pacific, leaving the Gulf of Mexico as the primary offshore production area. While many lawmakers on the East Coast supported Tuesday\u2019s decision, Alaska\u2019s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticized it and other moves by the administration that have restricted oil development in that state, including previously announced protections for a wide swath of western Alaska and Bristol Bay, home to one of the world\u2019s largest runs of wild salmon.

Schumer posted a screengrab on Instagram on Monday of her delivering the news to her father on a video call. \"Today I bought my father's farm back,\" she wrote in the caption. She also posted a video of herself as a pig-tailed little girl, standing, talking, walking, pouting, in a vast cornfield on the farm,\u00a0as the stalks swayed above her head. A video posted by @amyschumer on Dec 19, 2016 at 1:42pm PST \"Video from the farm when I was running away in the cornfield and my dad was taunting me because I wanted him to come with me. We lost the farm when we lost everything else. But today I got to buy it back for him,\" she wrote in the caption. Schumer didn't say where the farm is located, but she spent part of her childhood on Long Island, the daughter of a family made wealthy by her father's successful furniture company in Manhattan. But the family went bankrupt when she was about nine, and soon her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Three years later, her parents divorced,\u00a0she told the New York Times in 2013. Judging from some of the comments on her Instagram, Schumer's act was a hit with her fans. \"Best story on the internet is amy buying back her childhood farm ! She is a class act !\" posted jenpudgecurran . \"So inspiring,\" added aseaanchorking . Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Russian investigators on Tuesday inspected the art gallery in the Turkish capital of Ankara where Ambassador Andrey Karlov was shot dead Monday evening by Mevlut Mert Altintas. The 22-year-old gunman, a member of Ankara's riot police squad, had shouted slogans about the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo as he killed the envoy. RELATED: Photographer Who Captured Ambassador's Assassination Recounts Shooting Russia's entrance into Syria's war helped turn the tide of the conflict and heralded a series of victories for government forces. Up until a few months ago, the Russian military was bombing rebel positions in Aleppo. The senior government official described the killing as \"fully professional, not a one-man action\" and said the attack was well-planned. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because he was not authorized to release details to the press.

Still, Turkish police have detained seven people in connection with the gunman: his parents, sister, three other relatives and his roommate in Ankara, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported. According to the news agency, Altintas took leave from work and on Dec. 14 made a hotel reservation near the art exhibition center. He arrived at the hotel on Monday. Police searched his hotel room, which was later sealed. Andrey Karlov, the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, speaks at a photo exhibition in Ankara moments before a gunman (seen rear on the left) opened fire on him on Monday. Burhan Ozbilici / AP Karlov's body was flown home to Moscow on Tuesday afternoon after an emotional ceremony at Ankara Airport attended by Turkish government officials and diplomats. Karlov's wife, Marina Karlova, wept as her husband's flag-draped coffin was carried by a Turkish honor guard. She laid two red carnations on the coffin before it was loaded onto the aircraft. RELATED: Andrey Karlov, Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Fatally Shot at Museum \"Ambassador Karlov has become the eternal symbol of Turkish-Russian friendship,\" Deputy Prime Minister Tugrul Turkes said at the ceremony. Turkey and Russia, which have backed opposing sides in the Syrian war, vowed not to let the killing disrupt efforts to repair their ties. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he spoke by phone Monday night, were \"in agreement that this was an open provocation.\" The street of the Russian Embassy in Ankara will be named after Ambassador Karlov. pic.twitter.com/mT90m5MEG7 \u2014 Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu (@MevlutCavusoglu) December 20, 2016 A joint investigation was being conducted into the ambassador's death, he said. \"Together with Mr. Putin, we have an understanding that our cooperation, especially in Syria, will not be affected by this attack.\" The Associated Press ",

She stopped the shower and sat down. The pain abated. Later, while driving her other children to a violin lesson, the chest pain returned: this time it didn't subside. A concerned neighbor took her straight to the emergency department. There, the medical staff worked quickly, taking EKGs and pumping her with IV fluids. The tests revealed a heart attack. \"It's really a blur, I just remember being given a little cup with maybe 30 baby aspirin,\" says Hess of the heart attack which occurred in 2008. \"I just kept saying to the nurse, I have to be okay, I have this 17-day-old baby.\" An angiogram found nothing; her arteries were clear. She began exercising more regularly and even started weightlifting. But six years later, during a Fourth of July trip in Wisconsin, it happened again. Only this time it was a full cardiac arrest. \"I didn't have pulse,\" says Hess. \"I had about 45 minutes of CPR and I was shocked about 10 times before they could get me back into a normal rhythm.\" Related: 5 Things to Know About Sudden Heart Attacks After Hess's second heart attack, it became clear that this was not a postpartum complication \u2014 she was diagnosed with spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. \"I didn't have pulse,\" says Hess. \"I had about 45 minutes of CPR and I was shocked about 10 times before they could get me back into a normal rhythm.\" \"SCAD is a type of heart attack, but completely different than the one we normally think of,\" says cardiologist Dr. Sharonne Hayes of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. \"It's caused by a split or tear in an otherwise healthy artery that leads to a drop in blood flow to the heart leading to a heart attack.\" Researchers are discovering that SCAD heart attacks occur more frequently than once thought. The most vulnerable are younger women who are otherwise healthy, with normal blood pressure and no risk factors for heart disease. The average age of those affected is 42-years-old, with roughly 10 to 20 percent being new mothers or pregnant. The condition can also affect men. Play ",

    "text": "WATCH Swiss: No Terror or Far-Right Ties in Zurich Mosque Attack 0 Shares Email Swiss police have found no radical Islamist or far-right motives by a gunman who killed himself after carrying out a shooting spree at Zurich mosque that wounded three worshippers, a top police official said Tuesday. Authorities are still investigating the possible motive of the 24-year-old Swiss citizen of Ghanaian origin with a penchant for the occult who carried out Monday's shootings in Switzerland's largest city. The incident had stirred concerns about possible extremist violence in the mostly peaceful Alpine country that, like others in mostly Christian Europe, has been wrestling with its relationship to its Muslim communities. The suspect, who was not identified by name but had a criminal record for a bike theft years ago, had only days earlier repeatedly stabbed and killed an acquaintance of South American origin with whom he had been arguing. \"There's no indication of any kind of terrorist connection to (the radical Islamic State group), or an Islamic radicalization of the suspect,\" Zurich state criminal police chief Christiane Lentjes Meili said of the mosque shootings. She said no links to any far-right movements were found either. A Zurich city police spokesman said Monday that the gunman, dressed in dark clothes, stormed the mosque's prayer hall and opened fire on worshippers, wounding three people before fleeing. The mosque is frequented by Somali migrants. Zurich police on Tuesday suspended the hunt for the suspected gunman after a body was found in the vicinity, which turned out to be that of the assailant. \"It became quickly clear that the person killed himself,\" Lentjes Meili said, without elaborating. \u2014\u2014\u2014 George Jahn in Vienna and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

He watched the Cubs in the playoffs at Chicago Bros. Pizzeria, where he poses for a photo on Dec. 18, 2016. Michael Wester, a former Chicago Cubs season ticket holder who had his seat privileges revoked by the team, lives in San Diego. He watched the Cubs in the playoffs at Chicago Bros. Pizzeria, where he poses for a photo on Dec. 18, 2016. (John Gastaldo / Chicago Tribune) Patrick M. O'Connell Chicago Tribune When the Cubs told Michael Wester his season tickets were not being renewed, he was upset but not surprised. After all, he made a bundle of money selling seats to coveted postseason games at Wrigley Field . Wester readily admits he sold more than 85 percent of his tickets, in upper deck sections 506 and 514, during the championship season. Cracking down on fans like Wester, the Cubs say, is a way to keep tickets in the hands of people who actually plan on attending the games. It is also a way for them to try to maximize revenues, or at least prevent others from profiting handsomely over their popular product, those who study the sports business said. \"The tension that we see is teams are looking to exert more control over the secondary market,\" said Matt Notowidigdo, associate professor of economics at Northwestern University who has done consulting work with several MLB teams, including the Boston Red Sox. Major League Baseball's official partnership with StubHub makes it easier than ever for fans to sell and buy tickets with a few clicks of a button or swipes of the finger. For high-demand teams like the Cubs, the puzzle is how to capture the maximum amount of dollars without alienating loyal and longtime fans, while keeping at least some prices affordable for the average fan, those who study sports business said. The Cubs' season ticket holder agreement, like others in the league, states the team can revoke a person's ticket for any reason at any time, a concept known as \"revocable license.\" Cubs season ticket licenses are renewed on a yearly basis, the club said, \"at the sole discretion of the team.\" The license agreement includes language advising fans their plan may be canceled if tickets have been purchased \"for the purpose and intent of reselling the tickets on the secondary market.\" Cubs fans. \"When you have a situation like this, where the demand is pent up for so long, baseball is uniquely positioned where our season ends just as the holiday season starts,\" MLB Business Executive Vice President Noah Garden said. \"Generally we see... Looks like it will be a Blue Christmas for Cubs fans. \"When you have a situation like this, where the demand is pent up for so long, baseball is uniquely positioned where our season ends just as the holiday season starts,\" MLB Business Executive Vice President Noah Garden said. \"Generally we see... (Phil Rosenthal) The team did not disclose how many other season ticket holders have received nonrenewal notices since the Cubs won the World Series but said it was not more than a typical offseason. \"The issue is getting tickets in the hands of fans who are primarily interested in enjoying Cubs baseball and experiencing Wrigley Field,\" Cubs spokesman Julian Green said. Wester, a 29-year-old who grew up as a Cubs fan in Mount Prospect and now lives in San Diego, attended about a half-dozen games in person. He called the Cubs \"hypocritical\" for saying they cater to the average fan, then canceling his plan when he made money selling his sought-after tickets. \"Where were they during the three or four years that I was doing this when I was losing money? They did absolutely nothing,\" Wester said. \"To me, it's like they want to have their cake and eat it, too.\" The Cubs' move is hardly unprecedented, both in the team's recent history and among other MLB teams. After a 101-loss season in 2012, the Cubs revoked nearly 1,000 season tickets from about 40 customers suspected of scalping. And in 1991, former major league ballplayer Eric Soderholm, who held 18 Cubs season tickets, took the team to court after it yanked his privileges because he was hawking the seats through his ticket broker business. He lost. \"Basically, it's a take-it-or-leave-it situation,\" said Lawrence Wolf Levin, a lawyer who represented Soderholm in the case. \"That was my concept of the law then, as it is now. (The Cubs) pretty much are doing what they want to do, when they want to.\" Chicago Tribune photographers pick their best Cubs photos from 2016. The Indians, the Cubs' opponent in the Series, revoked the season tickets of several fans on the eve of the Fall Classic because their season ticket holder agreement prohibits fans from reselling postseason games. There is a big difference between the attitudes of high-demand teams like the Cubs, and other clubs where sellouts are rare and popularity is lower, Notowidigdo said. \"Some teams have a hands-off approach, and some take a very proactive stance,\" on ticket resales, Notowidigdo said. Teams that feel they are missing out on revenues are more apt to revoke seat privileges. \"A stronger predictor of teams' attitudes is underlying demand,\" Notowidigdo said. The Cubs drew more than 3.2 million fans in 2016, fifth-highest in the majors at more than 39,900 per game. The team said 2016 regular-season tickets resold on StubHub.com for an average of 96 percent above their face value. Postseason tickets went for 670 percent above face value, including a 1,206 percent increase for the three World Series games at Wrigley Field. According to the Cubs season ticket license agreement, the club has \"absolute discretion\" on whether to offer fans seats. The White Sox have similar language in their contract. After waiting a lifetime for a championship team, Cubs fans will discover the price of success. The average price of season tickets will rise 19.5 percent in 2017, the Cubs announced Monday, with increases ranging from 6 percent for upper-deck reserved seats to 31 percent for infield club box seats. ...

Because the Cardinals are pumping a Cubs ticket package these days. There are other packages, such as bobbleheads, yeesh,... (Steve Rosenbloom) \"What the team is really hoping to do is make sure they're continuing the revenue,\" said Mark S. Nagel, a professor of sport and entertainment at the University of South Carolina. \"Underlying this is the concern for the bottom line because other people are making a profit on the tickets.\" Nagel, who teaches classes and has written about ticket rights, said revocable licenses with sports team tickets are not new, and \"99 percent of the time, it's not a problem.\" When season ticket agreements either spell out specific guidelines or limits for reselling tickets or give teams \"absolute discretion\" to revoke seats, fans should know the ground rules, Nagel said. \"That's really tough to say that's unfair,\" Nagel said. Ticket agreements with fans, Nagel said, are designed to allow clubs to make sure their arenas are free of misbehavior or violence. But the ticket resale phenomenon also comes into play, and the issue for fans becomes how many tickets they can resell without it becoming a problem in the eyes of team management, Nagel said. In essence, each team must determine the line for how many resold tickets is too many. In court filings in the 1990s case, Levin argued that since Soderholm paid for his tickets, the team did not have the right to revoke his seats simply because he was reselling them. But a Cook County Circuit Court judge, and later the Illinois appeals court, ruled in favor of the Cubs. Levin himself used to be a Cubs season ticket holder but decided not to renew his plan a few years ago because prices were getting too expensive. He said teams want to make as much money as they can, and control their product and their business. When the courts ruled in favor of the team, Levin said, fans such as Wester don't have a legal gripe. \"They're saying it's my ball; I'll take it away if you don't play by my rules,\" Levin said. The Cubs, which announced that the average price of season tickets will rise 19.5 percent in 2017, say the goal is to keep tickets in the hands of real fans, weeding out seat holders such as Wester who hold the tickets primarily to sell. With a lengthy season ticket waiting list, canceling the plans of holders such as Wester allows others a chance to buy plans. \"The goal is to provide as much value as possible to our season ticket holders,\" Cubs senior vice president of sales and marketing Colin Faulkner said recently. \"We want to have that direct relationship with fans that are actually going to the games. It was a significant number a couple of years ago and we've continued every year to take a look at that as we bring in new season ticket holders as well.\" Faulkner said they had a record 98 percent ticket renewal last year and a waiting list of around 109,000. Even the most rabid fans are unlikely to attend all 81 home baseball games, and even if fans split season tickets with a group, reselling tickets is common. The teams know this, and to a certain extent, encourage it, making it easy for fans to securely list their seats for resale. A look back at the top Chicago sports stories from 2016. (Amanda Kaschube) Sox spokesman Scott Reifert said they \"very rarely have issues with fans in this area.\" \"Philosophically,\" Reifert said, \"we see resale and resell opportunities, particularly through MLB partner StubHub, as a positive for our fans.\" Major League Baseball does not have a leaguewide policy regarding ticket resales or season ticket agreements, leaving it up to individual clubs to create their own policies. \"What we think is best for the sport is to leave it up to the teams,\" said Bob Bowman, MLB president, business & media. \"The only people who go to 81 home games every year are the players in uniform. So we leave that up to the clubs.\" The league's official partnership with StubHub, Bowman said, is a legal, safe, reliable and easy way for fans to sell tickets. The five-year agreement with StubHub, which expires in December 2017, also enables teams to electronically track how many tickets are resold. When season ticket holders sell tickets, teams are in a way striking out twice: They are not meeting initial price objectives on the initial sales, and they miss out on the bulk of the profits when fans resell, Notowidigdo said. Fans like Wester who sell lots of tickets are, in effect, using their seats as an annuity payment, he said. In recent years, teams have launched so-called dynamic or flexible pricing, making more attractive games more expensive and discounting seats against less popular opponents or on weeknights. Nagel said that system is designed to capture the \"accurate\" price for a ticket to any given game. But many teams also reserve a small number of lower quality seats \u2014 deep in the outfield or upper deck, for instance \u2014 at super-low prices to cater to everyday fans. If the Cubs are concerned that season ticket holders are reselling tickets well above face value, perhaps their tickets are priced too low, Nagel said. Of course, there are public relations and perception concerns about sky-high ticket prices, and Nagel said this strategy can \u2014 and has \u2014 also backfired on teams that increase prices before a season, then watch as their team stumbles toward a losing season. \"What more and more teams need to realize is to be more efficient in how they price initially,\" Nagel said. On the other side is the consumer, whose objective is generally simple and consistent. \"Fans,\" Nagel said, \"want to pay the least amount possible for the best seat possible.\" Chicago Tribune's Paul Sullivan contributed.

(AP Photo/Jin Lee, File) FILE - In this Sept. 10, 2013 file photo, Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner makes his concession speech at Connolly's Pub in midtown in New York. A federal court in New York is scheduled to release redacted copies Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016, of the search warrant and other documents that gave the FBI new license to dig into a trove of Hillary Clinton emails days before the presidential election. The emails were found on a computer belonging to former U.S. Rep. Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, as part of an investigation into an online relationship between the disgraced New York congressman and a teenage girl in North Carolina. (AP Photo/Jin Lee, File) (Jin Lee / ASSOCIATED PRESS) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The FBI said it needed a search warrant for thousands of Hillary Clinton 's emails discovered on a computer belonging to former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner in part because agents wanted to look for evidence of \"intrusions\" by people trying to steal classified information, according to court documents made public Tuesday. The search warrant application, written by an agent whose name was blacked out, was filed Oct. 30, two days after FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that investigators had discovered a new trove of email correspondence that could be pertinent to an investigation he had closed over the summer into Clinton's use of a private server to handle emails she sent and received as secretary of state. In it, agents laid out their rationale for reopening the probe. They wrote that thousands of emails between Clinton and one of her top aides, Huma Abedin , had been discovered on a Dell laptop used by Weiner, Abedin's estranged husband. And, based on their previous work in the case, the agents said they had reason to suspect that those emails might contain classified material, possibly including top secret information that could cause \"grave damage to national security\" if disclosed. \"A complete forensic analysis and review,\" the agent wrote, \"will also allow the FBI to determine if there is any evidence of computer intrusions into the subject laptop, and to determine if classified information was accessed by unauthorized users or transferred to any other unauthorized systems.\" A magistrate judge signed off on the search warrant the same day. After getting court consent to delve into the newly discovered emails on Oct. 30, agents spent several days analyzing them before Comey announced that they contained no new evidence of any wrongdoing by Clinton.

    "text": "Dec 20 2016, 5:30 pm ET Obama Places Sweeping Ban on Offshore Drilling in Atlantic and Arctic Waters by Amanda Sakuma advertisement In the final stretch of his term President Barack Obama is implementing new environmental protections that stand to thwart Donald Trump's agenda on oil and gas extraction in ways that may prove difficult for the president-elect to roll back. The Obama administration announced on Tuesday that it will place an indefinite ban on offshore oil and gas drilling across large swaths of Atlantic and Arctic waters. The actions come in conjunction with news that Canada will implement a sweeping ban of its own, launching a set of actions to be reviewed every five years. Related: Breaking the Ice: Obama Seeks to Cement Climate Change Legacy \"President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau are proud to launch actions ensuring a strong, sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem, with low-impact shipping, science based management of marine resources, and free from the future risks of offshore oil and gas activity,\" the White House said in a joint statement with the Canadian leader. Tuesday's announcement is just the latest example of Obama leveraging the waning days of his administration to stymie any future attempt to expand offshore drilling in the region. Earlier in the year the Interior Department unveiled its five-year plan for offshore oil and gas drilling, notably omitting any expansion to specified regions in the Arctic. Together the results would likely slow the tide of President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to expand production to reach untapped oil and gas reserves.

The seldom used measure allows the executive to permanently freeze offshore drilling in specified regions. Senior Obama administration officials stress that there is no provision in the law providing the president authority draw those actions back. Environmental groups hailed the announcement as a major victory and symbolic milestone in ending offshore drilling in a region where it is exceedingly difficult to prevent and respond to potential oil spills. Related: Obama Caps Environmental Legacy With Paris Climate Change Deal \"We are confident that this is an announcement that will stick. We have both the law and public opinion on our side,\" Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said. There is currently no precedent for a president to hit rewind on bans against offshore drilling in the name of environmental protections. And because the actions are not up for review for another five years, advocacy groups say they are optimistic Trump will not be able to reverse the tide. Kayakers trying to block the departure of the Shell Oil Polar Pioneer rig platform as it moved from Elliott Bay in Seattle on June 15, 2015 TIM EXTON / AFP - Getty Images file \"No president has ever rescinded a previous president's permanent withdrawal of offshore areas from oil and gas development,\" Marissa Knodel of the environmental group Friends of the Earth said in a statement. \"If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obama's withdrawals, he will find himself in court.\" Still allies in the oil and gas industry that while Obama's actions Tuesday are indefinite, it doesn't mean the ban will be in place for forever. \"Blocking offshore exploration would weaken our national security, destroy good-paying jobs, and could make energy less affordable for consumers,\" Erik Milito, Upstream director at the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Fortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, and we look forward to working with the new administration on fulfilling the will of American voters on energy production.\" Amanda Sakuma ",

Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev came to the brink of war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a showdown aggravated by communication delays. The system used teletype and telegraph terminals manned by military translators, tasked with relaying messages from their commanders-in-chief through a transatlantic cable. The American terminal was in the Pentagon, where it remains. The first test message from Washington to Moscow, on Aug. 30, 1963: \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy's dog's back 1234567890.\" Navy Chief Petty Officer John E. Kelley (seated), a presidential communicator, and Lt. Col. Charles Cox, senior presidential translator, staff the hotline in 2013. The original teletype has long since been replaced by computers. DOD Over the years, the systems were updated with advances in technology: satellites, fax machines, computers, email. The point was to exchange information quickly, but never verbally, to avoid misunderstandings. The first American president to reportedly use it was Lyndon Johnson, who in 1967 communicated with the Soviets' Alexei Kosygin on the unfolding Six Day War in the Middle East . Richard Nixon reportedly used it four years later to discuss tensions between India and Pakistan with Leonid Brezhnev, and again in 1973 during another Middle East flareup. Jimmy Carter reportedly used it to discuss the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Ronald Reagan reportedly used it often and not only in crisis situations.

    "text": "Obama Moves to Ban Drilling Indefinitely in Parts of Arctic, Atlantic Oceans By Serena Marshall Dec 20, 2016, 6:02 PM ET 0 Shares Bureau of Ocean Energy Management WATCH Obama Moves to Ban Drilling Indefinitely in Parts of Arctic, Atlantic Oceans 0 Shares Email In an effort to provide long-lasting protection to fragile Arctic ecosystems, President Obama has enacted an expansive, permanent ban on oil and gas leasing in several Arctic and Atlantic Ocean areas. The president has designated a large portion of the U.S. Chukchi Sea and the vast majority of the U.S. Beaufort Sea as permanently off-limits to drilling leases, saying the risks far outweigh any possible, distant-future benefits. \"The risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region\u2019s harsh conditions is limited,\" the president said in a statement. \"By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region \u2013- at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.\" The agreement comes following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2019s visit to the District of Columbia, where the two leaders committed to a joint framework on Arctic drilling by the end of this year and cited the Paris climate agreement. \"Today, President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau are proud to launch actions ensuring a strong, sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem, with low-impact shipping, science based management of marine resources, and free from the future risks of offshore oil and gas activity,\" the leaders said in a joint statement. Between lands earlier protected in 2015 and those added today under the agreement, nearly 125 million acres in the Arctic are now protected from future oil and gas development. The president also designated 31 Atlantic Ocean canyons off-limits to oil and gas exploration in today's announcement. According to the administration, one-tenth of one percent of U.S. offshore crude production comes from Arctic. They also point to research showing long term drilling has a greater than 75 percent chance of a large oil spill in the area and given the remote areas, cleanup would be difficult. Under usual circumstances, any executive order the president enacts can be reconsidered and potentially overturned by a new president. However, Obama is using a provision in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which says that the president has the right reserve some offshore areas and keep them off the market. \"The President of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf,\" section 1341 of the act states. The move comes as ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson has been selected by President-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of state. Rex Tillerson: Everything You Need to Know About Trump's Pick for Secretary of State In 2014, ExxonMobil, operating under an agreement with the Russian government, found an oil field in the Arctic that they estimated to be worth 750 million barrels of oil. However, due to sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea , the company's Arctic work was halted. While the Obama Administration remains confident that there is no precedent or legal authority for the incoming Trump administration to reverse the Arctic withdrawal, as it has been made under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, the president-elect could lift sanctions on Russia, freeing ExxonMobil or other companies to drill in the Arctic in Russian territory. Earlier this month, Obama signed an executive order providing greater protections to the northern Bering Sea. 0 Shares ",

Erik Kirschbaum An attack on an outdoor Christmas market that killed 12 people was an act of terror, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday, adding that she was struggling to come to terms with the idea that a refugee who was given shelter by her country could have been the assailant. But Merkel, who has faced heavy criticism for allowing more than a million refugees into the country over the last 18 months and could see her reelection chances hurt by the deadly attack, said Germany would not cave in to fear and change its way of life even as the country was deeply shaken by what appeared to be the first major terror attack on German soil in decades. Questions remained about the motivation and identity of the perpetrator. German authorities arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of deliberately driving the 40-ton truck into the crowd late Monday\u00a0and said he is believed to be a Pakistani national who arrived in Germany as a refugee at the end of 2015. He had been in trouble with the law locally in the last year for minor offenses.

(John MacDougall / AFP/Getty Images) However, by Tuesday afternoon, police and prosecutors began expressing doubts about whether he was the assailant \u2014 or, if he was, whether he had acted on his own. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed still not certain that he [the suspect]\u00a0was the driver,\u201d\u00a0Berlin Police Chief Klaus Kandt said at a news conference. Federal state prosecutor Peter Frank added: \u201cWe have to brace ourselves for the possibility that the man arrested was not the assailant or part of a group behind the attack. We don\u2019t know at this point whether it was one assailant or a group of assailants.\u201d German media reported that police doubts about the arrested suspect\u2019s involvement were related to the fact that blood-covered clothing was found inside the cabin of the truck, but there were no traces of blood on the clothing of the man arrested. Also, there were no signs that he had been involved in an altercation, but the body of a Polish driver was found in the vehicle, and police think he was killed in a struggle before the truck drove into the crowd. Still, the widespread presumption was that the attack was deliberately carried out on a site with symbolic associations with Christmas. \u201cWe have to assume that this was a terror attack,\u201d Merkel said in a brief six-minute television statement as flags across the country were lowered to half-staff. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to understand that the person who did this came to Germany in search of protection and asylum, if that\u2019s confirmed. That would be especially sickening for all those in Germany helping refugees and for those who came here to be protected and integrate themselves.\u201d Merkel, who had received assurances of support on the phone earlier Tuesday from President Obama, said that it would be wrong for Germans to change their lives because of the attack. She vowed the case would be resolved and the assailant prosecuted. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do without our Christmas markets. We don\u2019t want to let fear of evil paralyze us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the strength to live our lives in Germany the way we want to: in freedom and openly.\u201d Later in the day, Merkel placed a wreath at the scene of the attack together with Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

We don\u2019t want to let fear of evil paralyze us. \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel In addition to those killed, more than 48 people were hurt, some critically, when the truck drove for about 80 yards into a crowd of hundreds gathered around the Christmas market stalls and shops around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the heart of west Berlin at 8 p.m. The incident revived memories of a similar low-tech attack in July in Nice, France, when a truck driver plowed through a national holiday crowd and killed more than 80 people during Bastille Day celebrations. Many of the German victims were crushed by the truck, which police said had been hijacked about four hours earlier. The lone suspect was arrested about a mile away after\u00a0a bystander followed him through the dark Tiergarten park and kept the police informed of his whereabouts. \u201cThis was an attack against our freedom,\u201d Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller told a news conference. Local officials said that the operators of dozens of the popular holiday-season Christmas markets across Berlin were being urged to stay closed Tuesday. De Maiziere said that the suspect has denied any involvement in the attack. He said the man had arrived in the southern state of Bavaria on Dec. 31, 2015, and had ended up in Berlin. His asylum application had not yet been completed. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a most brutal attack,\u201d de Maiziere told reporters. At 4 a.m. Tuesday, German police stormed a temporary refugee shelter set up in the cavernous empty hangars of Tempelhof Airport in the center of Berlin, where the man is believed to have been living. But there were no further arrests made, according to German media reports. German security authorities had long warned about the vulnerability to terror attacks of the popular open-air Christmas markets, where revelers celebrate the holiday season by drinking mulled wine while eating sausages and sweets. After deadly terror attacks in Paris, Brussels and Nice over the last 14 months, Germans have been on a heightened state of alert, fearful that similar Islamist attacks could happen at any time. Fears that terrorists might have slipped into the country under the flood of refugees have been growing following three relatively minor attacks in 2016 involving migrants: a knife attack against a police officer, an ax attack against tourists on a train and a bungled suicide bombing in which only the attacker from Syria was killed. Adding to the sense of angst, a 17-year-old Afghan refugee was arrested earlier in December on suspicion of raping and killing a young German medical student in the small college town of Freiburg.\u00a0Merkel has faced growing criticism for her refugee policies since hundreds of foreign men sexually abused and groped women on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne and dozens of other cities. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD,\u00a0party wasted little time in blaming Merkel for the terror attack in Berlin. Marcus Pretzell, the party\u2019s leader in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, attacked the chancellor on Twitter: \u201cWhen will the German rule of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy be stopped? These are Merkel\u2019s deaths.\u201d Frauke Petry, the national leader of the AfD that has come out of nowhere over the last four years to claim more than 10% of the support in opinion polls,\u00a0added: \u201cGermany is no longer safe.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss 304 electoral college votes seal Donald Trump's election as president , the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducts its newest members ,\u00a0L.A. proposes a $10-million legal fund for immigrants facing deportation under Trump, and attacks in Ankara \u00a0and Berlin .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss 304 electoral college votes seal Donald Trump's election as president , the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducts its newest members ,\u00a0L.A. proposes a $10-million legal fund for immigrants facing deportation under Trump, and attacks in Ankara \u00a0and Berlin .\u00a0 Caption Former Bridal Reality Show Contestant Reported Missing After Attending Birthday Party in Torrance Mark Mester reports for the KTLA 5 Morning News on Dec. 20, 2016.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Americans in a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll rate the Affordable Care Act as President Obama's greatest achievement in the White House. Also, as his biggest failure. In yet another sign of how polarized the United States remains, the signature initiative known as Obamacare draws the strongest praise from his supporters and the sharpest rebuke from his critics as Americans begin to consider how history will judge the nation's 44th president. On one thing\u00a0there is agreement across partisan lines: Six in 10 predict incoming president Donald Trump will significantly dismantle Obama's legacy.\u00a0Three-fourths of Democrats call that a bad thing; three-fourths of Republicans call it a good one. \"The impression he pushed was that he wanted to undo everything on Day One, somehow, miraculously,\" says Megan Glidewell, 37, a college counselor from Waconia, Minn., who voted for Hillary Clinton. She was among those called in the poll. \"I know that's not how it works, but it certainly felt like what he wanted and what the people who voted for him wanted.\" About a third of those surveyed say Obama ultimately will be seen as a \"good\" president; 18% say he'll be a \"great\" one. But one in four say history will rate him as only \"fair,\" and another one in four say he'll be seen as a \"failed\" president. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
