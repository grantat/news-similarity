The killings were part of a series of nine murders that took place over five weeks in California. In 1971, Manson was found guilty of conspiracy to commit the murders of seven people, including Tate. He was sentenced to be executed, but his sentence was changed to life in prison when the death penalty was abolished in California.

Putin said the cease-fire will be guaranteed by both Moscow and Turkey. Turkey has been allowing opposition forces to use its long border with Syria to cross back and forth. The agreement was also praised by Iran, another of Assad\u2019s strongest backers. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the truce will include 62,000 opposition fighters across Syria and that the Russian military has established a hotline with its Turkish counterpart to monitor compliance. Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, said President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration will be welcome to join the peace process once he takes office. Putin said he ordered the Russian military to scale back its presence in Syria, where it has provided crucial support to Assad\u2019s forces. Putin didn\u2019t say how many troops and weapons will be withdrawn. He said Russia will continue \u201cfighting international terrorism in Syria\u201d and supporting Assad\u2019s military. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, welcomed the cease-fire announcement, saying he hopes the agreement will save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and pave the way for productive peace talks. Earlier Thursday, Turkey called on Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from Syria. The Iranian-backed extremist group has sent thousands of fighters to support Assad and has been playing an instrumental role in the civil war since 2013. Foreign fighters from around the world have joined both sides of the Syrian conflict, which has displaced half the country\u2019s population and produced more than 4 million refugees. Many of those refugees have been streaming into Europe, fueling anti-immigration sentiment and terrorist fears that are reshaping the continent\u2019s political landscape. Syria\u2019s military noted that the cease-fire comes after the \u201csuccesses achieved by the armed forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the fierce fighting in Aleppo. Osama Abo Zayd, a spokesman for mainstream Syrian opposition groups, told reporters in the Turkish capital of Ankara that 13 armed opposition factions have signed the agreement. He said the peace talks will be based on the Geneva 2012 declaration that calls for a governing body with full executive powers to run Syria during a transition period. \u201cThis means that there will be no presence for Assad in the future,\u201d he said. However, Khashan, the political analyst, said Assad\u2019s exit is \u201cout of the question.\u201d \u2018\u2019Neither the Russians nor the Iranians would allow it to happen,\u201d he said. Saeed Sadek, a professor of political sociology at Cairo\u2019s Future University, said Assad has no power to accept or reject any deals. \u201cHe is now under the control of Moscow, Tehran and Ankara. All these countries will decide his future,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The weather system dumped snow in the Rockies Wednesday, creating slick conditions on the roads. Eastbound lanes along Interstate 70 in Denver were shut down after a multivehicle crash near the Eisenhower Tunnel, where the highway was snow-packed and icy, according to ABC Denver affiliate KMGH-TV . KCNC Eastbound lanes along Interstate 70 in Denver, Colorado, were shut down due to a multi-vehicle crash near the Eisenhower Tunnel during a snow storm, Dec. 28, 2016. ABC News meteorologists are tracking the storm and say it\u2019s moving into the Northeast region this morning. But because the system is moving into milder climes, forecasters say much of the precipitation from Washington, D.C ., to Boston and Portland, Maine, will be in the form of rain. ABC News Rain and snow started falling in parts of the Northeast this morning as the storm moved into the region. Meanwhile, meteorologists say the storm could bring 1 to 2 feet of fresh snow to the mountains of New England. \u201cMost of the heavy snow will be found inland in the mountains of New England,\u201d ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. \u201cGreat news for the ski resorts.\u201d ABC News Heavy snow will be coming down in parts of New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine by this afternoon. As of this morning, 14 states were under winter weather alerts, from Michigan to North Carolina and all the way up to Maine. Rain began falling around 7 a.m. ET in Washington, Philadelphia and New York City, while snow started coming down in upstate Pennsylvania and upstate New York. \" />ABC News The Great Lakes region could see over a foot of snow. By noon, forecasters say Boston will have showers and parts of Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine will see snowfall. \u201cOver a foot of snow is possible near the Great Lakes region,\u201d Golembo said. 0 Shares ",

It's likely a preview of the airport's growing pains Long line at LAX over the holidays Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times Passengers line up curbside at Los Angeles International Airport two days before Christmas, one of the busiest travel periods of the holiday season. LAX will handle about 4.3 million travelers over the holidays, 400,000 more than last year. Passengers line up curbside at Los Angeles International Airport two days before Christmas, one of the busiest travel periods of the holiday season. LAX will handle about 4.3 million travelers over the holidays, 400,000 more than last year. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Dan Weikel, Adam Elmahrek It\u00a0was Christmastime at Los Angeles International Airport . Security lines were\u00a0long, passengers crowded the terminals and restaurants ran short of food. Airlines delayed and canceled several hundred departures and arrivals because of bad weather. At the gates, travelers booed and cheered announcements about flight schedules, depending on the news. Some people slept\u00a0on the floor. Outside, traffic was\u00a0so heavy it often took an hour or more\u00a0to drive the two miles between the 405 Freeway and the terminals. \u201cI\u2019ve been flying in and out of LAX since the \u201980s and it was the most chaotic experience I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Frank Girardot of Pasadena, whose flight to Detroit the night of Dec. 22 was delayed about four hours. The 19-day holiday season for LAX and its unprecedented surge in travelers will\u00a0end Tuesday. But the experience of several million passengers passing through its gates might be an indicator of what lies ahead if the\u00a0nation\u2019s third-busiest airport continues to expand at a record pace. Airport consultants and commercial aviation experts say traffic and terminal congestion will  probably persist, especially during peak travel times of the year, because of a variety of factors, including an ongoing modernization of the facility that has\u00a0yet to catch up with its dramatic growth since the recession. An estimated 80 million passengers\u00a0will travel through LAX this year \u2014 an increase of about\u00a08% over 2015 and about 30% since 2010. The Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency,\u00a0predicts that LAX will handle\u00a096.6 million passengers annually by 2040. During this year\u2019s holiday period alone, LAX had an estimated 4.3 million travelers, about 400,000 more than in 2015. The airport was built to handle 40 million passengers annually for the \u201984 Olympics. Last year, there were 75 million... \u2014 Jack Keady, an airport and aviation consultant \u201cIt\u2019s a straight mathematical equation,\u201d said Jack Keady, an airport and aviation consultant based in Playa del Rey. \u201cThe airport was built to handle 40 million passengers annually for the \u201984 Olympics. Last year,\u00a0there were 75 million and projections call for almost 100 million. The congestion is only going to get worse.\u201d Airport officials said they are concerned about congestion and that Los Angeles World Airports, the operator of LAX, is taking major steps to improve ground transportation and the efficiency of airfield operations. \u201cThe holiday crush is something we are used to \u2014 Thanksgiving, summer and the Christmas rush,\u201d said Bob Gilbert, chief development officer for the airport. \u201cBut as we move forward, congestion is going to be exacerbated if we don\u2019t take appropriate action to address the issues that will challenge our facilities.\u201d As with other major airports, Gilbert said much of the holiday congestion at LAX has resulted from bad weather in L.A. and\u00a0\u00a0other parts of the country that caused flight delays and cancellations. \u201cThe places where people fly in from have issues of their own,\u201d he added. \u201cThis affects LAX.\u201d During the holiday peak \u2014 Dec. 21-23 \u2014 about 239,000 travelers passed through the airport each day. Baggage-claim areas were packed, and long lines formed on the street to check luggage curbside.\u00a0 The airlines had added so many flights to handle increased demand\u00a0that the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a slowdown in operations on Monday to help clear arriving aircraft from taxiways where they were backed up because of  a shortage of gates. \u201cThere were tons of people. We couldn\u2019t get any information anywhere,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0said Rodney Leong of San Francisco, whose departing flight on Dec. 21 was delayed 4\u00bd\u00a0hours. \u201cDo the words \u2018fall of Saigon\u2019 mean anything to you? I wouldn\u2019t recommend flying into LAX unless you have to.\u201d Airport officials said that from Dec. 22 to Dec. 29, \u00a02,101 arrivals and departures were delayed and 161 arrivals and departures were canceled. Even before the holiday crush, passenger growth combined with airport\u00a0construction was snarling traffic\u00a0in the terminal area and on main access routes \u00a0including the 105 Freeway and\u00a0Sepulveda, La Tijera \u00a0and Century boulevards. Over the years, daily traffic has\u00a0steadily increased from 70,000 vehicles in the central terminal area to more than 95,000 today. The week before Christmas, the vehicle flow peaked at 108,000 on Dec. 21.\u00a0 At\u00a0the busiest times, the westbound 105 turns into a freeway of angst and squeaking brakes as traffic backs up all the way from the Sepulveda offramp to the 405 connector. \u201cThey are trying to fix an airport at the same time it\u00a0is operating and increasing capacity,\u201d\u00a0said Denny Schneider, president of the Alliance for a Regional Solution to Airport Congestion. \u201cThe traffic we are now seeing is the new normal.\u201d ",

The hormones from stress can cause plaque that is already in the artery to rupture. Dr. Wittstein explains that there is a way for broken heart syndrome to cause a stroke. When a large portion of the front wall of the heart isn't pumping as effectively the blood remains stagnate. Blood has to be moving and if it doesn't it begins to clots. This forms a blood clot which breaks loose and can go to the brain. Stress also causes elevated blood pressure, which makes people more prone to strokes, and it has been shown to increase inflammation, which is also a risk for cardiovascular disease. The more common kind of stroke, an ischemic stroke , is caused by a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain. RELATED: Died of a broken heart? The science behind close couple deaths Self-care also plays a role in handling grief. Hayes, who was not involved in Reynolds' treatment, but commented on the effect of grief in general, said it's unknown what chronic medical conditions Reynolds might have had. Caregivers often don't take very good care of themselves while at their loved one's bedside. \"Did she skip medications? Not eat? Not stay hydrated?\" Hayes noted. \"That's an element as well.\" Some of it may also be a will to live. People who are ill often have mental or emotional \"targets\" for living: \"I want to make it through my kid's birthday\" or see them graduate or get married or celebrate Christmas. Take those targets away, and it's a shock. \"I think spirituality and optimism and resilience has a part in this,\" Hayes said. A. Pawlowski ",

Johnson, whose criminal history includes multiple theft charges, had been ordered to wear a GPS monitor in the days before the slaying, and a judge had requested a mental health evaluation, court records show. According to WUSA he did not show up to be fitted with the device. \u201cWe have found out since this nightmare happened on Christmas Day that he, the defendant, was charged with multiple crimes and allowed to walk free on our streets,\u201d McCauley\u2019s friend Greg Upwall told the station. \u201cWe feel as though the justice system is broken in this case and that we pray to God that our loss isn\u2019t something that anyone else will ever have to go through again.\u201d \u00a0 Johnson been charged with first-degree murder and was ordered held without bail Wednesday afternoon. Johnson told police that he met McCauley on or around Christmas, when she offered him a ride. According to the documents, he told police that she offered to have sex with him and that they had sex \u201con a curb somewhere.\u201d He told police that after the sexual encounter, she became despondent and said she wanted to kill herself. Johnson told police that McCauley hanged herself inside her car, although he was unable to say what she used to hang herself, the documents show. According to the documents, he also told police that she told him he could use her car, money and credit cards, at one point asking, \u201cIf someone is suicidal and gives you all their stuff is that illegal?\u201d He also told police that he picked up a prostitute and drove around the city with McCauley\u2019s lifeless body in the back seat, the documents state. When asked why he drove around with the woman in the back seat, Johnson said he thought she was sleeping, the station reports. Johnson had injuries to the hands and jaw when he was arrested, police said. Johnson\u2019s public defender did not immediately return a message Wednesday. McCauley was reported missing after she didn\u2019t show up to a Christmas party hosted by friends in Washington\u2019s theater community. Ann Norton, the executive director of the Washington Stage Guild, said there was evidence that McCauley had left her apartment with the Brussels sprouts she planned to bring to the dinner.

Vladimir Velengurin/AP/Russian Emergency Ministry Press Service Russian authorities say that there was no explosion onboard the plane that crashed earlier this week, killing 92, though some prominent officials have yet to rule out terrorism. In a press conference Thursday, members of a Russian government commission investigating the crash told reporters it could have been one of several factors, but that data from the crash ruled out an explosion. \"After deciphering the first flight recorder we have made a conclusion that there was no explosion onboard,\" said Lt. Gen. Sergei Bainetov, head of the air force's flight safety division. But when asked whether terrorism had been ruled out, Bainetov said attacks of that sort don't always \"involve an explosion.\" Other investigators focused more on mechanical causes, as NPR's Lucian Kim tells our Newscast unit: \"At a press conference in Moscow, Russian Transportation Minister Maxim Sokolov declared the main phase of the search-and-recovery effort complete. ... \" 'Today,' he said, 'we've recovered everything that's connected to the crash.' That means the Tupolev-154's black boxes and wreckage. It also means 19 bodies and more than 230 body parts, which are now undergoing DNA analysis. \"Sokolov said it's clear the plane had technical problems \u2014 and now experts are trying to determine why.\" Article continues after sponsorship As we've previously reported , the Defense Ministry plane, which crashed on Christmas, was carrying among other passengers a world-renowned military chorus.

    "text": "College campus provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos just got a huge book deal By Holly Epstein Ojalvo 2:29 pm EST December 29, 2016 421    shares Milo Yiannopoulos is a conservative columnist and Internet personality. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) Milo Yiannopoulos courts controversy pretty much wherever he goes. He\u2019s been called a provocateur, a troll, the poster boy of the alt-right and a white nationalist. He\u2019s even called himself the \u201csupervillain\u201d of the Internet. And now he has a big fat book deal \u2014 along with his existing plan to make a movie with footage from his controversial tour of college campuses. Wait \u2014 who is Milo Yiannopoulos? If you\u2019re not familiar with Yiannopoulos, here are some factoids about him: He\u2019s a British writer and public speaker. He\u2019s 32 years old, Catholic and openly gay. He founded the web magazine the Kernel , which Daily Dot Media bought in 2014. He\u2019s an editor for the conservative publication Breitbart News. He\u2019s a fan of Donald Trump (who he has called \u201cDaddy\u201d) and criticizes identity politics and feminism. He often makes provocative statements some people find offensive and defends himself vigorously on free speech grounds. He got kicked off Twitter for his role in the trolling of actress Leslie Jones . What\u2019s this about him having a book deal? Simon & Schuster is a book publisher, and they just gave Yiannopoulos a book deal for $250,000, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Milo Yiannopoulos strikes $250K book deal https://t.co/ryOPCPWymI pic.twitter.com/IWfMJYJCr7 \u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) December 29, 2016 Yiannopoulos told the Hollywood Reporter, \u201cI met with top execs at Simon & Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building \u2014 but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money.\u201d And he posted about his deal on Facebook, saying, \u201cI\u2019m more powerful, more influential, and more fabulous than ever before and this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream. Social justice warriors should be scared \u2014 very scared.\u201d And his movie? Related: Conservative journo Milo Yiannopoulos loves to \u2018shock and outrage\u2019 college students His stock response to these protests is to say that liberals are trying to quash his freedom of speech. And he often mocks his critics too. The Hollywood Reporter reported last summer that Yiannopoulos was working on a documentary based on his campus tour, but nothing new has come out about that lately. Another documentary, American Milo, was already made about him . What are people saying about all this? There\u2019s quite a lot of outrage on the left. And some clapback from the right. We add Simon & Schuster to a growing list of companies happy to associate with racists and bankroll hate, misogyny and transphobia. \u2014 Salena Godden (@salenagodden) December 29, 2016 Milo getting a book deal is an example of how gayness has become an effective mask for white supremacy. more gays need to talk about this \u2014 2017 will be bad too (@ptrmsk) December 29, 2016 Milo gets a book deal. The left make plans, as usual, to stop us reading something they refuse to read. pic.twitter.com/D8hgzisIwP \u2014 Old Holbornski \u2718 (@Holbornlolz) December 29, 2016 Milo is trending because the left is crying about him receiving a $250K book deal. One election later, they still think silencing works. \u2014 Matt Dougan (@Americooligan) December 29, 2016 Lmfao this headline. Oh, Milo\uf602\uf602 He just has to only breathe and liberals get offended. https://t.co/cHZQGvC8Qc \u2014 Ariana Rowlands\u265b (@IamQueenAri) December 29, 2016 . @simonschuster are you concerned $250k book deal you gave Milo Yiannopoulos will read as condoning the racist harassment @Lesdoggg endured? \u2014 Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) December 29, 2016 Milo is awful and I'm sure his book will be stupid. But pressuring publishing houses toward viewpoint restriction leads somewhere bad. \u2014 Josh Barro (@jbarro) December 29, 2016 Isn't the outrage over Milo's book proving Simon and Schuster's presumed calculation\u2013that people will care about it\u2013true?

    "text": "John Kerry . The Jerusalem... An Israeli planning committee backed down on Wednesday from approving hundreds of permits for housing projects in east Jerusalem, hoping to avoid fanning controversy over settlement activity hours before a policy speech on Israeli-Palesitnian peace by Secretary of State John Kerry . The Jerusalem... (Joshua Mitnick) President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s victory and the prominence of patrons of the Israeli settlements in his close circle of advisors have only compounded the skepticism. A December public opinion poll found that two-thirds of Palestinians believe a two-state solution is no longer feasible. The alternative, many argue, is an invitation to Israel to swallow Palestine. \u201cMany people support the idea,\u201d said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian legislator and a former candidate for president. \u201cIf the two-state solution is physically unattainable, we have only one option: A struggle to gain full and equal democratic rights in one state, in the land of historic Palestine.\u201d Once limited to small groups of politically independent weekly protesters against Israel\u2019s military occupation, the idea is now being widely discussed. Palestinian intellectuals, businessmen and political officials who long championed the two-state solution are starting to strategize about what some argue is an already existing one-state reality. \u201cBecause of the lack of a political horizon, the inability of the sides to sit down together, because of the reality on the ground of expanding settlements and road checkpoints, people started to believe that the two-state solution is dead,\u2019\u2019 said Bashar Azzeh, a youth activist and marketing director at the Wassel Group, a Palestinian logistics company. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSome people are saying: Let\u2019s demand full human and civil rights rather than national rights; then maybe the international community will listen to us.\u2019\u2019 In  Al Birah, Ramallah\u2019s twin city, the municipal soccer stadium sits on a ridge just a few hundred yards from the red-roofed homes of the Israeli settlement of Psagot on the opposite hilltop. Wasfi Nawajah, a coach in a warm-up suit, complained that his southern West Bank village had no permits to build a gym, while the neighboring Israeli settlement was free to build sports facilities and expand. \u201cThe Palestinians are only suffering from the peace process. The situation is tough. Many people are losing hope,\u2019\u2019 Nawajah said. A poll this month by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found a nearly 10-percentage-point jump over the last three months of Palestinians who say the two-state solution is no longer viable. Support for a one-state solution has advanced in the same period to 36% from 32%. \u201cThis is a major change, a significant erosion in the viability of the two-state solution,\u2019\u2019 Khalil Shikaki, the director of the polling center, said in a lecture at the Jerusalem Press Club. \u201cToday, we don\u2019t have majority support for the two-state solution. What has gone up is support for the one-state solution.\u2019\u2019 Slackening support can be found in Israel as well as in the incoming U.S. administration. Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of David Friedman, a longtime patron of the Israeli settlement of Beit El, suggests the new administration might no longer champion negotiations toward a Palestinian state as did previous U.S. presidents. Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who advocates annexation of 60% of the West Bank and \u201cautonomy on steroids\u201d for Palestinians in the remaining areas, in November declared the end of \u201cthe era\u201d of the Palestinian state. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he remains committed to \u201ctwo states for two peoples,\u2019\u2019 but when he was asked by an Israeli journalist on the eve of the 2015 election whether he expected the creation of a Palestinian state on his watch, he said no. The prime minister and his aides say Israel needs to reach security agreements with surrounding Arab governments before a peace deal with the Palestinians.\u00a0 Most in Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud Party and Bennett\u2019s pro-settler Jewish Home party have never given up on the contention that Israel has a historical and even divine right to all of the biblical land of Israel. For larger swaths of Israel\u2019s population, ending Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank is seen as a security risk too big to take. A one-state campaign would mark a sea change in strategy for the Palestinian leadership, which has been pushing for Palestinian statehood alongside Israel since the early 1990s. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has staked his political career on a nonviolent campaign to negotiate for a Palestinian state and has given no signs that he\u2019s about to change. At a recent convention of his political party, Fatah, the dominant political force in the West Bank, there was no discussion of a shift in official strategy. \u201cWe still believe that the two-state solution is the best solution,\u2019\u2019 said a senior Palestinian official who was not authorized to speak openly on policy. \u201cHowever, if Israel chooses to annex, that\u2019s the end of the West Bank. Once the idea of a two-state solution is over, the only thing you have left is one state.\u201d The notion of a single binational state \u2014 which would have roughly equal numbers of Arabs and Jews \u2014 has long been an anathema to many Israeli Jews because it would mean a radical makeover of Israel\u2019s identity as a \u201cJewish state.\u2019\u2019 \u201cIt would mean the end of Zionism,\u2019\u2019 said the senior Palestinian official. Israel\u2019s Arab minority already accounts for 20% of the country\u2019s population. Arab Israelis make up about 15% of the parliament, but because parties representing them don\u2019t join government coalitions, only one Arab has ever served as a Cabinet minister. There has been only a single Arab on Israel\u2019s Supreme Court. In recent years, demographers have projected that the total number of Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will eventually surpass that of the Jewish population. On Thursday, the Palestinian statistics bureau said demographic parity would be reached by the end of 2017. Though Israel\u2019s leading demographers generally concur with the Palestinian numbers, Yoram Ettinger, a former diplomat from the Likud Party, has called those projections \u201cdemographic scaremongering\u201d aimed at spreading \u201cfaintheartedness and fatalism\u201d among Jews. He and some others contend the estimates of Palestinian population are inflated and the projections are incorrect; in fact, they say, Arab birthrates are declining and Jewish rates are increasing. A binational state, many Palestinians believe, presents a new opportunity to pressure Israelis who fear becoming a minority in their own homeland. They envision waging a campaign evoking black South Africans\u2019 struggle against white majority rule that would tarnish Israel\u2019s democratic credentials. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe meaning of a state in all of the occupied territories can have two alternatives,\u201d Ziad Abuzayyad, a former Palestinian minister, told Israel Radio this month. \u201cEither Israel becomes an apartheid state that ignores the Arabs, or it will give rights to the residents there and there will be a binational state. You decide.\u201d Sam Bahour, an American Palestinian businessman, has argued that Palestinians must focus their energy on a campaign to gain more economic, movement and water rights, while not giving up on the possibility of establishing a separate Palestinian state at some point in the future.\u00a0 \u201cThe thinking is very logical that we have reached a dead end on the practicality of two states, so people are reaching to think for alternatives,\u2019\u2019 he said in an interview. \u201cNo one has articulated what people are talking about in coffee shops into a political program. I don\u2019t think [one-state] is political thinking; it\u2019s frustration thinking.\u201d Indeed, Palestinian officials are reluctant to officially jettison support for a two-state solution because the idea still has the support of the international community. In recent years, the United Nations and international bodies have recognized a \u201cstate of Palestine\u201d in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. For most Palestinians, that remains the dream. But many like Samer Abd al-Kareem Omar say they are willing to part with the dream of an independent state if it means economic prosperity, physical security and equality. In a cafe full of water-pipe smoke across from Al Birah, Omar, a 40-year-old computer teacher, said his family lost several acres of agricultural land to the construction of Israel\u2019s West Bank barrier.

Bruce Rauner were able to set aside their differences to eliminate taxes on the purchase of tampons and other feminine hygiene products, create more flexible sick leave rules for workers, and add wage protections for domestic workers such as nannies and housekeepers. Those are among about 190 new Illinois laws that take effect with the new year. The state gets an official state artifact in the form of a pirogue, a canoe made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and hairdressers will be required to undergo training to spot signs of domestic violence among their clients. Students enrolled in driver education classes will now be taught what to do if pulled over by police, and community colleges will see tougher oversight following numerous revelations about questionable spending at the College of DuPage. And one controversial measure that is set to take effect Jan. 1 is under review in the courts. At issue is state law that allows medical providers to decline to perform abortion procedures if they have moral objections. A change to that law would require health care providers that oppose abortion to provide patients with information about or a referral to other providers that will perform the procedure. Supporters say the legislation is designed to give patients timely access to legal medical care. But opponents led by a group of anti-abortion pregnancy centers sued to block the law, arguing the legislation violates their free speech. Last week, a judge in Winnebago County said the state can't enforce the law against the handful of centers involved in the lawsuit while the case plays out. Here's a look at some of the new rules for 2017: Tampon tax The state will no longer collect sales tax on tampons, sanitary napkins and menstrual cups \u2014 a rare area of agreement on taxes between Republicans and Democrats who can't agree on a budget. Feminine hygiene products are subject to a 6.25 percent state sales tax, unlike some other necessities such as shampoo. That figure can be higher depending on local taxes. For instance, before the Chicago City Council voted to exclude tampons and sanitary napkins from the city's sales tax earlier this year, feminine hygiene products purchased in Chicago were taxed at a rate of 10.25 percent. Chicago property owners hoping for a respite from rapidly rising taxes will be disappointed in 2017, when city government and Chicago Public Schools will continue digging deeper into their pocketbooks. Two more major property tax increases are coming. So is a new tax on water and sewer service.... Chicago property owners hoping for a respite from rapidly rising taxes will be disappointed in 2017, when city government and Chicago Public Schools will continue digging deeper into their pocketbooks. Two more major property tax increases are coming. So is a new tax on water and sewer service.... (Hal Dardick) State budget officials estimate the change could cost the state roughly $15 million a year in tax revenue. Advocates for the repeal said it was an unfair tax that's part of a broader trend in which women continue to earn less than their male counterparts in the workplace but are charged more for everything from razors to haircuts. They often call the trend a \"pink tax\" because women's products are so often marketed in pink packaging. \"It's important that women know they are paying more for things,\" said sponsoring state Sen. Melinda Bush, D-Grayslake. \"This is a necessity that women have to have, and I don't think they should have ever been taxed. It's a wrong tax, and we are righting a wrong.\" Contraception choices Women will have more choices when it comes to contraceptive options under a new law that eliminates a complicated waiver process they must go through to get birth control medications not offered by their insurance companies. Supporters say women should be able to choose birth control that's best for their bodies without having to pay more, contending the measure will save money by preventing more unintended pregnancies. Opponents questioned if a wider range of options would add costs to insurance companies. Workplace changes Nannies, housekeepers and other domestic workers will now be entitled to the state's minimum wage and various human rights protections, under legislation dubbed the Illinois Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. Employers will be required to pay domestic workers at least $8.25 an hour, above the federal minimum of $7.25. And they must get at least 24 hours of rest in each calendar week and a meal period of 20 minutes for every 7.5-hour shift, according to the new law. They will also be covered by the Illinois Human Rights Act, which protects against sexual harassment, and the Wages of Women and Minors Act, which prohibits employers from paying women and minors \"an oppressive and unreasonable wage.\" Advocates say the changes will help protect domestic workers who are more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Another measure would ban noncompete clauses between an employer and an hourly employee who earns $13 an hour or less. The law becomes effective after Jimmy John's agreed to a $100,000 settlement with the state attorney general over the company's noncompete agreements, which prevented employees from working at another sandwich shop for two years after they left a job at Jimmy John's. The attorney general's office said the rules were \"highly restrictive.\" Meanwhile, workers will now have more flexibility when using their sick leave. Under a new law, employees who qualify for sick leave benefits can use that time off to provide care for family members who are hurt or ill. Rauner signed the legislation against the wishes of many in the business community, who called it a mandate that limits an employer's ability to make decisions. Personal information One measure aims to toughen the state's rules regarding data breaches and when companies, hospitals, banks, retailers and others must inform customers if their personal information has been compromised. Under the new rules, a customer must be alerted if their electronic medical information, health insurance information, claims information or biometric data such as a fingerprints have been improperly accessed. The law also requires notification if a username or email address has been compromised. A separate law prevents employers from accessing an employee or applicant's personal online accounts. It bans employers from requesting, requiring or coercing workers into giving their username or password to any online account, or accessing that account in the presence of the employer. Community college rules Community colleges will face tougher oversight under a package of laws put in place following a Chicago Tribune investigation that uncovered numerous revelations about questionable spending and lax oversight at the College of DuPage. The measures would require schools to undergo special audits every five years to examine contracts, transparency and compensation to school leadership; require extra training for community college board members on ethics, financial oversight and fiduciary responsibilities; and limit what income can be factored into pension benefits for university and college presidents. Currently, those officials are able to get credit toward their pension for the cash value of perks like bonuses or car allowances. Under the change, pensionable income would be limited to salaries and not other benefits. Law and order Police agencies across Illinois will have new regulations on how they use cell site simulators, devices commonly known as \"Stingrays\" that collect cellphone data and can be used to track someone's location. The devices are commonly used by police to investigate crime, but those pushing for restrictions said police also were able to collect data from people who aren't the focus of an investigation at the same time. New rules would require police to delete all data not related to the target of an investigation at least once every 24 hours, or within 72 hours if the simulators are used to identify an unknown communication device unless there is a court order directing otherwise. A different law would require jails to accept cash to post bail. The measure came about after a Rockford teen was arrested for a traffic offense. When his mother tried to bail him out, the credit card machine was broken, and the Winnebago County Juvenile Detention Center had a policy to refuse cash. That meant her son was forced to sit in jail all weekend. On a related note, it'll soon be cheaper for state prison inmates to make calls under a new law that requires the state to find a cheaper phone provider. Rates can not exceed 7 cents per minute for debit, prepaid and collect calls. The current rate is about 11 cents a minute. Supporters argue for-profit companies were gouging inmates, preventing them from staying in touch with family. Meanwhile, police officers who are partnered with a police dog will get the first chance to adopt that dog when it's no longer fit for service. If the officer does not wish to keep the dog, other officers in the department could seek an adoption or it would go to a no-kill shelter.

The idea is to take advantage of the close relationship many customers have with their stylists. \u2022Students enrolled in driver's education classes will soon be required to learn what to do if they are pulled over by police. Backers hope to prevent standard stops from escalating into violence. \u2022Insurance companies must now consult the federal master file to determine if a policy holder has died and whether benefits are owed. The change pushed by Treasurer Michael Frerichs is aimed at closing a loophole that led to companies failing to pay out benefits because they would not check to see if a customer had died. \u2022Property owners will be required to notify potential renters or buyers of any lead hazards. The notice must be given in writing before a lease is signed or renewed, or before a sales contract is signed. \u2022The pirogue will become the official state artifact, after students at a Wilmette middle school pushed for the designation for the boat made of a hollowed-out tree used by native tribes of Illinois. \u2022Grocery stores will now be allowed to consolidate eggs in cartons. Previously, if one egg in a dozen was cracked, the whole carton had to be thrown out. \u2022Student musicians in grades six through 12 can now be excused from school to play taps at military funerals. \u2022Catfish are now included on the list of fish that can be killed by a pitchfork, spear gun, or bow and arrow. mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com ",

Reynolds was 84. \"She's gone to be with Carrie,\" Reynolds' son, Todd Fisher, said in a statement. \"She loved taking care of her and now she's gone to be with her.\" Reynolds was rushed to a hospital from a Beverly Hills home at around 1 p.m. PT, according to law enforcement officials. Todd Fisher confirmed she had died Wednesday evening and later told \"Variety\" he blamed heartbreak for his mother's death. \"I miss her so much. I want to be with Carrie,\" Reynolds said hours before she died, Todd told the magazine. There was no immediate word on her cause of death. The back-to-back loss of the mother-daughter duo, each Hollywood fixtures of their own generations, stunned fans and fellow celebrities. Carrie Fisher died Tuesday , days after suffering a heart attack on a plane. She was 60 years old. \"I can't imagine what Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds' family are going through this week. I send all of my love,\" TV host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted. Reynolds catapulted to fame after her first leading role in 1952 at age 19, when she played Kathy Selden in \"Singin' in the Rain,\" which also starred Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. As an actress, dancer, and singer, she became America's sweetheart \u2014 and a triple threat among performers. \"She sang the most cheerful song in film history,\" James Lipton, host of \"Inside the Actors Studio,\" said on MSNBC's \"The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell,\" referring to the song \"Good Morning\" featured in the beloved musical. \"And she held her own,\" Lipton added, referring to how young Reynolds was at the time and the fact that she starred alongside Hollywood veterans. \"Can you imagine being thrust into that?\" Related: 'Star Wars' Actress Carrie Fisher Dies at 60 Reynolds herself admitted in an interview once that working with Kelly and O'Connor at just 19 was intimidating. \"They had been dancing for 30 years. I was dancing for three months, so I was hysterical,\" she said. Born April 1, 1932, Reynolds worked the beauty pageant circuit before she made her film debut in 1950 in the musical \"The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady.\" In 1964, she earned a best actress Oscar nomination for the 1964 drama, \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown.\" Then in the late 1960s, the actress starred in the \"The Debbie Reynolds Show,\" a short-lived sitcom on NBC. For the next two decades, Reynolds turned her attention to the stage, performing on Broadway and in Las Vegas. She continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s. In all, Reynolds appeared in dozens of films, television shows and stage productions, and was nominated for multiple Golden Globes and Academy and Emmy Awards. In this April 19, 1955, file photo, singer Eddie Fisher and his fiancee, actress Debbie Reynolds, look at each other at Idlewild Airport in New York. AP Reynolds' career spanned nearly seven decades, and she appeared in some of the most iconic films of the 20th century. Her personal life was almost as scintillating as the movies and shows she was in. She was the first wife of pop star Eddie Fisher in 1955, who later divorced her in an infamous love triangle to marry Reynolds' best friend, Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds and Fisher had two children together, Carrie and Todd. Reynolds then married shoe Mogul Harry Karlin in 1960, before getting divorced in 1973. Her third marriage was to real estate developer Richard Hamlett in 1985. The two divorced in 1996. \"I don't choose well. I don't blame anybody but myself, but I just seem to have very poor taste in men,\" she once recalled in an interview. Debbie Reynolds, Robert Preston in \"How The West Was Won.\" Moviestore / /REX/Shutterstock Celebrity tributes poured in after Reynolds' death. \"Debbie Reynolds was one of the last of Hollywood Royalty. It breaks my heart that she is gone,\" actor William Shatner said in a tweet. \"I'd hoped that my grieving was done for 2016.\" Actress Anna Kendrick called her an \"American treasure.\" Actor and filmmaker Albert Brooks called Reynolds \"a legend and my movie mom.\" Reynolds and Carrie Fisher had a volatile relationship that eventually smoothed out as the two grew older and closer. Fisher often spoke of the ups and downs in her relationship with her mother, and what is was like growing up in the shadow of famous parents. In 2012, Fisher told TODAY the relationship between them was \"certainly not ... typical.\" \"But now I have officially turned into my mother. In our family, to turn into one another we do night club acts,\" she said, in reference to her one-woman show \"Wishful Drinking.\" Play ",

(Photo: John Moore, Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Suicide \u2014 not combat \u2014 is the leading killer of U.S. troops deployed to the Middle East to fight Islamic State militants, according to newly released Pentagon statistics. U.S. casualties have been relatively low since the U.S.-led war effort began with a bombing campaign in August 2014, reflecting the limited combat exposure for troops.\u00a0Of the 31 troops who have died as of Dec. 27 in Operation Inherent Resolve, 11 have taken their own lives. Eight died in combat, seven in accidents and four succumbed to illness or injury. The cause of one death is under investigation. The reasons suicide\u00a0ranks as the No. 1 cause of troop deaths are complex and poorly understood, according to experts on military suicide. They likely include mental illnesses that enlistees brought with them to boot camp, post-traumatic stress, multiple combat deployments and heightened anxiety in a military\u00a0at war for 16 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one single cause for it,\u201d said Rajeev Ramchand, a senior behavioral scientist at the Rand Corp. who has studied military suicide. \u201cThere are a multitude of factors. They are also picking up on a trend toward more suicide in the U.S. population as a whole. Maybe there\u2019s a universal stress on everyone in the military that affects them in profound ways.\u201d Read more: Study: Soldiers at highest risk for suicide tries in first year The nature of the fight against ISIL has also limited combat fatalities. Direct fights between U.S. troops and ISIL fighters are uncommon events. U.S.-led airstrikes have been the principal means of attack, and they have been exceptionally lethal. The military estimates bombs and missiles fired by warplanes and drones have killed 50,000 ISIL fighters. Thousands of American troops have deployed to train and assist Iraq\u2019s army, and thousands more have been sent to provide security, launch artillery barrages and perform logistics duties. Few of them have come under direct attack. Several hundred more U.S. commandos are on the ground in Iraq and Syria, conducting raids to capture or kill ISIL leaders and assist local fighters. Some of those missions have been deadly. On Oct. 22, 2015, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, a member of the Army\u2019s super-elite Delta Force, was killed by gunfire as he helped free 70 prisoners from an ISIL prison in northern Iraq. The largest loss of life in a single incident in the war against ISIL didn\u2019t take place in Iraq or Syria. It occurred in Jordan on Nov. 4, 2016, when three Special Forces soldiers were shot by a guard as they tried to enter an air base. The American commandos were training local forces to fight ISIL militants. Their shooting deaths remain under investigation. The most casualties in a single attack occurred earlier this year when rockets fired by ISIL fighters targeted a Marine artillery base in northern Iraq. The attack on March 19 killed\u00a0Staff Sgt. Louis Cardin and wounded eight others. All of them received Purple Heart medals, according to the Navy. By far, 2016 has been the most dangerous for U.S. forces since the war began. Seven of the eight combat deaths have occurred in 2016, and 21 of the 26 troops wounded in action suffered their injuries this year. But the military's suicide problem continues. Between 2001 and 2010, the rate of suicide in the military doubled, Ramchand said. The chief spike occurred around 2005 when fighting and combat deaths soared in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Army shouldered most of the war\u2019s burden. The Army still has the highest percentage among the services for suicide, according to the Pentagon's latest figures. Of the 269 active-duty troops who took their own lives in 2014, 122 were soldiers, or about 28%. As a whole, the military\u2019s rate of suicide of about 20 per 100,000 troops in 2014 was comparable to the same civilian population. Retired general Peter Chiarelli made suicide prevention a top priority when he was the Army\u2019s No. 2 officer as vice chief of staff from 2008 to 2012. He expressed frustration with the failure to drive down the rate of military and civilian suicides. He called for a research effort, similar to the comprehensive initiative to attack HIV/AIDS, focusing on changes in the brain caused by depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. That will require focused leadership from the Pentagon and Congress\u00a0and the development of new drugs. \u201cThis really is an illness,\u201d Chiarelli said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re weak.\u201d 193 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 21 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iJPiLP NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

(Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The Obama\u00a0administration sanctioned Russian intelligence officials on Thursday over claims that they interfered in this year's election by hacking the emails of Democratic Party officials. \"These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior,\" President Obama said in a statement. Obama also suggested that the Russians sought to affect previous elections via cyber-espionage. The administration will soon \"be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections,\" he said. Obama signed an executive order outlining economic penalties for individuals and organizations involved in \"tampering with, altering, or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or\u00a0effect of interfering with or undermining election\u00a0processes or institutions.\" The sanctions affect \"nine entities and individuals,\" Obama said: \"The GRU and the FSB, two Russian intelligence services; four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRU\u2019s cyber operations.\" They did not include Russian President Vladimir Putin, though Obama strongly suggested that he knew about the Russian hacking activity because \"these data theft and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian government.\" U.S.intelligence agencies have accused the Russians of getting involved in the election in order to help Donald Trump win the presidency, accusations that President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have denied. These agencies are conducting a formal investigation, and Congress is likely to\u00a0conduct a probe of its own. Obama had pledged a response earlier this month, and also suggested that covert activity \u2014\u00a0including U.S. cyber activity \u2014\u00a0may be involved as well. \"These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia\u2019s aggressive activities,\" Obama said Thursday. \"We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized.\" Trump, who has questioned whether the Russians were involved in the hacking, expressed skepticism about sanctions in speaking with reporters Wednesday night. \"I think we ought to get on with our lives,\" Trump said, adding: \"I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly \u2014 the whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on.\" Trump and his aides have also said that Democrats are pushing the Russia hack story as part of an effort to explain away the loss by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Anticipating the sanctions Wednesday, Russia accused Obama of acting out of spite, and pledged retaliation. \u201cPeople in the White House need to understand clearly that if Washington really takes new hostile steps, then it will receive a response,\u201d\u00a0foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a video statement. Trump harped on the email releases during his campaign against Clinton, claiming the reflected favors the secretary of state and her team did for contributors to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton backers cited Trump statements that seemed to encourage the Russians to hack Clinton herself. Leaked emails also reflected tensions within the Democratic Party. The leaks to the resignation of Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, amid claims that the party favored Clinton over primary rival Bernie Sanders. Thursday's sanctions are essentially additions of ones the Obama administration placed on Russia after it annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine. In announcing the hacking sanctions, Obama said: \"In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance.\" 95 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hx28PX NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Daily Record 5:28 p.m. EST December 29, 2016 Darrick Clyde Moore. (Photo: Submitted) YORK, Pa. \u2014 Enraged over his stepdaughter's refusal to bake him cupcakes on Christmas, a Springettsbury Township man allegedly choked, punched and kicked\u00a0the\u00a0teen before his wife intervened, according to charging documents . Darrick Moore, 47, of the 100 block of Edgewood Road, faces charges of simple assault and harassment. Moore, who remained in York County Prison on $15,000 bail on Thursday, has a preliminary hearing before District Judge Barry L. Bloss Jr. on Jan. 4, according online court dockets. Springettsbury Township Police said that at 7:45\u00a0p.m. on Sunday, they were called to Moore's home for a domestic disturbance. The girl told police that Moore wanted her to bake him cupcakes, but that she refused. Then, when she went into the kitchen to heat up food, Moore told her he did not want her to do that, documents state. When the girl warmed up the food anyway, Moore grabbed it and threw it in the backyard, documents state. At MSU: Assault, harassment and secrecy The two then argued, and the girl pushed Moore, and Moore pushed her back, causing her to fall to the ground. When\u00a0the teen was on the ground, \"Moore got on top of her and started to choke her with his hands,\" documents state. After Moore choked her\u00a0\u2014 during which she said she could not breathe\u00a0\u2014 he hit her in the face numerous times, causing her to bleed, according to documents. The girl's mother then came into the kitchen and started to yell at Moore, but as Moore was getting off the girl, he kicked her in the right side of her abdomen, documents state. The girl told police that at some point during the alleged incident\u00a0Moore said, \"I'll choke you so hard you're head will pop off,\" documents state.

The actress is the daughter of the late Carrie Fisher, and as she's joked to many a late night and morning host, she's also the progeny of another movie\u00a0icon. Debbie Reynolds is flanked by granddaughter Billie Lourd, left, and daughter Carrie Fisher, Billie's mother, right. \u00a0(Photo: Kevin Mazur, WireImage) \"She always gets so upset that people call me Carrie Fisher's daughter. I'm Debbie Reynolds' granddaughter,\" Lourd\u00a0quipped to Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford on Today\u00a0earlier this month . Now she's better known as Chanel #3 from Scream Queens, and a budding star in her own right. Though with the tragic passing of her mother and grandmother back-to-back, she's also become the last legacy of a Hollywood dynasty. Here's a look at the young talent's life and career. Her father is a Hollywood big-wig The women in her family may have been in the spotlight, but her father, Bryan Lourd,\u00a0is one of those important men behind the scenes, or as Kotb says, the agent in LA. He's the managing director of CAA, which has a roster that includes George Clooney,\u00a0Scarlett Johansson, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence... you get the idea. He married \u00a0his longtime partner, Bruce Bozzi Jr., in October. (Bozzi's family\u00a0started the original Palm steakhouse.) A photo posted by Bruce Bozzi (@brucebozzi) on Oct 12, 2016 at 2:13pm PDT She's a\u00a0fresh face in the Ryan Murphy universe Lourd joins a bevy of actresses who've had seminal roles in hit productions by TV mastermind Ryan Murphy, including Sarah Paulson and\u00a0Lea Michele. Lourd stars alongside Michele, Emma Roberts and Abigail Breslin in Fox's Scream Queens, an anthology in its second season that follows a cast of characters being terrorized by a serial killer.\u00a0The all-star cast\u00a0is rounded out by Jamie Lee Curtis, John Stamos and Taylor Lautner. \u00a0(Photo: Steve Dietl, Steve Dietl/FOX) She's\u00a0more than an on-screen love interest for a famous werewolf A photo posted by Taylor Lautner (@taylorlautner) on Dec 27, 2016 at 4:40pm PST The cast and crew have said they've grown to be like family over the last two years. But\u00a0Lourd and Lautner's relationship looks to be a lot more intimate. The two\u00a0were\u00a0 caught kissing \u00a0on Scream Queen co-star Kiki Palmer's Snapchat account at a wrap party for the show in early December. And the actor was by her side leaving her\u00a0Santa Monica home Wednesday, hours before the death of her grandmother. Billie Lourd leaves her home with rumored boyfriend Taylor Lautner. \u00a0(Photo: Splash News, Splash News) She's a modern-day feminist In a conversation with Murphy for Teen Vogue , the actress\u00a0praised the writer / director / producer for creating the\u00a0Half Foundation, which has a mission of ensuring that women and minorities make up at least 50 percent of the directors on his shows. She went on to explain how Fisher taught\u00a0her to think without the confines of gender. \"She raised me to not think of men and women as different. She raised me without gender. It\u2019s kind of the reason she named me Billie. It\u2019s not about being a strong woman \u2014 it\u2019s about being a strong person. She once told me, \u201cI never sat you down with a credo. It was more about leading by example.\u201d Pursuing acting was an act of rebellion Her family, particularly Reynolds, tried to dissuade her from pursuing a career in acting. Reynolds sat her down and made her read diaries from her days on set about the costs of the gig. \u201c\u2018Dear Debbie, you\u2019re sitting in the makeup chair, you have no eyebrows, you\u2019re a shell of yourself, and it\u2019s 5 am. How did you get here?\u2019\" she recounted to Vanity Fair about the diary passages.\u00a0\u201cHer advice would be to keep true to yourself and don\u2019t lose yourself. Or your eyebrows.\u201d Billie Catherine Lourd, left, and Carrie Fisher arrive at the Governors Awards at the Dolby Ballroom on Nov. 14, 2015, in Los Angeles. \u00a0(Photo: Jordan Strauss, Invision, via AP) She plays a part in the Star Wars franchise Lourd auditioned for The Force Awakens, the 2015 edition to the series that made her mother a legend, without telling her family. She landed the small role of Lieutenant Connix, which she'll reprise in Episode VIII. While on set in London, the first she was ever on, she tried to blend in with the other extras until one day she checked on her mother, who had a cold, and her cover was blown. Gary originally belonged to her Lourd is reportedly taking care of Fisher's French bulldog, Gary, but she's also his original mom, she told the Today show. She's mom to a Frenchie named Tina as well. A photo posted by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Oct 28, 2015 at 9:21am PDT She'll star alongside Roberts and Ansel Elgort on the big screen in 2017 Along with Suki Waterhouse and Taron Egerton, Lourd and the young crew will bring to life the dealings and drama of two real Harvard School for Boys alums in Billionaire Boys Club, currently in post-production.

    "text": "Privacy Policy \u201cThey are concerned about controlling retaliation,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The Obama administration was riven by an internal debate about how much of its evidence to make public. Although the announcement risks revealing sources and methods, it was the best way, some officials inside the administration argued, to make clear to a raft of other nations \u2014 including China, Iran and North Korea \u2014 that their activities can be tracked and exposed. In the end, Mr. Obama decided to expand an executive order that he issued in April 2015, after the Sony hacking. He signed it in Hawaii on Thursday morning, specifically giving himself and his successor the authority to issue travel bans and asset freezes on those who \u201ctamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\u201d Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Mr. Obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four Russian intelligence officials: Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the current chief of a military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., and three deputies: Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, the deputy chief of the G.R.U.; Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, a first deputy chief, and Vladimir Stepanovich Alekseyev, also a first deputy chief of the G.R.U. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But G.R.U. officials rarely travel to the United States, or keep their assets here, so the effects may be largely symbolic. It is also unclear if any American allies will impose parallel sanctions on Russia. The administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations: the Special Technologies Center, a signals intelligence operation in St. Petersburg; a firm called Zor Security that is also known as Esage Lab; and the Autonomous Noncommercial Organization Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems, whose lengthy name, American officials said, was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking. \u201cIt is hard to do business around the world when you are named like this,\u201d a senior administration official with long experience in Russia sanctions said on Thursday morning. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence. But the question will remain whether the United States acted too slowly \u2014 and then, perhaps, with not enough force. Members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s election campaign argue that the distractions caused by the leaks of emails, showing infighting in the D.N.C., and later the private communications of John D. Podesta, the campaign chairman, absorbed an American press corps more interested in the leaks than in the phenomena of a foreign power marrying new cybertechniques with old-style information warfare. Certainly the United States had early notice. The F.B.I. first informed the D.N.C. that it saw evidence that the committee\u2019s email systems had been hacked in the fall of 2015. Months of fumbling and slow responses followed. Mr. Obama said at a new conference he was first notified early this summer. But one of his top cyberaides met Russian officials in Geneva to complain about cyberactivity in April. By the time the leadership of the D.N.C. woke up to what was happening , the G.R.U. had not only obtained those emails through a hacking group that has been closely associated with it for years, but, investigators say, also allowed them to be published on a number of websites, from a newly created one called DC Leaks to the far more established WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, several states reported the \u201cscanning\u201d of their voter databases \u2014 which American intelligence agencies also attributed to Russian hackers. But there is no evidence, American officials said, that Russia sought to manipulate votes or voter rolls on Nov. 8. Mr. Obama decided not to issue sanctions ahead of the elections, for fear of Russian retaliation ahead of Election Day. Some of his aides now believe that was a mistake.

The question now is whether the response he has assembled will be more than just symbolic, deterring not only Russia but others who might attempt to influence future elections.

Citizen-Times 4:44 p.m. EST December 29, 2016 x Share The accused Charleston church shooter had a troubled past even before he was arrested for killing nine people at Emanuel AME Church in June 2015. USA TODAY NETWORK The Charleston, S.C., shooting church suspect, Dylann Storm Roof, is escorted June 18, 2015, from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) The shooter\u00a0convicted earlier this month of killing nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u00a0will undergo a second hearing to determine if he is competent to stand trial , this one just ahead of a sentencing where jurors will decide whether he should die or receive life in prison. Standby counsel for Dylann Roof, 22, filed a motion under seal Thursday asking Judge Richard Gergel of U.S. District Court in Charleston determine whether the defendant is competent to proceed with the sentencing phase. Gergel granted that motion and scheduled the competency hearing for Monday, a federal holiday, with jurors expected to reconvene for the sentencing phase Tuesday. The motion came one day after a hearing in which Roof again said he would represent himself during the sentencing. He told the court he planned to offer an opening statement\u00a0but will not call witnesses or submit evidence in his defense. Earlier this month, a federal jury in Charleston found the admitted white supremacist guilty of 33 federal counts, many of them related to hate crimes and obstruction of religion, in the June 2015 attack at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the nation's oldest historically black houses of worship. All nine parishioners killed were black. Dylann Roof won't offer defense during sentencing Jury selection was to begin in November\u00a0but was postponed after Roof's defense team asked for a competency evaluation of the defendant, one requested against Roof\u2019s wishes and after he had asked to represent himself in court. Following two days of closed-door testimony, Gergel found Roof could understand the nature of the trial as well as its consequences and allowed the case to proceed with Roof representing himself Through jury selection, Roof served as his own attorney but requested that his defense team once again represent him during the trial itself. Dylann Roof guilty in Charleston church shooting With sentencing set to begin in five days, Roof again has\u00a0dismissed the lawyers, a move that prevents them from submitting evidence that he suffers from a mental defect. Evaluations and testimony from mental health experts in the sentencing phase often are\u00a0considered key factors that might persuade jurors to vote for a life sentence over execution. In court filings, Roof has indicated he will not call mental health experts, reversing a course his lawyers had planned earlier. That Roof, as a capital defendant, has elected to represent himself is an unusual but not an unheard of move. Defendants sometimes employ the strategy because they believe they are of sound mind while their counsel sees otherwise, mental health experts say. In chilling video, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof laughs, confesses to murders At Gergel\u2019s discretion, records of the initial competency hearing, which remain closed, could become public after the trial is complete. Roof told the judge in Wednesday\u2019s hearing that he sees release of those documents as problematic. Roof said he is serving as his own attorney to keep evidence like that presented in the competency hearing out of the public domain. Gergel responded that he still is\u00a0weighing the issue, complicated by a state death-penalty trial expected in January, but once proceedings have concluded, the public likely will\u00a0have a right to know.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Inquiries from Donald Trump\u2019s transition team to federal agencies about their work on hot-button issues like climate change and 'violent extremism' -- and about the staffers involved -- have spurred questions over what the incoming administration has planned for those programs. His team, in the roughly seven weeks since the election, has posed such questions to the departments of Energy, State and Homeland Security. Critics of President-elect Trump have suggested the inquiries are a sign his administration intends to gut key programs and punish the staffers involved. Republican defenders, though, say these concerns are overblown. \u201cThe Democrats are trying to talk about anything other than their own problems, and currently they include stoking faux outrage about President-elect Trump rolling back women's rights and firing bureaucrats who don't agree with his environmental policy,\u201d Republican strategist Joe Desilets said Wednesday. The inquiries began earlier this month when transition team members submitted 74 questions to the Energy Department regarding climate change and other policy issues, including two about staffers who worked on President Obama\u2019s climate agenda. Energy officials have pledged to cooperate with the incoming Republican administration but didn\u2019t provide the staffers\u2019 names. The transition team hastily struck the questions, but not before a storm of criticism. Max Stier, founding president of the Partnership for Public Service, which started the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, told FoxNews.com that both sides handled the matter \u201cappropriately\u201d but that the personnel questions were \u201cunusual and unsettling.\u201d \u201cCareer employees are responsible for executing the policy directives the president sets,\u201d Stier told FoxNews.com. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold people accountable for the policies set by people elected by the American public. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d The transition team did not respond for a request for comment. The Los Angeles Times also reported that the team has inquired with the State Department about gender-based programs, asking about \u201cstaffing, programming and funding,\u201d including those started or championed by Hillary Clinton when she ran the department. Stier said the inquiries from Trump\u2019s landing team at the State Department about spending and other matters such as this are not unusual. \u201cQuestions about the policy landscape are entirely legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kettle of fish.\u201d Aside from recent tensions regarding the Obama administration\u2019s latest confrontation with Israel, Trump and Obama largely have maintained a cordial relationship since the election. The two met at the White House in November. And the president has pledged cooperation to help ensure a smooth transition for the incoming administration, ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. However, Energy spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder recently said some of the transition team questions left agency staffers \u201cunsettled.\u201d Climate change \u2013 which holds that the earth\u2019s gradual warming is a result of human activity including the burning of fossil fuel -- has been called a \u201choax\u201d by Trump. Though his transition team withdrew the personnel questions to the Energy Department, two influential House Democrats still submitted their objections. \u201cWe are concerned that these efforts to single out particular department employees involved in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may be an attempt to target DOE employees whose scientific views on climate change differ from those of the incoming Trump administration,\u201d wrote Reps. Elijah Cumming, of Maryland, and Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, the top Democrats, respectively, on the House\u2019s Oversight and Energy committees. State Department spokesman John Kirby later characterized the requests to his department as \u201cnormal\u201d questions about how an agency \u201cis staffed, it is manned and it is resourced.\u201d \u201cNothing that I\u2019ve seen and nothing that we\u2019re aware of falls outside the lines of what would be a normal,\u201d he said. Reuters , meanwhile, reported that the team also has asked the State and Homeland Security department for the names of officials working on efforts to counter \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d Reuters reported that some career officials were concerned about what the incoming administration would do regarding those programs. During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to fight radical Islamic terrorism and frequently criticized Obama for avoiding the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d to describe the Islamic State and other such terror groups. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "advertisement Can't stand another second of 2016? Too bad. As if this horrible, no good, very bad year wasn't excruciating enough, know that an extra second is being added to clocks on Dec. 31. That means before the world can ring in 2017 at midnight on Saturday, this crummy year \u2014 which already included an extra day in February \u2014 will overstay its welcome 'til the bitter end. Before we get to see the '17' light up in Times Square, the world will have to endure another second of 2016. Drew Angerer / Getty Images The reason? So-called \"leap seconds\" get tacked on every few years in order to keep clocks in sync with the Earth's rotation. In other words, there's a discrepancy between (1) how long it takes the Earth to rotate, which fluctuates and is affected by factors such as the ocean tides, and (2) the time shown on superscientific and superprecise atomic clocks created by humans, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory . This leap second system was first trotted out in 1972, and has become fairly common, with the most recent being required in June 2015. A second might seem like nothing to the average person, but a discrepancy over time can have a big effect on our space probes and satellites, scientists say. So this year, to get the two times to jibe again, a second will be added at 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds in Greenwich Mean Time, or Universal Time. For those on the East Coast, that translates to 6:59:59 p.m. What could happen during that one fleeting second, as that single grain of sand slips through our collective hourglass? For starters, people already have plans to ensure some of our most treasured celebrities stay put. One South Carolina man even started a GoFundMe page to \"help protect\" actress Betty White from 2016, jokingly offering to fly to wherever she is and ensuring her fans that she's doing just fine. Others said they want Mary Tyler Moore, who celebrated her 80th birthday on Thursday, to keep turning the world on with her smile through year's end. YES!!!! HBD Now get somewhere safe Mary Tyler Moore. 2016 has a #leapsecond ! We need you in 2017! https://t.co/7Q3vEboTEg \u2014 Alexsandra Wright (@alexsandra8888) December 29, 2016 Meanwhile, an extra second is giving some people a chance to knock out everything on their 2016 bucket lists \u2014 including finally learning Latin or Gregorian chanting. Good luck, procrastinators! They are adding a \"leap second\" to 2016's clock so maybe I do have time to learn Latin. \u2014 Steve Morrison (@mor100) December 28, 2016 There is an extra leap second before 2016 is over so maybe I'll have time now to learn all the Gregorian Chants in falsetto. OK, so while this year wasn't the pits for everyone \u2014 after all, Leonardo DiCaprio finally got his Oscar \u2014 many folks on social media are still ready to say \"bye Felicia\" and other colorful colloquialisms to 2016. For them, the New Year can't get here fast enough. Good riddance. \u2014 Billy Hallowell (@BillyHallowell) December 29, 2016 We don't have an op plan put together for this! A longer NYE?

Police say the three people, who were all visiting from out of state, fell from a lift Thursday at Ski Granby Ranch. Police say one of the children was hospitalized in stable condition and the other was flown to Children's Hospital in suburban Denver for treatment. Police spokeswoman Schelly Olson says ski resort officials reported they fell about 20 feet onto snow. She said state regulators who oversee chairlifts are helping to investigate. The ski area about 90 miles west of Denver promotes itself as a family-friendly resort without the hassles of larger, more famous ski resorts. The death comes during one of the busiest weeks of the season for ski resorts in Colorado. Advertisement ",

    "text": "(David Zahniser) Koretz is running in the March 7 election for a third term. He had voiced support for Caruso\u2019s project in recent weeks, while also asking for the developer to seek\u00a0common ground with the project\u2019s remaining\u00a0opponents. At one point, Koretz\u00a0had commended Caruso for making the project somewhat taller and thinner, saying that move had preserved the views of some neighbors. The City Council is scheduled to vote on the La Cienega project next month. Opponents say the proposal is the latest example of city officials working to change the planning rules for a well-connected developer. They warn that Caruso\u2019s 145-unit apartment building would set a precedent, prompting other nearby property owners to propose luxury apartments much\u00a0taller than the rules allow. Backers of the project, including local neighborhood council leaders,\u00a0say Caruso\u2019s project would bring much-needed amenities, including a 6,910-square-foot plaza with a fountain and\u00a014 apartments rented at below market rates. Caruso, in an interview last week, said he worked extensively to meet the neighborhood\u2019s needs, redesigning the project and offering additional concessions. He also said he had never seen a decision at City Hall that was \u201cinfluenced by somebody who gave money.\u201d \u201cUsually, in my opinion, it\u2019s just the opposite,\u201d he said. Caruso\u2019s foundation has given $125,000 to a nonprofit group created by Mayor Eric Garcetti , whose appointees on the Planning Commission endorsed the La Cienega project last month.

And $100,000 went from Caruso to a campaign committee set up by Councilman Mike Bonin to support Measure M and a second measure designed to pay for homeless housing. Bonin, also running for re-election, issued a statement earlier this week saying he was pleased\u00a0to have secured\u00a0Caruso\u2019s financial support for the\u00a0two tax measures. \u201cRick is a constituent, a friend, and a problem solver, and Mike is grateful that he and Rick see eye to eye on solutions to our biggest problems,\u201d Chad Molnar, Bonin\u2019s chief of staff, said in an email. Caruso hosted fundraisers for Bonin\u2019s council campaigns\u00a0in 2013 and 2015. Mark Ryavec, a consultant who is running against Bonin, said the councilman should not have accepted the $100,000 donation from Caruso in September. Three months earlier, the council voted in favor of a Caruso retail project in Pacific Palisades, which is part of\u00a0Bonin\u2019s district. That type of big-money fundraising \u201cdestroys the public\u2019s\u00a0faith that decisions are being made objectively and based upon the law,\u201d Ryavec said. Ryavec said his campaign will not accept donations from real estate developers.

The deal, signed by the Syrian government and the armed opposition, ends hostilities on Friday at midnight local time, he said. Syria's military today said it agreed to the nationwide cease-fire. \"Three documents have been signed,\" Putin said during a meeting with Russia's foreign and defense ministers. \"The first document is between the Syrian government and the armed opposition on a cease-fire on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. The second document is a package of measures to control the cease-fire regime. And the third document is a statement on readiness to begin peace talks on the Syrian settlement.\" According to The Associated Press, Russia and Turkey will guarantee the truce, Putin said, adding that the parties agreed to meet for peace talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan , a former Soviet republic. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the truce will include 62,000 opposition fighters across Syria, the AP reported. The Kremlin said Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by telephone to discuss the agreement and both \"are satisfied.\" The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, \"welcomes the announcement of a nationwide cease-fire\" and \"hopes that the implementation of the agreement will save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across Syria and pave the way for productive talks in Astana,\" according to a statement from his spokeswoman, Jessy Chahine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will be welcomed to join the Syrian peace process after he takes office in January.

In this series , The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. (Lee Powell/The Washington Post) CHILLICOTHE, Ohio \u2014 Nine women live in the little house by the railroad tracks. It\u2019s early fall, and they\u2019re sharing three bedrooms and a single bathroom. They rise each day at 6 a.m., brush their teeth, eat breakfast together and then get into a van to ride a half-mile to all-day group therapy. At dusk they\u2019ll be back, typically sitting on the porch, smoking cigarettes and watching the trains go by. The conductor will blow the horn. The women will wave, cigarettes brightening with the motion. It\u2019s a nice little ritual, and routines like this \u2014 \u201crepetition and reward,\u201d as the counselors say \u2014 are encouraged for people in recovery from heroin and opioid addiction. These women dream of returning to normal life. Several have children but lack custody of them. In the grip of addiction, they traded away what they loved most in life for transient jolts of euphoria. Traci Andrus, 45, is known as \u201cMom.\u201d She had been a city social worker until she needed routine surgery and became hooked on opioid painkillers. Familiar story: The pills led to cheaper heroin, she says, then to all manner of chaos and dysfunction, and unemployment, and jail, and finally this new existence in the little house by the tracks. \u201cI had a home. I had a brand-new car. I had a life,\u201d Andrus says. Rachel Kerner, 39, is tall, striking and known as \u201cFancy\u201d because she\u2019s always dressed to the nines. She had a good career as a flight attendant, but she used cocaine recreationally, failed a drug test and lost her job. She also lost a child three weeks after giving birth, and she began abusing prescription opioids. \u201cI didn\u2019t really deal with my son\u2019s death until I got into rehab,\u201d she says. Traci Andrus, Staci Huston, Kelsea Dress and Rachel Kerner watch a train pass from the front steps of a home for recovering addicts in Chillicothe, Ohio. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Lisa Touvell, 49, had steady factory work for years but has always struggled with addiction and a decade ago made the transition from pills to heroin. \u201cI gave up. I couldn\u2019t find a job. Two failed marriages. My kids were taken away. I gave up,\u201d she says. She wound up in prison for drug trafficking, and she was released in March. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she says, persuasively. These women are trying to survive an epidemic of self-destruction in small-town and rural America. Death rates have risen sharply among whites, particularly women, particularly those with a high school education or less \u2014 the white working class that played a key role in the November election. Last year, overall life expectancy in the United States fell for the first time since 1993, when HIV was rampant. Today there is no emergent virus running amok. Instead, Americans are dying from a rash of pathologies, sicknesses and addictions that experts call \u201cdiseases of despair.\u201d Downtown Chillicothe, a small town in Ross County, Ohio, where opioid abuse and overdoses are on the rise. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) In a year-long series, The Washington Post has explored a complex epidemic that combines an oversupply of addictive prescription drugs with a dismaying demand for them among people struggling with pain and hopelessness. Opioids come in many forms, from prescription painkillers to street heroin. Fatal overdoses from prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999 and heroin overdoses have gone up about six-fold since 2001. But other drugs also play a role. A Post analysis of federal health data found that white women are five times as likely as white men, for example, to be prescribed drugs for anxiety in tandem with painkillers, a potentially deadly combination. Meanwhile, the suicide rate among middle-aged white women has risen in parallel with prescriptions for often-ineffective psychiatric drugs. Both have roughly doubled since 1999, The Post found. According to federal health officials, nearly 1 in 4 white women ages 50 to 64 are being treated with anti-depressants. Binge drinking is also on the rise, as women close the gap with heavier-drinking white males. As a result, The Post found, alcohol-related deaths have more than doubled since 1999 among white women ages 35 to 54. Booze is also a factor in myriad opioid overdoses. The federal government\u2019s response to the opioid epidemic has been slow and halting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines urging doctors to sharply limit opioid prescriptions only this year \u2014 fully 20 years after OxyContin, the pill that helped spark the crisis, gained regulatory approval. Law enforcement agencies have been largely ineffective. Amid pressure from the drug industry, the Drug Enforcement Administration curtailed an aggressive campaign targeting drug distributors suspected of shipping millions of opioids that wound up diverted to the black market, The Post found. Federal officials have said they are committed to combating the epidemic but are focusing more narrowly on doctors, pharmacists and companies that continue to violate the law. Chillicothe (pronounced \u201cchill-i-COTH-ee\u201d) lies in Ross County, population 77,000. Last year, 40 people here died of drug overdoses, almost all from opioids. That number has tripled in the past three years. \u201cForty overdoses? This, in a little sleepy county?\u201d says John Gabis, the county coroner. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to talk to one more parent who\u2019s lost a child?\u201d Patience Whitley, 20, Deidra Neiberline, 14, Amanda Rooker, 24, and Dawn McFadden, 37, socialize on their front porch in Chillicothe. They said the neighborhood is dangerous and filled with drug activity, including dealers. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Changes creep into the city Chillicothe is a historic town in a transitional landscape. To the north and west are fields of corn and soybeans, a classic, flat Midwestern terrain. To the south and east are the foothills of Appalachia, with winding country roads that, when crossing a stream, narrow to a single lane. World-famous Native American burial mounds speak to thousands of years of human occupation along the Scioto River. Chillicothe was the first capital of Ohio and a destination on the underground railroad. The downtown boasts vintage Victorian buildings. At the annual Halloween parade, thousands of people lined the sidewalks to applaud an hour-long stream of high school marching bands, firetrucks, vintage cars and hot rods. This isn\u2019t one of those Rust Belt towns where the economy collapsed. People point out that you can still get a decent job here. Major employers include a hospital, a truck factory, two prisons and a branch of Ohio University. There\u2019s a retail strip with big-box stores that draws shoppers from several surrounding counties and includes an Applebee\u2019s, an Olive Garden, an IHOP and a Bob Evans. The most visible enterprise is the paper mill, in continuous operation since the late 19th century. Its smokestack dominates the city skyline. The process of making pulp can turn the air quite pungent, but residents have long accepted the stench as \u201cthe smell of money.\u201d It\u2019s a proud history \u2014 but natives say this isn\u2019t the place they used to know. Back in the day, the worst thing people did was hide in a ditch and hurl field corn kernels at passing cars. That\u2019s how Tracy Minshall, 47, remembers her childhood. \u201cIt used to be so Mayberry,\u201d she says from behind the counter of the addiction treatment center where she works. Chillicothe was once protected from urban pathologies by its very remoteness. Today, everyone lives in a wired, networked, smaller world. [ One-third of long-term users say they\u2019re hooked on prescription opioids ] \u201cWithin the last 10 years it\u2019s changed significantly. The violent-crime rate has gone up, the theft issues have gone up, all driven by the drug issue,\u201d says police detective Bud Lytle. Residents often blame the drug problem on \u201cthe 23 pipeline,\u201d a reference to Route 23. The highway brings in dealers from Columbus and Detroit to the north. To the south is Portsmouth, on the Ohio River. Once famous for shoe factories, Portsmouth is now better known as the setting of \u201c Dreamland ,\u201d the acclaimed book by Sam Quinones that described how the proliferation of pain clinics (known as \u201cpill mills\u201d) helped create the opioid epidemic. Signs on Route 23 south of Chillicothe advertise addiction treatment. Residents often blame the drug problem on \u201cthe 23 pipeline,\u201d a reference to Route 23. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) The smokestacks of Glatfelter paper mill tower above homes in Chillicothe, a Rust Belt town where the economy did not collapse. The process of making pulp can turn the air quite pungent, but residents have long accepted the stench as \u201cthe smell of money.\u201d (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) The government cracked down on pill mills, and deaths from prescription opioid overdoses have leveled off nationally in the past five years. But at the same time, there has been a surge in overdoses from heroin and fentanyl, a powerful, synthetic opioid sold as a street drug and often mixed with heroin. \u201cNow you can get heroin quicker in these communities than you can get a pizza,\u201d said Teri Minney, head of the Ross County Heroin Partnership Project. \u201cThey\u2019re delivering.\u201d The addicts often shoot up in public places knowing that if they overdose they will be seen and potentially revived by police or paramedics carrying naloxone, the anti-overdose medication, also known by the brand name Narcan. One day in September, police and paramedics responded to 13 separate overdose calls, including one fatality: a man who died in an apartment right on Main Street. Meanwhile, a woman overdosed in her car as it idled at a Valero gas station with her 2-year-old daughter in the back seat. On that single day, seven children in the county were taken into government custody. \u201cIt\u2019s the Zombie Apocalypse,\u201d says Gabis, the coroner. The county\u2019s health commissioner, Tim Angel, says he sees multiple generations of addicts now. He\u2019ll ask a young patient who has come in for treatment, \u201cHow did you get involved in this?\u201d and the answer will be, \u201cMy mother shot me up for my birthday when I was 14.\u201d Angel shakes his head. \u201cIn quaint rural America.\u201d [ Orphaned by America\u2019s opioid epidemic ] Addiction is like termite rot, eating at the foundation of a community. This cultural self-destruction is particularly pernicious when women with children can\u2019t function as mothers. Obstetrician Richard Villarreal says he has delivered many babies born to mothers with opioid addiction. \u201cYou would never expect a lot of moms who are on narcotics. They\u2019re nice people, many are well-to-do people, they\u2019ve experimented and now they\u2019re stuck,\u201d he says. Soon after the birth, he says, \u201cthese babies become shaky and you can\u2019t calm them down.\u201d Chillicothe made national headlines more than a year ago because of what became known as the \u201cmissing women\u201d cases. In the span of little more than a year, six young women vanished. Rumors spread in town that a serial killer was on the loose. State and local police and the FBI found no consistent pattern, except one: drug addiction and the social dysfunction that comes with it, including prostitution. One woman committed suicide, the coroner ruled. Another was fatally shot by a man convicted this summer of murder. Two were found dead of apparent overdoses. Two remain missing. The only serial killer here, authorities say, is opioid addiction. Cheryl Beverly, left, the house manager, speaks with Stephanie Beatty, 25, about addiction. Beverly also has her own organization called Cheryl\u2019s House of Hope. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) \u2018Opiate fatigue\u2019 In the war against self-destruction, victories tend to be small, incremental and fragile. The epidemic is addressed piecemeal, by churches, police, judges, nonprofit groups and volunteers. The little house by the railroad tracks is a grass-roots operation. The owner runs Safe Haven, the place where the women go daily for therapy. The house manager, Cheryl Beverly, has her own organization called Cheryl\u2019s House of Hope. As autumn turned colder and winter arrived, the house by the tracks saw successes as well as setbacks. Traci Andrus \u2014 \u201cMom\u201d \u2014 dropped out of the Safe Haven program and moved out of the house. She said in a recent email that the program had restricted her ability to come and go, and that her family needed her. She wrote that she is clean and sober, working at a convenience store in a gas station and looking for an administrative job. Rachel \u201cFancy\u201d Kerner, the former flight attendant, graduated from the Safe Haven program and got a job in a department store. Earlier this month, she announced on Facebook that she\u2019d been clean and sober for a year, and is \u201cgrateful for God giving me a 2nd chance at life.\u201d She wrote: \u201cAnyone out there struggling, just remember, you can do this, don\u2019t ever give up on yourself.\u201d Lisa Touvell, the former factory worker, is doing well. She got a job at a discount store and earlier this week moved out of the house by the tracks and into her own apartment. Hope is essential to battling addiction, and so is money, and that\u2019s an urgent issue in Ross County. Congress recently approved, and President Obama signed, health legislation that includes funding to fight the opioid epidemic. But Ross County voters last month rejected for the first time in three decades a property tax levy that funds a variety of health services, including a weekly clinic for addicts and a program to distribute naloxone to people with family members at risk of overdosing. Katie Pariscoff, Meagan Smith, Nicole Pierce and Rachel Kerner socialize at a group home managed by Cheryl Beverly, right, in August. Earlier this month, Kerner announced on Facebook that she\u2019d been clean and sober for a year. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Angel, the health commissioner, described the failure of the levy as \u201cdevastating.\u201d He was forced to cancel the weekly clinic and send the roughly 70 patients to another facility. Layoffs are a possibility; Angel himself lost his job when the health board on Dec. 15 terminated his contract. The coroner, Gabis, blames the levy\u2019s failure in part on \u201copiate fatigue.\u201d He says, \u201cThere is a Darwinian mind-set that the addicts got themselves into this, why are we rescuing them over and over?\u201d The police and paramedics who confront the epidemic daily are wearing down, too, Gabis said: \u201cThe human response is to turn off the emotions when dealing with this.\u201d There are some positive signs. On Nov. 18, hundreds of high school students gathered outside the Ross County courthouse for a rally against drugs. And their parents are learning the signs of addiction: Missing spoons. Missing jewelry. Deteriorating hygiene. Bad skin. Isolation. Lytle, the police detective, has a story about that. He says Appalachian families like his are very close-knit. Earlier this year, he noticed that his daughter Taylor, 22, had lost weight and developed skin problems. When she complained of constipation, something clicked. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing.\u201d \u201cTaylor, don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d She told him the truth: More than a year earlier, she had hurt her back lifting a patient at work, where she was a nursing assistant. A doctor gave her a prescription for 120 Percocets with two automatic refills. That was 360 pills. After those ran out, he gave her a scrip for 60 more and warned her about addiction. Too late. She had no problem finding pills on the street. [ Why death rates for white women in rural America are spiking ] After the confrontation, she kept using, and at one point vanished for two days, a harrowing experience for her parents in light of the \u201cmissing women\u201d issue in Chillicothe. She was found in a dope house down in Pike County, taken to an emergency room and then brought back home, where she went through withdrawal \u2014 \u201cdope sick,\u201d as the addicts say \u2014 as her family monitored her. \u201cIt is like having the flu and laying in the street while people run over you while you\u2019re puking,\u201d Taylor said one day this fall in a meeting room at the law enforcement complex in Chillicothe. She\u2019s 23 now, and hopeful, with plans to go back to school to get a nursing assistant\u2019s license. She says she is grateful that she grew up in a happy, stable home and that she had family support and resources. Detective Lytle has gone with his daughter to her therapy appointments. He sat in the lobby, where anyone passing by could see him. He was born in Chillicothe. Everyone in town knows him. His physical presence was a message to his daughter that he loved her and was not ashamed of her. And it was a message to the community: This could happen to anyone. More reading and resources: ",

The sweeping actions, outlined by the White House three weeks before the new administration takes office, include: Shutting down two compounds, one in Maryland and one in New York, \"used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes.\" Sanctions against the GRU, the Russian military intelligence service, and the FSB, the spy agency that succeeded the KGB, and four high-ranking officers of the GRU. Sanctions against two suspected hackers, both wanted by the FBI in earlier cybercrime cases, and three companies that allegedly provided support to the GRU's cyber operations. Releasing technical information about Russian cyber activity, \"to help network defenders in the United States and abroad identify, detect, and disrupt Russia's global campaign of malicious cyber activities.\" \"All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions,\" President Obama said in a statement, blaming the \"highest levels\" of the Russian government. Obama's statement said the U.S. had declared 35 Russian \"intelligence operatives\" persona non grata. The State Department said the 35 are diplomats \"who were acting in a manner inconsistent with their diplomatic or consular status\" and also accused Russia of harassing U.S. diplomats overseas with arbitrary police stops, physical assaults and the release of personal details putting them at risk. \"The diplomatic sanctions today were in response to the diplomatic harassment from Russia we've seen over the past two years,\" White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said. As of noon on Friday, the U.S. also will bar Russian access to two Moscow-owned \"recreational compounds,\" the White House said. A 45-acre property at Pioneer Point in Maryland was purchased by the Soviet government in 1972, and the 14-acre property on New York's Long Island was purchased by the Soviet government in 1954.

Trump has expressed doubt as to whether Russia tried to meddle in the election. Asked on Wednesday, before the sanctions were imposed, about possible sanctions, he said, \"I think we ought to get on with our lives.\" Trump echoed that sentiment Thursday evening, but said he wants to meet with U.S. intelligence officials. \"It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\" Trump said in a statement on the sanctions. \"Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\" Trump could reverse the actions, but he would have to buck Republican members of Congress who support the sanctions and have called for even stiffer measures. Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: \"In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.\" So true! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016 \"The retaliatory measures announced by the Obama Administration today are long overdue,\" U.S. Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a joint statement. \"But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.\" The White House vowed that U.S. retaliation will go beyond the steps announced Thursday. \"We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized,\" Obama said in his statement. The economic sanctions against the Russian agencies, companies and individuals were contained in an executive order signed by Obama. An FBI wanted poster for an alleged hacker who is now a target of U.S. sanctions. FBI The sanctioned individuals include two alleged hackers, Evgeniy Mikhaylovich Bogachev, aka \"Lucky12345,\" and Aleksey Belan, aka \"Mrmagister.\" Bogachev was indicted in a 2014 case in Pennsylvania in connection with a \"phishing\" scheme to steal money through electronic fund transfers from victims' bank accounts, and he was charged in a 2014 Nebraska case with trying to defraud 12 banks. Belan allegedly broke into the computer networks for three major U.S. e-commerce companies in 2012 and 2013. The named Russians who hold positions in the GRU are: Chief Igor Korobov, First Deputy Chief Vladimir Alexseyev, First Deputy Chief Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Chief Sergey Gizunov. Tracy Connor ",

Trump has had access to the presidential daily briefing since his election, and his transition team claims he is receiving it at least three times a week. The Trump transition did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment on whether existing intelligence on Russian cyberattacks has been available to him up to this point. ",

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Juan Perez Jr. Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel has swapped one of his most recent appointments to the Chicago Board of Education with a former top aide who has helped negotiate contracts with the Chicago Teachers Union . Arnaldo Rivera will take over Dominique Jordan Turner's spot at the school board, pending what's expected to be a routine City Council approval of his appointment. Jordan Turner and schools officials have declined to comment about her status with the board in recent weeks. On Thursday, Emanuel's office announced Jordan Turner had \"recently stepped down\" to serve on the Chicago Public Library 's board of directors. \"There is no doubt that Arnie's experience addressing our schools' most urgent needs makes him uniquely qualified to build on the work that our schools across the city are doing to improve our children's futures,\" Emanuel said in a statement Thursday. Jordan Turner, president and CEO of the Chicago Scholars Foundation, was formally selected for the school board in June 2015 as part of a broad mayoral makeover of its ranks. Turner has also served as a director of the Posse Foundation and the KIPP Foundation charter school organization. Emanuel's office announced Jordan Turner would leave CPS for the library board in mid-December, saying the move would be effective in January. Jordan Turner, reached Thursday, declined to comment. The mayor's move to bring Rivera, a longtime schools operative, to the CPS board comes as the district stares down decisions on its turbulent finances and moves forward with plans for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of construction projects.

Got it President Barack Obama blames the \"highest level of the Russian government for hacks,\" as he speaks during a news conference, Friday, Dec. 16, 2016, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (Susan Walsh/AP) By Missy Ryan , Ellen Nakashima and Karen DeYoung December 29 at 2:21 PM Follow @missy_ryan Follow @nakashimae Follow @karendeyoung1 The Obama administration announced sweeping new measures against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for what U.S. officials have characterized as interference in this fall\u2019s presidential election, ordering the expulsion of Russian \u201cintelligence operatives\u201d and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of U.S. computer systems. The response, unveiled just weeks before President Obama leaves office, culminates months of internal debate over how to react to Russia\u2019s election-year provocations. In recent months, the FBI and CIA have concluded that Russia intervened repeatedly in the 2016 election, leaking damaging information in an attempt to undermine the electoral process and help Donald Trump take the White House. Because Thursday\u2019s announcement is an executive action, it can be undone by the next administration. But Obama\u2019s last-minute measures put pressure on Trump, who has largely waved off the allegations against Russia, to make a decision about whether to keep the punitive measures in place. In a statement issued by his transition office late Thursday, Trump was noncommittal, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d he said, \u201cin the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\u201d (The Washington Post) Taken together, the sanctions and expulsions announced Thursday were the most far-reaching U.S. response to Russian activities since the end of the Cold War, and the most specific related to Russian hacking. The administration also released a listing of addresses of computers linked to the Russian cyberattacks and samples of malware inserted into U.S. systems. Several lawmakers have called on the administration for months to respond, saying that tougher measures need to be taken to punish Russia. The White House resisted acting ahead of the election for fear of appearing partisan. Obama, who had promised a tough U.S. response, said the new actions were \u201ca necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests.\u201d He said Americans should be \u201calarmed\u201d by an array of Russian moves, including interference in the election and harassment of U.S. diplomats overseas. \u201cSuch activities have consequences,\u201d the president said in a statement. The new measures include sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, three companies that are believed to have provided support for government cyber operations, and four Russian cyber officials. The two agencies named are the GRU, Russia\u2019s military spy service, and the FSB, the civilian spy agency that grew out of the KGB. The administration has also ordered 35 Russian operatives to leave the United States and will shut down Russian-owned facilities on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore and on Long Island in New York believed to have been used for intelligence purposes. State Department spokesperson Mark C. Toner said the diplomatic retaliation was partly a response to Russian provocations against American personnel in Russia, including \u201carbitrary police stops, physical \u00adassault, and the broadcast on State TV of personal details about our personnel that put them at risk.\u201d (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) In June, a senior U.S. diplomat was attacked by a Russian soldier at the doorway to the U.S. embassy as he tried to enter. That incident, circulated on video, resulted in the earlier expulsion of two Russian diplomats from Washington. The State Department also said that personal details about U.S. diplomats were publicly released in Moscow, and that the Russian government had refused to approve security upgrades to the U.S. diplomatic facility in St. Petersburg. Obama suggested Thursday that the United States may undertake covert activity in response to Russian activities. Officials gave no details. The Treasury Department also designated two Russian hackers, Evgeny Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, for criminal cyber activities involving U.S. firms and unrelated to the election hacks. Moscow, which has denied involvement in attacks related to the election, vowed to respond in kind. \u201cI cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,\u201d Russian presidential spokesman Dmitri Peskov said in a statement late Thursday evening carried by the Interfax news service. Peskov said the response would be authorized by President Vladimir Putin. In virtually all previous cases of Soviet or Russian diplomats declared persona non grata in this country, an equal number of U.S. officials have been expelled from Russia. [ Read the executive order released by the White House ] Trump has called on the Obama administration to present proof of Russian hacking. Speaking Thursday before the reprisal announcement, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Trump\u2019s views on the hacking allegations could change if more solid evidence emerges that Russia was responsible. \u201cIf the United States has clear proof of anyone interfering with our elections, we should make that known,\u201d Spicer said, adding, \u201cRight now we need to see further facts.\u201d Spicer also said that some on the political left were using the Russia allegations to downplay Trump\u2019s victory at the polls on Nov. 8. [ Kremlin spokesman vows retaliation against U.S. sanctions ] U.S. officials say they have been refining for months their assessment of the attacks, in which they say a Russian military intelligence agency hacked the Democratic National Committee and stole emails that were later released by WikiLeaks. Emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, who chaired Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, also were made public. State electoral systems were also targeted, but administration officials said Thursday, as they have in the past, that they have no evidence the actual voting process was interfered with on Election Day. While U.S. officials have not named Putin himself in the cyber meddling, Obama has suggested that approval came from the very top of the Russian government. As part of the new measures, the administration has amended a 2015 executive order allowing the president to respond to foreign cyberattacks. That order was intended primarily for attacks against infrastructure or commercial targets, but officials adapted it to cover attempts to undermine the electoral process \u2014 not only in the United States but in other countries as well. In a call with reporters, U.S. officials said they chose to announce the new measures before the end of Obama\u2019s term in an attempt to educate Americans about Russian activities and to deter future intrusions. \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe Russia will interfere with future U.S. elections and future elections around the world,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity \u00adbecause he was not authorized to speak on the record. \u201cThe Russian actions have been sustained over an extended period of time, and by any definition are against the national interests of the United States, not the interests of President Obama.\u201d The harassment, the official said, \u201chas been escalating steadily for some time\u201d and is \u201ca direct threat to the ability of the United States to conduct diplomacy.\u201d Both U.S. allies and American businesses were concerned about Russian activities, the official said, and \u201cif [Trump transition officials] aren\u2019t, then they should explain why.\u201d The Obama administration also released a document providing some details about the cyber operation U.S. officials have labeled \u201cGrizzly Steppe,\u201d including a list of names the hackers used. These groups have conducted campaigns against think tanks, universities and corporations, as well as government agencies, according to the administration. In foreign countries, they have carried out damaging and disruptive cyberattacks, including on electrical utilities. John Carlin, former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, said the measures announced Thursday were significant. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show that we can do attribution and are willing to impose a deterrent \u2014 not just for the Russians, but for the world, as we\u2019re figuring out what the norms should be in cyberspace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a world of free passes.\u201d Identifying the malware that was used, imposing sanctions and affecting the Russians\u2019 ability to hack for intelligence purposes all \u201craise the cost\u201d of conducting such activities, Carlin said. The Obama administration has already imposed sanctions on Russia for its activities in Ukraine, but those measures do not appear to have deterred Russia\u2019s actions there. Congressional Republicans welcomed the crackdown but said it was overdue. \u201cIt is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the measures were inadequate and promised to fight for stronger sanctions. Despite the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to deliver an 11th-hour blow against Russia, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament, suggested the measures would not inflict lasting damage. \u201cNone of this will change the results of the election of the American president, and in January, the rightful owner of the White House will be Donald Trump,\u201d Slutsky said. \u201cI expect that with his arrival the dialogue between Russia and the United States will be conducted in a more healthy political atmosphere.\u201d David Filipov and Andrew Roth in Moscow and John Wagner in Washington contributed to this report.

    "text": "Officers Killed in the Line of Duty Rose in 2016 By lisa marie pane, associated press Dec 29, 2016, 3:31 PM ET 0 Shares Email The number of police killed in the line of duty rose sharply in 2016, driven by shootings of police around the country, most notably ambushes in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana . From Jan. 1 through Wednesday, 135 officers lost their lives. Some died in traffic accidents, but nearly half were shot to death. That's a 56 percent increase in shooting deaths over the previous year. Of the 64 who were fatally shot, 21 were killed in ambush attacks often fueled by anger over police use of force involving minorities. \"We've never seen a year in my memory when we've had an increase of this magnitude in officer shooting deaths,\" said Craig Floyd, president and chief executive of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. \"These officers were killed simply because of the uniform they wear and the job they do. This is unacceptable to the humane society that we are.\" In Dallas, a sniper on July 7 attacked at the end of what had been a peaceful rally against police brutality. He killed five law enforcement officers and wounded nine others \u2014 the largest death toll among law enforcement from a single event since the 9/11 attacks, which killed 72 officers. Months later, Dallas businesses and residents still display blue ribbons and banners declaring, \"We support our Dallas police officers.\" But even amid community support, the police department remains unsettled. Hundreds of officers have retired or left the force over the past six months as the city struggles to find a way to increase pay and save a failing police and fire pension. Former Chief David Brown, who became a national figure in the aftermath, was among those who opted to retire. And interim Dallas Police Association president Frederick Frazier said that morale is \"almost nonexistent.\" \"A lot of us are going through the motions at work. We're hoping things will get better with our struggle,\" he said. Frazier added that the attack was a \"game changer. It changed the perception of law enforcement. It reversed the roll after Ferguson . We were the pursuer and now, we're being pursued.\" Less than two weeks after the Dallas attack, a lone gunman in Baton Rouge shot and killed three officers and wounded three others outside a convenience store in the weeks after a black man, 37-year-old Alton Sterling, was shot and killed by police during a struggle. Baton Rouge Police Cpl. Lester Mitchell was partners with Matthew Gerald, one of the three slain officers, and was among the officers who raced to the scene of the shooting that also killed sheriff's deputy Brad Garafola and officer Montrell Jackson. Mitchell has daily reminders of the deadly shootout, driving past the scene on his way to police headquarters. \"Just passing there, you can't help but replay it over and over again,\" he said. Mitchell said the shooting has made him more alert and aware of potential dangers on patrol, sometimes in situations that wouldn't have alarmed him before, like a hand in a pocket. \"You learn to cope with it, because if you don't, you can drive yourself crazy,\" he said. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund's Floyd said the impact of this year has been profound on law enforcement. Agencies are struggling to recruit officers to their ranks and those who continue to serve \"talk about how their head is now on a swivel.\" \"They're always looking over their shoulder, always worrying about the next attack that could come at any time from any direction,\" Floyd said. That was underscored by the slaying in November of a San Antonio detective who was fatally shot and killed outside police headquarters as he was writing a traffic ticket. The man accused of shooting him said he was angry about a child-custody battle and simply \"lashed out at somebody who didn't deserve it.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press reporters Claudia Lauer in Dallas and Mike Kunzelman in Baton Rouge contributed to this report.

    "text": "Pay to Rise for Millions as 19 States Increase Minimum Wage By david klepper, associated press ALBANY, N.Y. \u0097 Dec 29, 2016, 5:59 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this July 22, 2015 file photo, supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald's in Albany, N.Y. Millions of workers across the U.S. will see their pay increase as 19 states bump up their minimum wages as the new year begins. California, New York and Arizona are among the states with increases taking effect Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016 or Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. New York state is taking a regional approach, with the wage rising to $11 in New York City, $10 in its suburbs and $9.70 upstate. (AP Photo/Mike Groll, File) 0 Shares Email It will be a happy New Year indeed for millions of the lowest-paid U.S. workers. Nineteen states, including New York and California, will ring in the year with an increase in the minimum wage . Massachusetts and Washington state will have the highest new minimum wages in the country, at $11 per hour. California will raise its wage to $10.50 for businesses with 26 or more employees. New York state is taking a regional approach, with the wage rising to $11 in New York City, to $10.50 for small businesses in the city, $10 in its downstate suburbs and $9.70 elsewhere. Some specific businesses \u2014 fast-food restaurants and the smallest New York City businesses \u2014 will have slightly different wage requirements. \"This $1.50 increase, I cannot even comprehend or tell you how important this will be,\" said Alvin Major, a New York City fast-food worker. The 51-year-old father of four helped lead the fight for the increase in his state, one of several successful efforts by fast-food workers and other low wage workers around the country. \"The price of food has gone up. Rent has gone up. Everything has gone up. ... This will make a difference for so many people.\" Voters in Arizona, Maine, Colorado and Washington approved increases in this year's election. Seven other states, Alaska, Florida, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey , Ohio and South Dakota, are automatically raising the wage based on indexing. The other states seeing increases are Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan and Vermont . Additional increases are slated for later in the year in Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Maryland. In Arizona, the state Chamber of Commerce and Industry filed a lawsuit challenging the increase, which will raise the minimum wage from $8.05 to $10. On Thursday, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to temporarily block the raise. Workers and labor advocates argue the increases will help low-wage workers now barely making ends meet and boost the economy by giving some consumers more money to spend. But many business owners opposed the higher wages, saying they would lead to higher prices and greater automation. Some restaurant owners may consider reducing portion sizes or charging for side dishes that were once included in the price of a meal to absorb the increase, according to Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association. \"I'm sure prices will go up where they can, but restaurants want to avoid sticker shock,\" she said. \"They're going to have to get creative.\" The adjustments in New York, California and several other states are part of a series of gradual increases to a $12 or $15 hourly wage. The minimum wage will also go up this weekend in 22 cities and counties, including San Diego, San Jose and Seattle. The high number of states and localities raising the wage this year reflects the successful work of fast-food workers and organized labor, according to Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, as well as federal inaction on the wage. The national minimum was last raised, to $7.25, in 2009. \"These aren't only teens trying to make some pocket money,\" she said. \"Increasingly it's adults who are using this money to support their families.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to indicate California's minimum wage will rise to $10.50 for larger companies, instead of $10 overall. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Dec 29 2016, 12:03 pm ET 11 Surprising Predictions for 2017 From Some of The Biggest Names In Science by David Freeman advertisement What scientific discoveries will 2017 bring? What technological innovations? Probably not time travel \u2014 or time-shares on Mars. But no one really knows for sure, and when we asked some of the biggest names in in science and technology to share their predictions for the coming year, there was a bit of pushback. \"I normally don't make predictions for anything less than two trillion years in the future,\" Arizona State University cosmologist Lawrence Krauss told NBC MACH. It's easier to make predictions that far out, he added jokingly, when \"no one will be around to check them.\" Ultimately, Krauss came through with some fascinating forecasts. Read on to see them, along with predictions from legendary astronaut Buzz Aldrin and nine more thought leaders in science and tech (the submissions have been lightly edited). Buzz Aldrin Christina Korp / Christina Korp Buzz Aldrin: A New \"Race for Space\" Dr. Buzz Aldrin, the second human to walk on the moon, is a leading advocate of space science and planetary exploration. He is the co-author of several books, including \"Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration\" and \"No Dream Is Too High: Life Lessons From a Man Who Walked on the Moon.\" He lives in Satellite Beach, Florida. Given President-Elect Trump's interest in putting in place a space council, I envision a more unified approach to shaping and overhauling aspects of America's civil, military, and industrial space sectors. And get ready for intense competition in the development of human spaceflight systems, not only for use in low Earth orbit but also outward from our home planet. This commercial \"race for space\" will lead to technical and business innovations we don't yet appreciate or understand. I think the year ahead will see Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin group wring out its New Shepard reusable suborbital launch vehicle and press forward on its New Glenn booster. Similarly, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo will hasten the pace of testing to create suborbital passenger service. And keep an eye on the maiden flights of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner and the SpaceX Dragon 2 capsules \u2014 stepping stones to restore our nation's capabilities for human spaceflight. I expect Elon Musk and his SpaceX rocketeers will fly their Falcon Heavy launcher from the refurbished Launch Complex 39 pad A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. That's the same site that I rocketed from with my Apollo 11 colleagues, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, to achieve the first human landing on the Moon in July 1969! China is headed for several milestone achievements. For one, they will use their new Long March 5 and Long March 7 boosters to advance their goal of building their own space station. In addition, look for China to fly to the moon the robotic Chang'e 5 spacecraft and attempt the first lunar sample return to Earth in more than 40 years. Lastly, look for surprises from mysterious Mars! Now orbiting the Red Planet is the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter that in 2017 will \"sniff out\" whether methane detected on that world is a product of Martian microbes. Personally, I'll be working as hard as ever to rally public and political willpower to hasten the day when those first footfalls on the Red Planet lead to permanent inhabitation of Mars. Julie Brefcyznski-Lewis Richard Nolan / Richard Nolan Julie Brefcynski-Lewis: Virtual Reality Reset Dr. Julie Brefcynski-Lewis is assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology in the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute at West Virginia University in Morgantown. She has studied higher order brain functions such as attention, emotions, social interactions, and meditation. The scientific method is rooted in objectivity and has relied on government and public confidence that scientists are well trained and dedicated to accurate results. I think the big question of 2017 will be how science will adapt to a changing cultural landscape in terms of public attitudes, funding, global participation, and more. In my field of neuroscience, we are a little lucky that many lawmakers making political and funding decisions have direct experiences with neurological and mental health needs of loved ones. In terms of disruptive technology, I predict virtual reality will have a major influence on how science is performed and communicated. In my research, for example, we are adapting novel PET (positron emission tomography) brain imager technology so that it is wearable and allows imaging of someone moving and responding in a virtual environment, such as an addict in a cue-laden setting. Other laboratories are using VR to explore the shapes and functions of neurons and molecules, and it's likely to become a haven for social interactions such that exciting new studies on human behavior will emerge. George Church Courtesy of George Church / George Church George Church: Gee-Whiz Gene Editing Dr. George Church is professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston and director of personalgenomes.org. He is the author of \"Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves.\" Next year will see great strides in reading and writing genomes, organs, and ecosystems. We'll move beyond small genome \"edits\" to large-scale \"writing,\" with huge practical consequences, including resistance to all viruses. For organs, new microscopy methods will enable molecular atlases of whole bodies during normal development from eggs to adults and pathological states like cancer. Leveraging such body atlases will be recipes for constructing any tissue type and transplanting it successfully between species. For ecosystems, we will see growing numbers of tests of safety and effectiveness of genetic strategies for controlling agents (mosquitoes, worms, mice) of deadly diseases like malaria, filariasis, and Lyme disease. We will also see great progress in the use of genetic engineering to reverse processes that had seemed irreversible: aging and extinction. And super-compact encoding of data into DNA-storage will transform our ability to record video and interface with brains. Kate Darling Flavia Schaub / Flavia Schaub Kate Darling: Artificial Intelligence Heads Home Dr. Kate Darling, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, investigates social robotics and conducts experimental studies on human-robot interaction. Her work explores the emotional connection between people and life-like machines. I'm excited about the rise of personal assistant robots. We won't be seeing Rosie from the Jetsons anytime soon, but we will see more and more cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) products in the home \u2014 in particular, voice-activated speaker systems that sit on tables and countertops. These robots are at a primitive stage, have few capabilities, and are full of flaws. But there's a lot of demand for them. That's because they can perform some useful tasks (turning on music and lights, reading out loud, answering trivia) and because people enjoy interacting with a digital \"other.\" In some ways the flaws and limitations are part of these assistants' charm, and 2017 will definitely see more of these in people's lives. Katherine Freese Evan Cohen / Evan Cohen Katherine Freese: Dark Matter Answer? Dr. Katherine Freese is professor of physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a noted expert on dark matter. She is the author of \"The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter.\" My work seeks to understand what the universe is made of. Ordinary atomic material makes up only five percent of the universe. Most of the mass in the universe is made of dark matter, and we want to know what it is. Right now, only one experiment has detected a hint of dark matter: the Italian Dark Matter Experiment (DAMA). The technique the DAMA scientists use is based on a paper I wrote, and so I am dying to know if their results are right. In 2017 three other experiments will be in a position to show once and for all whether or not DAMA has actually discovered dark matter. It is possible that the 80-year-old dark matter puzzle will finally be solved. Lawrence Krauss Tessa Etzione / Tessa Etzione Lawrence Krauss: Quantum Computing Breakthroughs Dr. Lawrence Krauss is professor of earth and space exploration and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe. He is the author of nine books, including \"A Universe from Nothing\" and \"The Physics of Star Trek.\" His latest book, \"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\" is scheduled for publication in 2017. It seems to me that quantum computing is evolving very fast. I expect that some breakthroughs this this area, or in the related areas of quantum teleportation or encryption, may occur in 2017. Also in 2017, we may have new, definitive data from the South Pole on the possibility that gravitational waves from earliest moments of the Big Bang might be detectable. If so, this would have utterly profound implications for our understanding of our own universe, and maybe the existence of other universes. I don't hold out much hope for any definitive developments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in 2017 (maybe in 2018). But then I never expected them to discover the Higgs boson when they did. If they observe new particles, it will completely determine the future of particle physics. If not, will another accelerator be built to help us continue to push the frontiers of knowledge? Jennifer Kuzma Richard Nolan / Richard Nolan Jennifer Kuzma: \"Gene Drives\" Get Real Dr. Jennifer Kuzma is professor of social sciences at the School of Public and International Affairs and co-founder and co-director of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Natural scientists have discovered new biology-based tools that can precisely edit existing genes in living organisms, or insert new genes at particular locations in the genome. These \"gene editing\" tools (e.g. \"CRISPR\") are being used to change multiple genes in plants, animals, and microorganisms for industrial production of medicines or chemicals, agricultural productivity, or environmental goals such as pollution remediation. Based on gene editing, biologists have discovered ways to engineer wild populations in the environment using \"gene drives.\" With gene drives, it is theoretically possible to release just a few individuals of a species and an engineered gene can then spread throughout the wild population. Gene drives could be used to protect endangered species against disease or to reduce populations of unwanted species, such as invasive pests. Gene-edited products are already in the marketplace. Genetically engineered insects with population-reduction genes have been cleared by government agencies for environmental release in certain areas. Although gene drives have only been tested in the laboratory, we will see the first releases of organisms with gene drives in the near future, possibly 2017. The ability to engineer populations in the wild necessitates a broader public discussion about whether we want to pursue this as a society. I would like to predict this dialogue will happen, but the political will to engage the public on these topics is currently lacking. Janet Hering R. Schaffner / R. Schaffner Janet Hering: The Circular Economy Expands Dr. Janet Hering is director of the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology in Dubendorf and professor of environmental biogeochemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Industry developed the concept of the circular economy to \"extract the maximum value and use from all raw materials, products and waste, fostering energy savings and reducing Green House Gas emissions.\" This concept is increasingly being taken up by cities around the world as they recover heat from domestic sewage (Paris), reclaim water from wastewater to recharge aquifers (Orange County, California) and produce water for industrial wafer fabrication (Singapore), produce agricultural fertilizers from source-separated urine (Durban, South Africa), and produce fuel pellets from fecal sludge (Kampala, Uganda). Since 2010, over half of the world's population has been living in cities, expanding both the opportunity and the need to redefine municipal wastewater and waste as a resource. Establishing the circular economy in cities holds great promise for increasing urban sustainability. The number of cities pursuing this approach will grow rapidly in 2017. Tracey Holloway Paul Schilling / Paul Schilling Tracey Holloway: Better Weather Prediction Dr. Tracey Holloway is professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences in Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and leader of NASA's Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team. This coming year will bring a huge advance in the monitoring of Earth from space. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA worked together on a new geostationary satellite, called GOES-16, that launched in November 2016. Starting in 2017, GOES-16 will provide data almost continuously, improving weather predictions and environmental management. Satellites are already able to \"see\" our life-supporting atmosphere in a way that has transformed weather prediction, emergency response and public health. But for measurements of smoke, dust, lightning and other features, GOES-16 will be the first time we have nearly minute-by-minute data. For example, the new satellite will allow us to track forest fire smoke so that people can take measures to protect their health. This near-real-time data will be a huge step forward from current satellites that provide snapshots of these important features only once or twice a day. Each new satellite offers a treasure trove of data, publicly available to support decision-making of communities and businesses. I'm working with scientists across the country to help ensure that cities, health professionals, weather forecasters \u2014 even kids for the science fair \u2014 get the maximum benefit from these amazing eyes in the sky. Ainissa Ramirez Bruce Fizzell / Bruce Fizzell Ainissa Ramirez: One Amazing Eclipse Dr. Ainissa Ramirez is a materials scientist and author in New Haven, Connecticut. She hosts the podcast Science Underground and is writing a book on the impact of materials on history and culture. One of the biggest science events of 2017 will be a total solar eclipse. On August 21, a diagonal swath of the U.S. from Oregon to Kansas to South Carolina will go dark. More than 300 million Americans live within a two-day drive from seeing this heavenly event. How the sky blackens in the middle of the day is a bit like getting a bad seat at the movies. If a tall person seated in front of you blocks your view of the screen, then you are experiencing what happens to the Earth on a cosmic scale. In this movie drama, you are the Earth, the tall person is the moon, and the movie screen is the sun. During an eclipse, the darkness lasts only a few minutes. But it is a reminder that we are all part of something big. Eclipses also connect us to history. In ancient times, eclipses stopped wars. In 1919, an eclipse helped prove Einstein's theory of relativity. Even Thomas Edison got inspiration for his light bulb in 1878 while on a trip to Wyoming to see an eclipse. This August, all of us get a chance to be connected to nature, to science, and to each other. Perhaps we'll find other ways to connect when the darkness passes. Carlo Ratti Lars Kruger / Lars Kruger Carlo Ratti: Self-Driving Vehicles Come of Age Dr. Carlo Ratti is a professor at MIT, where he directs the Senseable City Lab. He is co-author of \"The City of Tomorrow: Sensors, Networks, Hackers, and the Future of Urban Life.\" Forget about the difficulties we saw with Uber's fleet of self-driving vehicles in San Francisco. This is soooo 2016! 2017 will be the year of self-driving, and of the exploration of its impact on our cities. Self-driving vehicles promise to blur the distinction between private and public modes of transportation. \"Your\" car could give you a lift to work in the morning and then, rather than sitting idle in a parking lot, give a lift to someone else in your family \u2014 or, for that matter, to anyone else in your neighborhood, social-media community, or city. This implies a city in which we could travel on demand with just a fraction of the number of cars in use today. Such reductions in car numbers are just theoretical. However, they could potentially lower the cost of our mobility infrastructure and the embodied energy associated with building and maintaining it. Furthermore, driverless cars could have a big impact on our lifestyle and daily activities: They could be transformed into extensions of our homes. While travelling, we might be able to do lot of activities we use to do at home \u2014 read a book, take a nap, eat, text, or make love (more than what already happens today).

(Photo: KRISTA NILES, AP) 59 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Amazon, Walmart and other retailers are being sued for $50 million for allegedly infringing on the trademark of iconic rap and hip-hop group RUN-DMC. The stores \"are trading on the goodwill\" of the band and confusing consumers by \"advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products\" that erroneously imply\u00a0the group\u00a0endorsed the merchandise, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Examples include old-school black-frame\u00a0glasses often\u00a0sported\u00a0by Darryl McDaniels \u2014 best known to fans and music lovers as DMC\u00a0\u2014 one of the band's founders and the trademark's owner, the lawsuit charged. He owns 200 pairs of similar glasses, \"the better to see what's going on in the world,\" according to an entry on the band's official website . An exhibit filed with the court complaint also showed shirts, hats and other merchandise like some worn by McDaniels, Joseph \"Reverend Run\" Simmons, and Jason \"Jam Master J\" Mizell\u00a0when the trio shot to music and cultural stardom from their 1980s start in the Hollis, Queens neighborhood of New York City. The band members, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009 for a string of hits that include \"It's Like That,\" \"My Adidas,\" and \"You Be Illin,\" no longer perform together but are widely considered\u00a0as rap elder statesmen. Mizell died in an\u00a0 unsolved 2002 shooting . \"The number of infringing materials\" allegedly marketed and sold by the companies \"are too numerous to properly list,\" according to the lawsuit, which alleged the retailers' actions have \"harmed RUN-DMC in its business.\" Along with Amazon and Walmart, the court complaint targets retailers Jet.com, Vision World, Infinity Fashion and SW Global. All are Amazon business partners, the lawsuit alleges. The companies either could not be reached or did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. Christopher Brown, a Boston-based attorney who filed the case, similarly did not return a message seeking comment.

A woman talks with members of the Chicago Police Department at the scene where two people were killed and were wounded\u00a0in\u00a0the 8600 block of South Maryland Avenue on Dec. 25, 2016. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune It was movie night in Demarco Kennedy's Far South Side apartment. The 32-year-old railroad worker's wife and three children waited for him in the living room, with plans to watch the animated film \"Rio 2.\" He sat at his dining room table, paying bills. Then, gunshots. Kennedy's kids, coached in the past by their wary parents, dropped to the floor. As the children attempted to crawl into a hallway, Kennedy's wife saw him fall over. The left side of his face was streaked with blood from a bullet wound. \"He was grabbing my hand real hard. He was trying to say something and he couldn't,\" Nicole Cooper said Tuesday, recounting the August evening when her husband was slain. \"And when he released my hand, that's when he passed.\" With that random bullet through the family's window, Kennedy became another homicide victim in Chicago, one of more than 750 in 2016. Demarco Kennedy Family photo Demarco Kennedy was killed by a stray bullet in his Far South Side apartment in August. Demarco Kennedy was killed by a stray bullet in his Far South Side apartment in August. (Family photo) A persistent reality for some of Chicago's toughest neighborhoods, violence unnerved far reaches of the city in 2016 as shootings and homicides soared. Not since the drug-fueled bloodshed of the mid-1990s had the city witnessed such a toll. Some neighborhoods, already scarred and gutted by years of violence, suffered inordinately. But the danger spread into more neighborhoods, too, and randomness became an all-too-familiar element to many shootings. Grim milestones added up: The deadliest month in 23 years. The deadliest day in 13 years. 4,300 people shot. As the year wound down, with the promise of a new year coming soon, a violent Christmas Day. \"It's a shame. It's a shame,\" said Rafi Peterson, a community activist in the Chicago Lawn community on the Southwest Side. \"Those lives cannot be replaced. \"How did this happen? Why is this continuing to happen?\" For months, police, politicians and residents have asked the same questions. In a recent interview at police headquarters, Superintendent Eddie Johnson and his second-in-command, First Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro, speculated on the rise in homicides. They blamed, in part, a perceived willingness by criminals to settle disputes with guns, and what they say is a failure on the part of the justice system to hold them accountable. Read more stories \"We used to respond to gang fights in progress \u2026 now we respond to shots fired,\" Navarro said. \"People fought. Now everyone picks up the gun. Just like that.\" Through Dec. 26, 754 people were slain in Chicago compared with  480 during the same period last year, an increase of 57 percent, according to official Police Department statistics. The last time Chicago tallied a similar number of killings was in 1997, when 761 people were slain. Shooting incidents also jumped by 46 percent this year to 3,512 from 2,398, the statistics show. What's more, crimes went up by double digits in nearly every major category, including criminal sexual assaults, robberies and thefts. Month by month, Chicago's homicide numbers have ticked upward. On cold days and warm days, snowy days and during holiday weekends alike. Kennedy's slaying on Aug. 9 in the Rosemoor neighborhood was among the 92 homicides across Chicago that month, the most the city had seen for a single month since July 1993 when there were 99. The weekend immediately before Halloween ended with 59 people shot, 17 fatally, the deadliest weekend of 2016. In November, homicides totaled 77, the worst for that month since 78 in 1994. The Police Department statistics do not include about an additional 20 killings on area expressways, police-involved shootings, other homicides in which a person was killed in self-defense or death investigations. Looking back to 1998, when Chicago recorded 704 homicides, the city was in the midst of a homicide decline from more than 900 earlier in the decade. The turn of the millennium saw a bottoming out, with homicides dropping to 453 at the end of 2004 \u2014 around the time the Police Department began relying on computerized data to know where to deploy officers where they're needed the most. The tally rose again somewhat, then went down again in 2014, when the city recorded 416 slayings. (Peter Nickeas) As the homicide numbers headed upward this year, crime experts cautioned against making year-to-year comparisons, arguing that long-term trends give a better understanding of how the level of violence in a city has changed over time. Still, even though it  has a lower homicide rate than many U.S. cities with smaller populations, Chicago by far continued to lead the nation in  actual number of slayings. The city's homicides outpaced  New York City and Los Angeles combined, even though their populations far exceed Chicago's 2.7 million people. According to official statistics through Dec. 18, the most recent publicly available, New York and Los Angeles had a combined 613 homicides, fewer  than Chicago's total. In addition, there were a combined 2,306 shooting victims in the two cities, about half of Chicago's total. Crime experts cannot point to any definitive factors for the increases in shootings and homicides in Chicago this year. But some experts have come to one conclusion: Chicago's dramatic rise in homicides this year is the highest of any major city. A draft released Thursday of a new study from the University of Chicago Crime Lab noted that of the five largest U.S. cities by population, including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Houston, Chicago has seen the largest single-year homicide increase of the last 25 years. The study also noted that the increase in slayings this year was \"sudden and sustained,\" with each month recording more homicides than the same months in 2015. But they pointed out that other cities throughout the country have also seen increases in homicides. \"The fact that many other American cities saw homicides increase in 2015 and 2016 suggests that part of what Chicago experienced this past year may not be unique to our city,\" according to the study. (David Heinzmann) The study's authors were careful to say they could not explain why Chicago's violence has gone up, though they said weather patterns, declines in finances for social services, and any changes in police response couldn't be definitively linked to the sudden and dramatic increase. They did note, however, that more homicides were committed with guns in Chicago than other cities. In 2016, about 91 percent of Chicago's homicides were committed with a firearm, up from 88 percent last year, the study showed. When you compare that with  1998, the last time Chicago recorded over 700 homicides, about 76 percent of those victims were killed with guns, official Police Department statistics show. Los Angeles' homicides committed with guns averaged 72 percent from 2011 to 2015, and 60 percent in New York City, the study noted. However, Jens Ludwig, a professor of social service administration, law and public policy at the University of Chicago, said that the study could not conclude whether there were actually more guns on Chicago's streets this year compared with  past years. \"There's no way to know if more guns are flooding into Chicago because there's no definitive measure of the numbers of guns in Chicago,\" said Ludwig, one of the authors of the study. Police struggle The year was tumultuous for the Chicago Police Department, as it struggled to contain the rise in violence while also undergoing  reforms sparked by the release of 2014 video that showed Officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. A torrent of street protests followed. A wide-ranging civil rights investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into the city's police practices was launched. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder and Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. Johnson, in the recent interview, said negative attitudes toward the police began to grow in 2014 when a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Mo. The McDonald shooting intensified that distrust and anger in Chicago. These incidents diminished the respect that police once had, emboldening criminals, Johnson said. \"The level of disrespect I see for police now, I've never seen it like this in 28 years,\" he said. \"The willingness of the bad guy to engage a police officer, I've never, it's just different. \u2026 Before, they didn't engage the police like they do now. \"Now, the police are perceived as the bad guy, and they're not given the benefit of the doubt anymore,\" Johnson said. \"Back then in '98, it was the total reverse. ... Don't think that the bad guy doesn't look at what's (happening) on CNN and say, 'Oh, they're really giving it to the police. Now is my time to shine.'\" (Jeremy Gorner) Indeed, officers have told the Tribune that morale was lower this year. Officers described taking a more cautious approach to their work, concerned they could end up in a viral  video, sued or fired. The Tribune chronicled two key measures that appeared to show cops scaled back on their interaction with the public. Arrests, which have generally been on the decline in recent years, dropped sharply through Dec. 25 to 84,644, a 24 percent decrease from 111,499 a year earlier and the fewest in at least five years, according to official police statistics. Over that same period, street stops \u2014 in which officers stop people on foot and document the interaction \u2014 have plunged to 106,570, down 82 percent from 599,590 a year earlier. Officers complain a longer, time-consuming form that police must fill out for each stop has played a significant part in the drop. However, the draft U. of C. study released Thursday questioned whether Chicago's decline in street stops and arrests truly could be a driving factor of violence, noting that when New York's stops dropped in recent years, homicides did not dramatically increase. Still, the researchers  noted that reducing street stops could have a different effect \"across cities,\" but that the factor isn't well understood yet. Critics of the department say that decades of officer misconduct and the department's failure to discipline officers has also played a large role in the public's mistrust of police. Johnson acknowledged there is a widened gap between police and minority communities, a distrust that he and some crime experts believe has contributed to the increase in violence. \"We treated the black community inappropriately in a lot of instances,\" he said during the interview. \"You cannot go into a community and stop everybody. You see a man with a Comcast uniform on ... walking his wife to the grocery store, and you're stopping him. Why? \"That creates a lot of mistrust between the community and the Police Department,\" Johnson continued. \"We recognize that we did treat certain parts of this city inappropriately. And that was our fault. So we have to correct that. But you can't correct it until you acknowledge that it was a problem.\" Guns and gangs Police officials have also blamed much of Chicago's violence on the flow of illegal firearms through dangerous neighborhoods, mainly on the South and West sides. That problem, experts say, is far worse in Chicago than in New York and Los Angeles. Johnson has spoken often about legislation in the works in Springfield aimed at requiring repeat gun offenders to serve longer prison terms. Officials have also blamed an intractable gang problem in Chicago for the violence. Once highly structured and hierarchal, Chicago's street gangs have fractured into small factions. Petty disagreements and personal disputes fueled by social media can quickly turn violent, police officials have said. Chicago police investigated many shootings over the Christmas weekend.\u00a0 (Armando Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Gang expert John Hagedorn noted that by the late 1990s, the organized gang wars for power and dominance were starting to become less commonplace. Gang leaders went to jail. The nationwide crack epidemic was coming to an end, causing the gangs to make less money in narcotics than before, he said. Chicago's sprawling public housing complexes were also being torn down, Hagedorn noted, sending gang members to different parts of the city where other gangs were in control. All of these elements shifted the nature of the city's gangs from \"a culture of obedience\" to \"a culture of autonomy,\" he said. \"Kids were off on their own. The nature of the violence swings,\" said Hagedorn, a professor of criminology, law and justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \"Rather than violent orders from the top \u2026 violence today is local between sects and it's spontaneous, not structured. And there's nobody around to control it.\" Johnson said the department is trying to utilize its so-called strategic subject list to beat back gangs. The department uses a computerized algorithm to identify about 1,400 people, mostly gang members, considered most likely to shoot someone or become a victim of violence. Once they're identified, the department tries to contact these people, warn them of the consequences of their lifestyles and try to steer them on the right path by offering them an array of social services. Neighborhoods under fire Most of the violence in 2016 has been concentrated on the South and West sides, in communities struggling with decades of poverty, entrenched segregation, gangs, rampant narcotics sales and other social ills. Two of the city's historically most violent police districts \u2014 Harrison and Englewood \u2014 account for almost one-fourth of Chicago's homicides and shooting incidents. But, violence has touched most of the city, spiking in nearly all of the 22 patrol districts. Harrison, a West Side district that includes communities such as West Garfield Park and North Lawndale, has recorded the worst violence. Through Dec. 25, 92 people were killed, a 92 percent increase over the 48 people slain a year earlier, official department statistics show. Shooting incidents rose to 469, up 74 percent from 270 a year earlier. One block in West Garfield Park, the 4400 block of West Monroe Street, has seen at least 10 people shot this year, one of them fatally, according to a Tribune analysis. The block is just north of the Eisenhower Expressway, nicknamed the \"Heroin Highway\" because of its easy access for drug-buying suburbanites. Conflicts over lucrative drug spots throughout the area fuel much of the violence. ",

A tweet Thursday from the Unified Police official Twitter account announced the arrest of Oscar Bermejo-Zaragoza. Police did not offer further details or return a message seeking more information. Salt Lake County jail records show Bermejo-Zaragoza was being held Thursday afternoon on suspicion of aggravated assault and discharging a firearm toward a vehicle. Police say on Wednesday, the 9-year-old boy was sitting with several other children in the backseat of a parked SUV in the town of Kearns, about 15 miles from Salt Lake City, when one shot was fired from a passing car occupied by two men. The bullet went through the SUV's windshield and hit the boy in the head. He underwent emergency surgery Wednesday night and remained in critical condition Thursday, police said. Unified Police Detective Ken Hansen said Thursday that doctors may not know until the weekend whether the boy will recover. No other children were injured. Hansen said police believe the shooting was gang-related and someone else was the target. The car that the two men were seen in was later found in Salt Lake City. Court records show Bermejo-Zaragoza faces aggravated burglary, robbery and assault charges from a September home invasion in Ogden. He has not yet entered a plea in that case. He was not in custody for that case because he had posted a $50,000 bond. Bermejo-Zaragoza was scheduled to appear at a hearing regarding the September charges Thursday morning, but it wasn't clear if he made the appearance before his arrest Thursday. His attorney in that case, James Retallick, and prosecuting attorney Brody Flint did not return messages. 0 Shares ",

A\u00a0couple of cheetahs are photographed Aug. 22, 2012, in the Tamboti Game Reserve, near Lephalale, South Africa. Conservationists are sounding alarm bells for the cheetah, the fastest animal on land. A new study says there are an estimated 7,100 cheetahs remaining across Africa and in a small area in Iran. (Kevin Anderson / AP) Sarah KaplanWashington Post More than 100,000 cheetahs prowled Africa's arid grasslands little more than a century ago. But the powerful predators now number just 7,100, and their populations are plummeting toward extinction, according to a new report. In a study published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers called for cheetahs' conservation status to be raised to \"endangered,\" to reflect their low numbers and stave off further declines. \"Given the secretive nature of this elusive cat, it has been difficult to gather hard information on the species, leading to its plight being overlooked,' lead author Sarah Durant, a researcher at the Zoological Society of London and the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a statement. \"Our findings show that the large space requirements for the cheetah, coupled with the complex range of threats faced by the species in the wild, mean that it is likely to be much more vulnerable to extinction than was previously thought.\" Cheetahs, the fastest animals on land, require home ranges that can span thousands of miles. Their habitat once extended across Africa all the way to southwestern Asia. But it has been fragmented by humans, and the population is divided as a result. This splintered existence makes survival even more difficult for animals; without genetic diversity from breeding with unrelated animals, each fragile group becomes even more vulnerable to disease, food shortages and environmental change. Of the 7,100 cheetahs estimated by the study, there is one relatively healthy group of about 4,000 living across six countries in southern Africa. Then there are about 1,000 in the Serengeti, plus clusters as big as 200 and as small as 10 scattered across a few dozen pockets of protected habitat. The species has been all but wiped out in Asia - just 50 still live in Iran. More than 75 percent of the cheetah's range is not part of a protected area, and that makes it difficult to ensure their safety \u2014 or even figure out how many of the creatures are still alive. Though governments are required to keep track of cheetahs within national parks, there is little data on the number of animals outside them. But the animals' extensive ranges mean they're constantly roving past the reach of protections afforded them on public lands. Beyond these borders, cheetahs risk run-ins with humans: They may be slain to protect livestock, struck by cars, or hunted for sale on the black market, where a cub might fetch as much as $10,000, according to the BBC.

    "text": "Dec. 29, 2016 | REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON Talia Williams was killed in 2005 at the age of 5 by her father, Naeem Williams, then an active-duty infantryman stationed in Hawaii. (Inform) Naeem Williams in an undated photo. (Helene L. Allen, Paralegal US Army Trial Defense Service, Hawaii Field Office) Talia Williams, left, was killed in 2005 at the age of 5 by her father, Naeem Williams, right, then an active-duty infantryman stationed in Hawaii. (Helene L. Allen / U.S. Army; Inform) In September 2011, Army Sgt. 1st Class Crispen Hanson\u2019s commander at Ft.\u00a0Bliss ordered him into a military treatment program for child abusers. Texas child welfare authorities had formally\u00a0reported a\u00a0\u201creason to believe\u201d the 20-year Army veteran had severely beaten his 6-month-old son, Malachi, leaving him with a broken leg. For the next four months, Hanson met weekly with a therapist from the Family Advocacy Program, a $200-million-a-year Pentagon program known as FAP that seeks to prevent child abuse in the ranks. When Hanson completed the therapy, FAP officials closed the case and a state judge allowed him to see his infant son. But three months later, on April 9, 2012, El Paso paramedics called to Hanson\u2019s house found Malachi dead. An autopsy found \u201cblunt force injuries\u201d and \u201cinnumerable contusions of the head, torso\u00a0and extremities.\u201d The county medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. Last year, Hanson pleaded guilty to two counts of injuring a child after prosecutors agreed to drop murder charges.\u00a0A state judge sentenced him to probation. The Army gave him an honorable discharge and a full pension of about $28,000 a year. Army Sgt. 1st Class Crispen Hanson pleaded guilty to two counts of injuring a child after his toddler son, Malachi, was found dead in his home. (El Paso Police Department) Army officials said the decision to close the FAP case before the infant\u2019s death was appropriate.\u00a0\u201cNo program has a 100% guarantee of success when dealing with individuals,\u201d said William Costlow, an Army spokesman.\u00a0 The Pentagon has struggled to deal with a little-noticed cascade of child abuse and neglect cases in military families in the years since America went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, a Times investigation has found. Previously unreleased reports by the Army, Navy and Air Force reveal numerous cases where military officials knew or suspected that child abuse or neglect was occurring \u2014 but failed to intervene or to alert the Family Advocacy Program or state child welfare agencies, The Times found. In many cases, the reports blamed military personnel for failing to report cases of abuse and neglect to FAP officials.\u00a0 FAP \u201cis not accessing those most in need due to \u2026 failure on the part of others to report\u00a0concerns or maltreatment incidents,\u201d warned an\u00a0 internal 2014 report on 27 deaths in Army families. \u201cIn several cases, command was aware of ongoing abuse but failed to report it,\u201d it added. A 2014 report on 50 deaths in Air Force families over five years reached a similar conclusion. \u201cIn numerous cases \u2026 Air Force employees and other individuals were aware of suspected child maltreatment or domestic abuse and did not report it to FAP or any other authority,\u201d it said. Citing privacy restrictions,\u00a0Pentagon officials redacted parts of each report, which were\u00a0released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. The Times was able to identify many victims and their abusers by comparing the reports with\u00a0court records and other legal documents. Even senior FAP officials concede they are able to help only a fraction of the children who suffer abuse. \u201cWe get about 25% of the incidents,\u201d said Rene Robichaux,\u00a0who oversees an Army-wide\u00a0clinical\u00a0child abuse treatment program from the Army Medical Command in San Antonio. \u201cThe rest occur behind closed doors.\u201d There's a real reluctance to address child abuse fatalities in the military because it's a career-ender for soldiers. \u2014 Theresa Covington, head of the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths America\u2019s longest wars already have been associated with poor\u00a0mental health in military families, behavioral problems in children, a higher risk of divorce, and higher rates of suicide, studies show. Experts now add child abuse to that tragic list. \u201cWe have a relatively high rate of child maltreatment,\u201d said Dr. Sharon Cooper, a pediatrician and retired Army colonel\u00a0who treats child abuse\u00a0victims at Ft.\u00a0Bragg in North Carolina.\u00a0\u201cAnd we know that child abuse and neglect is highly influenced by deployment.\u201d Child fatalities have soared even as the armed forces have shrunk by 10% in recent years. Fatalities more than doubled from 14 in 2003 to 38 in 2012. They\u00a0remained above 30 a year through 2014 before dropping to 23 in 2015, the last year that Pentagon records are available. Overall, FAP\u00a0counted 5,378 child abuse and neglect victims in military families in 2015. The Pentagon long has claimed that child abuse is less severe in the military than in the\u00a0civilian population. The military weeds out alcohol and drug users with random tests\u00a0and annual fitness reports, and the mental strain of unemployment isn\u2019t a problem. Moreover, base commanders are supposed to monitor their troops\u2019 daily lives and the welfare of their families. They can order FAP to counsel parents and even temporarily bar service members from contact with their families in abuse cases.\u00a0 Military bases also are required to cooperate closely with state child welfare agencies, which share responsibility for protecting children in military families living on and off U.S. installations. But in the last five years, the rate of child abuse and neglect in the military has gone up sharply \u2014 from 4.8\u00a0incidents per 1,000 children\u00a0to 7.2 incidents, according to Pentagon records. Civilian rates vary depending on how they\u2019re counted, but generally are higher. Kylee Houston lived her entire brief life inside the secure gates of Naval Air Station New Orleans. She was found dead in a soiled crib at age 14 weeks. (Edmund D. Fountain / For The Times) The failure of base commanders to intervene has sparked special concern among child welfare advocates. Experts say those failures may occur because a criminal charge of child abuse\u00a0can lead to a soldier\u2019s discharge \u2014 costing the family its livelihood \u2014 and also can be seen as a blot on a commander\u2019s record. \u201cThere's a real reluctance to address child abuse fatalities in the military because it's a career-ender for soldiers,\u201d said Theresa Covington, head of the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths, a nonprofit group in Washington that works closely with the Pentagon. Underlying the problems is the belief at senior levels of the Pentagon that the military can handle family violence by ordering an accused abuser into FAP counseling, experts say. \u201cUltimately an allegation\u00a0of abuse is plopped down on the desk of some commander, who is supposed to take action, as if ... you can discipline somebody who is abusing their children and make them stop, which is absurd,\u201d said Mark Davis, an attorney involved in a decadelong lawsuit against the Army over the abuse death of 5-year-old girl on a military base in Hawaii. Created after the Vietnam War, FAP now has more than 2,000 case workers and administrators. They offer help to 1.2 million active-duty couples\u00a0and 1.1 million children\u00a0at almost every U.S. military base, including in Germany, Japan and other overseas posts where families are allowed. In the most violent cases, FAP officials can seek a protective order from the military that bars an abusive parent from contact with a child, or ask a civilian court to place a battered child in foster care. FAP and Pentagon officials say the program provides valuable counseling, parenting classes, home visits and other help to thousands of military families, many of them young parents living on their own for the first time. \u201cThe welfare of our service members and their family members warrants the highest priority in the Department of Defense,\u201d said a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Benjamin E. Sakrisson.\u00a0\u201cThe department is actively committed to keeping children safe and healthy.\u201d The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines\u00a0all have boosted training and staffing at their FAP operations over the last decade, officials say. FAP staffing at Army bases, for instance, has grown from 136 to 390, with many new hires assigned to visit homes of new parents to teach parenting techniques. But some FAP offices are overwhelmed, especially after units deployed overseas return home. At Ft. Bragg, the nation\u2019s largest Army base, soldiers often wait weeks to see a FAP therapist for routine counseling, said Anne Malena, a civilian social worker in private practice who mostly works with Ft. Bragg families. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely overworked, and they\u2019re working on crisis situations most of the time,\u201d she said. FAP officials contend it is unfair to blame their staff for failing to foresee which military parents will abuse their children when warning signs often are fragmentary or ambiguous. \u201cPredicting these kinds of events is an extremely difficult thing to do,\u201d said Dr. Terri Rau, a psychiatrist and senior policy analyst for the Navy\u2019s\u00a0Fleet and Family Support Programs in Norfolk, Va., which oversees\u00a0FAP. Yet in some cases, there were clear warning signs. In August 2012, for example, Tamryn Klapheke starved to death in her crib at her parents\u2019 house on Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. She was 22 months old. Tiffany Klapheke, right, at the Taylor County Courthouse in Abilene, Texas. (Nellie Doneva / Associated Press) State prosecutors said her mother, Tiffany Klapheke, had left the infant without food or water for four days while her husband, an Air Force enlisted man, was overseas. Her two other children were also badly malnourished. Both the base FAP office and Texas\u2019\u00a0Child Protective Services, the state agency responsible for investigating child abuse, had been repeatedly warned of neglect at the house. Air Force doctors had notified both offices in 2010 and 2011 that the older children were underweight and had missed medical appointments. \u201cThe consequences of not feeding the child could be fatal,\u201d Edward Wilcock, the FAP social worker assigned to Tamryn\u2019s case, wrote in her file in September 2011. But FAP closed its case three months later when Klapheke completed her assigned doctor visits and Tamryn had gained a little weight, records show. Child Protective Services in Taylor County, where Dyess is located, closed its own investigation a week before Tamryn starved to death. Its last face-to-face contact with the family was 10 months earlier, courts records show. Klapheke, 23, was convicted of injury to a child and sentenced in state court to 30 years in prison. Four employees from Child Protective Services resigned over misconduct in the case. The two older children were placed with a foster family. Wilcock, who remains employed by FAP at Dyess,\u00a0declined to comment for this story. Capt. Nicole Ferrara, a base spokeswoman, said the Air Force investigated whether \u201cvarious personnel met their required duty obligations,\u201d and said \u201cappropriate action was taken to address the findings.\u201d She declined to disclose the findings\u00a0or the action taken. FAP\u00a0also failed Kylee Houston, who lived her entire brief life inside the secure gates of Naval Air Station New Orleans. Just 14 weeks old, the malnourished infant died in a soiled crib at her home on March 15, 2015. An autopsy blamed accidental suffocation. Kylee\u2019s twin sister and four siblings, all under age 5, also suffered from extreme neglect, police found. State prosecutors put them all in foster care and arrested the parents on charges of cruelty to juveniles and second-degree murder. The father, Navy Seaman Xavier Houston, pleaded guilty in January to cruelty to juveniles and is serving a 10-year prison sentence. His wife, Calendria, is awaiting trial. FAP was well aware of the danger. On July 1, 2014, neighbors called the military police when they heard the parents fighting, a frequent occurrence. The police report noted that one child was filthy and the house reeked of dirty diapers. Calendria Rochell Houston, left, is awaiting trial and Navy Seaman Xavier Montrez Houston is serving a 10-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to charges stemming from the death of Kylee Houston. (Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office) The police shared the report with the base Fleet and Family Support Center, which oversees the FAP\u00a0office. But the\u00a0office\u00a0didn\u2019t inform Louisiana\u2019s child welfare agency, as an agreement between the base and the state required. A month later, on Aug. 5, Calendria Houston complained to\u00a0base authorities that her husband had \u201cleft their four children, ranging in age from 3 years old to 5 months old, unattended at their residence,\u201d according to a Navy investigation.\u00a0 At his commander\u2019s urging, Xavier Houston had met a FAP counselor \u201ca handful of times\u201d to discuss his strained marriage, but not the welfare of his children, according to Houston\u2019s attorney, Clarke Beljean. That failure angers Charles J. Ballay, the district attorney in Louisiana\u2019s Plaquemines Parish who is prosecuting the parents. The military was \u201caware or should have been aware\u201d that the Houstons were neglecting their children, Ballay said. \u201cSomebody should have taken action to save the life of this young child.\u201d The Navy appears to agree. Mike Andrews, a Navy spokesman, said \u201cseveral\u201d contractors involved in the Houston case resigned after Kylee\u2019s death. He declined to identify them or say if they quit in response to pending disciplinary action. Military police on the base were instructed for the first time to notify Louisiana\u2019s child protection agency in cases \u201cinvolving child welfare of any kind,\u201d Andrews said. FAP\u00a0has come under fire before.\u00a0 In the early 1980s, about a decade after the Army, Navy and Air Force each developed programs for treating domestic violence on military installations, an investigation by federal auditors found the efforts were poorly funded, understaffed and often inadequate. Congress provided additional money in response and ordered the Pentagon to keep better track of personnel accused of abuse. After cases continued to increase, Congress in 2001 created an independent task force to evaluate the military\u2019s efforts. The panel issued 193 recommendations, including\u00a0a call for the Pentagon to hire hundreds of \u201cvictim advocates\u201d on military bases to help abused children and spouses, whom panel members felt often received short shrift from FAP. The task force delivered its report to Congress on the same day in March 2003 that U.S. forces invaded Iraq. During a House Armed Services Committee hearing, distracted lawmakers ducked into side rooms to watch the invasion on TV. The Pentagon ultimately adopted many of the changes the panel proposed. In 2011, Jessica Wright, then undersecretary of Defense for personnel and readiness, ordered another \u201ctop-level rapid review\u201d of FAP. It produced 84 \u201cpreliminary ideas\u201d for improvements. It also led to creation of an Integrated Project Team\u00a0to recommend ways to \u201chelp families in need and at risk as early as possible,\u201d said Sakrisson, the Pentagon spokesman. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a major in the Army National Guard , is one of the few lawmakers to focus on the issue. Congress this month passed a national defense authorization bill that includes a provision Gabbard introduced that requires military personnel to immediately report suspected cases of child abuse to FAP and to state child protection agencies. Yet even when the military and civilian agencies cooperate, victims go undetected. In November 2011, for example, Laquita Lewis told police that her boyfriend, Jerrell Edwards, had punched and nearly strangled her after she complained he was driving too fast. Both sailors were stationed at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. Since her son Jaiden, who was 2 1/2, was in the vehicle and she was pregnant with Edwards\u2019 child, the FAP office opened an investigation into \u201cchild neglect and domestic physical abuse,\u201d records show. Navy commanders ordered the couple to break off contact for a month. But the base \u201cincident determination committee\u201d\u00a0\u2014 a panel that includes senior officers, FAP officials, military police, hospital personnel and others who see abuse cases \u2014 voted to close the case three months later, ruling that Edwards\u2019 behavior \u201cdid not meet criteria for abuse,\u201d records show. Virginia Child Protective Services, which had opened a separate investigation, closed its case after social workers made a single visit to Lewis\u2019 apartment. Edwards, who broke up with Lewis, was discharged from the Navy for using marijuana. But she let him move in after their baby was born. In April 2012, Lewis found Edwards trying to revive Jaiden at the apartment. The toddler was unconscious and bleeding from the mouth, according to Navy documents. Jaiden died at the hospital hours later, and an autopsy revealed a \u201cruptured stomach, lacerated liver and bruising to his colon,\u201d as well as an apparent cigarette burn on his foot,\u00a0the records show. The incident determination committee\u00a0reexamined the evidence. This time they concluded that Edwards had repeatedly subjected Jaiden to \u201csevere physical abuse,\u201d case records show. Edwards was convicted in May 2014 in state court of murder and child abuse\u00a0and sentenced to 30 years in prison.\u00a0 \u201cI thought I was doing the right thing by letting him spend time with his new child,\u201d Lewis said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision I live with every day. But I can\u2019t help feel that the Navy failed me and Jaiden in some way.\u201d I can\u2019t help feel that the Navy failed me and Jaiden in some way. \u2014 Laquita Lewis No case better highlighted the military\u2019s failure to protect children than the brutal death of 5-year-old Talia Williams. The tragedy inspired Gabbard, the Hawaii lawmaker hoping to reform FAP, to call her legislation \u201cTalia\u2019s Law.\u201d \u201cThis young girl was abused for months and not removed from the abuse, even though she was living in military housing and the military has mandatory reporting,\u201d said Gabbard, a major in the Army National Guard. The procedures \u201cfailed Talia and they have failed many, many other children in military families.\u201d Talia was killed in July 2005 after months of near-daily beatings by her stepmother, Delilah Williams, and her father, Spc. Naeem Williams, a soldier at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii. At one point, military police took Talia to a base medical clinic after her day-care center reported bruises on her arms and back. Talia told the staff that her father hit her with \u201cMr. Paddle\u201d when he got angry, according to court testimony. But she was returned to her parents. One of her stepmother\u2019s co-workers later went directly to FAP to report her concerns that Talia was being abused. She recounted overhearing Williams say it was \u201cOK to whip a child, just don\u2019t leave any marks,\u201d according to court records. Tarshia Williams displays a pendant with her daughter Talia's face on it. (Sam Eifling / Associated Press) Hilda Borja, the FAP\u00a0official who received the complaint, took no action, according to Army and court records. An Army investigation later found Borja was \u201cnegligent in her duty to report suspected child abuse.\u201d The report cited \u201ca series of missed opportunities\u201d by authorities that could have prevented Talia\u2019s death. Borja resigned before the Army finished its disciplinary proceedings, officials said. In a brief phone interview, she said \u201cthe truth is I had nothing to do with that family.\u201d Spc. Williams was sentenced last year to life in federal prison for murder. His wife was sentenced to 20 years in prison after she testified against him. But the case had an unusual postscript. In 2008, Tarshia Williams, Talia\u2019s biological mother, sued the Army in federal court for negligence and wrongful death. Justice Department lawyers argued that the Army could not be held liable for child abuse on military bases.\u00a0Protecting battered children, even on a base, was the job of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Human Services, not the Army, the government lawyers argued. \u201cThe Army has no legal framework for taking custody or otherwise acting formally to protect abused children, and therefore explicitly relies on\u201d state child protection agencies, the Justice Department claimed\u00a0in court documents. U.S. District Judge Alan C. Kay rejected the government\u2019s\u00a0motion to dismiss the case. The Justice Department settled with Talia\u2019s mother last year for $2 million. The short, sad life of Rylan Ott Military and state authorities failed to save a 2-year-old boy from abuse. Police responding to gunfire at a mobile home near Ft. Bragg one night found a soldier in full military gear, waving an AR-15 assault rifle and trying to get a child to snort a powerful prescription tranquilizer. Spc. Devin Havis and Samantha Bryant, his girlfriend, were abusing Klonopin and urging Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Brittany, \u201cto engage in this drug use,\u201d according to a police report from the October 2015 incident. Officers found the girl hiding in a closet with her 17-month-old half-brother Rylan. Police charged Havis and Bryant with child abuse and \u201cfighting with firearms in the presence of minors.\u201d Bryant was committed to a local hospital\u2019s mental health ward for three days. The two children were placed in foster care at Ft. Bragg for their protection while military and civilian agencies investigated.But America\u2019s largest Army base \u2014 \u00a0a heavily guarded enclave that is home to 238,000 soldiers and civilians \u2014 proved no refuge.\u00a0 On April 14, four months after a state judge returned the two children to their mother, Rylan drowned in a pond near the mobile home. Army Spc. Devin Havis, left, was living with Samantha Bryant, right, when Bryant's son, Rylan Ott,  drowned in a nearby lake. Havis was kicked out of the Army with a general discharge and Bryant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. (Moore County Sheriff's Office) Bryant was charged with involuntary manslaughter and child neglect and is in Moore County jail awaiting trial. Havis \u2014 who was not prosecuted on the earlier charges \u2014 was kicked out of the Army with a general discharge, one level below an honorable discharge.\u00a0 Rylan\u2019s death was one of at least five child fatalities or severe abuse and neglect cases at Ft. Bragg over the last 14 months. Ft. Bragg officials declined to discuss the five cases, citing legal proceedings. But it\u2019s clear, from court records and interviews, that the system failed toddler Rylan Ott. His father, Spc. Corey Ott, had married Samantha Bryant in 2014, and their relationship was volatile. \u201cShe liked to drink and party, and so did I, but when she drank, she got crazy,\u201d Ott said in an interview. She liked to drink and party, and so did I, but when she drank, she got crazy. \u2014 Spc. Corey Ott The pond in Vass, N.C., where 23-month-old Rylan Ott drowned. (Greg Barnes / Fayetteville Observer) They lived in a cramped apartment on Ft. Bragg after Rylan was born, and then moved to an on-base house. Bryant\u2019s daughter, Brittany, came from Texas to live with them. But after Ott began an eight-month deployment to the United Arab Emirates, Bryant moved to a mobile home off base with the two children. She also began seeing Havis, a military policeman. \u201cShe got my boy and my truck and just took off,\u201d Ott said. \u201cI felt like I was losing my family.\u201d\u00a0 When Ott returned in September 2015, Bryant refused to rejoin him. She showed him a new AR-15 rifle with a high-powered sight, saying she had bought it herself. Ott didn\u2019t believe her, convinced that the weapon was proof she was seeing another soldier. Bryant and Havis were arrested three weeks later for firing the AR-15 and sniffing Klonopin, an anti-seizure medication that is often abused, around her children.\u00a0 Sgt. Shane Mills and his wife, Amanda, whose daughters attended school with Brittany, agreed to act as foster parents while the Moore County child protective services agency investigated the case. Rylan was \u201creal quiet\u201d and very thin when he arrived on Nov. 2, Amanda Mills recalled. After a month, he had become a \u00a0\u201csweet, smiling, laughing\u201d little boy, she said. The toddler\u2019s mother was allowed to visit three times a week. But Bryant was so disruptive that the Mills asked authorities to halt the visits. After that, social workers drove the children to offices 25 miles away so Bryant could see them in supervised visits.\u00a0 On Dec. 17, 2015, after a daylong hearing, North Carolina District Judge Scott C. Etheridge ordered Rylan and Brittany returned to their mother. He cited a state law that calls for courts to seek family reunification whenever possible. The Moore County social services department backed the ruling, noting that Bryant had finished a class on parenting. The judge rebuffed pleas from the foster parents and from Pamela Reed, a court-appointed social worker who had urged him not to send the children back to their mother. Corey Ott displays a book of photographs of his son, Rylan Ott, who apparently drowned in a North Carolina pond while under the care of his mother, Samantha Bryant. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) The judge also rejected Ott\u2019s request for custody, ruling he hadn\u2019t spent enough time with the boy \u2014 mostly due to his long overseas deployment \u2014 to be a good father. \u201cI left that courthouse in tears,\u201d recalled Ott, who quit the Army the next day. When child protection workers arrived to take Rylan and Brittany to their mother, Shane and Amanda Mills also broke into tears, fearing for the children\u2019s safety, they said. \u201cWhen this thing goes south \u2014 not if, but when \u2014 you call me, day or night,\u201d Shane Mills said he told the social workers. \u201cI will be there to pick up these children.\u201d The Mills never got a call. They learned Rylan had drowned when Brittany posted a photo on Instagram last April of the smiling toddler in her lap. \u201cRIP. This little boy is my little brother and he was really a blessing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI love you Rylan Ott \u2026 but [you\u2019re] with God now.\u201d ",

    "text": "advertisement A Trump ally who made strikingly offensive remarks about the Obama family last week was on Thursday told to resign immediately from his position on a Buffalo, N.Y., school board. In a 6-2 vote, the Buffalo County School Board gave controversial businessman Carl Paladino 24 hours to resign his seat, or the decision would go to the Department of Education. Paladino was absent from the meeting. Related: Trump Ally Carl Paladino Slammed for 'Racist' Wish List for Obamas Paladino, an outspoken ally of President-elect Donald Trump, came under fire last week for his racist response to a local survey on New Year's wishes, telling the paper that he wished President Obama would die of mad cow disease and for the First Lady \"to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe.\" Carl Paladino, former New York gubernatorial candidate, speaks to reporters in the lobby at Trump Tower on Dec. 5, 2016 in New York City. Drew Angerer / Getty Images His remarks were greeted by swift outrage, with protesters around the country demanding his resignation. The board's decision Thursday was greeted by a loud and sustained standing ovation from the school board chambers. Paladino, who was chair of Trump's New York campaign before the election, also once sent an email to a female anti-Trump Utah GOP delegate saying she should be \" hung for treason \" and promised to \"be in your face\" at the convention. Related: Analysis: The Vengeful World of Donald Trump, and Why It Matters In a closing statement before the vote was held, district President Barbara Nevergold said Paladino had failed the students under his care \u2014 especially those who are minorities \u2014 by reducing their role models to \"depraved individuals.\" \"Words matter Mr. Paladino,\" Nevergold said. \"As a sitting board member you have amassed a record and established a pattern of behavior that is equally egregious and violates your oath of office and professional ethics as a board of education member.\" Nevergold went on to describe hundreds of \"incredulous\" complaints she and fellow board members said they'd received since Paladino's statements were made public. \"They would like me to tell you, 'You're fired,'\" she said to applause. \"But those are not my words. So I'm asking you to do the right thing and resign.\" Paladino apologized somewhat for his remarks in a statement Tuesday, telling the Buffalo News that he'd mistakenly sent the responses to the outlet \u2014 he meant to only share the outlandish racism with his friends \u2014 and didn't intend for them to hurt the \"minority community.\" But he also remained defiant, vowing not to leave the school board in the face of backlash from what he called, \"vanquished progressive haters.\" \"I don't intend to yield to the fanatics among my adversaries,\" he said. \"I certainly am not a racist.\" But for many members in both the board and the community, Paladino's apology wasn't enough.

U.S. President Barack Obama holds a year-end press conference at the\u00a0White House on Dec.\u00a016, 2016. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The United States struck back Thursday at Russia for hacking the U.S. presidential campaign with a sweeping set of punishments targeting Russia's spy agencies and diplomats. The U.S. said Russia must bear costs for its actions, but Moscow called the Obama administration \"losers\" and threatened retaliation. A month after an election the U.S. says Russia tried to sway for Donald Trump, President Barack Obama sanctioned the GRU and FSB, leading Russian intelligence agencies the U.S. said were involved. Those sanctions could easily be pulled back by Trump, who has insisted that Obama and Democrats are merely attempting to delegitimize his election. In an elaborately coordinated response by at least five federal agencies, the Obama administration also sought to expose Russia's cyber tactics with a detailed technical report and hinted it might still launch a covert counterattack. \"All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions,\" Obama said, adding, \"Such activities have consequences.\" President Barack Obama 's administration's move to name and sanction more Russians it accused of hacking Democratic campaign organizations had been previewed for days in leaks to reporters. But as they issued statements and appeared on news shows Thursday, Republicans offered a wide range of responses,... President Barack Obama 's administration's move to name and sanction more Russians it accused of hacking Democratic campaign organizations had been previewed for days in leaks to reporters. But as they issued statements and appeared on news shows Thursday, Republicans offered a wide range of responses,... (David Weigel) He said the response wasn't over and the U.S. could take further, covert action \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to a counterstrike in cyberspace the U.S. has been considering. Trump issued a statement saying it was \"time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\" Yet in the face of newly public evidence, he suggested he was keeping an open mind. \"In the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation,\" Trump said. As part of the punishment, the U.S. also kicked out 35 Russian diplomats who the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives, and shut down a pair of Russian compounds, in New York and Maryland. The U.S. said those actions were in response to Russia's harassment of U.S. diplomats, calling it part of a pattern of aggression that included the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. Read the story It was the strongest action the Obama administration has taken to date to retaliate for a cyberattack, and more comprehensive than last year's sanctions on North Korea after it hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment. The new penalties add to existing U.S. sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine, which have impaired Russia's economy but had limited impact on President Vladimir Putin's behavior. Russia, which denied the hacking allegations, called the penalties a clumsy yet aggressive attempt to \"harm Russian-American ties.\" Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would take into account the fact that Trump will soon replace Obama as it drafts retaliatory measures. The day marked a low point for U.S. relations with Russia, which have suffered during Obama's years as he and Putin tussled over Ukraine, Edward Snowden and Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad. Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, took to Facebook to call the Obama administration \"a group of foreign policy losers, angry and ignorant.\" It was unlikely the new sanctions, while symbolically significant, would have a major impact on Russian spy operations. The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets and block Americans from doing business with them. But Russian law bars the spy agencies from having assets in the U.S., and any activities they undertake would likely be covert and hard to identify. Barack Obama announced a number of retaliatory actions on Thursday, including the expulsion of nearly three dozen Russian citizens from the United States. \"Today the State Department declared 35 Russian government officials... In response to Russian hacking of American political organizations, President Barack Obama announced a number of retaliatory actions on Thursday, including the expulsion of nearly three dozen Russian citizens from the United States. \"Today the State Department declared 35 Russian government officials... (Philip Bump) \"On its face, this is more than a slap on the wrists, but hardly an appropriate response to an unprecedented attack on our electoral system,\" said Stewart Baker, a cybersecurity lawyer and former National Security Agency and Homeland Security Department official. Indeed, senior Obama administration officials said that even with the penalties, the U.S. had reason to believe Russia would keep hacking other nations' elections and might well try to hack American elections again in 2018 or 2020. The officials briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity. Though the FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a joint report on \"Russian malicious cyber activity\" \u2014 replete with examples of malware code used by the Russians \u2014 it still has not released a broader report Obama has promised detailing Russia's efforts to interfere with U.S. elections. The report has been eagerly anticipated by those hoping to make it politically untenable for Trump to continue questioning whether Russia was really involved. But U.S. officials said those seeking more detail about who the U.S. has determined did the hacking need look only to the list of sanctions targets, which includes the GRU head, his three deputies, and two Russian nationals wanted by the FBI for cybercrimes.

Charles Krupa/AP hide caption toggle caption Charles Krupa/AP Your obligatory shot of a clock \u2014 with this crucial reminder: The ineluctable march of time will dally just a little bit when it bids farewell to 2016. Charles Krupa/AP Here's a timely reminder for all you would-be revelers out there: Be careful with your countdowns this New Year's Eve. There will be a little extra time to bask in the glow of a retreating 2016 \u2014 or curse its name, as the case may be. Whatever your inclination may be, one thing is certain: Before the year is out, the world's foremost authority on time will be adding one more second to the clock. In a bulletin released this summer, the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, or IERS, said it would be necessary to introduce a \"leap second\" at the end of December. Timekeepers use this added second much as leap years are used \u2014 to bring the world's atomic clocks in sync with the Earth's own distinctive rhythm, which in this case is determined by its rotation. This leap second isn't the first. Since 1971, the world has added leap seconds with some regularity \u2014 typically every two to three years \u2014 and the latest leap second was added only last year , in June. Article continues after sponsorship Why do these leap seconds keep cropping up? Peter Whibberley, a research scientist with the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory, explains it this way : \"Atomic clocks are more than a million times better at keeping time than the rotation of the Earth, which fluctuates unpredictably. Leap seconds are needed to prevent civil time drifting away from Earth time. Although the drift is small \u2014 taking around a thousand years to accumulate a one-hour difference \u2014 if not corrected, it would eventually result in clocks showing midday before sunrise.\" 11:59:60 \u2014 Look For An Extra Tick Of The Clock Tonight Recent research appears to back up Whibberley's assessment. According to a study published earlier this month in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A , Earth's rotation has slowed about 1.8 milliseconds per day \u2014 which means the solar day itself has lengthened, little by little. The researchers based this assessment on records dating back to 760 B.C., long before the implementation of the precise atomic clocks. The Los Angeles Times broke down the findings: \"If humanity had been measuring time with an atomic clock that started running back in 700 BC, today that clock would read 7 p.m. when the sun is directly overhead rather than noon.\" Still, however useful they may seem, these little extras can occasionally cause some big frustrations, as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel notes : \"Leap seconds have crashed airline reservation systems. They're believed to have briefly shut down Russia's GPS satellite system, and there's potential for even greater mischief as things like financial trading become ever more precise in their use of time.\" To Keep Up With Earth's Rotation, Clocks Will Tick An Extra Second Tonight To Keep Up With Earth's Rotation, Clocks Will Tick An Extra Second Tonight ",

    "text": "Last Updated Dec 28, 2016 8:02 PM EST President-elect Donald Trump announced two companies are adding thousands of additional U.S.-based jobs Wednesday evening. Speaking briefly with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump said that phone carrier Sprint will bring 5,000 jobs back from overseas. \u201cThey have taken them from other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are bringing them back to the United States.\u201d Sprint confirmed the announcement on its website, saying the jobs would be added by the end of fiscal 2017 and it would \u201c begin discussions immediately with its business partners, states and cities to determine the right locations in the U.S. to create these jobs.\u201d Details on what types of jobs would be added were not immediately available. Trump's team \u201cWe are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his Administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,\u201d said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure in the press release. Mr. Trump said that another company, OneWeb, will hire 3,000 people in the U.S., which he called \u201cvery exciting.\u201d OneWeb is a satellite network aimed at providing affordable internet access. Mr. Trump said the deal \u201cwas done through\u201d SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a Japanese billionaire. The pair met in New York earlier this month, and announced together that SoftBank -- which is Sprint\u2019s largest shareholder and has invested in OneWeb -- would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and planned to create 50,000 jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether the 8,000 jobs announced Wednesday are included in that 50,000 figure. The 5,000 jobs at Sprint are part of that commitment but will be funded by the carrier, not Son, Bloomberg reported. OneWeb founder and executive chairman Greg Wyler said that a recent infusion of cash from Son allowed the company to accelerate its production process, resulting in 3,000 jobs added across its supply chain. OneWeb\u2019s own staff would rise from 200 to about 1,000, he said. Wyler credited Mr. Trump with persuading Son to increase SoftBank\u2019s investment in OneWeb, thereby speeding up the production process. He added that he was optimistic about an improved business climate in the U.S. under the new administration, including lower corporate tax rates and a simpler tax code. Donald Trump's $14 billion Cabinet The Wednesday announcement follows one Mr. Trump made when the air conditioning manufacturer Carrier announced in late November that it had reached a deal to keep approximately 1,100 jobs in the U.S. Mr. Trump focused much of his campaign trail rhetoric on bringing back jobs from overseas. Mr. Trump also said he spoke with President Obama on Wednesday, after a series of tweets going after the current president . \u201cHe called me, we had a very nice conversation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Asked whether he wanted the United States to leave the United Nations, Mr. Trump did not give a direct answer, instead just saying the organization has \u201ctremendous potential\u201d that it\u2019s not living up to. \u201cIf it lives up to its potential it\u2019s a great thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d CBS News\u2019 Irina Ivanova contributed to this story. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "CBS News December 29, 2016, 2:39 PM U.S. imposes sanctions on Russia over election interference Email Last Updated Dec 29, 2016 7:23 PM EST The Obama administration announced Thursday a new series of sanctions against Russian intelligence entities and agents they say are responsible for hacks into the Democratic National Committee and related servers. In addition to the sanctions, 35 Russian operatives will be expelled from the country and listed as \u201cpersona non grata.\u201d The operatives, who are based out of the Russian embassy in Washington and the Russian consulate in San Francisco, have been informed they have 72 hours to leave the United States along with their families. A senior administration official said Thursday afternoon that the U.S. is \u201cresponding here to a pattern of Russian behavior that has been evident for some time.\u201d The official also said that the announced punishments are \u201cnot the sum total of everything we are doing in response to Russia\u2019s actions \u2026 as President Obama and others have said, some of those actions will be public and some of them will not.\u201d U.S. officials do not often release the details of their investigations -- but they did Thursday. The release was part of an ongoing effort to pu... President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for better relations with Moscow, has been largely dismissive of claims that Russian intelligence was responsible for the hacks. However, in a statement released shorty after the announcement of sanctions, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called the administration\u2019s response an \u201coverdue\u201d yet \u201cappropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia.\u201d \u201cRussia does not share America\u2019s interests,\u201d Ryan\u2019s statement says. \u201cIn fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world.\u201d For his part, Mr. Trump said he wanted the nation to \u201cmove on\u201d from the election but that he would still meet with intelligence officials to discuss the matter.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Thursday evening. \u201cNevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\u201d A senior administration official tells CBS News that the Obama administration will place sanctions on individuals associated with Moscow's effort... A joint statement from Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain echoed Ryan\u2019s point that the measures were \u201coverdue\u201d yet \u201ca small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy.\u201d The pair also said that they \u201cintend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.\u201d According to White House spokesman Eric Schultz, Mr. Trump\u2019s team was notified about the sanctions earlier on Thursday.\u00a0 Specific sanctions are being applied to the leadership of GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency. A total of nine Russian entities and persons have been targeted by the sanctions.\u00a0 \u201cSanctioned individuals include\u00a0Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the current Chief of the GRU; Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, Deputy Chief of the GRU; Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, a First Deputy Chief of the GRU; and Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev, also a First Deputy Chief of the GRU,\u201d said a statement from the White House released Thursday afternoon. The Obama administration has imposed new sanctions against Russia in retaliation for a series of cyberattacks during the presidential campaign. C... The FSB, Russia\u2019s other major foreign intelligence agency, is also the recipient of sanctions. According to a White House fact sheet, the FSB assisted the GRU in \u201ctampering, altering, or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with the 2016 U.S. election processes.\u201d The president amended a previous executive order allowing him to respond to cyberattacks in order to apply these sanctions.\u00a0 The U.S. government will also shut down two Russian government-owned compounds \u2013one in Maryland, and the other in New York. According to the fact sheet, the shut downs and expulsions are in response to \u201charassment of our diplomatic personnel in Russia\u201d that have gone \u201cfar beyond international diplomatic norms of behavior.\u201d Meanwhile, two private individuals have been designated by the U.S. government for hacking American companies for financial gain. A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the country would consider retaliating to the sanctions, according to the Associated Press. Russia\u2019s embassy in London responded to the sanctions announcement by tweeting a picture of a \u201clame duck\u201d and referred to the Obama administration as \u201chapless\u201d:\u00a0 President Obama expels 35 \uf1f7\uf1fa diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl \uf1fa\uf1f8 people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D \u2014 Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 29, 2016 After the sanctions were announced, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a report \u201cproviding details of the tools and infrastructure used by Russian intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and infrastructure associated with the recent U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. government, political and private sector entities.\u201d \u201cThis activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. Government and its citizens,\u201d said a statement from the FBI and DHS. \u201cThese cyber operations have included spearphishing, campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; theft of information from these organizations; and the recent public release of some of this stolen information\u201d The CIA has also been ordered to release its own report.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images Officials escort Adnan Syed from the courthouse in Baltimore on Feb. 3 after the first day of hearings for a retrial. A judge granted the new trial, but on Thursday he denied Syed's motion to be released while he waits for the retrial. Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images A circuit court judge in Baltimore has denied bail to Adnan Syed, the man whose conviction for a 1999 murder was the subject of the podcast Serial. Syed will remain in jail while he awaits a new trial. Syed was convicted in 2000 in the killing of his high school girlfriend Hae Min Lee, and sentenced to life in prison. A judge vacated that conviction last June. In an opinion released Thursday, Circuit Judge Martin Welch denied Syed's motion for bail, citing the seriousness of the crime and the potential for Syed to flee, though he said Syed posed no danger to the community. The judge suggested that despite new evidence, the potential for Syed to be convicted and sentenced to life in prison once again was cause to reject the motion: \"The circuit court finds that the nature and circumstances of the offenses are the most serious of nature and there is still compelling evidence against [Syed]. The circuit court also find that the nature of the evidence against [Syed] creates a greater risk of flight. The circuit court further finds that upon conviction, [Syed] still faces the potential sentence of life imprisonment plus thirty years.\" Article continues after sponsorship In the motion to release filed in October, Syed's attorney had argued that his client has been a model prisoner and poses no threat: \"Syed has now served more than 17 years in prison based on an unconstitutional conviction for a crime he did not commit. He has no history of violence other than the State's allegations in this case, and if released he would pose no danger to the community. He is also not a flight risk; it makes no sense that he would run from the case he has spent more than half his life trying to disprove.\" ",

Robert Hulseman died at his Illinois home of health\u00a0complications following a series of strokes, the Associated Press reported. He served as president and chief executive of the family-run Solo Cup Co., but his invention of the plastic cup \u2014 particularly the\u00a0red ones \u2014\u00a0is what stands out to many.

He helped turn it into \"one of the largest foodservice packaging companies in the world,\" the obituary said. Aside from the Solo Cup, he also developed the coffee-topping Traveller Lid.

By Andrew Roth and David Filipov December 29 at 6:08 PM Follow arothwp Follow @davidfilipov MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin on Friday issued a stark warning to the United States, saying it would respond in kind to the U.S. expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and other sanctions following the Russian hacking of U.S. political parties before the 2016 presidential elections. \u201cI cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,\u201d said Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov in a statement late Thursday reported by the Interfax news service. He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would decide the exact response. [ Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election interference ] Peskov\u2019s remarks were the culmination of a sharply worded reaction by Russia\u2019s establishment to the sanctions, which come at a time when Moscow is looking forward to an improvement in its ties with the United States at the start of the Trump administration in three weeks. (The Washington Post) Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, whose comments about the Obama administration have grown increasingly hostile as the relationship has soured, dismissed the White House as \u201ca group of foreign policy losers, angry and ignorant.\u201d Zakharova\u2019s colleague in the foreign ministry, Konstantin Dolgov, who holds the title of commissioner on democracy and human rights, called the U.S. sanctions \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and cast them as having \u201cthe goal of damaging relations and complicating their restoration in the future.\u201d Whatever retaliation Moscow is considering will have to take into account the possibility that the Trump administration will want to restore the relationship that has foundered on differences over Syria, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin\u2019s proxy war in Ukraine and the alleged hacking on behalf of now-President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential campaign. [ The luxurious, 45-acre compound in Maryland is being shut down for alleged Russian espionage ] Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the steps showed President Obama\u2019s \u201cunpredictable and aggressive foreign policy.\u201d \u201cSuch steps of the U.S. administration that has three weeks left to work are aimed at two things: to further harm Russian-American ties, which are at a low point as it is, as well as, obviously, deal a blow on the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the president-elect.\u201d Konstantin Kosachyov, a senior member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, suggested that Moscow will have to weigh its response given the possible reaction of the newly elected president. The sanctions, he said in comments carried by Interfax, represented not the will of the United States as a whole but \u201cthe agony of political corpses of the outgoing administration.\u201d Putin holds a meeting with permanent members of Russia's Security Council at the Kremlin in Moscow on Dec. 28. (Michael Klimentyev/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) That said, the history of diplomatic expulsions suggest that, at the least, Russia will throw out a similar number of U.S. Embassy personnel. Zakharova and others have long warned of an\u00a0\u201casymmetrical\u201d response to sanctions over the hacking allegations, so other expulsions are possible. Putin repeatedly denied Russian involvement in the U.S. election despite the accusations from the White House, and the Kremlin has questioned the evidence for the claims. In his nationally broadcast marathon news conference last week, Putin borrowed some of Trump\u2019s dismissive rhetoric, remarking about the hacking that, \u201cMaybe it was someone lying on the couch who did it.\u201d\u00a0 The Democratic Party, Putin said, is \u201closing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame. In my view, this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You have to know how to lose with dignity .\u201d U.S. analysts say Putin\u2019s animus against Hillary Clinton are a likely explanation for the Kremlin\u2019s desire to harm her campaign for the presidency, but contempt for Obama\u2019s White House has also grown in recent months, after the administration shut down all contacts with the Kremlin. Putin in October issued a striking manifesto of changes he expected the United States to make, including reimbursement for Ukraine sanctions, as a precondition for restoring relations. More recently, Russia has pursued peace negotiations in Syria, culminating in a cease-fire deal Putin announced Thursday that pointedly excluded the Obama administration. But the sanctions did not dampen expectations in Moscow that better times were soon to come. \u201cNone of this will change the results of the election of the American president, and in January, the rightful owner of the White House will be Donald Trump,\u201d said Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament. \u201cI expect that with his arrival, the dialogue between Russia and the United States will be conducted in a more healthy political atmosphere.\u201d Read more: ",

Marc Buslik, Chicago Police Department 19th District Commander, discusses the deparment's body camera policies and demonstrates its use at the district headquarters on Dec. 28, 2016. (Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) William Lee Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The head of the union representing thousands of Chicago's rank-and-file police officers on Thursday said he was caught off guard this week by the announcement that every patrol officer in the city will be equipped with body cameras by the end of 2017 \u2014 a year ahead of schedule. Dean Angelo Sr., president of the Fraternal Order of Police's Lodge 7, said his office had only a single meeting with police brass in the past year to discuss implementation of the recording devices, despite a prior written agreement stating both sides would meet to discuss how the body cameras would be rolled out. On Wednesday, police officials, along with Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's office, announced a plan to equip several thousand patrol officers with body cameras in every police district by  late 2017, something that could offer a closer look at interactions between cops and citizens. The AXON 2  body cams were not slated to reach all 22 police districts until late 2018. \"I was made aware of it through an email that one of my (FOP) board members sent me. I didn't get a call (from the department), didn't get a heads-up,\" Angelo said.

(Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) Angelo said FOP members did not oppose using body cameras \u2014 devices that police departments across the country are starting to use. But he said officers wanted to make sure they had time to get acclimated to the new recording devices without the threat of discipline from the department for any rude or inappropriate private conversations by officers caught on a hot mic. \"We wanted to be part of this (planning) process so that nonduty-related conversations between you and I about someone walking down the street, or what was said at roll call, or about who our boss and what their experience \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 may be (isn't) ... something that we wind up getting considered for discipline on,\" Angelo said. \"Those are conversations between you and I, and it's our opinion,\" he said.

    "text": "By Adam Taylor December 29 at 5:28 PM Follow @mradamtaylor A Russian-owned compound in Maryland is being shut down after the Obama administration says it was being used for intelligence-related purposes. (TWP) On Thursday afternoon, the Obama administration announced its long-awaited retaliation for what has been characterized as Russian interference in November's presidential election. Among the wide-ranging measures, the White House announced that the\u00a0State Department would be closing two Russian-owned compounds \u2014 one in Maryland and one in New York\u00a0\u2014 that it says were used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes. It is also declaring 35 Russians \u201cpersona non grata\u201d for their alleged role in intelligence operations. How hidden were these alleged spy compounds?\u00a0At least in the case of Maryland, the answer is simple: not very. [ U.S. takes action against Russia for election hacking ] The compound in Maryland sits on around 45 acres of land at Pioneer Point, a peninsula where the Corsica and Chester rivers merge\u00a0\u2014 around a 90-minute drive from downtown Washington, by the Eastern Shore town of Centreville in Queen Anne's County. The site was purchased by the Soviet government in 1972, and became something of a resort for Soviets living in the United States. It is the former estate of\u00a0John J. Raskob,\u00a0a former executive for DuPont and General Motors perhaps best known as the builder of the Empire State Building. The Soviets later added to the estate\u00a0by making a deal with the State Department, which received two properties in Moscow in return. At the time of its purchase,\u00a0there was some resistance to the sale of the building to the Soviets, with the local newspaper reporting there were \u201cfears of nuclear submarines surfacing in the Chester River to pick up American secrets and defectors.\u201d [ Why do so many people miss the Soviet Union? ] 1969 photo of the Pioneer Point property near Centreville. (Baltimore Sun) But by 1974, the New York Times reported that many locals had been won over, with the help of dinner parties and gifts of vodka and caviar. \u201cAs far as neighbors are concerned you couldn't ask for better,\u201d Joe Handley, a former estate manager for Raskob, told The Washington Post in 1979. \u201cThey don't bother anybody.\u201d A reporter from the local Star Democrat newspaper in Easton visited the site in 1987\u00a0\u2014 in large part because of\u00a0the long-standing rumors that it was being used for espionage. The resulting article, also\u00a0 published in The Post , noted the tall chain-link fence outside the compound and the video cameras monitoring the gate, but also the lime-green bungalows, swimming pools and numerous tennis courts. \u201cTomorrow we have a game,\u201d one tennis player identified as Yevgeny told the reporter. \u201cWe have a tournament with the International Monetary Fund. They have a beautiful team. But this year, God knows who will win.\u201d After the turmoil of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Pioneer Point was bought by the Russian Federation\u00a0\u2014 at the time, the Associated Press reported its value was $3 million. Local residents told the AP that they didn't have any problems with the Russians who visited the compound. ''I live down the road from them. We fish and crab with them. There's usually one that speaks English for the group,'' a woman named as Bonnie Delph told the AP . The compound has been in the news very little since then. Nine years ago, the Russian ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov, invited a reporter from Washington Life magazine to tour the grounds, explaining that for him it was like the\u00a0traditional Russian summer house, or dacha, he was used to back home.\u00a0\u201cBecause we have such a hectic life in Washington, we need a place to hide for a while,\u201d\u00a0his wife, Svetlana, was quoted as saying. A man who answered the phone for a number listed online for the Pioneer Point compound said it was a wrong number, before adding that he did not speak English. On Thursday, U.S. officials would not confirm the location of the New York compound being shut down \u2014 saying only that it was a 14-acre property on Long Island that had been purchased by the Soviet government in 1954. However, a number of Russia-watching bloggers pointed towards the Killenworth estate on Dosoris Lane in Glen Cove, which acts as the country home for Moscow's delegation to the United Nations. The grand country house was once owned by\u00a0American philanthropist\u00a0George Dupont Pratt. The announcement culminates months of vigorous internal debate over whether and how to respond to Russia's unprecedented election-year provocations, ranging from the hacks of the Democratic National Committee to the targeting of state electoral systems.

Five officers, including Ahrens, were killed in a shooting incident in Dallas on July 7, 2016. Reuters/Carlo Allegri Email The number of police killed in the line of duty rose sharply in 2016, driven by shootings of police around the country , most notably ambushes in Dallas and Baton Rouge , Louisiana. From Jan. 1 through Wednesday, 135 officers lost their lives. Some died in traffic accidents, but nearly half were shot to death. That\u2019s a 56 percent increase in shooting deaths over the previous year. Of the 64 who were fatally shot, 21 were killed in ambush attacks often fueled by anger over police use of force involving minorities. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a year in my memory when we\u2019ve had an increase of this magnitude in officer shooting deaths,\u201d said Craig Floyd, president and chief executive of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. \u201cThese officers were killed simply because of the uniform they wear and the job they do. This is unacceptable to the humane society that we are.\u201d President Obama made a plea for unity during Tuesday's memorial service for five Dallas officers killed in a police ambush. He was joined on stag... In Dallas, a sniper on July 7 attacked at the end of what had been a peaceful rally against police brutality. He killed five law enforcement officers and wounded nine others - the largest death toll among law enforcement from a single event since the 9/11 attacks, which killed 72 officers. Months later, Dallas businesses and residents still display blue ribbons and banners declaring, \u201cWe support our Dallas police officers.\u201d But even amid community support, the police department remains unsettled . Hundreds of officers have retired or left the force over the past six months as the city struggles to find a way to increase pay and save a failing police and fire pension. Former Chief David Brown, who became a national figure in the aftermath, was among those who opted to retire. And interim Dallas Police Association president Frederick Frazier said that morale is \u201calmost nonexistent.\u201d \u201cA lot of us are going through the motions at work. We\u2019re hoping things will get better with our struggle,\u201d he said. Frazier added that the attack was a \u201cgame changer. It changed the perception of law enforcement. It reversed the roll after Ferguson. We were the pursuer and now, we\u2019re being pursued.\u201d Less than two weeks after the Dallas attack, a lone gunman in Baton Rouge shot and killed three officers and wounded three others outside a convenience store in the weeks after a black man, 37-year-old Alton Sterling, was shot and killed by police during a struggle. Baton Rouge Police Cpl. Lester Mitchell was partners with Matthew Gerald, one of the three slain officers, and was among the officers who raced to the scene of the shooting that also killed sheriff\u2019s deputy Brad Garafola and officer Montrell Jackson. Mitchell has daily reminders of the deadly shootout, driving past the scene on his way to police headquarters. \u201cJust passing there, you can\u2019t help but replay it over and over again,\u201d he said. Mitchell said the shooting has made him more alert and aware of potential dangers on patrol, sometimes in situations that wouldn\u2019t have alarmed him before, like a hand in a pocket. \u201cYou learn to cope with it, because if you don\u2019t, you can drive yourself crazy,\u201d he said. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund\u2019s Floyd said the impact of this year has been profound on law enforcement. Agencies are struggling to recruit officers to their ranks and those who continue to serve \u201ctalk about how their head is now on a swivel.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re always looking over their shoulder, always worrying about the next attack that could come at any time from any direction,\u201d Floyd said. That was underscored by the slaying in November of a San Antonio detective who was fatally shot and killed outside police headquarters as he was writing a traffic ticket. The man accused of shooting him said he was angry about a child-custody battle and simply \u201clashed out at somebody who didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Clouds fill the sky over Los Angeles as seen from the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) Nicole Santa Cruz Contact Reporter Los Angeles County could see between a quarter-inch and half-inch of rain Friday\u00a0as the first of two anticipated\u00a0storm systems passes through the region\u00a0this weekend, according to the National Weather Service. The rainfall will add to what is already the wettest month recorded in downtown Los Angeles since December 2010, said David Sweet, a weather service meteorologist. So far this month, the area has seen 4 inches of rain, nearly double the historical average for December.\u00a0 On Friday, there\u2019s an 80% chance of rain forecast at 4 a.m., with a possibility of showers returning Friday night, Sweet said. On Saturday afternoon, a second storm system coming from the northwest is expected to pass through, bringing a 40% chance of showers into the evening. Temperatures will fall to about 65 degrees on Friday and 50 to 60 degrees on Saturday, Sweet said. Snow levels could drop to about 4,000 feet in the foothills of the Antelope Valley, according to forecasts. The weather service also warned of possible wintry driving conditions Saturday along the Grapevine area of the 5 Freeway and the Cajon Pass area of the 15 Freeway. Last week, some areas of Los Angeles saw as much as 2 inches of rain, according to the weather service. The storms contributed to nightmarish conditions at Los Angeles International Airport , where bad weather, crowded airspace, security scares and construction caused some flights to be delayed or\u00a0rerouted. The rain also caused the usual road congestion and accidents. In an area that has been hit hard by five years of severe drought, the wet winter has been a welcome development. Steady, moderate rain over weeks and months this year is what has pulled 15% of the state \u2014 all of it up north \u2014 out of drought conditions, according to the weather service and the U.S. Drought Report. The rains have helped recharge reservoirs that feed the two massive systems that move water from the northern Sierra to the state\u2019s cities and farmlands.\u00a0 L.A.\u2019s rain isn\u2019t expected to stay for long though. New Year\u2019s Day is forecast\u00a0to be mostly sunny.

One of the children was hospitalized in stable condition and the other was flown to a children\u2019s hospital in suburban Denver for treatment. Investigators have not released any names and have not said what caused the family to fall. Police spokeswoman Schelly Olson said state regulators who oversee chairlifts are helping with the investigation.\u00a0 In a statement, the resort said it happened at approximately 9:30 a.m.,\u00a0 CBS Denver reports. Rod Kessler, their operations directior, said that two young people and an adult \u201ccame out of their chair\u201d on the Quickdraw Quad lift. The ski area about 90 miles west of Denver promotes itself as a family-friendly resort without the hassles of larger, more famous ski resorts.\u00a0 Deaths from malfunctions or falls are rare in the United States, The Denver Post reported (https://goo.gl/7eSuhj ). According to the National Ski Areas Association, deaths from malfunctions have totaled just 12 from 1973 through October, and there were three deaths from falls between 2004 and October. According to an October report by the NSAA, the last death on a chairlift attributed to a malfunction was in 1993. As of the 2015-2016 ski season, the annual fatality rate per 100 million miles traveled on ski lifts was 0.14. The latest death comes during one of the busiest weeks of the season for ski resorts in Colorado.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Toru Hanai/AP hide caption toggle caption Toru Hanai/AP U.S. intelligence agencies maintain that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally authorized the hacking of Democratic officials'\u0099 email accounts during the runup to the presidential election. Toru Hanai/AP Updated at 6:15 p.m. The White House has announced new actions targeting Russia in response to cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U.S. election. In a statement Thursday , President Obama said, \"All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions,\" referring to hacks of the Democratic National Committee. Obama also cited an \"unacceptable level of harassment\" of American diplomats by Russian security services and police in Moscow. The immediate impact of the president's executive order is that 35 Russian diplomats will be expelled from the U.S. and two Russian compounds will be closed. The statement also names Russian individuals and entities \u2014 including two intelligence services \u2014 to be targeted by new sanctions. \"We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized,\" the statement goes on to say. Later on Thursday, a separate joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FBI reiterated the claim that the Russian government was behind the cyber attacks: \"This activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. Government and its citizens. These cyber operations have included spearphishing, campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations; theft of information from these organizations; and the recent public release of some of this stolen information. In other countries, Russian intelligence services have also undertaken damaging and disruptive cyber-attacks, including on critical infrastructure, in some cases masquerading as third parties or hiding behind false online personas designed to cause victim to misattribute the source of the attack.\" Article continues after sponsorship President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on assertions that Russia was responsible for hacks and leaks during the election. But shortly after 6:00 pm on Thursday, his transition team released the following statement, attributed to Trump: \"It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\" Congressional leaders from both parties have released statements supporting the new sanctions, while taking thinly-veiled shots at political opponents. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan sent out a short release to reporters this afternoon: \"Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.\" Democratic Senator Charles Schumer , who is expected to lead his caucus in the Senate come January, welcomed the administration's actions. \"I strongly support the steps the administration is taking to fight back against Russia's interference in our election. We need to punch back against Russia, and punch back hard. \"I hope the incoming Trump administration, which has been far too close to Russia throughout the campaign and transition, won't think for one second about weakening these new sanctions or our existing regime. Both parties ought to be united in standing up to Russian interference in our elections, to their cyberattacks, their illegal annexation of Crimea and other extra-legal interventions.\" The Democratic National Committee, which was targeted by the alleged attacks, also weighed in, urging further action. \"We applaud President Obama for taking these actions in response to the Russian government-sponsored cyberattacks on the DNC, the Clinton campaign, and our free and fair elections. However, more must be done. \"It has been widely reported that U.S. intelligence officials have a 'high level of confidence' that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in these attacks, even providing direction on how the stolen material was leaked. These intrusions were not just 'hacks.' They were attacks on the United States by a foreign power and should be treated as such. Therefore, today's action alone by the White House is insufficient. Now it's time for President-elect Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress to put our national security before politics and show the American people that they are serious about protecting our democracy. That's why I have called on Congress to launch a thorough, independent, and bipartisan investigation on the Russian government's unprecedented interference in the 2016 election.\" Meanwhile, the AP Reports that Russia is already considering retaliatory measures to the sanctions. And a tweet from Russia's embassy in the U.K. mocked President Obama, tweeting a picture of a lame duck. Russia has denied the allegations. President Obama expels 35 \uf1f7\uf1fa diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl \uf1fa\uf1f8 people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D ",

The competency hearing will take place Monday, and Gergel will make the ruling from the bench.

He went on to play parts of four seasons in the NFL, winning the NFC Rookie of the Year award with the Chicago Bears in 1995. But his promising career was cut short, in part because of injuries.

He was also open about his excessive marijuana use during his early days in the NFL. \" 'When I got hurt, I knew (marijuana) was a problem because it pretty much consumed all my time,' Salaam told ESPN in 1999. 'I wasn't going to practice or anything like that, so I pretty much spent a lot of my time sitting around and getting high, and that's when I knew I had to let it go. I wasn't outgoing.

In a two-sentence response almost four hours after the administration's announcement, President-elect Donald Trump said it was \"time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\" He added he would meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week to be updated on the situation. Using an executive order, President Obama sanctioned the GRU and the FSB -- two of Russia's intelligence services as well as other entities and individuals associated with the GRU.\u00a0The cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate the hack of its emails earlier this year concluded the hacking came from the Fancy Bear group, believed to be affiliated with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency. In addition to the sanctions, the State Department has declared 35 Russian intelligence operatives \"persona non grata\" in the U.S., giving them 72 hours to leave, and is shutting down two Russian compounds in Maryland and New York. The Maryland property is a 45-acre property at Pioneer Point, and was purchased by the Soviet government in 1972.\u00a0 The New York property is on Long Island and is 14 acres and was purchased by the Soviet government in 1954.

The Russian Embassy in the UK took a different approach, tweeting out a picture of a lame duck and blasting what it called \"Cold War deja vu.\" The Treasury Secretary meanwhile has named two individuals -- Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev and Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan -- it says were involved in \"malicious cyber-enabled activities.\"\u00a0 \"These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior,\" Obama said in a statement. Obama also announced that the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI will release declassified information on Russian cyberactivity to help \"identify, detect and Russia's global campaign of malicious cyber activities.\" Obama also said that the administration will be providing a report to Congress \"in the coming days\" about Russian attempts to interfere in the election, as well as previous election cycles. The president also hinted that his administration intends to do more to hold Russia accountable. \"These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities,\" Obama said. \"We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized.\"\u00a0 U.S. intelligence services have concluded that the Russians interfered in the election to try and help President-elect Donald Trump win. Trump has dismissed the conclusions. However, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. welcomed the move in a statement. \"Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-TX., called Obama's actions \"long overdue,\" while House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes said he's been \"urging\" Obama for years to take action and that this \"indecision and delay\" explains why \"American's influence has collapsed.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

By John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian December 29 at 7:52 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @karoun President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday played down the ramifications\u00a0of any Russian interference\u00a0in the U.S. election, saying it is \u201ctime for the country to move on to bigger and better things\u201d in a statement issued just hours after President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against Moscow. Trump, who has for weeks voiced skepticism about Russia\u2019s role in the hacking of Democratic email accounts and other hostile actions, said he would seek to learn more about the situation next week. \u201cNevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation,\u201d the president-elect said in his statement. The announcement culminates months of vigorous internal debate over whether and how to respond to Russia's unprecedented election-year provocations, ranging from the hacks of the Democratic National Committee to the targeting of state electoral systems. (The Washington Post) [ Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election interference ] Trump\u2019s posture put him at odds with Republican congressional leaders, who have condemned Russia for its actions, with some suggesting tougher measures\u00a0than what Obama detailed\u00a0Thursday afternoon. The president\u2019s retaliation included the removal of 35 Russian government officials and sanctions against state agencies and individuals tied to the hacks. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) greeted the sanctions as an \u201coverdue\u201d gesture, while still jeering at the Obama administration over the timing, noting that the imposition of punitive measures was \u201can appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the sanctions \u201ca good initial step, however late in coming.\u201d He also hinted an interest in imposing more punitive measures against Russia if Congress\u2019s investigation into allegations of election-related hacking yields further evidence, \u201cto ensure that any attack against the United States is met with an overwhelming response,\u201d he said. The Post's Karen DeYoung looks at the implications of the latest measures taken by the Obama administration against Russia and its interference in the U.S. election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Several leading senators have already pledged to conduct such investigations in their committees next year, and some of them have already expressed an interest in slamming the Kremlin with stiffer restrictions. \u201cWe intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia,\u201d Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) wrote in a joint statement Thursday. Both chair panels that intend to probe the matter of Russian hacking next year. But no Republicans have expressed full confidence in the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the hacking that inspired Obama\u2019s sanctions was done as part of a Kremlin plot to aid Trump\u2019s chances of winning. The FBI and CIA have concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Trump win the White House in his race against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The hacks targeted the Democratic National Committee and the account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. Trump has suggested in recent weeks that the source of the hacks could be a range of other actors, including someone \u201c sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds \u201d or \u201csome guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d Speaking to reporters Wednesday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump sought to distance himself from Obama\u2019s expected punishment of Russia, saying, \u201c I think we ought to get on with our lives .\u201d [ Trump on alleged election interference by Russia: \u2018Get on with our lives\u2019 ] During a conference call with reporters Thursday morning, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Trump's views could change if more solid evidence emerges that Russia was responsible. \u201cIf the United States has clear proof of anyone interfering with our elections, we should make that known,\u201d Spicer said, adding: \u201cRight now we need to see further facts.\u201d But Spicer said there is another aspect to the talk about Russia influencing the presidential election. \u201cI think you have a lot of folks on the left who continue to undermine the legitimacy of his win and the nature of how big that win was,\u201d Spicer said. He called that behavior \u201cunfortunate.\u201d Later Thursday, in an interview with CNN, Spicer suggested that the DNC was partly to blame for being hacked. \"At some point, the question hasn't even been asked of the [Democratic National Committee]: Did you take basic measures to protect the data that was on there?\" said Spicer, who spoke shortly before the Obama administration announced its actions. \"Where's the responsibility of them to protect their systems?\" politics ",

Krenwinkel helped kill pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six other people at the urging of Manson 47 years ago. Former Manson family member and convicted murderer Patricia Krenwinkel listens to the ruling denying her parole, at a hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif., Thursday, Jan. 20, 2011. Reed Saxon, AP The hearing was held at the California Institution for Women, about 40 miles east of Los Angeles, where Krenwinkel is imprisoned. Gov. Jerry Brown has the power to block the release of inmates if parole is granted. He previously stopped the parole of two other Manson followers. Krenwinkel acknowledged during her trial that she chased down and repeatedly stabbed Abigail Ann Folger, the 26-year-old heiress of a coffee fortune, at Tate\u2019s home and helped kill grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, the following night. Los Angeles County prosecutors say Krenwinkel carved the word \u201cwar\u201d into Leno LaBianca\u2019s stomach, then wrote \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d in blood on the couple\u2019s refrigerator. Krenwinkel\u2019s attorney, Keith Wattley, successfully petitioned the state to hold the hearing a year early at the California Institution for Women, about 40 miles east of Los Angeles, where Krenwinkel is imprisoned. \u201cMs. Krenwinkel is fully aware of the difficulty she faces,\u201d Wattley told The Associated Press in an email. \u201cBut California law officially recognizes a person\u2019s capacity to change and to address the factors that contributed to their previous behavior so that they can safely be paroled.\u201d Krenwinkel contended at her previous parole hearing in 2011 that she is a changed woman. She has a clean disciplinary record, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree behind bars, taught illiterate inmates to read and trained service dogs for disabled people. Sharon Tate\u2019s sister, Debra Tate, said before Thursday\u2019s hearing that killers such as Krenwinkel cannot be rehabilitated. \u201cShe was a very prolific killer,\u201d Debra Tate said recently. \u201cThey may behave well in a controlled environment, but we cannot trust that, given the pressures of life, that they will be able to remain straight\u201d outside prison. Krenwinkel was a 19-year-old secretary when she met Manson at a party. She testified at her previous parole hearing that she left everything behind three days later to pursue what she believed was a budding romance with him. She wept and apologized, saying she became a \u201cmonster\u201d after she met Manson. \u201cI committed myself fully to him. I committed myself to the act of murder,\u201d she said then. \u201cI was willing to sacrifice others\u2019 lives for my own.\u201d ",

    "text": "Dec 29 2016, 1:21 pm ET Nation's First Known Intersex Birth Certificate Issued in NYC by Mary Emily O'Hara advertisement On Tuesday, 55-year-old Sara Kelly Keenan received something in the mail she's been waiting for her entire life: an accurate birth certificate. Keenan was born intersex, with male genes, female genitalia and mixed internal reproductive organs. Now, Keenan, who uses female pronouns, is making history. Hers is believed to be the first birth certificate ever issued in the United States that reads \"intersex\" in the gender field, instead of \"male\" or \"female.\" Sara Kelly Keenan Courtesy of Sara Kelly Keenan Lambda Legal attorney Paul Castillo commended the New York City agency \"for issuing an accurate birth certificate.\" \"In the United States, birth certificates often provide access to a wide range of public services and critical identity documents, such as state IDs and passports,\" Castillo said. \"Having birth certificates with gender designations other than male or female provides an enormous sense of validation for a number of non-binary and intersex people.\" Like many people born intersex, Keenan was unaware of her anatomical reality for most of her adult life, because her parents and doctors agreed to keep it secret. When she was born in New York City a half-century ago, she was classified as a boy for three weeks\u2014then suddenly issued a female birth certificate. Back then, intersex people were called \"hermaphrodites,\" and doctors typically recommended surgery to make them conform to one of two genders. Keenan started a lifetime of hormone replacement therapy at age 16, vaguely informed that she was \"a girl that can't make hormones.\" Her father confessed to her in 2012 that doctors had suggested a penis be constructed to match her genitalia to her male chromosomes, but he had declined. She has since undergone endocrinological testing to confirm her intersex status. \"Not all intersex people will choose to identify legally as intersex,\" Keenan told NBC Out, \"and not all parents will choose to have their intersex child identified as intersex on birth documents. But for those who do, the option must exist.\" Sara Kelly Kennan Facebook Keenan said she embraces her intersex identity and wants to pave a \"legal way for other intersex people who choose to embrace it in the same way to do so with a legally recognized sex marker.\" After a long life filled with what she called \"lies and deception,\" Keenan has been newly energized by what she said is a mission to fight society's ignorance of the intersex community. A Third Gender Emerges The third-gender momentum gained by Keenan and other intersex people follows on the heels of decades of transgender activism that made it easier for people to change gender markers on identity documents. In 2016, it is relatively simple\u2014with the appropriate medical care and documentation\u2014in most states to change one's gender from male to female and vice versa. But for those born intersex, and those who feel that neither of the 'binary' genders suits them, there's an urgent need for another option. In September, Keenan made headlines when a judge allowed her to become the first California resident to change her gender to \"non-binary.\" When the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) issued her new birth certificate, she entered truly unique territory: Keenan now has two legal genders, both issued this year. Each is accurate, in terms of intersex people falling between or outside of the gender binary\u2014but nothing had prepared Keenan for the moment she would see her birth certificate finally say \"intersex.\" Dana Zzyym, of Fort Collins, Colo., left, and Paul D. Castillo, staff attorney of the South Central regional office of Lambda Legal, after a hearing on Zzyym's lawsuit in Denver on July 20. David Zalubowski / AP \"I wondered if they'd actually issue it and wasn't going to believe it until I saw it,\" Keenan said. \"It is both shocking and empowering.\" A DOHMH spokesperson told NBC Out on Wednesday that Keenan's case shows the agency is working to \"adopt changes.\" \"The Health Department has interpreted our gender marker rule to mean that a person may amend their birth certificate to have 'intersex' reflected on their birth certificate with appropriate documentary evidence from a U.S.-licensed doctor,\" DOHMH Assistant Press Secretary Julien A. Martinez said. \"The Department will continue to work with community partners as we adopt changes to more accurately reflect a person's sex.\" \"As far as interACT is aware, [Keenan's] is the first birth certificate with the designation 'intersex,'\" said Alesdair Ittelson, Deputy Legal Director at interACT, an intersex advocacy group. \"We are aware of one other reissued birth certificate that reads 'hermaphrodite' and several that do not have a sex specified.\" In Ohio in 2012, an intersex person successfully petitioned to have their birth certificate revised to read \"hermaphrodite,\" according to Keenan's attorney, Toby Adams. That case, kept quiet for privacy reasons, ironically owed its victory to the same law that makes it impossible for transgender Ohio natives to change their birth certificates: a 1987 ruling that states \"a birth certificate is an historical record of the facts as they existed at the time of birth.\" The person who was issued the revised certificate was able to provide medical documentation showing they were born \"a true hermaphrodite\" according to medical terminology. Scrambling To Catch Up Keenan is certainly not the first intersex person to fight for recognition on identity documents. But her success in gaining legal third-gender documents is forcing all levels of government to act, as they scramble to accommodate terms that many state and federal agencies don't currently use in their computer systems. Jamie Shupe Facebook Keenan's historic birth certificate arrived during a historic year for gender politics that began with the nation's first legally non-binary person, Jamie Shupe\u2014who changed gender in Oregon this June. Keenan's case is also a parallel to that of Dana Zzyym, a Colorado Intersex person who filed a lawsuit against the State Department after the agency refused to issue a third-gender passport. All three cases have led to government agencies racing to catch up, unable to ignore court orders and city-issued documents. In the new year, Adams and her organization\u2014 the Intersex and Genderqueer Recognition Project (IGRP)\u2014will be busy filing gender-change petitions for new clients in six California counties. She's also fielded requests from clients in seven other states across the country. Overall, Adams described the third-gender movement as \"exploding\" and told NBC Out she expects 2017 to be a landmark year in which third-gender options on identity documents could become standardized. On Wednesday, Adams told NBC Out Keenan's intersex birth certificate has \"huge historic significance.\" \"It shows a change in the nation's understanding of gender as not being constrained by the myth of the binary,\" Adams said. As people like Keenan, Shupe and Zzyym push forward with various government agencies, it's becoming clear that some sort of standardization will soon become necessary. Keenan now has two legal genders: non-binary according to the courts and intersex according to her birth records. In the meantime, she's had meetings with the California Department of Motor Vehicles to discuss changes in the driver's license system that would allow her to update her ID. And while the DMV offices in both California and Oregon appear eager to make the changes necessary to accommodate Keenan and Shupe, it's unclear what form that will take. Will Keenan's driver's license say intersex or non-binary? What happens if the Supreme Court orders the State Department to add a third gender to passports as a result of the Zzyym case? As of today, the details are unclear\u2014but the increased momentum of the third-gender movement is unequivocal, and government agencies that issue identity documents will have to grapple with the changes in 2017.

    "text": "Dec 28 2016, 2:50 pm ET Single Shot at Doctor's Office May Be Future of HIV Prevention by Mary Emily O'Hara advertisement Truvada, the other \"little blue pill,\" is taken daily to prevent HIV and has been touted as a miracle drug responsible for lowering HIV rates across the United States. But soon, the daily pill may be overshadowed by an even simpler method\u2014a single flu shot-like injection at the doctor's office, once every two months. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced last week that it was entering the first-ever global clinical trial of an injectable HIV-prevention drug called cabotegravir. The trial is taking place in eight countries across three world regions\u2014the Americas, Africa and Asia\u2014and researchers are enrolling 4,500 gay and bisexual men along with transgender women, pulling from groups with the highest rates of new infections. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS BSIP/UIG Via Getty Images \"The annual number of new HIV infections among young people, especially young men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men, has been on the rise despite nearly flat HIV incidence among adults worldwide,\" said Raphael J. Landovitz, the Protocol Chair for the study. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control reported new HIV diagnoses have declined by nearly 20 percent\u2014mostly among white gay and bisexual men. But HIV rates are on the rise for men of color and transgender women, as well as youth. Data suggests the disparity might be due to Truvada itself: A 2016 study found 74 percent of Truvada users were white, and the number of black users dropped between 2012 and 2015. RELATED: Black Gay, Bisexual Men Have 50 Percent Risk of HIV Patients participating in the new study will be randomly assigned to receive Truvada pills or cabotegravir injections, to compare the injectible drug's efficacy with the established PrEP pill. Currently, Truvada is the only commercially available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication, and the only FDA-approved HIV-prevention method, period. Bottles of antiretroviral drug Truvada are displayed at Jack's Pharmacy on November 23, 2010 in San Anselmo, California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH, told NBC Out the hope is the injectable PrEP drug will work as well as Truvada\u2014which currently has a roughly 99 percent rate of success in preventing transmission of the HIV virus. \"The ultimate reason for the trial is that many people who take Truvada have difficulty with having to take a pill every single day,\" Fauci said. \"That really becomes prohibitive, and sometimes people don't adhere really well.\" Fauci explained that while it would be ideal for patients to only have a shot once a year, for example, the 8-week period is how long cabotegravir stays in the system inhibiting the virus from taking hold. If the current trial is successful, he predicted, researchers will likely begin to tweak the drug's chemical makeup in an effort to make it last longer. Full results of the trial are expected by 2021 but could come even sooner. A related trial testing the injections on cisgender young women is slated to begin in 2017. RELATED: New Study Shows HIV Epidemic in New York in 1970 The stunning efficacy rates of Truvada have launched a race to expand the market. Researchers are currently studying an HIV vaccine that uses antibody injections, a microbicide gel that can be used as a sort of HIV-prevention lube and a slew of other HIV drugs for treatment and prevention. Damon Jacobs, an HIV-prevention specialist who moderates the 15,000-member Facebook group PrEP Facts: Rethinking HIV Prevention and Sex , told NBC Out the plethora of future prevention methods looming on the horizon is \"wonderful.\" \"It's not going to be one size fits all,\" he said. \"Just like with birth control: some women take the pill, some get an IUD. I'm glad we're going in that direction for PrEP as well.\" According to Jacobs, the PrEP race in medicine is happening because of Truvada's runaway success. While the studies showed Truvada prevents HIV transmission at near-total rates, it's only over the course of the past couple years that the wider effects have been seen. Truvada was introduced commercially in the U.S. after its FDA approval in 2012\u2014since then, New York City has announced new HIV rates fell below 2,500 for the first time since the epidemic exploded in 1981. Jacobs said PrEP was largely responsible for the decline. Play ",

Sandi Jackson, who is seeking a divorce from ex-U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., said in court filings this week that she is out of work and has been borrowing from friends and selling her belongings to stay afloat. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Katherine Skiba Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Former Chicago Ald. Sandi Jackson , who is seeking a divorce from ex-U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., said in court filings this week that he has income of at least $10,250 a month while she is out of work and has been borrowing from friends and selling her belongings to stay afloat. Sandi Jackson filed for divorce in Washington, while her husband filed in Cook County. The former Democratic lawmakers pleaded guilty to felonies in 2013 and later completed staggered terms in federal prison. A hearing in family court in Washington is set for Tuesday, while a separate proceeding is set for Wednesday in Cook County. After 25 years of marriage, the couple is grappling with issues including custody of their children, ages 13 and 16, and her request for child support, alimony and attorney's fees. Where the matters will be heard is a key issue. Chicago attorney Barry Schatz, who is representing Jackson Jr., said Wednesday that Cook County is the proper venue because Jackson Jr. has been registered to vote in Illinois all his life and has an Illinois driver's license. In addition, the couple's home in Chicago was purchased before they bought one in D.C., he said. He said judges in deciding the jurisdiction for a divorce may consider where the couple lives, where their assets are and where their children reside. Schatz said Jackson Jr.'s income was from disability payments, but said he could not specify the sum because he did not have the file in front of him. ",

Courtesy of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan Astronomers searching for an undiscovered planet in the outer solar system hope to catch a glimpse of it Thursday through the Subaru Telescope located on top of Hawaii's Mauna Kea mountain. Courtesy of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan On the top of Hawaii's Mauna Kea mountain Thursday, astronomers will point the large Subaru Telescope toward a patch of sky near the constellation of Orion, looking for an extremely faint object moving slowly through space. If they find what they're looking for, it will be one of the most important astronomical discoveries in more than a century: a new planet in our solar system. Technically, a new planet hasn't been discovered since Neptune was spotted in 1846. Pluto , discovered in 1930, was demoted to \"dwarf planet\" a decade ago. If a new planet is found, it will be the new Planet Nine. Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., will be among the astronomers poring over the pictures taken by Subaru to see if one provides a glimpse of the planet. A Friend For Pluto: Astronomers Find New Dwarf Planet In Our Solar System Sheppard and others have been studying photos taken earlier this year by the Subaru. \"We're looking for things that move, so we're looking for anything that's not a star or a galaxy, basically,\" Sheppard says. Things that move are most likely objects orbiting our sun, dim objects in the far reaches of the solar system \u2014 way past the orbit of Neptune. Sheppard has been using telescopes in Hawaii and Chile to search for these distant objects, and has found several of them. \"All of the objects are right on the edge of detection,\" he says. \"They're very faint.\" But so far, no new planet. In 2014, Sheppard and a colleague published a paper suggesting a handful of these faint distant objects were behaving as if something even more distant with a strong gravitational pull was tugging on them. They suggested the behavior might be explained by an undiscovered planet. Article continues after sponsorship That speculation got a boost from a computer model developed by two other astronomers at Caltech. The model confirmed, at least theoretically, that the planet was really there, and predicted it would be 10 times more massive than Earth, and could even explain the sun's slight tilt with respect to the rest of the solar system. But astronomer David Jewitt , at the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks it's wrong to get all hot and bothered about a new planet at this point. Jewitt says the model is interesting work, \"but without meaning to sound too critical, it's relatively easy to explain anything that's observed, in one way or another, using a model.\" He also thinks the media attention to the model is overblown. \"There's the natural tendency to jump on reports of 'Hey, we've got a planet, we might have a planet.' That's something that people really want to think about a lot. It's a very cool thing to think about,\" says Jewitt. He adds that theories and models do have value, but they only take you so far. \"The answer as to whether there's another planet won't come from models. It won't come from theories. It will only come from observations,\" Jewitt says. And so several astronomers, including Sheppard, are out there observing. \"To me this is science at its finest,\" says Sheppard. \"It's like this thing where science is leading us to say something is definitely going on out there, something weird is happening, and the best explanation for it is there's a planet.\" ",

A fuse shorted in a backup generator that was powering the hotel's Masquerade Tower, said Richard Broome, a spokesman for the Rio's parent company, Caesars Entertainment. The outage affects the fire control systems, so officials made visitors leave their rooms. It's expected to last at least until Friday. \"It all went dark, and then we heard a commotion in the hall,\" Amanda Paulsen, who was staying at the casino with her husband for the holiday weekend, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"We went to look and someone said, 'The power's out, we have to leave.' \" The 2,500-room Rio, which was built in 1990 and is a short drive from the Las Vegas Strip, is one of the more affordable resorts in Las Vegas, with rooms that run less than $100 on an off-peak night. It's home to magicians Penn and Teller, the Chippendales male revue and Food Network personality Guy Fieri 's restaurant El Burro Borracho. The timing of the outage is particularly problematic because it comes at one of the busiest and most lucrative weekends of the year for Las Vegas. More than 300,000 visitors are expected to ring in the new year in Sin City, which is welcoming big-name musical acts and putting on an eight-minute pyrotechnic show that features fireworks launched from casino rooftops. Broome said the Rio was already near capacity. It will try to place guests at other Caesars-owned properties or at competitors' hotels if space runs out, and the company would determine any additional compensation for customers on a case-by-case basis, he said. The problem first emerged Wednesday when a plugged sink in a service area accidentally overflowed, shorting out the fuse in the main power system and causing a small electrical fire that prompted a more limited evacuation, Broome said. Management then relied on a backup generator, but that was later compromised by water from a fire sprinkler and it too shorted early Thursday. Patrons in 900 rooms were directed to the lounge of the 1980s-themed musical \"Rock of Ages,\" where they received food, drinks and updates about the situation. By noon, the company determined it needed to move guests to other hotels and started escorting them back to the rooms to retrieve their belongings, Broome said. Nobody was injured, but emergency responders helped some guests with disabilities get to the bottom of the tower. 0 Shares ",

Despite what the Fort Worth Police Department has charged, David Collie in the video does not appear to be clearly pointing a box cutter at a deputy who was with the officer who fired the shots. Instead, Collie appears to be pointing his right hand away from the officers. \"There's clearly no box cutter in the video,\" Collie's lawyer, Nate Washington, told NBC News on Thursday. \"There's no box cutter in his hand, no box cutter on his person. At some point later they discovered a box cutter. The whole thing is suspicious.\" Washington said he obtained the footage \"from a different source, from a different law enforcement agency.\" Dashcam Video Shows Police Shooting That Left Man Paralyzed                 THU, DEC 29                                  Dashcam video shows two Fort Worth, Texas officers shooting David Collie in the back at a distance of 34 feet, which paralyzes him. NBC News \"We've tried multiple times to get information from the city of Fort Worth,\" he said. Shortly after Washington released the footage on Tuesday, the Fort Worth Police posted a Tweet in response the lawyer's move: \"We saw what you saw. We heard what you heard. We have received your phone calls, your emails, your messages, your tweets, your reviews, your absolute concern over what occurred and your demand for answers and action. WE DO HEAR YOU.\" A message from our #PublicRelations Office: pic.twitter.com/QFbZJTf9OS \u2014 Fort Worth Police (@fortworthpd) December 27, 2016 The police are still investigating the shooting. Collie, 33, is not named in a July 28 press release issued by the Fort Worth Police. Neither is the police officer who fired the shots or the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office deputy who was with him at the time. Both were in uniforms but \"working together in an off-duty capacity and driving a marked Fort Worth Police patrol car,\" the release states. The chain of events that ended with Collie wounded began, according to police, at 11:55 p.m. on July 27 when dispatchers got a 911 call about a robbery in a gas station parking. The victim described the robbers as \"two shirtless black men\" and that one of them displayed what looked like a \"silver handgun.\" Responding to the broadcast, police say, the off-duty officers drove into an apartment complex not far from the station and, minutes later, encountered a shirtless Collie strolling on the grounds. It is at this point the police press release and the video footage diverge. \"The officers observed a subject matching the description of one of the robbery suspects look in their direction and duck down behind a row of bushes near the entrance to the complex,\" the press release states. In the footage, Collie is seen walking and does not seem to be attempting to hide from the officer and the deputy. \"As the officers approached and exited the patrol car, the subject began walking away from them,\" the release reads. Collie, in the video, appears to stop briefly to look at the officers before he resumes walking. The release states that the officers repeatedly gave Collie \"verbal commands\" to stop and show his hands but the \"subject refused to comply.\" There is no audio with the footage so it can't be determined what, if anything, the officers said to Collie or what he replied. \"The subject then removed a silver object from his pocket and pointed it directly at the TCSO deputy,\" the release states. \"The Fort Worth officer saw the silver object, believed the male was threatening the TCSO deputy with a firearm and fired two rounds at the subject striking him once in the lower torso.\" In the video, Collie is moving away from the lawmen and does extend his right arm \u2014 but in the direction he is going, not in the direction of the officers. It is not clear if he has anything in his hand. And when he is shot, he appears to fall forward. The police press release states the Fort Worth officer \"immediately began to treat the subject's gunshot wound and bleeding.\" In the remaining 25 seconds of the footage, however, neither officer is seen tending to the wounded man. When asked to respond to the seeming contradictions between what appeared in the press release and what appeared on the dashcam video, a police spokesman Thursday referred NBC News back to their \"original press release.\" Collie, who is now paralyzed from the waist down, could not be reached for comment. He was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant but a Tarrant County grand jury declined to indict him, his lawyer said. Washington said Collie told him he was scared when the officers approached him and didn't know what to do. He said a box cutter was found 10 feet away from where Collie was shot. \"You see Mr. Collie, he's not breathing hard, not trying to get away from the officers,\" Washington told reporters earlier. \"He was trying to comply with the officers \u2026 It was a crime to have him chained to a bed for 61 days.\" Washington said he knows the names and badge numbers of the officers involved in the shooting but is not releasing them to the public just yet. \"We don't want to encourage people to harass or harm officers,\" he said. Earlier, a police spokesman told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram they won't release any more details about the incident \"until the internal case in closed.\" The Fort Worth police got a lot of unwanted attention earlier this month when video of a white officer violently arresting three black women went viral.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d For the people whose emails were stolen, this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter, recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices, humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts \u201csuboptimal.\u201d \u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201d The United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201d Mr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn. Advertisement \u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook. Democratic House Candidates Were Also Targets of Russian Hacking The fallout for nearly a dozen congressional candidates underscores the effect of the Russian influence operation on the American electoral system. Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed. \u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201d A Target for Break-Ins Sitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture. \u201cGOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair,\u201d reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19, 1972, with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again. There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have. \u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Tamene, who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F.B.I. agent, was not a full-time D.N.C. employee; he works for a Chicago-based contracting firm called The MIS Department . He was left to figure out, largely on his own, how to respond \u2014 and even whether the man who had called in to the D.N.C. switchboard was really an F.B.I. agent. \u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201d Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system. Photo An internal memo by Yared Tamene, a tech-support contractor at the D.N.C., expressed uncertainty about the identity of Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the F.B.I., who called to inform him of the breach. Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo. In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201d Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised. Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d \u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201d The F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201d By March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn. A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google. \u201cSomeone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account,\u201d the March 22 email said , adding that the sign-in attempt had occurred in Ukraine. \u201cGoogle stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.\u201d Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.

What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.

Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button. \u201cThis is a legitimate email,\u201d Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta\u2019s aides, who had noticed the alert. \u201cJohn needs to change his password immediately.\u201d With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.

Credit Dave Sanders for The New York Times During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C. The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated. One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says.

Credit Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead. Their first major attack was detected on Oct. 7, 1996, when a computer operator at the Colorado School of Mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain. The school had a major contract with the Navy, and the operator warned his contacts there. But as happened two decades later at the D.N.C., at first \u201ceveryone was unable to connect the dots,\u201d said Thomas Rid , a scholar at King\u2019s College in London who has studied the attack. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investigators gave it a name \u2014 Moonlight Maze \u2014 and spent two years, often working day and night, tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end, they concluded that the total number of files stolen, if printed and stacked, would be taller than the Washington Monument. Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world. But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it. The Russians had not gone away, of course. \u201cThey were just a lot more stealthy,\u201d said Kevin Mandia , a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye \u2014 and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems. The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia. But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks. But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cEach time, they eventually met with some form of success,\u201d Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project , wrote recently in a soon-to-be published paper for the Carnegie Endowment. The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them. 2016 Election Hacking Coverage Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d So the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld. It was a brazen change in tactics, moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014, they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a little-known American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine, then in political turmoil. They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the steal-and-leak strategy. The Open Society Foundation, run by George Soros, was a major target, and when its documents were released , some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members. Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot. The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers. \u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d No one knew just how bad the breach was \u2014 but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created, including Ms. Dacey, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann , a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie, the Washington law firm that handles D.N.C. political matters. \u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201d Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them. \u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201d Photo Michael Sussmann, a Washington lawyer and former cybercrime prosecutor at the Justice Department, received an email in late April confirming that the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system had been compromised. The D.N.C. immediately hired CrowdStrike , a cybersecurity firm, to scan its computers, identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day, CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia, Mr. Sussmann said. The work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer. It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes. \u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager. Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email. Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations. That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone. To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents. In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak. All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201d The D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage. \u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d The Media\u2019s Role Continue reading the main story Photo Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign protested at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times In mid-June, on Mr. Sussmann\u2019s advice, D.N.C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak, they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way, they figured, they could get ahead of the story, win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign. But the very next day, a new, deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2.0 appeared on the web, claiming to be the D.N.C. hacker \u2014 and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides. \u2014         GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 20, 2016 \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns. Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201d But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter. \u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201d That gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be. Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2.0 had been edited by someone calling himself, in Russian, Felix Edmundovich \u2014 an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky . Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian, generated by what was clearly a Russian-language version of Word. When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201d Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks.com , a site that sprang up in June, claiming to be the work of \u201chacktivists\u201d but posting more stolen documents. It, too, seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably, the website was registered in April, suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to what Guccifer 2.0 published on his site, he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications . The steady flow of Guccifer 2.0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6, 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland, Guccifer released the D.N.C.\u2019s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives, it was insider gold. Then WikiLeaks, a far more established outlet, began to publish the hacked material \u2014 just as Guccifer 2.0 had promised. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped out 44,053 D.N.C. emails with 17,761 attachments . Some of the messages made clear that some D.N.C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger, Mr. Sanders. That was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside. Mr. Trump, by now the Republican nominee, expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent, and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25, he sent out a lighthearted tweet : \u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7, a month before the election, the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta , Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. The same day, the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings, in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date, with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d \u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201d The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming. Wednesday@HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks . \u2014         Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) Oct. 2, 2016 But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming. Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling. In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d \u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent.

Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence. Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web. \u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201d Devising a Government Response Photo The D.N.C. headquarters in Washington. Credit Justin T. Gellerson for The New York Times Inside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea. In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim. In that case, embarrassing emails had also been released. But the real damage was done to Sony\u2019s own systems: More than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released. Within weeks, intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the North and its leadership . Mr. Obama called North Korea out in public, and issued some not-very-effective sanctions . The Chinese even cooperated, briefly cutting off the North\u2019s internet connections. As the first Situation Room meetings on the Russian hacking began in July, \u201cit was clear that Russia was going to be a much more complicated case,\u201d said one participant. The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics, and they were masters of \u201c kompromat ,\u201d their term for compromising information. But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president. \u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system. In August a group that called itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d published a set of software tools that looked like what the N.S.A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install \u201cimplants,\u201d malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A., a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar. The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning. The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes. Photo Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, pressed for a more muscular response to the Russians. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options. But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president. In a series of \u201cdeputies meetings\u201d run by Avril Haines , the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C.I.A., several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands. \u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201d Even something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky. \u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201d Instead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy. Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage. Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks \u2014 an offer he declined to take up. \u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201d Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting. Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters. But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony. The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role. But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified. A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201d Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. \u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded. Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201d A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201d The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that. The Next Target Continue reading the main story Photo President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. walked back toward the White House after delivering remarks about the election results last month. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive. Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump? In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals. What seems clear is that Russian hacking, given its success, is not going to stop. Two weeks ago, the German intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, warned that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. \u201cThe perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such,\u201d Mr. Kahl said. Now, he added, \u201cEurope is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance, and Germany to a particularly great extent.\u201d But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target. On the day after the presidential election, the cybersecurity company Volexity reported five new waves of phishing emails, evidently from Cozy Bear, aimed at think tanks and nonprofits in the United States. One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper. Its title: \u201cWhy American Elections Are Flawed.\u201d Correction: December 13, 2016 Editors\u2019 Note: An earlier version of the main photograph with this article, of a filing cabinet and computer at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, should not have been published.

USA TODAY NETWORK Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Syria President Bashar Assad. (Photo: AP) Russian President Vladimir Putin said the\u00a0Syrian government and rebel fighters reached a cease-fire\u00a0deal to allow peace talks over the nearly 6-year-old conflict to begin, state media reported Thursday. A nationwide cease-fire will start at midnight, Syrian state news agency SANA reported. Russia's TASS\u00a0news agency also reported the news. Putin said Russia and Turkey will guarantee the truce, although he acknowledged the deal was \"fragile.\" If the cease-fire holds, peace talks will take place in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. They would not include the United States and would be separate to United Nations-brokered negotiations. Putin did not specify which rebel groups would\u00a0participate in the truce set to begin later Thursday, but Russia's defense ministry said it would include 62,000 opposition fighters from across Syria. The Syrian army said the truce does not include al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch and the Islamic State group. Putin said the deal came out of meetings held in Moscow with foreign ministers from Russia, Turkey and Iran.\u00a0\"The agreements reached are very fragile, they demand special attention and patience, a professional approach to these issues and a constant contact with our partners,\" he said. A member of one of Syria's main opposition groups\u00a0said the truce includes a halt to airstrikes and shelling. Ahmad Ramadan of the Syrian National Coalition told The Associated Press rebel factions would abide by the truce but retaliate to violations by the government and its partners. 6351 CONNECT TWEET 5 LINKEDIN 49 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iI13m3 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

The strike was targeting a van carrying ISIS fighters who were spotted firing an anti-tank rifle. The van was hit in an area that officials later realized was a hospital compound parking lot, resulting in potential civilian casualties. In a statement, the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve said it \"takes all allegations of civilian casualties seriously\" and that an investigation into the incident is being conducted. The findings will be released. The strike comes more than two months after Iraqi operations to free Mosul began. Coalition air support has been key for Iraqi advancement on the ground. Though progress has been hampered by heavy losses, intense ISIS retaliation, and bad weather, a renewed offensive to retake Mosul began this week. 0 Shares ",

By Ann Hornaday December 29 at 4:39 PM Follow @AnnHornaday (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) Y ou can almost hear Carrie Fisher\u2019s voice come down from on high: \u201cReally, Mom? You had to upstage me one last time?\u201d The instant memorials to Debbie Reynolds came pre-fitted with the words \u201cHollywood legend\u201d before her name. And she was a legend, for different reasons to different people. For one generation, she was the fresh-faced teenage ingenue who, after being discovered at a Los Angeles beauty pageant, delivered her first big Hollywood star turn in the 1952 MGM musical \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d To those same fans, she was party to one of the most notorious romantic scandals of the 1950s, when her husband, the pop singer Eddie Fisher, left her for their dear friend Elizabeth Taylor after Taylor\u2019s husband, the producer Mike Todd, met an untimely death. (The couples had been such good friends that Reynolds and Fisher named their son Todd.) [ \u2018This is too hard to comprehend\u2019: Hollywood mourns Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher ] To another generation, Reynolds was known as \u201cPrincess Leia\u2019s mom,\u201d Princess Leia having been played by Carrie Fisher in \u201cStar Wars.\u201d And to another cohort still, she was assumed to be the inspiration for Fisher\u2019s 1987 novel, \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d a fictionalized memoir of Fisher's recovery from a drug overdose. In the book, Reynolds\u2019s character was mentioned only briefly (and not particularly negatively), but she loomed large in Fisher\u2019s screenplay for the film adaptation, which starred Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. In that version, Fisher\u2019s mother was brash, bossy and sometimes breathtakingly inappropriate in her attempts to steal the spotlight from her far more painfully self-aware daughter. Although the story was about a mother and daughter who were both actresses \u2014 and embroiled in the kind of pressure, competitiveness and endless psychodrama such a relationship might naturally entail \u2014 Fisher insisted that it was far more fiction than fact. Still, \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d captured what might have been the most enduring truth about Reynolds: She was a trouper. A red-light performer. To borrow a phrase about another thinly fictionalized actress \u2014 Margo Channing, in \u201cAll About Eve\u201d \u2014 if she could walk, crawl or roll, she played. 1 of 31 The life and career of Debbie Reynolds (1932-2016) View Photos Mary Frances \u201cDebbie\u201d Reynolds, actor, singer, entertainer and humanitarian died at age 84.

Richard Drew/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. After her spectacular breakout in \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d (which she made when she was 19, the same age Fisher was when she was catapulted to unexpected fame in \u201cStar Wars\u201d), Reynolds made 50 movies; she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in the musical \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown.\u201d She did Broadway and television and she recorded a hit pop song, \u201cTammy,\u201d from the 1957 movie \u201cTammy and the Bachelor.\u201d She kept coming back, whether it was to play Albert Brooks\u2019s mother in the 1996 comedy \u201cMother\u201d or Debra Messing\u2019s mother in the TV show \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d And through it all, she continued to take her cabaret show on the road to Las Vegas. She was so indomitable (would \u201cunsinkable\u201d be too on-the-nose?), that well into her 80s, even after strokes and bouts of pneumonia, she would insist on booking just one more show. In May, when Carrie Fisher was at Cannes promoting the HBO documentary \u201cBright Lights,\u201d about Reynolds\u2019s latter-day nightclub career, she recalled that she hatched the idea for the film after watching her mother rally again and again, despite a failing memory and inevitable physical decline. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that gives her life, but it was also pulling it out of her,\u201d Fisher explained, \u201cbecause she\u2019d perform, and then she\u2019d have to recover.\u201d When her mother would insist on playing one more date, Fisher admitted, \u201cPart of me is, \u2018Please, no.\u2019 But it\u2019s great that she has that kind of passion. And she adores it, so who am I to get in the way of it? Just don\u2019t ask me to, because she automatically says, \u2018And then you\u2019ll come, too.\u2019 \u201d [ The humanity and humor of Carrie Fisher ] In Eugenia Zukerman\u2019s 2003 book \u201cIn My Mother\u2019s Closet: An Invitation to Remember,\u201d Fisher wrote at length about her relationship with Reynolds, whose fame she \u201cresented bitterly\u201d when she was young. But, she added, \u201cAs a kid, I remember thinking, There is no other mother that even comes close to this broad. I still find my mother fascinating and very touching. She\u2019s loyal, she\u2019s reliable, she\u2019s honest. Those qualities are hard won. She\u2019s also quick, she\u2019s certainly witty. She still performs, and whether she\u2019s tired, or her foot hurts, when she\u2019s out there onstage, she\u2019s radiant, she\u2019s the consummate performer. I\u2019ve watched her for a long time, and she\u2019s got this strong life force. It pours through her veins, her muscles, and her heart. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d No one, least of all Fisher, should be surprised that she and Reynolds died just one day apart. Despite any strains in the past, by now they had grown close, not just physically (Fisher lived just up the hill from her mother in Los Angeles), but psychically as well. Reportedly, Reynolds\u2019s last words were, \u201cI want to be with Carrie.\u201d Those are the understandable sentiments of a parent who can\u2019t imagine the agony of outliving her only daughter \u2014 tinged, perhaps, with a touch of jealousy that Fisher had left to play the great gig in the sky without her mother, the consummate performer. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll come, too.\u201d If Saint Peter is waiting, one can\u2019t help but imagine him a bit intimidated by Fisher \u2014 coolly observing the scene and taking notes for mordant future reference \u2014 and Reynolds, adjusting her hair and makeup one last time before wowing him with a showstopper of an opening number. Dim the stars. Cue the music of the spheres. Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher will storm the pearly gates together. How, in heaven or on earth, could it ever have been otherwise? lifestyle ",

There\u2019s disagreement over whether the Sprint jobs, announced shortly after a multi-billion investment from its owner, SoftBank, should even be counted as new, or whether they are part of a previous SoftBank announcement promising 50,000 jobs. (A Sprint spokeswoman told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday they are part of the 50,000, but the company\u2019s CEO seemed to suggest the opposite \u00a0in a tweet a half-hour later.)\u00a0 There\u2019s also dispute over whether Mr. Trump should be taking credit for jobs resulting from a private investment that, analysts say, would likely have ended up in U.S. firms anyway . And of course, it\u2019s unknown what benefits -- tax, regulatory or otherwise -- Sprint will be getting in return, and thus whether the jobs are the result of sound public policy. But leaving all these questions aside, there\u2019s a more fundamental objection to Mr. Trump\u2019s job numbers. Any way you slice it, neither 5,000 nor 50,000 is a particularly impressive number, in job-creation terms across America. For perspective, here are the U.S. jobs created so far this year -- plus the Sprint announcement in December. Close Bureau of Labor Statistics/CBS MoneyWatch The economy has created just under 6,000 jobs every day of 2016. And relatively speaking, that\u2019s not even a particularly booming economy. The monthly job creation count for the year averages 165,200, not including December, for which data is not yet available. That\u2019s steady growth, but nothing like the previous two years, where average monthly job growth was well above 220,000. (The job figures for recent months could still be revised slightly in January, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases information on December employment. But they are unlikely to change much.) Of course, the 5,000 new jobs at Sprint aren\u2019t all coming home this month; Sprint has set a deadline of March 2018. Spread out over 15 months of very average job growth -- let\u2019s say around 155,000 a month, plus or minus 10,000 here and there -- this is what the impact of Sprint (in red) would look like. ",

The sweeping retaliation follows an intense review of what Obama called \"aggressive harassment\" of U.S. diplomats in Moscow and \"cyberoperations aimed at the U.S. election,\u201d a hacking campaign that U.S. officials code-named \u201cGrizzly Steppe.\u201d It also signaled the worst cyberclash of the modern era, with the two former Cold War adversaries now increasingly focused on penetrating each other\u2019s digital networks and communications. In the most dramatic move, the State Department declared 35 intelligence operatives at the Russian Embassy in Washington and the Russian Consulate in San Francisco as personae non gratae. They were given 72 hours to leave the country with their families for \u201cacting in a manner inconsistent with their diplomatic status.\u201d The Obama administration also said it would block access after noon Friday to two properties owned by the Russian government \u2014 a 45-acre estate along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and 14-acre compound in Long Island, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0 that it says were used by Russian personnel for gathering intelligence. The broad penalties, three weeks before Obama hands over the White House to Donald Trump , mark a new low in post-Cold War relations with Russia amid rising tensions over President Vladimir Putin \u2019s military operations in Syria and Ukraine. \u201cAll Americans should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s actions,\u201d Obama said in a statement. He said the U.S. moves follow \u201crepeated private and public warnings\u201d to Moscow. \u201cThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia\u2019s aggressive activities,\u201d Obama added. \u201cWe will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized.\u201d Obama said the Russian effort was aimed at interfering with the U.S. election. He stopped short of endorsing FBI and CIA conclusions that the cyberattack was aimed, at least in part, at helping Trump win. Earlier this month, Obama all but blamed Putin personally, telling reporters that very little happens in the Russian government without Putin\u2019s knowledge. Trump has repeatedly dismissed conclusions from the Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security that senior Russian officials directed a campaign to interfere in\u00a0the fall election.\u00a0 In a statement Thursday night,Trump made clear he is still not convinced. \u201cIt's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\u201d he said. \u201cNevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.\" The mass expulsion of alleged Russian spies is the largest in decades, and a Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said Moscow would respond in kind. \u201cI can't say what the response will be, but there is absolutely no alternative to the principle of reciprocity,\u201d he said. Peskov said the U.S. measures were \u201cungrounded and illegal\u201d and were intended to undermine Trump\u2019s calls for warmer relations with Moscow. In an acerbic statement, Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said America had been \u201chumiliated by its own president\u201d and his \u201chardly literate foreign policy team.\u201d \u201cNot by international terrorists, not enemy armies. Washington\u2019s own master slapped it on the face by maximally increasing the number of urgent things to be done by the next administration,\u201d she said. She said Russia would announce countermeasures \u201cand a lot of other things\u201d Friday. The State Department said it was expelling the 35 Russian diplomats partly in response to the harassment of U.S. diplomats in Russia over the last four years, including the tackling of a U.S. Embassy official by a Russian security guard that was posted on YouTube in June. \u201cThis harassment has involved arbitrary police stops, physical assault, and the broadcast on State TV of personal details about our personnel that put them at risk,\u201d State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement.\u00a0The Russian government has also closed 28 American cultural education centers in Russia and blocked the construction of a new consular office in St. Petersburg. \u201cSuch behavior is unacceptable and will have consequences,\u201d Toner said. Closing the two Russian compounds may be especially painful for Russian diplomats. One is a sprawling estate called Pioneer Point\u00a0on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore that Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington long has used as a weekend retreat. In 2007, Washington Life magazine\u00a0described it as a \u201cthree-story brick dacha fronting the Chester River.\u201d The parcel was purchased by the Soviet government in 1972 and transferred to the Russian Federation in the 1990s. \u00a0 Russian diplomats based in New York City or at the United Nations have used the Long Island compound for decades as a weekend retreat. A State Department official described both locations on condition of anonymity. Obama used a newly amended executive order that for the first time authorizes U.S. action in response to attempted \u201cinterfering with or undermining\u201d a U.S. election, an expansion of previous authority. He ordered sanctions against Russia\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate, known as the GRU, and the Federal Security Service, known as the FSB. Officials said both took part in the hacking and leaking of tens of thousands of emails and other material from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, among other targets. The stolen digital trove was posted on WikiLeaks and other websites. The administration also sanctioned four senior GRU officers \u2014 the current chief,\u00a0Igor Valentinovich Korobov Sergey, and three of his deputies \u2014 and three Russian companies that provided material support for its cyberoperations. Also sanctioned were two notorious Russian hackers, Evgeniy\u00a0Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, who U.S. officials said had stolen more than $100 million by breaking into the computers of U.S. banks, universities and online retailers.
