    "text": "Mass Graves, Booby Traps as Russians, Syrians Sweep Aleppo By The Associated Press BEIRUT \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 7:30 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Syrian Government Recaptures Aleppo from Rebels, State TV Reports 0 Shares Email Russia's Defense Ministry said on Monday that its troops had found mass graves in Syria's Aleppo with bodies showing signs of torture and mutilation. Dozens of bodies have been uncovered, according to Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. He said some bore gunshot wounds. While the Syrian war is now largely fought with mortars, tanks, and air power, death has come at close quarters as well. Human rights observers and the media have recorded numerous examples of massacres and organized torture, perpetrated by the government, opposition, and the Islamic State group. The Russian Air Force has helped Syrian President Bashar Assad and its allies to capture Aleppo, Syria's largest city, after weeks of a siege. Russia has since dispatched military police to the city. Konashenkov also accused rebels, who controlled eastern Aleppo before they were pushed out earlier this month, of laying multiple booby traps and mines across town, endangering the civilian population. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gathers information on the conflict through local contacts, said on Sunday that at least 63 Syrian soldiers and militiamen had been killed by such booby traps in east Aleppo since the government took control of it from rebels last Thursday. The Observatory said the victims were a mix of demining personnel and soldiers or militiamen looting the districts. As Russian and Syrian forces secured and consolidated eastern Aleppo, Syrian president Bashar Assad was showing signs of increasing confidence in his position. On Sunday, Assad visited a Christian orphanage near the capital Damascus to mark Christmas . Photographs posted on the Syrian presidency's Facebook page showed Assad along with his wife, Asma, standing with nuns and orphans in the Damascus suburb of Sednaya. In the northern city of Aleppo, Christians celebrated Christmas for the first time in four years with the country's largest city now under full control of government forces. The rebel withdrawal from east Aleppo last week marked Assad's biggest victory since Syria's crisis began in 2011. Christians, one of the largest religious minorities at about 10 percent of Syria's pre-war 23 million-strong population, have tried to stay on the sidelines of the conflict. However, the opposition's increasingly outspoken Islamism has kept many leaning toward Assad's government. 0 Shares ",

By Michael Kranish December 26 at 5:02 PM Follow @PostKranish President Obama said Republican strategy was to block his programs. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) President Obama said in an interview released Monday that he could have beaten Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump \u201cif I had run again.\u201d In his most pointed critique yet, Obama said Hillary Clinton's campaign acted too cautiously out of a mistaken belief that victory was all but certain. \u201cIf you think you're winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\u201d Obama said in the interview with former adviser and longtime friend David Axelrod, a CNN analyst, for his \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast. The president said Clinton \u201cunderstandably . . . looked and said, well, given my opponent and the things he's saying and what he's doing, we should focus on that.\u201d Trump took exception to this critique, tweeting out later in the day that \u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! \u2014 \u00a0jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.\u201d President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 Obama stressed his admiration for Clinton and said she had been the victim of unfair attacks. But, as he has in other exit interviews, Obama\u00a0insisted that her defeat was not a rejection of the eight years of his presidency. To the contrary, he argued that he had put together a winning coalition that stretched across the country but that the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign had failed to follow through on it. \u201cI am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I \u2014 if I had run again and articulated it \u2014 I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\u201d the president said. \u201cSee, I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class, I think that's nonsense,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLook, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters. There are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn't vote for Hillary, didn't vote for me, but are being helped by this . . . The problem is, is that we're not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we're bleeding for these communities.\u201d 1 of 9 See how Obama has aged during his presidency View Photos Eight years after he burst onto the scene with a youthful vigor, his once-black hair has gone nearly fully gray. Caption Eight years after he burst onto the scene with a youthful vigor, his once-black hair has gone nearly fully gray. Aug. 4, 2008\u00a0 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) smiles as the audience sings him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d during a campaign stop at the Lansing Center in Lansing, Mich. Rebecca Cook/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said via email that the campaign declined to comment. Axelrod, in an interview with The Washington Post, said he believed Obama went further than he had before in critiquing Clinton's campaign. \u201cThis was all in service of making the point that he believes that his progressive vision and the vision he ran on is still a majority view in this country,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cHe chooses to be hopeful about the future.\u201d [ Michelle Obama gave a somber exit interview to Oprah Winfrey ] Obama could not have run again; the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution states that \u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\u201d Still, Obama\u2019s suggestion that he could have won if he ran stoked debate Monday among political observers. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican who has been an adviser to Trump, said in an interview that \u201cObama doesn\u2019t know and neither does anyone else. Obama would have increased the turnout in the African American community, but he also might have increased the repudiation of him among those who felt they were betrayed. \u201cAll of the lies he told about Obamacare, \u2018keeping your doctor\u2019 . . . would have come back to haunt him. It would have been a totally different race.\u201d Steve Hildebrand, a Democrat who oversaw Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign in battleground states, said the president had an ability to communicate with lower-income workers that Clinton lacked. He said he sent the Clinton campaign 15 emails in which he said he told them \u201cyou are not communicating with lower-income workers, you are not connecting with them.\u201d In the podcast interview, Axelrod did not press Obama on many of the most controversial parts of his presidency, such as not taking action to prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Syria. The president, who has done relatively few interviews with mainstream media organizations, repeated his long-stated complaint that the media has filtered his message and that he is subject to unfair criticism by outlets such as Fox News. Obama also blamed some of his problems during his presidency on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a longtime adversary who famously said in 2010: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d McConnell failed in that goal, but Obama said the senator was successful in blocking many of his initiatives and setting the groundwork for Trump\u2019s victory. McConnell\u2019s strategy from a \u201ctactical perspective was pretty smart and well executed,\u201d the president said. The Republican leader found ways to \u201cjust throw sand in the gears\u201d in a manner that fed into people\u2019s beliefs that things were going badly. Obama said that, as a result, Republicans blocked action that could have helped more people recover from the Great Recession. The strategy, Obama maintained, was that \u201cif we just say no, then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is \u2014 is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy. And if we can \u2014 if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House.\u201d A McConnell spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Obama stressed that he doesn't plan to get involved in day-to-day responses to a Trump presidency, just as former president George W. Bush has remained mostly on the sidelines during the Obama years. But Obama made it clear that he will be more of an activist in the long run. He said he plans to help mobilize and train a younger generation of Democratic leaders and will speak out if his core beliefs are challenged. He also said he is working on writing a book. At a news conference at the White House, Dec. 16, President Obama shared his advice to Democrats following their defeat in the 2016 election. (Reuters) His post-presidential \u201clong-term interest,\u201d Obama said, is \u201cto build that next generation of leadership; organizers, journalists, politicians. I see them in America, I see them around the world \u2014 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds who are just full of talent, full of idealism. And the question is how do we link them up? How do we give them the tools for them to bring about progressive change? And I want to use my presidential center as a mechanism for developing that next generation of talent.\u201d He said he didn't want to be someone \u201cwho's just hanging around reliving old glories.\u201d Obama in the interview also reflected on his years at college, particularly Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1983. He said he was rereading \u201cold journals\u201d and letters to girls that he was \u201ccourting,\u201d and found them unreadable. He found himself to be \u201cwildly pretentious,\u201d recalling how he begged off going to parties so he could read the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The women on campus found him \u201ctoo intense,\u201d he said. Looking back, said the president of the United States, \u201cI should\u2019ve tried, like, you know, \u2018Wanna go to a movie?\u2019 \u201d 1 of 22 ",

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has borrowed more than $21 million to start paying for the former Michael Reese hospital site that was bought as part of former Mayor Richard M. Daley \u2019s failed bid for the 2016 summer Olympics. City Hall must now find the money to pay off both those loans and the $14.2 million... (Hal Dardick and John Byrne) \"This site has incredible potential to create new jobs and drive economic growth in the 4th Ward and community input is an important part of that vision,\" King's statement reads. Part of the city's plan at the site includes the possibility of removing the Michael Reese site and surrounding lots from the Bronzeville tax-increment financing district to create its own TIF, which city officials said would be used to address infrastructure needs there. The city already has removed McCormick Place from the Bronzeville planning area after the Tribune reported last year that the vast majority of spending of TIF funds earmarked for Bronzeville was going to projects near the convention center. Residents said they are less concerned about which TIF pools money from the area than they are about what ultimately is built. \"Residents typically have no say whatsoever anyway on how the public can leverage TIFs,\" said Mell Monroe, the owner of a Michigan Avenue bed-and-breakfast in Bronzeville and a onetime aldermanic candidate. \"I've been here 14 years and no one has ever come in and said, 'We're going to use TIF money on this or we're going to use TIF money on that.'\" Monroe has long called on the city to bring more attractions to the historic neighborhood. He said increasing tourism would help small-business owners such as himself and hopefully snowball into more private development. Even a casino would be welcomed on the lakefront as far as he's concerned, he said, although the city has said that is not on the radar in this round of planning. \"It could be a conglomeration of restaurants and hotels and things,\" Monroe said. \"Anything that brings traffic on our side of town.\" jcoen@chicagotribune.com ",

Here are 10 big brands well worth seeking out, and a glossary to help you navigate the selections. Billecart-Salmon Refined Champagnes, particularly the Brut R\u00e9serve ($45), Brut Sous Bois, fermented and aged in barrels ($80), and the ros\u00e9 ($65). (T.

(Verity Wine Partners, New York) Charles Heidsieck Nonvintage Brut R\u00e9serve ($55) is extraordinarily deep and complex; the other cuv\u00e9es are just as good. (Folio Fine Wine Partners, Napa, Calif.) Delamotte Nonvintage blanc de blancs ($60) is pure, chalky and elegant; the vintage ($100) is even better. (Vineyard Brands, Birmingham, Ala.) Duval-Leroy From the nonvintage brut ($40) to the high-end Femme de Champagne ($180), a fine range of understated beauties. (Duval-Leroy Imports, Manhasset, N.Y.) Jacquesson Idiosyncratic yet gorgeous Champagnes, from the savory, numbered, extra brut nonvintages (currently No. 739, $50), to the higher end, site-specific cuv\u00e9es. (Vintage \u201959 Imports, Washington) Louis Roederer Across-the-board top quality, from energetic, harmonious nonvintage Brut Premier ($45) to the vintage blanc de blancs ($75) to the high-end Cristal ($250). (Maisons Marques & Domaines USA, Oakland, Calif.) Philipponnat Ripe, rich nonvintage Royale R\u00e9serve Brut ($60) is fine, but the higher-end blends are superb, especially the single-vineyard Clos des Goisses ($200). (Banville Wine Merchants, New York) Ruinart Nonvintage blanc de blancs ($70) is unusually full-bodied though elegant and fresh; vintage Dom Ruinart blanc de blancs ($140) is superb. (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy USA, New York) Taittinger Understated wines, from the lacy, toasty, nonvintage La Fran\u00e7aise ($40) to the complex Comtes de Champagne blanc de blancs ($150). (Kobrand, New York) Champagne Cheat Sheet Blanc de Blancs Champagne is ordinarily a blend of some combination of three grapes. Two, pinot noir and pinot meunier, are black grapes, ordinarily used to make red wines. One, chardonnay, is a white grape for white wine. A blanc de blancs, literally white from whites, is made solely from chardonnay and tends to have great elegance and finesse. Blanc de Noirs \u201cWhite from blacks\u201d is a Champagne made only of black grapes, often but not always just pinot noir. It\u2019s more robust than blanc de blancs and much rarer. Disgorgement After the wine is fermented and bottled, a little sweetness and yeast are added to the bottle before it is sealed. This starts a second fermentation in the bottle, which produces the carbonation. Before the Champagne is finished, the sediment left by the dead yeast is expelled, or disgorged, from the bottle. Dosage After disgorgement, the Champagne is generally sweetened a bit before it\u2019s corked to balance the often searing acidity of the wine. Brut The amount of the dosage determines how dry the Champagne will be. Brut is the most common designation, indicating a wine that can range from 0 to 12 grams of residual sugar per liter, though nowadays most bruts are 6 to 10 grams. Extra Brut indicates a very dry Champagne, 0 to 6 grams of residual sugar per liter. Brut Nature Indicates no dosage, though technically it can have a small dosage of up to 3 grams of residual sugar per liter. Synonyms include brut z\u00e9ro. Extra Dry Paradoxically, this indicates a much sweeter Champagne than brut, up to 17 grams residual sugar per liter. Demi-sec is even sweeter. What's Next ",

By Amber Phillips December 26 at 8:00 AM Follow byamberphillips (Philip Bump/The Washington Post) With a 52-to-48 Senate majority next month, Republicans will have power in numbers. But a handful of independent-minded GOP senators could\u00a0arguably have even more power. Just three Republicans could derail some of Donald Trump's critical Cabinet-level nominations, which need to be approved by a 51-vote\u00a0majority of the U.S. Senate. (After Senate Democrats got rid of the filibuster in 2013 for nominations like these, they essentially took away their ability to block Trump's nominations, because a filibuster would have essentially translated into a\u00a060-vote confirmation requirement.) History suggests \u00a0it's very rare for senators from the president's own party to block his Cabinet appointments. But it is a possibility for\u00a0several of Trump's picks. Here are four\u00a0of Trump's nominations\u00a0that could draw\u00a0support from most Republicans \u2014 but\u00a0resistance from a critical few: Rex Tillerson: Secretary of state President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) The background:\u00a0The ExxonMobil chief executive was an unorthodox\u00a0pick for the nation's top diplomatic job, one that The Washington Post reported came at the last minute via an offhand recommendation from a pair of high-profile former Bush administration officials (whose firm happens to work with ExxonMobil.) Why it could blow up: Tillerson has extensive business ties to Russia and, specifically, to President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0The two worked together to seal energy and drilling deals in the face of\u00a0U.S. sanctions against Russia, and Tillerson even accepted an award from Moscow. German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported \u00a0that Tillerson also ran a U.S.-Russian oil firm in the Bahamas, a tax haven (and reminiscent of the offshoring Trump has said he wants to crack down on.) Watchdogs say it's problematic for any secretary of state to have such close financial and personal ties to any country, but the fact that it's Russia only heightens bipartisan concern in Washington that Trump is too friendly toward a nation that a decisive majority of U.S. political and intelligence leaders believe\u00a0is more of a foe. Whom to watch: Being tight with Putin is a red line for some high-profile Senate Republicans, including Marco Rubio (Fla.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Rand Paul (Ky.).They sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which\u00a0will vote first on Tillerson. If just one or two vote against the\u00a0nomination, that would swing the panel against the nod. Being a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState - MR \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 11, 2016 Tillerson has committee vote problem. Rubio, Rand, Flake all on SFRC and it's a 10-9 R/D split. He gets rejected in committee, that's it. https://t.co/7qFx6WRjuO \u2014 Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) December 11, 2016 Jeff Sessions: Attorney general President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) The background: Trump awarded one of his earliest Capitol Hill supporters with the nation's top law enforcement job. Sessions \u2014\u00a0a hard-line anti-immigration politician\u00a0\u2014 has been in the Senate for two decades, after a stint as\u00a0a U.S. attorney for Alabama. Why his confirmation could blow up: There's precedent . In 1986, Ronald Reagan's administration nominated Sessions to serve as a federal judge, but his nomination ran into trouble when former colleagues accused Sessions of saying racially insensitive things, such as warning a black colleague to be careful about what he said \"to white folks.\" \"I am not a racist,\" Session declared at the time . But the damage was done: The Republican-controlled Senate panel voted 10 to 8 to block his nomination. At the time, Sessions was only the second nominee in 50 years \u00a0the Senate denied for a federal judgeship. Here, too, a nominee's Achilles' heel threatens to make\u00a0Trump himself more vulnerable; this time, it's criticism\u00a0that the president-elect has ties to or is at least\u00a0agreeable to the alt-right community. Whom to watch: No Republican on the panel that will hold hearings on Sessions's nomination has expressed concern about Sessions (senatorial courtesy tends to come into play in these sorts of situations.) And if all Republicans hold together, a unified Democratic caucus wouldn't be\u00a0able to stop Sessions. But as Sessions learned all too well 30 years ago, events can change suddenly. Keep an eye on Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for\u00a0indication of any potential Republican mood swings. Sessions appears to understand how quickly things can turn. Politico reports he's trying to do damage control from that hearing 30 years ago: \"[T]he senator, in a lengthy nominee questionnaire delivered this month, practically depicts himself as a civil rights hero.\" Steven Mnuchin: Treasury secretary Banker Steven Mnuchin is the next potential Treasury Secretary in Donald Trump's administration. Here's what you need to know about him. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) The background: Like Trump, the former Goldman Sachs executive and finance director of Trump's campaign has no former experience in government. Since leaving Wall Street, Mnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) has been a big-money backer of some Hollywood extravaganzas, including \"Suicide Squad.\" Why his confirmation hearing could blow up: Wall Street. Specifically, his investment in a bank, then called IndyMac, that foreclosed on about 36,000 California homeowners during the housing crisis (despite receiving about $900 million in federal bailout money) and that\u00a0 has been accused of discrimination . If Democrats want to make an example out of anyone in Trump's wealthy, Wall Street-heavy Cabinet lineup , Mnuchin's nomination could be the best option. After all, his job would be to manage the nation's finances in part by overseeing Wall Street. Who to watch: So far, the Republicans we've heard talk about Mnuchin \u2014 notably, Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will review his nomination \u2014 have praised him. But if Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) have their way, the GOP\u00a0will be put on defense about Mnuchin's background. They have\u00a0 set up a website encouraging California residents to \"share their personal stories of being impacted by the 'Foreclosure King\u2019 Steve Mnuchin,\" and it's a safe bet that Democrats will be reading some of those stories at Mnuchin's hearing. Interestingly, the Republican Party's official biography for Mnuchin \u2014 which noted his Tinseltown success, listing highlights of the successful action-heavy\u00a0lineup from\u00a0\"RatPac-Dune Entertainment\" \u2014 left out \u00a0most of his Wall Street ties, including any mention of his top perch at Goldman Sachs. James Mattis: Defense secretary Retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) The background: In the Marines, retired Gen.\u00a0James Mattis is a legend. His gritty, no-nonsense, hard-charging style earned him the battlefield nickname \"Mad Dog,\" a high compliment in Marine culture and one that Trump apparently appreciates. General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 How the confirmation hearing could blow up: Well, it's not even legal right now for Mattis to take the job. Congress has a 65-year-old law that defense secretaries can't have been on active duty in the previous seven years, a somewhat symbolic reminder from our government that the military serves to help civilians. Mattis retired in 2013. That means both chambers of Congress must pass a law allowing a waiver for Mattis, then he has to be confirmed by the Senate. Whom to watch: So far, Mattis has received praise from key GOP Senate leaders, including John McCain (Ariz.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, which will review Mattis's nomination. But there is scattered opposition. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)\u00a0 said she'd oppose a waiver for Mattis on principle: \"Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.\" For now, it seems as if Gillibrand is in the minority on the Hill (in more ways than one.) But relying on Congress for any special favor\u00a0is far from a fool-proof plan. 1 of 31 ",

(Photo: Matt Kryger, The Indianapolis Star) INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A former Indiana University student is suing the university , saying it gave preferential treatment to a female student who accused him of rape and makes \"numerous mandates to make it more difficult for males accused of sexual misconduct to defend themselves.\" Aaron Farrer, 21, of Lafayette, Ind., was accused of rape in September 2015 after a female student said Farrer took advantage of her drunken state. The woman showed police a text message she received from Farrer the next day apologizing for the incident. Farrer told police the woman consented to sex\u00a0and initiated the act. That November, Farrer was expelled from school in Bloomington, Ind., according to court documents. The case against him was dismissed in September 2016 in Monroe Superior Court because of insufficient evidence. Tampa Bay QB Winston, rape accuser settle civil lawsuit This week, Farrer filed the federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court here, saying he was defamed and was a victim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. He also alleges his constitutional rights were violated. \"IU engaged in a gender-biased investigation of Farrer, which culminated in Farrer\u2019s unlawful expulsion from IU,\" his complaint states, adding that he was not afforded due process. \u201cIU (Indiana University) engaged in a gender-biased investigation of Farrer, which culminated in Farrer\u2019s unlawful expulsion from IU.\u201d Lawsuit from Aaron Farrer, Lafayette, Ind. Named defendants include his accuser, Indiana University, the school's assistant director, associate dean of students, deputy Title IX director, Title IX deputy investigator and other school staff. The Indianapolis Star and USA TODAY\u00a0typically do\u00a0not name people who are or may have been victims of sexual assault. Farrer and his accuser were not immediately available for comment. The 76-page complaint states that the defendants violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \"by creating a gender biased, hostile environment against males, like Farrer, based in part on IU\u2019s pattern and practice of disciplining male students who accept physical contact initiated by female students\u00a0but failing to discipline female students who engage in the same conduct.\" He alleges that male students are not provided due process in sexual-assault investigations. He said the rape allegations against him were taken as truth from the outset, adding that the university didn't want to embarrass the accuser or receive negative publicity. \u201cWhile Indiana University cannot comment on pending litigation or, due to federal privacy laws, specific student disciplinary cases, the university\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy provides for a fair, impartial and robust investigation and adjudication process when responding to reports of alleged sexual assault,\" said Margie Smith-Simmons, a spokeswoman for the school. \"Indiana University is strongly committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all members of its community\u00a0and assuring that its processes are fair and afford due process protections,\u201d she said. Suspended USC football player faces trial on rape charges Farrer's case is similar to one filed in April 2015, when a male student at University of California, San Diego, filed suit against the school for expelling him after a female student accused him of rape. The student, Francisco Sousa, was not allowed to provide text messages and other evidence that he said proved his innocence, according to that complaint. His expulsion since has\u00a0been reversed. Sexual-assault investigations are a growing issue on many college campuses and several have taken unorthodox steps to prevent sexual assault from occurring. Q&A with Lindsay Chambers of MTV's 'Sweet/Vicious,' a show tackling campus rape culture In August, Stanford University announced a ban on hard liquor from undergraduate parties on campus. The announcement followed a high-profile sexual assault case against former student Brock Turner, who was convicted on three felony counts of sexual assault and sentenced in June to six months in jail. Most sexual assaults \u2014 an estimated 63% \u2014 are never reported to the police, according to a 2012 report from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. A review of research finds that the prevalence of false reporting is between 2% and 10%, according to the study. Farrer is demanding a jury trial. He seeks damages in excess of $75,000 and an order requiring Indiana University to reinstate Farrer as a student and expunge his university files of all information related to his interactions with his accuser.

Daily Record 5:43 p.m. EST December 26, 2016 Christmas tree (Photo: Chagin, Getty Images/iStockphoto) YORK, Pa. \u2014 A woman allegedly picked up a Christmas tree and threw it at another woman during a Christmas Day fight in Red Lion, according to police. Karen Elaine Harrelson, 52, of the first block of First Avenue, Red Lion, faces two counts of simple assault and one count of terroristic threats. Pennsylvania State Police were called to Harrelson's home at 3:03 p.m. on Sunday for a domestic disturbance. Once there, a trooper met Harrelson, who told him there had been a fight at the home involving family members, court documents state. The trooper smelled alcohol coming from Harrelson's breath and noticed that she was slurring her words and could not articulate clearly while speaking, documents state. Inside the Kardashian family Christmas The trooper then spoke with Harrelson's daughter, Kristin Nichole Atkins, who said she was in contact with the victim, Kayla Renee Still. The trooper then asked Atkins to have Still return to the home. \"Atkins further related Harrelson has a known history of violence and when Harrelson says she is going to do something she follows through with it,\" documents state. According to online court dockets, Harrelson pleaded guilty to simple assault in 2013, stemming from an arrest earlier that year in West Manchester Township. Still returned to the home about 4 p.m. and told police that earlier\u00a0that day, she told Harrelson not to light a cigarette inside the house because her cousin was seven\u00a0months pregnant. Little Royals have a sweet Christmas Harrelson grew enraged when Still insisted she go outside with the cigarette, calling her names and threatening to \"whoop her (back side),\" documents state.\u00a0\"Still continued (saying) Harrelson then picked up her grandmother's Christmas tree and approached her in an aggressive manner and threw the tree at her and that's when they fell onto the couch.\" No details were available on the size or nature of the tree. Once on the couch, Harrelson grabbed Still's hair and began pulling\u00a0it, not letting go, documents state. Still then punched Harrelson in the face twice to get her to let go. Another person, Daniel Jesus Colcazo, tried to restrain Harrelson so that Still could escape. Police did not say if, or how, Harrelson, Still and Colcazo are related. Harrelson, who posted $15,000 bail, could not be reached for comment.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, shown at a May conference in Japan, will meet again at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday. (Photo: Stephane De Sakutin, AFP/Getty Images) More than 75 years later, remembrance and reconciliation are the themes as the Japanese prime minister visits\u00a0Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, the first formal trip\u00a0by a Japanese leader to the site where the world changed forever. Both Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Obama will speak at the commemoration of the\u00a01941 Japanese air attack that drew the United States into the Second World War. Abe\u00a0landed at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for the historic visit on Monday. Obama and Abe\u00a0will also meet privately on the state of the U.S.-Japan alliance, one that could undergo stark changes after Donald Trump becomes president next month. \"The two leaders' visit will showcase the power of reconciliation that has turned former adversaries into the closest of allies,\" the White House said in announcing the visit earlier this month. Obama and Abe plan to make remarks at the memorial built atop the bombed-out hull\u00a0of the USS Arizona, which sank to the bottom of the harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. The attack, on what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called \"a date which will live in infamy,\" killed more than 2,400 Americans. Abe is not expected apologize for the Pearl Harbor attack\u00a0but is likely to express sympathy for the victims.

During the presidential campaign, Trump talked about changing trade policies worldwide and requiring\u00a0Japan and other allies to pay more for security assistance. Abe met with the president-elect face-to-face last month at Trump Tower. The Obama-Abe meeting in Hawaii is designed \"to review our joint efforts over the past four years to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance, including our close cooperation on a number of security, economic, and global challenges,\" said the White House statement. George H.W. Bush: 75 years after Pearl Harbor, strength renewed In many ways, Abe's visit reciprocates Obama's trip earlier this year to Hiroshima, site of the first U.S. atomic attack on Japan that ended the war in 1945. Trump weighed in on that May trip, tweeting at the time: \"Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost.\" Japanese public opinion in the past has opposed the\u00a0prospect\u00a0of a formal government visit to Pearl Harbor. To many in Japan, the air attack of 1941 was a response to a U.S.-led oil embargo. But Abe's plans for this year have won good reviews in the national media. Technically, Abe will not be the first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor. In 1951, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida went to the site during a stopover in Hawaii following an international conference in San Francisco. Abe is the first to make an official trip\u00a0to Pearl Harbor, and to speak publicly about what happened there. During a joint address to the U.S. Congress in 2015, Abe noted that he had paid a visit to the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C. \"History is harsh \u2014 what is done cannot be undone,\" Abe said at the time. \"I offer with profound respect my eternal condolences to the souls of all American people that were lost during World War II.\" 77 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 121 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hnPBOr NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Here's what they're thinking so far Donald Trump and Paul Ryan Alex Brandon / Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15%. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says 20% is more realistic. President-elect Donald Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15%. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says 20% is more realistic. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press) Associated Press Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the nation's tax system, a heavy political lift that could ultimately affect families at every income level and businesses of every size. Their goal is to simplify a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants, and corporations that can easily shift profits \u2014 and jobs \u2014 overseas. It won't be easy. The last time it was done was 30 years ago. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u00a0(R-Ky.)\u00a0and Speaker Paul Ryan \u00a0(R-Wis.)\u00a0have vowed to pass a tax package in 2017 that would not add to the budget deficit. The Washington term for that is \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d It means that for every tax cut there has to be a tax increase, creating winners and losers. Lawmakers would get some leeway if nonpartisan congressional analysts project that a tax cut would increase economic growth, raising revenue without increasing taxes. Passing a massive tax package will require some politically tough votes. Some key Republican senators want to share the political risk with Democrats . They argue that a tax overhaul must be bipartisan to be fully embraced by the public. They cite President Obama 's health law \u2014 the Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010 without any Republican votes \u2014 as a major policy initiative that remains divisive. Obamacare without ruining the lives of millions of their own constituents. In the few short weeks since the GOP ... If there weren\u2019t so much at stake, one would be amused at the spectacle of Republican politicians writhing as they try to\u00a0make good on their ideological promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare without ruining the lives of millions of their own constituents. In the few short weeks since the GOP ... (Michael Hiltzik) Congressional Democrats say they are eager to have a say in overhauling the tax code. But McConnell, who faulted Democrats for acting unilaterally on healthcare, is laying the groundwork to pass a purely partisan bill. Both McConnell and Ryan said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill. McConnell says he wants the Senate to tackle a tax plan in the spring, after Congress repeals Obama's health law. House Republicans are more eager to get started, but they haven't set a timeline. Some things to know about Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code: The House plan House Republicans have released the outline of a tax plan that would lower the top individual income tax rate to 33% from 39.6%\u00a0and reduce the number of tax brackets to three from seven. The gist of the plan is to lower tax rates for just about everyone, and to make up the lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits. The plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children. The standard deduction would be increased, giving taxpayers less incentive to itemize their deductions. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says the plan would reduce revenue\u00a0by $3 trillion over the first decade, with most of the savings going to the highest-income households.\u00a0That's not revenue neutral. Small-business owners would get a special top tax rate of 25%. Investment income would be taxed like wages, but investors would have to pay taxes on only half of this income. The Senate plan Trump \u2019s plan President-elect Donald Trump's plan has fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. The Tax Policy Center says Trump's plan would reduce revenue\u00a0by $9.5 trillion over the first decade, with most of the tax benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers. Trump has disputed the analysis. Like the House plan, Trump\u2019s plan\u00a0would reduce the top income tax rate for individuals to 33%,\u00a0reduce the number of tax brackets to three and increase the standard deduction. Trump has embraced two ideas championed by Obama but repeatedly rejected by Republicans over the last eight years:\u00a0His plan would cap itemized deductions for married couples making more than $200,000 a year. And it would tax carried interest, which are fees charged by investment fund managers, as regular income instead of as capital gains. Corporate taxes The top corporate income tax rate in the U.S. is 35%, the highest in the industrialized world. However, the tax is riddled with so many exemptions, deductions and credits that most corporations pay much less. Both Trump and House Republicans want to lower the rate, and pay for it by scaling back tax breaks. Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15%. Ryan says 20% is more realistic, to avoid increasing the budget deficit. Border adjustment tax This is one of the most controversial parts of the House Republicans' tax plan. It is also key to making it work. Under current law, the United States taxes the profits of U.S.-based companies\u00a0even if the money is made overseas. However, taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company either reinvests the profits in the U.S. or distributes them to shareholders. Critics say the system encourages U.S.-based corporations to invest profits overseas or, more dramatically, to shift operations and jobs abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. House Republicans want to scrap America's worldwide tax system and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm's products are consumed\u00a0rather than where they are produced. Under the system, American companies that produce and sell their products in the U.S. would pay the new 20% corporate tax rate on profits from these sales. However, if a company exports a product abroad, the profits from that sale would not be taxed by the U.S. There's more: Foreign companies that import goods to the U.S. would have to pay the tax, increasing the cost of imports. Exporters love the idea. But importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say it could lead to steep price increases on consumer goods. The lobbying has already begun.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss George Michael \u00a0is dead at 53; South Asian immigrants \u00a0take\u00a0a gamble and lose; Christmas dinner at Midnight Mission ; and the pressure is on for\u00a0 D.A.

Rubin, a pioneering astronomer who helped find powerful evidence of dark matter died Dec. 25, 2016. She was 88. 0 Shares Vera Rubin, a pioneering astronomer who helped find powerful evidence of dark matter, has died, her son said Monday. She was 88. Allan Rubin, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University, said his mother died Sunday night of natural causes. He said the Philadelphia native had been living in the Princeton area. Vera Rubin found that galaxies don't quite rotate the way they were predicted, and that lent support to the theory that some other force was at work, namely dark matter. Dark matter, which hasn't been directly observed, makes up 27 percent of universe \u2014 as opposed to 5 percent of the universe being normal matter. Scientists better understand what dark matter isn't rather than what it is. Rubin's scientific achievements earned her numerous awards and honors, including a National Medal of Science presented by President Bill Clinton in 1993 \"for her pioneering research programs in observational cosmology.\" She also became the second female astronomer to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences. \"It goes without saying that, as a woman scientist, Vera Rubin had to overcome a number of barriers along the way,\" California Institute of Technology physicist Sean Carroll tweeted Monday. Rubin's interest in astronomy began as a young girl and grew with the involvement of her father, Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer who helped her build a telescope and took her to meetings of amateur astronomers. Although Rubin said her parents were extremely supportive of her career choice, she said in a 1995 interview with the American Institute of Physics that her father had suggested she become a mathematician, concerned that it would be difficult for her to make a living as an astronomer. She was the only astronomy major to graduate from Vassar College in 1948. When she sought to enroll as a graduate student at Princeton, she learned women were not allowed in the university's graduate astronomy program, so she instead earned her master's degree from Cornell University. Rubin earned her doctorate from Georgetown University, where she later worked as a faculty member for several years before working at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, a nonprofit scientific research center. During her career, Rubin examined more than 200 galaxies. \"Vera Rubin was a national treasure as an accomplished astronomer and a wonderful role model for young scientists,\" said Matthew Scott, president of the Carnegie Institution. \"We are very saddened by this loss.\" 0 Shares ",

Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60 Hotel guests in desirable destinations like Miami are increasingly facing mandatory resort fees that don't show up in the room rate. (Photo: photosvit, Getty Images/iStockphoto) If the consumer-unfriendly ticketing restrictions quietly added by the three major domestic airlines this year don't win the Worst New Travel Rules of 2016 award, they're definitely strong contenders. This spring, you might recall, American, Delta and United changed the way they price multicity tickets online, displaying dramatically higher fares than they used to. Airlines claim they were just closing a little loophole, but advocates cried foul. You can't leave your home without encountering a stupid travel rule these days. Fixes are a little harder. But as we head into 2017, there are a few possibilities. Here are the most absurd rules of the year \u2014 and their chances of being repealed. Wacky multicity ticket restrictions. Odds of dying in 2017: 0%. Airlines say their move to raise ticket prices, made virtually at the same time, is nothing more than a routine system change dictated by a competitive marketplace. There's no law against raising ticket prices, and since the government didn't take them to task for collusive behavior, the increases have stuck. Turns out there may be a way to reopen that loophole and save money. A new travel start-up called SQYGL (sqygl.com) promises a way to beat the system. \"We're effectively bypassing the airlines systems and still allow travelers to book \u2014 in seconds, not hours \u2014 complex multicity itineraries,\" says Ron Ben-Zeev, SQYGL's founder. The service, which is still being tested, launches in early 2017. Resort fees. Odds of dying in 2017: 20% Airlines have their funny pricing rules, hotels have theirs. They're called resort fees, and they're mandatory charges added after you get a price quote for your room. Tricky, isn't it? Since the beginning of this year, resort fees have surged 9% to an average of $19.74 per night at the hotels charging them. The markets with the biggest increases: Panama City, Fla. (24%), the Florida Keys (22%), followed by San Diego., (21%) and Miami (20%). \"Travelers are often blindsided by a mandatory fee they are forced to pay when they show up at their hotel,\" says Randy Greencorn, publisher of the site Resortfeechecker.com. \"Hotels are generally unwilling to waive the fee, leaving little recourse for consumers.\" The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has signaled that it's about to change its disclosure requirements for resort fees, which would effectively kill these dishonest charges. (Hotels would be required to display the total price at the beginning of the booking process.) Of course, that assumes there will be an FTC in 2017. Non-cancellable rooms. Odds of dying in 2017: 0%. Hotels have always had restrictions on room cancellations, but lately those restrictions have become even more restrictive. For example, if you need to make a change close to your arrival date, you can't do so without losing your room. In extreme cases, your reservation is completely non-refundable. These prepaid rooms offer a modest discount in exchange for giving up the ability to cancel and receive a refund. Result: more money for hotels, while guests sometimes walk away with nothing. \"One way around this rule is to call the hotel and ask to have your reservation moved further into the future, rather than canceling,\" says William Beckler, co-founder of the hotel site AllTheRooms.com. \"Then, later on, call again and try to cancel, which is less likely to be blocked since you're outside of that no-cancellation window.\" The strategy doesn't always work, but it's worth a try. Antique, outrageous protectionist laws. Odds of dying in 2017: 5%. Cabotage laws were created more than a century ago to protect American shipping interests. These archaic rules prevent foreign carriers from offering domestic service and foreign-flagged vessels from making more than one domestic stop before heading out to sea. \"Today, nearly every cruise ship is operated under a foreign flag,\" explains Tanner Callais, founder of the cruise website Cruzely.com. \"That means they can\u2019t pick you up in say, New York, and let you leave the ship permanently in Miami.\" With ostensibly pro-business Republicans in control of Congress and the executive branch, it's possible that cabotage could go buh-bye, if not next year, then soon. These obsolete laws don't help consumers, and removing them would significantly increase competition. Of course the thing that really needs to go away in 2017 isn't an old law or a new policy (although that would be nice), but rather the travel industry's outdated and often consumer-unfriendly loyalty programs. David Cumpston is fed up with ridiculous points schemes. He just tried to redeem his frequent-flier miles for a \"free\" British Airways ticket and had to pay an additional $600 in taxes and fees. Then the airline asked for another $95 for a seat reservation. So much for \"free.\" \"There\u2019s no common-sense reason for that,\" says Cumpston, who works for a marketing agency in San Francisco. Then again, there's no common-sense reason for any of these rules. They're just there because no has said \"enough.\" Maybe it's time for travelers to say it. How to get stupid rules reversed Complain. Companies listen when you speak up, and if they believe enough customers might take their business elsewhere, they'll change their unfriendly policies. Tip: Put your grievance in writing and make sure you receive a written response. If you don't, forward it to an executive to ensure it's viewed promptly. Let the government know you're unhappy. In travel, two agencies are responsible for the bulk of regulations: the Department of Transportation and the Federal Trade Commission. You can complain to both online, and in writing. Tip: If you want to have a real voice, be on the lookout for proposed rulemakings, where public comments are invited. They'll be taken into account when regulators make a final rule. Vote with your wallet. The most persuasive way to effect change is to stop doing business with a company. That's difficult with an airline, since we're down to just a few, but far easier with hotels. When there's a resort fee on your bill, tell them you're taking your business elsewhere and never coming back. Then watch what happens to the fee. 14368 CONNECT TWEET 81 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hlEHsR NEVER MISS OUT Travel Make your next trip unforgettable.

    "text": "Colombia Probe Finds Human Error, Lack of Fuel in Air Crash By alba tobella and cesar garcia, associated press BOGOTA, Colombia \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 6:44 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Pro Soccer Players Among 71 Killed in Colombian Plane Crash 0 Shares Email A series of human errors caused an airliner to run out of fuel and crash in Colombia last month, killing 71 people including most of a Brazilian soccer team, aviation authorities said on Monday. Colombia's Civil Aeronautics agency concluded in its investigation that the plan for the flight operated by Bolivia-based charter company LaMia did not meet international standards. Among the errors made were the decisions to let the plane take off without enough fuel to make the flight safely and then to not stop midway to refuel. The pilot also did not report the plane's emergency until it was too late, it said. Neither the company nor Bolivian authorities should have allowed the plane to take off with the flight plan submitted, said Freddy Bonilla, air safety secretary for Colombia's aviation authority. He said the agency's preliminary conclusions were based on the plane's black boxes and other evidence. Experts had earlier suggested that fuel exhaustion was a likely cause of the Nov. 28 crash that wiped out all but a few members of the Chapocoense soccer team, as well as team officials and journalists accompanying them to a championship playoff match in Medellin, Colombia. The BAE 146 Avro RJ85 has a maximum range was 2,965 kilometers (1,600 nautical miles) \u2014 just under the distance between Medellin and Santa Cruz, Bolivia , where the plane had taken off at almost full capacity. The plane was in the air for about 4 hours and 20 minutes when air traffic controllers in Medellin put it into a holding pattern because another flight had reported a suspected fuel leak and was given priority. Investigators found that crew members of the LaMia flight were aware of the lack of fuel but waited too long to report the emergency. Bonilla said that during the flight the pilot and co-pilot are heard on \"various occasions\" talking about stopping in Leticia \u2014 a city near the borders separating Brazil, Peru and Colombia \u2014 to refuel but decided not to do so. When the plane entered Colombian airspace it was flying into a wind, which caused more fuel to be consumed. And when the pilot asked for priority to land in Medellin, six minutes before crashing, the plane had already spent two minutes with a motor shut off, the investigation concluded. All the motors shut down minutes later. In a recording of a radio message from the pilot, he can be heard repeatedly requesting permission to land due to a lack of fuel and a \"total electric failure.\" A surviving flight attendant and a pilot flying nearby also overheard the frantic pleas from the doomed airliner. In addition, there was no explosion upon impact, pointing to a scarcity of fuel. Investigators in Colombia concluded that the plane did not have the fuel reserves required by international standards for such a flight. They said there was no evidence of sabotage or mechanical failure. Authorities also detected an excess of baggage, but did not relate it to the accident, and, according to its plan, the flight was expected to reach 30,000 feet, an altitude the plane was not certified for. Details of the complete report by Colombia's aviation agency will be released in April 2017. Bolivia, Brazil and the United Kingdom contributed to it. Bolivia's government has already blamed the airline and its pilot for the accident. 0 Shares ",

Gerald Herbert/AP hide caption toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP Mourners raise their fists during a night rally in honor of Alton Sterling outside the Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge, La., on July 11. Sterling was one of several men killed in police shootings this year. Gerald Herbert/AP Deadly encounters between police and civilians often made 2016 a year full of palpable tension. Across the country, demonstrators took to the streets to protest police shootings, while at the same time officers in a number of states were targeted and killed by gunmen. Both situations have prompted law enforcement to examine use-of-force policies. Video Of Baton Rouge Man's Fatal Shooting By Police Sparks Protests, FBI Inquiry Early next year, the FBI will take the first steps in developing a national database to track police shootings. Currently, the country's 18,000 police departments report crime information voluntarily, so media outlets and academics such as Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University, work to create their own comprehensive list of police shootings. \"My best estimate is that about 1,000 times a year an on-duty police officer shoots and kills someone,\" he says. Stinson says prosecutors consider most of those cases legally justified and few officers face charges. Even so, several police shootings this year drew massive protests and widespread attention. In July, Baton Rouge was a hotbed of protests and mourning after police shot and killed 37-year-old Alton Sterling who was selling CDs outside of a storefront. A bystander's graphic video of his death shows two white officers pinning Sterling to the ground. (Warning: The video shows an intense scene that ends with gunfire.) YouTube Protests flared after both shootings. Later after a peaceful march in Dallas, a sniper targeting police killed five officers and wounded several others before he was killed. During an interview on Fox News, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick talked about eroding respect for law enforcement. Article continues after sponsorship Snipers Kill 5 Police Officers, Wound Several Others At Dallas Protest \"And I do blame people on social media with their hatred towards police,\" he said. \"I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 last night's was peaceful, but others have not been, and we've heard the 'Pigs in a blanket.' This has to stop.\" Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, says what happened in Dallas was a tragedy. \"I think people are smart enough to be able to understand that both things are tragic and that we can't be deterred from fighting for black lives,\" Cullors says. Motive In Baton Rouge Police Slayings Still Unclear, Investigators Say There would be more killings \u2014 three officers ambushed in Baton Rouge \u2014 but later in September, police shot and killed men in Tulsa, Okla. , and Charlotte, N.C., putting the spotlight back on police use of force and setting off days of protests. The Justice Department's Civil Rights division is investigating the Tulsa shooting. Vanita Gupta, head of the division, says she's also aware that, as the nation grapples with police shootings, many in law enforcement are taking a harder look at what needs to change. After Police Killing Of Unarmed Man, Tulsa Chief Promises To 'Achieve Justice' \"I have been encouraged by the fact that there is a lot of conversation in the field about de-escalation training and implicit bias and procedural justice,\" she says. Chuck Wexler with the Police Executive Research Forum says he's working with police to develop better use-of-force policies and practices. The Forum's 30 guiding principles include calling for other officers to intervene and prevent their colleagues from using excessive force. After Fatal Police Shooting, Protest Erupts In Charlotte, N.C. \"How many cases would have been prevented when someone is obviously getting upset and losing their cool, if another officer had said, 'Hey, step back, let me take over?' That's what you need \u2014 cool heads to prevail in some of these situations.\" Changes like those could begin to build trust and possibly make deadly police-civilian encounters less likely. ",

Sixteen more people have been hit by gunfire since Monday morning, reports the Chicago Tribune . Among them: a 14-year-old girl listed in critical condition. More than three dozen guns were seized by investigators in connection with the shootings, which occurred between Friday evening and in early Monday\u2019s pre-dawn hours. The shooting tally includes violence at a family Christmas party on the city\u2019s South Side at which two people were killed and several others wounded.\u00a0 CBS Chicago reports the violence this year far surpasses last year\u2019s total, in which 30 people were shot in Chicago during a holiday weekend that was two days longer than this year\u2019s, because Christmas Eve and Christmas were on Thursday and Friday. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that the majority of shootings and homicides from Friday afternoon through Monday morning were \u201ctargeted attacks by gangs against potential rivals who were at holiday gatherings.\u201d He says 45 guns have been seized since Friday afternoon, which is slightly more than a typical weekend. Violence over the holiday weekend comes during a surge in city violence. More than 700 homicides have been reported this year.

    "text": "Obama Vs Trump: Dispute Erupts Over Who Would Have Won By josh lederman, associated press HONOLULU \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 5:48 PM ET 0 Shares Star Getty Images President Barack Obama, left, speaks following a National Security Council meeting on the Islamic State at the Department of Treasury in Washington, June 14, 2016. Donald Trump addresses supporters, June 13, 2016. 0 Shares In an alternate universe in which President Barack Obama ran for a third term against Donald Trump, who would have won? No surprise: The president and the president-elect disagree. A fresh dispute erupted Monday between Obama and his successor, spurred by Obama's hypothetical musings that had he run again, he would have been victorious. Interviewed for a podcast, Obama suggested he still holds enough sway over the coalition of voters that elected him twice to get them to vote for him once again. \"I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama told his former White House adviser, David Axelrod, in a podcast released Monday. Trump, naturally, disagreed. He took to his preferred medium \u2014 Twitter \u2014 to offer his reaction. \"President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY!\" Trump wrote. He suggested Obama's record would have prevented him from securing a victory, citing jobs that have left the U.S., troubles with Obama's Affordable Care Act and the ongoing threat posed by the Islamic State group as examples. The White House declined to comment on Trump's tweet. In the podcast, Obama didn't address whether he would have been able to surmount the obstacle that the Electoral College posed for Hillary Clinton . The Democrat failed to secure a majority of electoral votes despite winning the popular vote by millions. Yet Obama said he's spoken to people across the U.S. who have told him the direction he pursued \"is the right one,\" a sentiment he said extends even to some people \"who disagreed with me.\" He suggested Democrats' failure in the election may have stemmed from the prevailing assumption that Clinton's victory was all but assured. \"If you think you're winning, then you have a tendency \u2014 just like in sports \u2014 maybe to play it safer,\" Obama said. Though Obama railed against Trump during the campaign, he's largely held his tongue since the Republican's Election Day victory, in large part to ensure a smooth transition of power. He and Trump have spoken regularly by phone, and Trump has praised his predecessor for the graciousness with which he's handled the process. But in recent days, points of tension between their two teams have started to emerge, driven by Trump's picks of Cabinet nominees who have vowed to dismantle much of what Obama has accomplished. The Obama administration has also been dismayed by requests from Trump's team for information they fear could be used to try to identify and then eliminate bureaucrats who have worked on Obama priorities like climate change and women's rights overseas. Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, was prohibited by the Constitution's 22nd Amendment from running for a third term. But Obama has said even if there weren't term limits for presidents, he believes it's important for the country to have a change of leadership after eight years. He's also suggested his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, would have had little patience for a third term in the White House. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP 0 Shares ",

Donald Trump, center, along with his daughter Ivanka Trump, right, and attorney David Friedman, left, exit the Federal Building following their 2010 appearance in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, N.J. (Bradley C. Bower / Bloomberg) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter If President-elect Donald Trump wanted to show he planned to obliterate President Barack Obama 's approach to Israel, he might have found his man to deliver that message in David Friedman, his pick for U.S. ambassador. The bankruptcy lawyer and son of an Orthodox rabbi is everything Obama is not: a fervent supporter of Israeli settlements , opponent of Palestinian statehood and unrelenting defender of Israel's government. So far to the right is Friedman that many Israel supporters worry he could push Israel's hawkish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be more extreme, scuttling prospects for peace with Palestinians in the process. The heated debate over Friedman's selection is playing out just as fresh tensions erupt between the U.S. and Israel. In a stunning decision Friday, the Obama administration moved to allow the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlements as illegal. The move to abstain, rather than veto, defied years of U.S. tradition of shielding Israel from such resolutions, and elicited condemnation from Israel, lawmakers of both parties, and especially Trump. \"Things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" when he's sworn in, Trump vowed on Twitter. Presidents of both parties have long called for a two-state solution that envisions eventual Palestinian statehood, and Netanyahu says he agrees. Friedman, who still must be confirmed by the Senate, does not. He's called the two-state solution a mere \"narrative\" that must end. Under Obama, the U.S. has worked closely with J Street, an Israel advocacy group sharply critical of Netanyahu. Friedman accuses Obama of \"blatant anti-Semitism\" and calls J Street \"worse than kapos,\" a reference to Jews who helped the Nazis imprison fellow Jews during the Holocaust. For decades, the U.S. has opposed Israeli settlement-building in lands it seized in the 1967 Mideast war. Friedman runs a nonprofit that raises millions of dollars for Beit El, a settlement of religious nationalists near Ramallah. Beit El runs a right-wing news outlet and a yeshiva whose dean has provocatively urged Israeli soldiers to refuse orders to uproot settlers from their homes. So it's unsurprising that Friedman's nomination has already sharpened a growing balkanization of American Jews, between those who want the U.S. to push Israel toward peace and those who believe Obama's approach abandoned America's closest Mideast ally. It's a debate playing out even at Temple Hillel, near the Long Island-Queens border, where Friedman's father was rabbi for almost half a century. \"Clearly, David's opinions do not appeal to everybody in the synagogue, and they appeal to others in the synagogue,\" said Ken Fink, the synagogue's president and longtime congregant. \"But there's a huge amount of pride for the hometown boy.\" ",

In the session, Bana al-Abed and her mother, Fatemah, said it was their hope to return to their city after the war was over and help other Syrians affected by the violence. \"I will be back to help my people,\" Fatemah said in one response. Syrian girl Bana al-Abed hugs her mother Fatemah during an interview in Ankara, Turkey. ADEM ALTAN / AFP - Getty Images The pair took questions exactly one week after their family had been bused out of eastern Aleppo and taken to Ankara, Turkey. They said they were all safe following their evacuation and that Bana was hoping to go back to school. When asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, Bana told one Facebook user she wanted to be a \"teacher, author and peacemaker.\" \"I want to help people around the world,\" she said in another response. Related: Aleppo Twitter Sensation Bana al-Abed Evacuated From Syrian City Fatemah said the war's effect on Syria's children was \"very huge\" and affected children in \"every way.\" One person asked Bana how she found peace before falling asleep when she faced death day and night. \"I read & just got used to it but was afraid,\" she replied. Last Monday NBC News spoke with 26-year-old Fatemah after their escape. Play ",

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images Cybersecurity presents an early challenge for the incoming president, Donald Trump. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images President Obama has promised to take action in response to findings by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked computers at the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic political groups. And one of Donald Trump's first big decisions as president may be whether to continue down the chosen path. State-sponsored hacking is \"arguably one of the biggest threats to the nation,\" says Jay Kaplan, a former analyst at the National Security Agency. State actors are behind numerous recent hacks, including the federal employee records at the Office of Personnel Management , believed to be the work of China. In a recent report on enhancing national cybersecurity , the Obama administration avoided addressing the issue of state-sponsored hacking head-on. But it did recommend steps \u2014 including training 100,000 new \"cybersecurity practitioners\" by 2020 \u2014 to fix vulnerabilities in government and private networks. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections Crowdsourcing offers a path to tackle the challenge, Kaplan says. He is CEO of Synack, which is working with the Pentagon using crowdsourcing \"to uncover security holes across the federal government,\" as he puts it. Right now, the effort is focused on the Defense Department, Kaplan says, but he hopes \"to broaden that scope soon.\" A new administration may bring other new ways of looking at the problems \u2014 or at least that's what Betsy Cooper hopes. She is executive director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley. \"We absolutely believe that this is an opportunity for progress,\" Cooper says, \"that a new administration without ties to past government structures creates the opportunity for resetting the playing field.\" Article continues after sponsorship What Will Trump's Twitter Strategy Be When He Becomes President? One proposal is for a cyber workforce incubator to be set up in Silicon Valley, where tech industry experts and government officials could get together to exchange ideas. They would spend a year or two together and then \"each group would rotate back to their normal jobs,\" Cooper says. The idea is that in that period, the government workers will get \"better exposure to the Silicon Valley culture and way of working,\" Cooper says, while those from the tech industry will better understand \"the importance of government problems and the importance of working on these issues in the public sector.\" Cooper also suggests a public campaign \u2014 like the government has used to get people to buckle their seat belts or to recycle \u2014 to get ordinary Americans aware of the importance of things like using strong passwords and other so-called good cyber hygiene practices. Obama Urges A Boost In IT Spending To Secure Federal Computers It's not just individuals or government systems that need help with cybersecurity issues. \"I think the president should focus on three things: energy, finance and telecom,\" says Melissa Hathaway, president of Hathaway Global Strategies, who has worked on cyber issues in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. Hathaway, who is also a senior adviser on Harvard University's Cyber Security Project , says the IT systems of utilities and banks have already been infected with malware and are vulnerable to hackers, not only from state sponsors, but also criminals: \"If I can bring a utility offline through ransomware or through some other means,\" she says, \"I can cause them to pay to get it restored.\" And she points to recent attacks, in which hackers hijacked Internet-connected devices to bring down online services including Twitter and Spotify. \"It's really important that we stop talking about these problems and start solving them,\" Hathaway says. \"And that's going to require leadership; it's going to require focused attention.\" She says if Trump wants to make America great again, he needs to address cybersecurity quickly.

    "text": "Japan, US Set to Sign Pact to Limit US Base Worker Immunity By mari yamaguchi, associated press TOKYO \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 4:51 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH US to Return Some Land on Okinawa Military Base to Japan 0 Shares Email Japan and the U.S. have agreed in principle on guidelines for limiting immunity from Japanese prosecution for civilian workers at American military bases, following a murder case this year on a southern Japanese island involving a Marine-turned-contractor, officials said Monday. Since July, the governments have been negotiating several points concerning U.S. civilian contractors at American bases who are subject to protection under the countries' Status of Forces Agreement. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told a regular news conference that the two sides have agreed on how to define what constitutes a \"civilian contractor\" at an American base and hope to sign the agreement \"during President Barack Obama's term.\" He did not give further details. The May arrest of the base contractor, accused of raping and murdering a 20-year-old woman, renewed outrage on Okinawa, where resentment has been simmering over the island's heavy U.S. troop presence. That prompted Tokyo and Washington to try to establish a clearer definition of \"civilian base workers.\" In July, the two sides said base contractors, now described vaguely as having a \"civilian component,\" will be classified in more specific terms, to exclude from preferential treatment those without skills and those who are residents of Japan, like the suspect in the April murder case. Kishida said a clear definition of civilian contractors and adequate control of their data would help prevent criminal cases in the future. About 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan under a bilateral security agreement, more than half of them based on Okinawa. In addition, 7,000 Americans employed as civilian contractors were at U.S. military bases in Japan as of March. The Status of Forces Agreement, originally signed in 1960, gives U.S. military personnel and civilians employed at American bases in Japan immunity from Japanese criminal procedures in accidents or crimes while on duty or on base. It also allows the U.S. military to hold suspects on base until formal indictment by Japan. Okinawan authorities say the rule denies them proper access to investigate crimes under Japanese law. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi Find her work at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/mari-yamaguchi 0 Shares ",

Eleven of the 53 people shot between about 4:50 p.m. Friday and about the same time Monday died from their wounds. More than a dozen others were listed in serious or critical condition. The city saw eight multiple-victim shootings, including one\u00a0attack that left two people dead and five others wounded\u00a0and another shooting that left two people dead. Much of the violence happened in areas \"with historical gang\u00a0conflicts on the south and west side of Chicago,\" said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. He also referred to the department's \"strategic subject list,\" which is generated daily from a computerized algorithm and assigns a score from 1 to 500 based on such factors as a person's arrests and the activities of his or her associates. Those people with a score in the upper 200s or higher are considered in danger of being shot or of shooting someone else. Katherine Skiba Valerie Jarrett has played a unique role in the Obama administration. She was both a senior advisor to the president throughout his eight-year administration \u2014 it is extremely rare for White House staffers to stay for the duration \u2014 and a close friend of President Obama and First Lady Michelle... Valerie Jarrett has played a unique role in the Obama administration. She was both a senior advisor to the president throughout his eight-year administration \u2014 it is extremely rare for White House staffers to stay for the duration \u2014 and a close friend of President Obama and First Lady Michelle... (Katherine Skiba) \"Ninety percent of those fatally wounded had gang affiliations, criminal histories and were pre-identified by the department's strategic subject algorithm as being a potential suspect or victim of gun violence,\" Guglielmi said.\u00a0 The gunfire Monday included a man shot in each leg, a man wounded in the hand and a person shot in the head, authorities said. Monday\u2019s gunfire came after two brothers were killed and five other people were wounded while playing dice at a family Christmas party late Sunday. Donald Trump on Saturday announced he was dissolving his controversial foundation, which claimed to raise\u00a0money\u00a0for\u00a0charitable\u00a0causes but\u00a0has been accused of improperly using funds.

President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday announced he was dissolving his controversial foundation, which claimed to raise\u00a0money\u00a0for\u00a0charitable\u00a0causes but\u00a0has been accused of improperly using funds. Trump said he was shutting the foundation \u201cto avoid even the appearance of any conflict\u201d with his... (Tracy Wilkinson) That mass shooting, and the others on Christmas, added to the tolls this year in Chicago, where more than 700 homicides have been recorded and more than 4,000 people have been shot \u2014 a level of violence not seen in Chicago since the late 1990s, according to Chicago Tribune and police data. Last year, 488 people were killed in Chicago. The holiday weekend began with five teenagers shot within feet of one another. At 3:30 p.m. Friday, a 16-year-old boy was shot; a little more than an hour later, four\u00a0teenagers were shot on a nearby block. Their conditions had stabilized, officials said Monday. Guglielmi said most of the shootings were\u00a0targeted attacks by gangs against potential rivals during holiday gatherings. That brought on retaliatory gun violence. In response, police adjusted their assignments as needed and seized 45 guns from areas with a heavy presence of gangs, Guglielmi said. \"While we have promising leads, this unacceptable level of gun violence demonstrates the clear and present need for policymakers to convene in January and give Chicago the gun sentencing tools against repeat offenders so that we can adequately hold people accountable,\" he said.

    "text": "CBS/AP December 26, 2016, 3:04 PM Blizzards, ice storms wreak havoc across northern Plains In several parts of the country snow, ice, and rain are complicating holiday travels. Marlie Hall has more on the winter weather travel. The combination of freezing rain, snow and high winds that forced the shutdown Sunday of vast stretches of highways in the Dakotas continued into Monday, and authorities issued no-travel warnings for much of North Dakota. The National Weather Service in Bismarck, North Dakota, said a blizzard warning would remain in effect for most of the state into Monday afternoon or early evening. Severe whiteout conditions led to the closure of Minot International Airport, and the facility wasn\u2019t expected to reopen until 3 a.m. Tuesday. The airports serving Fargo and Bismarck also listed flight cancellations on their websites. \u201cBetween the ice and snow, and winds howling like crazy, there will be nothing moving\u201d until late afternoon Monday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Gust in Grand Forks, North Dakota. \u201cThen it\u2019s dig-out time.\u201d Gust\u2019s advice to travelers: \u201cStay put.\u201d\u00a0 Winds gusting 40 mph to 50 mph associated with the storm in Minnesota led to delays and cancellations at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The storm also has caused power outages in the Dakotas and Nebraska. The South Dakota Rural Electric Association said more than 12,000 of its customers were without power Monday morning. In Nebraska, winds gusting up to 70 mph were cited for hundreds of power outages in central and eastern portions of the state on Sunday, although by Monday morning utilities reported that power had been restored to most customers.\u00a0 The North Dakota Transportation Department closed most of a 240-mile stretch of Interstate 94 Sunday night, from the Montana border to Jamestown. That stretch remained closed Monday. Portions of U.S. Highways 2, 52 and 281 were also closed because of snow, ice and \u201cnear zero visibility.\u201d Motorists who drive past the roadblocks can be fined up to $250. No-travel advisories were issued for much of North Dakota, including the Williston, Dickinson, Minot, Bismarck, Jamestown, Valley City and Grand Forks areas. Authorities in South Dakota shut down Interstate 90 from the Wyoming border to Chamberlain - a distance of about 260 miles. And the Rapid City Fire Department sent out its special tracked vehicle for the first time this season to help stranded motorists east of Rapid City.\u00a0 The National Weather Service said the storm system will start to weaken on Monday as it moves into Canada. \u201cHeavy snowfall will diminish today, but strong winds will continue (to) create blowing snow and reduced visibilities in the Upper Midwest, the service said. \u00a0\u00a0 On Monday morning, lines were getting long at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport as holiday travelers tried to make it home, CBS Chicago reported . The early morning fog in Chicago, and wind and snow in other destinations, kept some passengers on the ground. Things looked better later in the day -- after dozens of cancellations from overnight fog and from a ripple effect caused by winter storms in other parts of the country. As of 11:40 a.m. Monday morning, Midway was reporting a total of 31 cancellations, with an average delay of less than 15 minutes.

Many states are imposing crippling fines as a way to close budget gaps. Those who can\u2019t pay can end up behind bars. After 24 hours behind bars in College Station, Texas, an unemployed mother of three is minutes away from being released. \u201cI have three children, and I just want to go home and see my babies,\u201d said the woman, who asked CBS News to conceal her identity. Unidentified woman being released from jail CBS News She explained how her inability to pay a simple traffic ticket drove her down a path to jail. \u201cIt just kind of snowballed,\u201d she said. \u201cWith paying my bills, I didn\u2019t have the money to confront this.\u201d Traffic violations, missed payments and failures to appear in court caused her bill to grow to nearly $3,000 dollars in fines, fees and an arrest warrant. But city Judge Ed Spillane had her released immediately. Judge Ed Spillane CBS News \u201cI released her so she could have a chance to work with us on a plan to do community service,\u201d he said. Every week, Spillane releases defendants who are not a danger to society and simply can\u2019t pay the fines. \u201cIt\u2019s complete illegal. You cannot be put in jail due to your economic status or economic inability to pay a fine,\u201d he said. The Justice Department agrees . It sent a letter to every court in the country discouraging the practice by calling it \u201cunlawful.\u201d A Brennan Center study found that at least 15 states have \u201cuser fees\u201d which are \u201cexplicitly intended to raise revenue.\u201d\u00a0 According to Spillane, \u201cThe state of Texas makes a billion dollars a year in state fees.\u201d Spillane said that by releasing defendants who do not have the money, he is simply following Supreme Court directives, and that he\u2019s not advocating for a slap on the wrist. That mother of three got a break, but across the country, others like her are still locked up. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Tim Ireland, AP) One day after news broke of George Michael's death over the Christmas holiday, fans and friends are still reeling. USA TODAY rounds up the latest developments related to the singer. Frank Sinatra's letter surfaces. Crooner Frank Sinatra wasn't one to mince words, and when Michael talked to the Los Angeles Times \u00a0in 1990 about the strain of celebrity status, the Chairman had to respond. Michael said, \"Stardom can make you miserable. After all, everybody wants to be a star. I certainly did, and I worked hard to get it. But I was miserable, and I don't want to feel that way again.\"\u00a0That interview prompted Sinatra to write a response. In it, he addressed Michael directly: \"Come on George, Loosen up. Swing, man, Dust off those gossamer wings and fly yourself to the moon of your choice and be grateful to carry the baggage we've all had to carry since those lean nights of sleeping on buses and helping the driver unload the instruments.\" Frank Sinatra's letter to George Michael pic.twitter.com/LXDpjiXqdD \u2014 Catherine Rampell (@crampell) December 26, 2016 Reports: Boyfriend found Michael.

(Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Megan Crepeau Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Gill brothers spent Christmas night at a family party in East Chatham, shooting dice with their cousins on the front porch of a brick house. The weather was good for December, and the game had been going for a while. Then, at 9:20 p.m., someone in a gray hoodie came through the south alley and opened fire. The gunshots were so loud and so close together that a neighbor across the street thought someone was tapping at his window. When he came out of his house to look, Anthony Marshall saw a porch crowded with screaming people. One man had fallen to the floor. Another was being propped up by a friend. Someone came to the bottom of the stairs and yelled at the people to get back inside. It was so crowded and chaotic that he was surprised more people weren\u2019t hurt, he said. \u201cIt seemed like it was going to be a pretty decent weekend. Christmas, no shooting, then boom,\u201d he said. (Chicago Tribune staff) James Gill, 18, was pronounced dead on the porch of the house in the 8600 block of South Maryland Avenue. His body stayed at the scene covered in a white sheet. His older brother, 21-year-old Roy, went to Advocate Christ Medical Center in critical condition and was pronounced dead there. Five other people were wounded in the shooting, most of them relatives of the Gill brothers, family said. Two were listed in critical condition. About half an hour later, James and Roy\u2019s father called their sister Kim with the news. She drove to the scene without putting on good socks or a winter coat. She called James\u2019 cellphone over and over, until she noticed a police officer carrying it. \u201cWhen I called, he looked down and cut the ringer,\u201d she said. Police then stretched the crime scene tape across Maryland Avenue. It took a few different lengths of tape knotted together to reach the other side. The pieces tangled up in the middle of the roadway like clumps of seaweed. (Mary Schmich) One woman stood next to the tape without her hat or coat or phone. She had left the house in a hurry after the shooting. It was just a family party, she said, trying to explain what happened. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Christmas!\u201d A group of young men walked to the corner. She sized them up as they approached. \u201cLook soft,\u201d she told them. \u201cYou all look hard.\u201d Just before 11 p.m., a detective gathered a few people toward 87th Street and spoke quietly. Roy Gill had died at the hospital, he told them, according to Kim Gill. The brothers\u2019 mother began to scream and collapsed into the man next to her. Her screaming attracted attention. Soon the crowd was 20-strong. They parted to make way for the mother. She couldn\u2019t walk. Three people grabbed her elbows and knees to carry her down the sidewalk. She hadn\u2019t stopped crying. \u201cIt\u2019s unexplainable, this hurt, the absence,\u201d Kim Gill said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how it\u2019s going to feel yet.\u201d She had cooked for the holiday, and had invited James over for pot roast, greens and sweet potatoes. She had bought a bottle of YSL cologne to give him. \u201cHe was a kindhearted person,\u201d she said. Police investigated several sites where people were shot and killed in Chicago on Christmas Day.\u00a0 (Armando Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) James and Roy both held jobs and were attending Malcolm X College to get their GEDs, Kim Gill said. \u201cI talk to my brothers all the time about this. It\u2019s messed up in these streets,\u201d she said. In response, they would tell her: \u201cWe know, sis, we know.\u201d Many of the seven people who were shot had criminal records, and at least one was affiliated with the Gangster Disciples, according to preliminary information from a law enforcement source. The brothers were getting their lives together, Kim Gill said, and they didn\u2019t usually associate with people they didn\u2019t know. \u201cAll the people that got shot and killed was family,\u201d she said. \u201cThat ought to tell you something, right there.\u201d But she didn\u2019t know who stayed at the house, she said, and they were out in a crowd, so it was anyone\u2019s guess who the shooter was aiming for. \u201cThis is Chicago,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a reason.\u201d ",

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) Galvan, whose father and grandfather started the market chain in 1961, said the bad tamales seem to stem from a problem with a 120,000-pound supply of raw corn purchased from a longtime California vendor, though he refused to provide the name. He said Amapola has since switched vendors.\u00a0 \u201cWe know that we lost a lot of customers,\u201d Galvan said. \u201cThe only way to confront this is head-on.\u201d He said the company would refund customers not just the money they spent on masa but on other items they purchased for the meal.\u00a0 \u00a0 The scene in Downey was semi-chaotic Monday morning, as the line for refunds stretched around the building and through the parking lot. Police had been summoned to keep order. By late morning, some said they had been waiting for three hours. A besieged-looking company representative fielded angry questions in Spanish. \u00a0 Many of the people in line were loyal, longtime Amapola customers, and stories were common of people who drove from all over the Southland \u2014 and even bordering states \u2014 to buy the masa. \u00a0 \u201cChristmas was ruined.\u00a0 For Mexican culture, tamales is the main thing,\u201d said Kathy Moreno, 33, of Downey, who bought 35 pounds of masa last week and was frustrated by the disorganized system of dispensing refunds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming here over 25 years.\u201d She said she does expect to return, but \u201cit will take a while to regain trust.\u201d Eloy Alvarez, second from right, of Whittier, shows how the masa went bad after cooking his tamales at home.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) Janessa Sandoval, 28, of Bellflower, said her grandmother usually makes the Christmas tamales, but that at age 79 her health no longer permits it. So Sandoval inherited the job this year, but they turned out runny and terrible, and she spent all Christmas Day wondering if she was to blame. Monday morning, her grandfather turned on the news. \u201cHe said, \u2018Janessa, it\u2019s not your fault,\u2019\u201d she said. Esther Cervantes, 44, of Bell Gardens, said she\u2019s been buying her masa here for years. This time, she said, her 8-year-old daughter threw up. And her nieces, visiting from Corona, left hungry. \u201cMy nieces went home to Corona without eating dinner, and I felt miserable,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything else to offer them. You can\u2019t go out and buy pizza.\u201d Maria Quezada, 63, had bought 80 pounds of masa for a big Christmas Eve bash that doubled as her husband\u2019s 70th birthday party. She cut her losses quickly when she noticed that the first batch \u2014 chili and cheese tamales \u2014 had the consistency of jelly after an hour and 20 minutes. She stashed the masa in the garage and scrambled for a replacement dinner. Luckily, she had a connection for chuck roast, which she turned into barbacoa. \u201cI have 37 nephews and nieces,\u201d Quezada said. \u201cThey all came.\u201d Carlos Galvan, the company vice president, said the markets had temporarily run out of cash to give refunds and would be closed Tuesday. He said the refunds would resume Wednesday.

    "text": "China's 1st aircraft carrier sails into South China Sea Published               December 26, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print China's aircraft carrier Liaoning in an undated photo. \u00a0(AP Photo/Xinhua, Li Tang, File) In a new show of force, China's first aircraft carrier and five other warships passed by Taiwan and sailed into the contested South China Sea on Monday, Taiwan's Defense Ministry reported Monday. VIDEO: CRITICS CONCERNED TRUMP COULD START TRADE WAR WITH CHINA China's Defense Ministry said Saturday that the Liaoning carrier had set off for a routine open-sea exercise in the Western Pacific as part of its annual training. But its entering into the politically sensitive South China Sea follows rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei over the status of the self-ruled island. The ships, led by the Liaoning, sailed past the Pratas Islands, also known as the Dongsha Islands, a Taiwan-controlled atoll in the northern part of the South China Sea, according to Taiwan. ROUNDUP OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SURROUNDING SOUTH CHINA SEA Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has refused to endorse Beijing's concept that Taiwan is a part of China. Beijing claims the self-governing island as its own territory and says failing to endorse the one-China principle would destabilize relations. The U.S. entered the spat earlier this month when President-elect Donald Trump spoke over the phone with Taiwan's leader, a breach of long-standing tradition. The U.S. severed diplomatic ties with the self-governing island in 1979 but has maintained close unofficial relations and a commitment to support its defense. \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" Trump tweeted. The Taiwanese ministry said the Liaoning and warships had on Sunday sailed 90 nautical miles south of Taiwan in the Bashi Channel, a waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines. Tensions have mounted in the South China Sea, where the U.S. and China accuse each other of engaging in a dangerous military buildup. China claims nearly all of the sea and is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons. The U.S.-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative think tank said this month that satellite imagery showed China building large anti-aircraft guns on artificial islands in the contested waters, where China has also laid airstrips, built communications facilities and deployed suspected missiles. China has characterized its moves as defensive in nature and accused U.S. warships of making provocative passes through the region. The Liaoning, commissioned by the Chinese navy in 2012, first sailed to the South China Sea in 2013, when it docked at a navy base near the Chinese holiday resort of Sanya. The vessel at the time was not outfitted with a full aircraft complement. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "advertisement The next gold rush will be intergalactic. In 2009, a collection of astronauts, academics, and aerospace industrialists convened to review NASA's present and future plans for manned space flight. Informally dubbed the \"Augustine Commission,\" the more-stuffily named Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee determined that our ultimate goal ought to be nothing less than \"to chart a path for human expansion into the solar system.\" This computer-generated image provided by Planetary Resources, a group of high-tech tycoons that wants to mine nearby asteroids, shows a conceptual rendering of several small robotic spacecraft mining a near-Earth asteroid. Planetary Resources via AP Considering that Earth's resources are finite and that the well of human desire knows no bottom, a continued future for our species will likely require robust manned spaceflight to leave the planet. But it remains incredibly expensive and logistically complex to see humans break the planet's escape velocity, let alone with any regularity. The ostensibly modern spacecraft of today carry all their fuel with them from the start \u2014 a lot of that fuel is required simply to transport other fuel. It's comically inconvenient. Contemporary spaceflight is impractical by virtue of being unsustainable; it's a pursuit for governmental agencies and rich visionaries. Now an industry with its roots in prehistory is changing that tune, summoning up a modern set of incentives for people to get more intimate with outer space. \"Space mining\" presents itself as a killer technology for interstellar travel and exploration \u2014 the miners are due to inherit the stars as we set their sights beyond our planet to harvest geological resources from the universe itself. Related: Are Humans the Real Ancient Aliens? The minerals we pull out of the the ground \u2014 whether they're worth money or are useful for some process \u2014 have the same composition as the minerals that comprise planets and asteroids. So what good are those minerals doing us out there? A website called Asterank charts the economic feasibility of mining some 600,000 different asteroids for their resources \u2014 one 90-foot-wide platinum asteroid is worth a respectable $50 billion on Earth . The incentive is undeniable. More than turning asteroids into money, however, today's space mining entrepreneurs are intent on turning asteroids into figurative gas stations. The ubiquitous space rocks are commonly home to water ice \u2014 or hydrogen and oxygen, the building blocks of rocket fuel. Deltion's autonomous load haul dump vehicle features a bucket with lift system. Deltion Deltion Innovations is a Canadian company developing hardcore robotic drills and excavation systems to sell to others for use in outer space. Once a mining operation has successfully harvested ice, CEO Dale Boucher says, \"We can break that water ice into its hydrogen and oxygen components by putting a DC voltage into it. This breaks the bonds of water apart, with the hydrogen going to one electrode and the oxygen going to another. This is called electrolysis, and we can use it in space to make fuel.\" In its perfect, refined form to come, space mining stands to radically normalize the notion of interstellar travel. With an easily refilled gas tank, future spacecraft will be free of the usual time and planning restrictions. Suddenly the whole galaxy is the scenic route. Nations are of course paying attention at the political level. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 asserts that no country can claim ownership over an asteroid, planet or other heavenly body. But President Barack Obama signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act in November 2015 specifically to make it legal for American space mining companies to pursue their goals (the Act protects these companies and others from regulatory oversight until October 1, 2023 \u2014 the tone is perhaps, \"Do what you have to do to make this work, then we'll worry about making it safe\"). Related: Is an Alien Megastructure Causing This Star's Strange Behavior? Space mining is the new Wild West \u2014 the resources hidden in asteroids are there for whoever can get there to gather them first, and one of the least-likely countries is leading the way. A prototype of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) robotic capture module system is tested with a mock asteroid boulder in its clutches at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The robotic portion of ARM is targeted for launch in 2021. NASA Luxembourg is a European country smaller than Rhode Island, but don't let its size suggest a shortage of vision. Its government launched a $227 million fund earlier this year to invest in space mining companies that set up operations within the country's borders, sending a strong message that the country intends to play a meaningful role in the changing nature of space travel. The incentive has already attracted American space mining companies Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries . \"If we want to keep building communities and raising families, at some point we outgrow the earth,\" says Planetary Resources president and CEO Chris Lewicki, who previously worked on Mars rovers for NASA. \"We've left the planet before \u2014 it's something we know how to do, something the government has spent money on. The challenge for companies operating in this space is how to do it more cost-effectively, and how to do it for commerce instead of science.\" Related: How Computers Are Learning to Predict the Future Lewicki says space miners will face all the same problems that terrestrial miners know all too well. Where's the best place to drill? How much material is there? The fundamental skills and knowledge are largely unchanged, but the environment will be unlike anything humans have ever mined before. \"We've previously crossed oceans and flown through the air, and today we have the technology to explore space. Asteroids are like rocks on the ocean shore of a new continent.\" As coal miners lose jobs by the tens of thousands , it's clear that the nature of mining (and even the nature of work itself ) is changing dramatically. The mining that humans do on Earth today will be done in space by robots tomorrow, and humanity will be better for it. How else will we carry out the task of expanding into the solar system?

He was also a prolific philanthropist and a supporter of causes that ranged from grappling with HIV/AIDS and protecting vulnerable children to honoring underpaid nurses. For instance, in 2006, during a free concert for the medical workers who had cared for his mother, and he explained his motives this way: \"Society calls what you do a vocation, and that means you don't get paid properly,\" he said, according to the BBC . \"I salute you.\" The pursuit began in 1984, his official online biography notes , when he performed with Band Aid, the musical charity that included everyone from Bono to Boy George.

He was 52. Little Rock police say that 59-year-old William Goodman, who was an acquaintance of Barfield\u2019s, got into a fight with 52-year-old Barfield on Dec. 24th around 5 p.m., shooting and killing Barfield, CBS affiliate KTHV reported. Goodman, 59, of Pine Bluff is being held in the Pulaski County jail on preliminary charges of first-degree murder in connection with Barfield\u2019s death, which has been classified as a homicide. Court records do not list an attorney for Goodman. Barfield was a native of Pine Bluff and led his high school team to a state championship, then played at a community college in Missouri and at Oklahoma City University. He was drafted in the 11th round by the Rangers in 1986. Barfield\u2019s sister, Debra Hudson, tells the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette \u00a0that she is devastated by her brother\u2019s death, saying he was not an aggressive person and that he had a loving personality. \u201cHe had the kindest heart of any human I had ever known,\u201d Hudson said.

Obama also was mildly critical of the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton , saying her campaign didn't do enough to get her message out. The remarks were notable because Obama has been careful since the election to avoid criticizing Trump, or to deliver a post-mortem on Clinton's failed bid. Obama spoke in a wide-ranging interview with former senior advisor and now CNN commentator David Axelrod\u00a0for the Democratic political operative's Axe Files podcast. The interview was released by CNN on Monday. \"You know, I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I -- if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama said. His comments were part of a wider discussion of what he called \"ugly\" sentiments of racism and xenophobia that surfaced during the 2016 campaign. Obama repeated his assertion that Clinton faced a double standard as a woman, which put her at a disadvantage. But he also said a kind of complacency set in that made the Clinton campaign too cautious and thus unable to get its message out sufficiently. \"If you think you're winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\" Obama said. During the interview, Obama also spoke of his family, the strength he'd gotten from wife Michelle and the improbability of his own political career. And the president said the spirit that his candidacy originally inspired, especially among young people, was \"never snuffed out\" despite the last eight years of turmoil. \"The idealism and the dedication stayed with the staff and got us through some really hard times,\" he said. Trump later responded to the remarks on Twitter. UPDATE 2:07 p.m.: This article was updated with Trump's response. This article was originally published\u00a0 at 12:28 p.m. Latest updates ",

Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the air war commander, said in an interview from his headquarters in Qatar. \u201cIt\u2019s improving. It\u2019s still not at the level we\u2019d like it to be.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The air operation is a pivotal component of a military campaign that has cost $12.5 million a day in Iraq and Syria. The effort has destroyed hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces, military vehicles, command centers and fighting positions, and killed more than 50,000 fighters, according to American estimates. Since the air war began in late summer 2014, American and allied aircraft have conducted about 17,000 strikes in both countries. The Islamic State has lost about half of the territory it seized in Iraq and Syria in 2014. But as ISIS loses ground in its physical caliphate, or religious state, the threat of hundreds of foreign fighters returning home and of the expansion of its virtual caliphate through social media is certain to accelerate, American and European officials say. That raises fears of more terrorist attacks in cities outside the Middle East. For instance, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for last week\u2019s truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin even though the links between the group and the main suspect, Anis Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, are not completely clear. After Mr. Amri\u2019s death, the Islamic State released a video of him pledging allegiance to the group. President Obama has vowed to deal the Islamic State crippling blows in Mosul and Raqqa before he leaves office. This month, he ordered 200 more American Special Operations forces to Syria to help local fighters advancing on Raqqa, nearly doubling the Pentagon\u2019s boots on the ground there . Commanders are uncertain, however, about the level of support President-elect Donald J. Trump will maintain for rebel groups in Syria combating the Islamic State. Photo Images of fuel trucks targeted by American airstrikes on Dec. 8. Credit U.S. Military The military march on Raqqa is complicated by the predominant role played by Kurdish militia members, who make up a majority of the 45,000 fighters bearing down on the city. They are the most effective American partner against the Islamic State in Syria, providing logistics, command and control, and fierce fighting prowess. But the Kurdish fighters are viewed by Turkey \u2014 a pivotal American ally \u2014 as a terrorist threat. These lingering diplomatic and military questions leave some congressional leaders voicing skepticism about a swift, decisive attack on the Islamic State capital. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see anything is imminent,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. With a prewar population of about 220,000, Raqqa is about one-tenth the size of Mosul, but commanders still face the same challenges of waging an air war while minimizing risks to civilians in a congested city. There are other reasons to go slow. Some Islamic State headquarters buildings have been spared attack for now so the Americans can monitor their communications and movements of their personnel in and out to learn more about the enemy operations, General Harrigian said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, allied airstrikes have picked up as the Arab and Kurdish fighters have moved closer to the capital, and as commanders seek to pressure Mosul and Raqqa simultaneously. About 30 percent of the 1,300 strikes in and around Raqqa since the war began in 2014 have been conducted in the past three months. \u201cThe pressure in Raqqa is bearing fruit as ISIL leaders come out of hiding, which allows us to kill them,\u201d Brett H. McGurk, Mr. Obama\u2019s envoy to the international coalition fighting the Islamic State, said this month. Tracking the enemy\u2019s ground movements falls largely to the crew of the Joint Stars plane, a 1960s-era, reconfigured Boeing 707 jetliner packed with sensitive electronics that is part of an eclectic and unsung mix of odd-shaped surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft with names like Compass Call and Rivet Joint. These planes suck up some enemy communications, jam others and help paint a picture of the Islamic State on the ground for American fighters and bombers to attack. Bulging from the belly of the Joint Stars is a canoe-shaped, cloud-piercing radar that can see ground targets \u2014 and even some low-flying planes and helicopters \u2014 as far as 250 miles away on either side of the nearly windowless fuselage. Aboard the plane, the crew of 19 Air Force and Army personnel \u2014 an unusual mix of active-duty and Georgia National Guard specialists \u2014 track clusters of dots on their screens that could represent groups of hostile fighters and their vehicles, friendly forces or just routine commercial traffic. Much depends on where they are and what time of day it is. From its high-flying, wide-area perch, the radar can track moving vehicles; low, slow-flying aircraft; and smaller potential targets such as people, said Lt. Col. William B. Hartman, 39, of Irvine, Calif., the Joint Stars squadron commander. The operators on board can change the filters on their systems to show different-size targets or their direction of travel in different colors, all of which is relayed back to operations centers in Baghdad and Erbil, in northern Iraq, he said.

Credit Suzanne Jenkins/U.S. Air Force, via Getty Images Flying from a base in the Persian Gulf, a typical Joint Stars mission over Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan can last about 11 or 12 hours. Crews pack snacks in their flight bags but also fire up the plane\u2019s oven to prepare an in-flight order of chicken wings. The Joint Stars is not equipped with cameras to identify specific images on the ground. When the crew members see something suspicious, they direct a Predator or Reaper drone to zoom in for a closer look. The Joint Stars is also valuable because a rotation of aircraft and surveillance crews can monitor a particular area for days, weeks or months, watching Islamic State activity to understand what the military calls the enemy\u2019s \u201cpattern of life.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Islamic State fighters know from experience that they are being watched and often try to deceive the surveillance planes, hiding in schools or mosques or using camouflage. At one point, analysts said, ISIS even appeared to be trying to smuggle weapons strapped to the bellies of herds of sheep. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely smart,\u201d Master Sgt. Caylon Kimball, 31, an airborne intelligence technician from Anadarko, Okla., said of the militants. Several weeks ago, as the air campaign intensified against the Islamic State\u2019s oil-production and distribution network, analysts noticed an intriguing development in the central Syrian desert, about 35 miles north of Palmyra. Comparing months-old radar data from Joint Stars and other surveillance imagery with newer versions, analysts discovered that the Islamic State was moving much of its oil tanker truck fleet to an obscure area of sandy gullies, about 20 miles by 20 miles in size. \u201cThey were trying to hide from us,\u201d General Harrigian said. \u201cThey were adapting to what we were doing. They were going into the desert and just parking.\u201d For several more weeks, analysts watched the clandestine desert truck stop grow, wanting to ensure it was the Islamic State trucking fleet. Confident in that assessment, General Harrigian ordered an attack plan, code-named Olympus. In two waves of strikes \u2014 on Dec. 8 and 9 \u2014 about two dozen Air Force and Navy warplanes destroyed 188 of the trucks. Empty truck cabs were struck first to scare off drivers sleeping in their rigs, and General Harrigian said it appeared there were no civilian casualties. Besides wiping out a sizable portion of the Islamic State\u2019s tanker truck fleet and depriving the group of over $2 million in oil sales, commanders said the strike was also meant to cripple the enemy\u2019s morale. \u201cThere would be a larger strategic message we sent to them: Nice try. We found you,\u201d General Harrigian said. \u201cKeep trying to hide, we will hunt you down again.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 26, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Eye in the Sky Glares at ISIS as a Pivotal Battle Brews in Syria.

By Abigail Hauslohner December 26 at 9:48 PM Follow @ahauslohner The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro in Tennessee was constructed five years ago despite protest from the community. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) It was here, in this midsize college town in the dead center of Tennessee, that a right-wing effort to ban Islamic law found one of its first sponsors. Here, too, a congressman co-sponsored a plan to \u201cdefund Muslim \u2018refugees\u2019 \u201d and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court . The town\u2019s Muslims carried on through all of that, raising their children, saying their prayers, teaching at college, filling people\u2019s prescriptions and filling their tanks, contributing to the civic life in a city of 126,000. They felt the familiar grief and fear of reprisal last year when a Muslim man killed four Marines in Chattanooga, 90 minutes away. Now Donald Trump \u2014 a man who has repeatedly cast doubt on the patriotism of Muslims \u2014 is the president-elect, and he has selected a national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , who has called Islam a \u201ccancer.\u201d And a deep unease has again seeped into the daily life of many here in this Muslim community of about 1,500. There has been a smattering of post-election harassment and insults \u2014 at schools, in parking lots, on the road \u2014 but nothing to take to the police or put Murfreesboro back in the national headlines. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re hoping that it\u2019s going to be calm,\u201d said Saleh Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and one of the founders of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm.\u201d (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Leaming,Alice Li/The Washington Post) A \u2018melting pot,\u2019 or the\u2018buckle on the Bible Belt\u2019 Murfreesboro is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country and an increasingly diverse one. Muslim and Christian students go to school and play sports together; their families patronize the same restaurants and stores. Residents variously describe the town as a proud example of Southern hospitality, a growing \u201cmelting pot,\u201d a suburb of \u201clittle blue dot\u201d Nashville and the \u201cbuckle on the Bible Belt.\u201d Its downtown with the old courthouse and Confederate-soldiers memorial yields to strip malls and chain stores, new housing developments and old cotton fields, and the university, with its 20,000 undergraduates. You can drive to the popular shawarma joint for some Arab cuisine, then get back in the car and hear syndicated talk-show host Michael Savage on the radio wondering how many veterans are in jail \u201cfor having the guts to kill an Islamo-fascist.\u201d Among the town\u2019s couple hundred places of worship are 59 Baptist churches, including an Arabic Baptist church as well as Grace Baptist, whose deacon in 2010 greeted the construction of the new mosque next door by erecting 23 huge white crosses on the road. There are people such as Abdou Kattih, a pharmacist at Walgreens and one of the mosque\u2019s founders, and Jason Bennett, an evangelical advocate for the homeless and a onetime mosque opponent; the two now consider each other close friends. From left, Annan Chamdin, Brian Mumpower, Hiba Kattih and Stephanie Mumpower chat while preparing meals for the Murfreesboro Muslim Youth group\u2019s Thanksgiving Day event. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) There are people such as the self-described \u201cright-wing Southern Baptist,\u201d shopping at Bullseye Gun, Gear and Pawn on a recent day, who is certain that Muslims think they have the right \u201cto kill you and take your wife as a sex slave.\u201d The man declined to give his name, he said, because he employs a number of Muslims in his health-sector company anyway and did not want them to know what he thinks. He still goes to cookouts and ballgames with them, he said. [ How fringe anti-Muslim conspiracy theories went mainstream \u2014 via Trump ] On the other hand, said James McCarroll Jr., a pastor at First Baptist Church, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing more of an acceptance, a lot of it being spurred by the university having a large community of Muslims.\u201d The day after the election, flowers were left on the mosque\u2019s doorstep, and a stranger approached the new imam, an Egyptian, at the Walmart and welcomed him to town. Nothing seems to illustrate the complicated attitudes better than Tammy and Ahmed Ragab\u2019s family \u2014 three conservative Muslims and three evangelical Christians sharing a house. The couple bought a home with Tammy\u2019s parents five years ago. To the Ragabs, Trump is a threat personified. They see him as a man whose policies and rhetoric have emboldened people to attack and vilify Muslims, including their 12-year-old daughter, who they said was threatened at school the week after the election. Tammy\u2019s parents and sister voted for him. In five years of diverging viewpoints and lifestyles \u2014 the couples cook separately, watch different news channels and celebrate different holidays \u2014 a simple harmony has prevailed, they said, because they love each other. Tammy\u2019s parents eat pork, go to church and keep \u201ca whole cabinet of Jesus statues\u201d in the house, Tammy said. They also remind their granddaughter to pray five times a day and help her pick out clothes to match her hijab. \u201cBut at the same time, when it comes to the Trump issues, she\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, he only said that one time,\u2019 \u201d Tammy said of her mother. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to do the things he said.\u201d Tammy, who converted to Islam a few years before meeting Ahmed, an Egyptian immigrant, implores her mother to consider \u201cthe things we might face\u201d under Trump. \u201cAnd she says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s your choice.\u2019 \u201d Her mother, Linda Harmon, said she knows \u201ca lot of people are scared that Muslims are going to have to register and get shipped back.\u201d But, she added, \u201ceven a lot of Muslims want people vetted. . . . He\u2019s not going to send any back that aren\u2019t causing any trouble, I don\u2019t think.\u201d \u2018I didn\u2019t know youwere one of them\u2019 Kattih, the pharmacist, remembers a day a few years back when a customer came in to fill a prescription and said, \u201cDid you hear those damn Muslims want to build a church in town?\u201d Kattih, who immigrated as an adult from Syria, told her that he is a Muslim. His skin, like many of the Arab immigrants in the town, is just as pale as the whites who can trace their American lineage back generations. The exchange resulted in a moment of shock, a hurried exit and, a week later, an apology. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were one of them,\u201d he remembered her saying the next time she came in. \u201cI just wanted to apologize. If you need anything, call me.\u201d The incident shaped his outlook, he said: Maybe people just don\u2019t know enough about each other. Abdou Kattih, a co-founder of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro and president of Murfreesboro Muslim Youth. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) Last year, Kattih founded Murfreesboro Muslim Youth, a community service group that aims to make Muslims visible and familiar to people who would not dare visit the mosque. \u201cWhat people in America are failing to realize: Most immigrant Muslims lived under dictatorship. Fear is embedded in their skin. So when they\u2019re afraid, they retract,\u201d Kattih said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the opposite of what needs to happen. You need to stretch out your hand to allies. And you\u2019ll be surprised what hands reach out back.\u201d A week after the election, the group\u2019s members, most in their late teens or early 20s, gathered in the town square and handed out flowers to strangers. Some people from other faiths joined in. On Thanksgiving, the students cooked 48 meals and gave them to families in need. When students hosted a meet-a-Muslim event on the university campus earlier this year, \u201cmost people came up to us and said they had never met a Muslim,\u201d said Basant Salem, 18, who moved to Murfreesboro five years ago from Morgantown, W.Va., when her father became a genetics professor at the university. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to change their views,\u201d said Basant\u2019s sister, Samar, 21, who once brought cookies to mosque protesters, \u201cbut just make them aware that we aren\u2019t what they think we are.\u201d \u2018I think we\u2019re going to see some pretty rough times\u2019 What worries and perplexes many Muslims and their friends here is what lies beneath the surface. What impact will Trump have as president when distrust of Muslims already exists? Bennett, director of the Murfreesboro Cold Patrol homeless-aid group, used to belong to an evangelical church opposed to the mosque, which protesters and politicians accused of supporting terrorism. Vandals struck the building site three times, at one point setting construction equipment on fire. Bennett changed his thinking after he met Kattih and other Muslims also involved in providing social services to those in need. He said the fear and the false pronouncements \u2014 that Muslims worship a different God, are taught to lie or use mosques as militant training centers \u2014 are as pervasive in the town\u2019s Sunday sermons and Bible studies as they were five years ago. \u201cAll that stuff is still there,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWhen policies start to take effect after January, or start to move, I think we\u2019re going to see some pretty rough times again.\u201d McCarroll, who leads a predominantly black church in Murfreesboro, echoed that concern. \u201cI think we could see people displaced,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s just rhetoric, but I think the town is really holding its breath.\u201d Ask locals about the churches that oppose Islam and many point first to the World Outreach Church, the largest megachurch in town. \u201cWe have a duty to investigate anyone under the banner of Islam,\u201d the pastor, Allen Jackson, declared at a hearing on the mosque plan in 2010. The church declined to comment on Jackson\u2019s view now, but a man who worships there said the pastor continues to view Islam through a prism of holy war: \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s biblical.\u201d Men and women who once sued and protested against the mosque come in to fill prescriptions from Kattih, buy doughnuts or cigarettes from Essam Mohammed at the Quik Mart or attend one of Sbenaty\u2019s engineering classes. They trade pleasantries. They\u2019re polite. They continue on their way. A man works on his truck in Murfreesboro. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) Howard Wall puts it like this: \u201cIf I have to go the store to get a Coke or something, we talk. I\u2019m nice to them, they\u2019re nice to me.\u201d Wall and his wife, Sally, are local developers who were among those who sued to stop the mosque construction, litigation that was resolved when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. The couple have no plans to take up another fight. They also think it won\u2019t be necessary, because Trump will limit the arrival of more Muslims. Murfreesboro doesn\u2019t need \u201cto have a lot of Muslims,\u201d Sally Wall said. \u201cI think they can stay where they are and we stay where we are.\u201d But there\u2019s more tolerance because of the public acrimony over the mosque, said City Council member Bill Shacklett. \u201cI wish some of the things hadn\u2019t happened. But the one thing it has done is compel people to open their hearts and minds to be drawn toward each other . . . get out and flesh out your faith with different people,\u201d Shacklett said, adding that Muslims and Christians have started to do that. \u201cMaybe that wouldn\u2019t have happened if we hadn\u2019t had the spotlight put on us for all of that.\u201d national News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

More than a dozen others were listed in serious or critical condition.\u00a0 The city has seen eight multiple-victim shootings, including two double homicides. One was an attack in the East Chatham neighborhood that left five dead and two wounded, and an attack in the Austin neighborhood left two dead.\u00a0 Much of the violence happened in areas \"with historical gang\u00a0conflicts on the south and west side of Chicago,\" said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. He also referenced the department's \"strategic subject list,\" which is generated daily from a computerized algorithm and assigns a score from 1 to 500 based on such factors as a person's arrests and the activities of his associates. Those people with a score in the upper 200s or higher are considered in danger of being shot or of shooting someone else. \"Ninety percent of those fatally wounded had gang affiliations, criminal histories and were pre-identified by the department's strategic subject algorithm as being a potential suspect or victim of gun violence,\" Guglielmi said Monday.\u00a0 The most recent shooting happened Monday night about 5:40 p.m. in the Back of the yards neighborhood, police said. A 34-year-old man was shot in the 4800 block of South Bishop Street about 5:40 p.m. and drove to a fire station seeking treatment. Paramedics took him to Stroger Hospital , police said.\u00a0 A 45-year-old man was shot in the 4100 block of West Arthington Street and taken Mount Sinai Hospitalf or treatment earlier in the day. He had been in an argument about 5:25 p.m., just before getting shot, police said.\u00a0 Two people were shot in the 5800 block of South May Street in the \u00a0Englewood neighborhood about 3:25 p.m. A 20-year-old man was taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County with a back wound and a 35-year-old man refused medical treatment for a graze wound. Someone in a dark-colored sedan fired shots and fled the scene, police said.\u00a0 A 22-year-old man walked into Advocate Trinity Hospital on the city's South Side seeking treatment for a gunshot wound sustained in the 7900 block of South Cottage Grove Avenue about 2:45 p.m., police said.\u00a0 Earlier,\u00a0about 11:20 a.m. in the 1800 block of South Ridgeway Avenue in North Lawndale, a 23-year-old man was shot in each leg. He was being treated at Mount Sinai Hospital, according to police. ",

Several elderly women were enjoying a reprieve from the summer heat in care of nuns in a convent in Amatrice, a medieval hilltop town. When the quake struck, half of the convent collapsed, apparently killing three nuns and four elderly women. Sister Mariana was one of three nuns and an elderly woman who survived because they were in a part of the convent that was not fully destroyed. Massimo Percossi / ANSA via AP 14.

The military coup attempt began late July 15 with tanks rolling into the streets of the capital, Ankara, and Istanbul as Recep Tayyip Erdogan was enjoying a seaside vacation. Explosions and gunfire erupted throughout the night. After the failed coup that left at least 270 people dead, the Turkish government declared a state of emergency and launched a massive crackdown against supporters of the movement led by U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara deemed responsible for the uprising. Gulen denies any involvement. Gokhan Tan / Getty Images 16. Migrants, most of them from Eritrea, jump into the water from a crowded wooden boat as they are rescued from the Mediterranean about 13 miles north of Sabratha, Libya, on Aug. 29.

Philippine government officials have defended police actions during the crackdown, and the president has met past such calls with angry tirades. Damir Sagolj / Reuters 18. Children from the Suri tribe stand in Ethiopia's southern Omo Valley near Kibbish on Sept. 25. The Suri are a pastoralist Nilotic ethnic group in Ethiopia. The construction of the Gibe 3 dam, the third largest hydroelectric plant in Africa, and large areas of very \"thirsty\" cotton and sugar plantations and factories along the Omo river threaten the lives of tribes living in the Omo Valley who depend on the river for their survival and way of life. Human rights groups fear for the future of the tribes if they are forced to scatter, give up traditional ways through loss of land or ability to keep cattle as globalization and development increases. Ethiopia aims to produce 15,000 megawatts of electricity through its dams in the coming five years. Carl De Souza / AFP - Getty Images 19. Nidhi Chaphekar, right, a 40-year-old Jet Airways flight attendant and mother of two from Mumbai, sits stunned with another unidentified woman wounded after explosions rocked Brussels Airport on March 22.

Police use water cannons on demonstrators during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota on Nov. 20. Since August, the camp on federal land near the reservation and the pipeline route has been home to thousands of people protesting the four-state $3.8 billion pipeline designed to carry oil to a shipping point in Illinois. The tribe argues that the pipeline would impact drinking water and sacred sites on its 2.3-million acre reservation straddling the North Dakota-South Dakota border. A federal court battle over whether the developer of the Dakota Access oil pipeline can finish the $3.8 billion project will linger at least into the first couple months of the new year.

Iraq's second-largest city Mosul was once arguably the most multicultural place in Iraq, with a Sunni Muslim Arab majority but also thriving communities of Kurds, Shiites, Christians and Yazidis. Together, they had created Mosul's distinct identity, with its own cuisine, intellectual life and economy. But ISIS has turned Mosul into a place of fear, hunger and isolation under 2 \u00bd years of rule by the militants. Bulent Kilic / AFP - Getty Images 31.

Although Islam is a 'recognized' religion in the constitution of officially atheist China, ethnic Uyghurs are subjected to restrictions on religious and cultural practices that are imposed by China's Communist Party. Ethnic tensions have fueled violence that Chinese authorities point to as justification for the restrictions. Kevin Frayer / Getty Images 36.

People sit on their rooftop to get a better view as the remains of former Cuban President Fidel Castro pass by on their cross-country journey from Havana to Santiago de Cuba on Dec. 1 in Santa Clara. Castro, the revolutionary leader who brought communism to his island nation in 1959, died Nov. 25 at age 90. Tens of thousands of people lined the route, which retraced in reverse the path of the triumphant march of Castro and his rebels across the island to enter Havana on Jan. 1, 1959. Many waved flags and shouted \"Long may he live!\" Others filmed the procession with cellphones, a luxury prohibited in Cuba until an ailing Castro gave up power in 2006 to his younger brother, Raul, who began a series of slow reforms.

    "text": "Dec 26 2016, 12:21 pm ET Hope and Change? Obama's Legacy at a Crossroads by Perry Bacon Jr. People walk past a campaign poster for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in the Brooklyn borough of New York on Oct. 30, 2008. Mark Lennihan / AP, file Share advertisement Barack Obama ran for and entered the White House with the promise of becoming a transformational leader \u2014 someone who could alter the fundamental direction of the nation's politics in a more progressive way. But with the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the subsequent loss of what could fairly have been described as a third presidential term, Obama's legacy is imperiled. How history judges the \"Obama Era\" now will, in part, depend on Donald Trump and whether he will unwind or leave in place his predecessor's policies. Working around a Republican Congress that had long blocked his ideas, Obama spent his final two years in office using his executive power and international agreements in an aggressive attempt to reshape American and international policy. He helped orchestrate the agreement reached with Iran to limit its nuclear weapons program; Trump has said he will scrap it. Trump has vowed to repeal and replace large swaths of the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature healthcare reform overhaul which left America with its lowest rate of uninsured people in decades.Obama poured political capital into helping craft the Paris agreement that the U.S. reached with more than 100 nations to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Absent comprehensive immigration reform, he pushed policies limiting the deportations of undocumented immigrants. Related: How Trump Could Erase Key Parts of Obama's Legacy He oversaw an increase in taxes on the rich to levels not seen since the Reagan administration and redistributing much of that money to lower-income Americans. Under Obama, the Dodd-Frank law was enacted which puts tighter limits on Wall Street banks and created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau designed to serve as a kind of national watchdog for Americans against businesses. U.S. President Barack Obama signs the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Bill next to U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science February 17, 2009. LARRY DOWNING / REUTERS And he helped push criminal justice and policing reforms that in effect were an attempt to wind down both the \"War on Drugs\" and aggressive policing tactics that disproportionately affected blacks. Trump has suggested he will end or radically change all of these policies. \"Based on policy, the record is impressive, if it is not undone,\" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University professor and historian who recently organized a meeting of scholars who presented papers on their views of Obama's legacy on politics and policy. \"If much of it stays on the books, I think he will be looked back at as the Democrat who broke through in ways other Democrats had not figured out how to do in a conservative era,\" Zelizer added. \"But if the result of the election is wholesale retrenchment, the main story will be about how and why his party suffered so much over the last eight years.\" The Road to Economic Recovery President Obama, still buoyed by the \"hope and change\" optimism of his first presidential campaign, entered office as the U.S. was mired in what became known as the \"Great Recession.\" The unemployment rate , which reached 10 percent in Obama's first year, is now 4.6 percent. The stimulus bill that Obama signed in 2009, which pumped more than $800 billion into the economy, helped stem that recession, according to many non-partisan experts. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said the stimulus increased America's GDP, reduced the unemployment rate and helped cause more hiring. Obama's decision to put taxpayer money into Chrysler and General Motors helped two of the largest American automakers remain in business, and a recent study suggested that 225,000 jobs have been added at motor vehicle and parts dealers since 2009. (Some studies are even more bullish on the auto rescue, suggesting it saved nearly 2 million jobs.)

He has promised bring jobs back to America by scrapping on day one the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. This is a death blow to the Obama administration's efforts as they spent tremendous political capital on the controversial, multinational trade deal. They hoped the accord would further cement U.S. influence and values in Asia and other parts of the world while improving labor, wage and environmental standards globally, thereby discouraging American outsourcing. Warriors and Retrenchment Obama ran for president skeptical of the use of American troops in resolving conflicts abroad, particularly in the Middle East. In office, Obama has brought thousands of troops back home \u2014 and not redeployed them. In 2009, about 34,000 thousand troops were in Afghanistan and another 140,000 were in Iraq. The Obama administration says it plans to have about 9,400 troops in Afghanistan when it leaves office, and there are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq. Obama has pushed for the resignations of the leaders of Egypt, Libya and Syria. But he refused to send large numbers of soldiers to those countries-or anywhere else.

Trump won the presidency by similarly pledging not to deploy large numbers of U.S. troops abroad. Obama \"tried to determine what's vital to American interests and what's not and to prioritize,\" said Fredrik Logevall, a professor of history and international relations at Harvard's Kennedy School. \"I think there is a lot of skepticism\u2014maybe not among people in the establishment\u2014but among ordinary Americans about military intervention. Under Trump, it could be hard to reverse that kind of policy,\" Logevall added. Unfinished Business On other policy issues, the president's record is more complicated. U.S. Census Data released this year showed that the median income for American households increased by 5 percent from 2014 to 2015. But this income, $56, 515, is essentially the same as it was in 2007, before the recession. Costs for college and health care in particular continued to grow for most Americans. Most American troops are out of Afghanistan and Iraq, but Obama, like George W. Bush, was not able to stabilize either country. Obama ordered the raid that successfully killed Osama Bin Laden, but a new terrorist threat emerged in ISIS, which the president at first underestimated. Then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House in Washington. Pete Souza / The White House via AP Obama essentially replaced American troops with drone strikes, angering some liberals who view that policy as both inhumane and an overreach of executive power. It's not clear if Trump will continue that policy. Related: How Trump Can Gut Obama's National Security Policies on Day One On counter-terrorism, \"Obama really concentrated the power in the presidency, so that he was the one making the decisions,\" said Kathryn Olmsted, a historian at the University of California, Davis, noting that Obama at times personally signed off on drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists. \"Obama decided he wanted to take over this himself. I don't know if Trump will decide to do that,\" added Olmsted, who is working on a paper on Obama's terrorism policies. A guard walks into the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, also known as \"Gitmo\", a maximum security detention center at the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on Oct. 22, 2016.                                   The U.S. military's Joint Task Force Guantanamo is still holding 60 detainees at the prison, down from a previous total of 780, including 20 cleared for release.                                   On his second day in office in 2008 President Obama issued an executive order to close the prison, which has failed because of political opposition in the U.S. Congress, mostly from Republicans who argue that they won't jeopardize national security over a campaign promise. John Moore / Getty Images And despite Obama's early promises to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, it is unlikely he will do so before leaving office. Social Change, Diversity...and the Backlash As the nation's first black president, Obama often sought to serve as a unifying figure who could in some ways help heal America of its racial, cultural, ideological and partisan divides. The changes around diversity, culture and inclusion that happened under Obama were monumental: a black president; a black \u2014 and very popular \u2014 first lady; a female nominee of a major political party; the first Latino Supreme Court justice; the first two black attorneys general; same-sex marriage nationwide; legislation adopted in many liberal areas to protect the rights of transgender Americans; a civil rights movement of protests and activism that resembles that of the 1960's; a repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" law, making it clear that openly-gay people can serve in the U.S. military.Obama's role in these shifts varied widely. The president was the driver of his own ascent and that of his appointees. He put the imprimatur of the U.S. government behind a gay rights movement that was already very strong and pushing him to do more. He was hesitant about the Black Lives Matter movement at first, but later fully embraced it. The images of Obama and his appointees\u2014including many women and non-whites\u2014leading the country can't be erased. White House staff members listen to President Barack Obama speak about Donald Trump's victory in the Rose Garden of the White House. Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett is at left. White House Communications Director Jen Psaki is at center and to her left is National Security Adviser Susan Rice. JIM LO SCALZO / EPA Trump has described the same-sex marriage issue as \"settled,\" even as the new president could in theory seek to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn the 2015 ruling that invalidated gay marriage bans. The renewed push for black and Latino civil rights, has been adopted by the leaders of the Democratic Party and many of its voters, and is likely to be a permanent part of the party's ideology in the future. Tolerance and inclusion for people of all religions, races and sexual identities is now one of the defining features of the Democratic Party, which controls most of America's largest cities and states. Related: Gay Rights and WorkerRights: The New Battles Between Blue and Red America But there has been a tremendous backlash to Obama's push for diversity and inclusion \u2014 and the effects of that rejection were seen during the 2016 election. Over the president's objections, Republicans across the country passed laws limiting early voting and requiring photo ID's to vote, moves that some federal judges say were explicitly aimed at reducing votes of blacks and Latinos. In a 17-candidate GOP field, Trump won while running most aggressively against Obama's vision of inclusion, suggesting he would limit Muslim immigration to the United States and deport undocumented immigrants. \"Left wing movements thrived under Obama,\" said Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University and author of the 2011 book \"American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation.\" He added \"but as Trump's narrow win shows, white workers had no comparable movement and so responded to a man who made them promises that Clinton did not.\" A Party Strong in Cities and On Coasts\u2014And Nowhere Else Two trends \u2014 white voters in the South and Appalachia increasingly backing the GOP while the liberal-leaning Asian and Latino populations grew in size \u2014 preceded Obama. But in Obama's eight years in Washington, these shifts fully took hold, reshaping American politics. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 by following the model of Obama's campaigns in 2008, aggressively appealing to Asian, black and Latino voters and college-educated whites who pride themselves on tolerance and inclusiveness. With that coalition, Democrats have won the popular vote and carried previously Republican states Colorado and Virginia in three straight elections. In 2004, John Kerry won California by about 10 percent. Hillary Clinton won by the state more than 30 percent in 2016. The Democratic Party of 2016 is more than 40 percent non-white, compared to about 25 percent in 1996, according to the Pew Research Center. Play ",

(Photo: USA TODAY Sports photos) INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In a future world, running backs Leonard Fournette of LSU and Christian McCaffrey of Stanford could be agents of change. Tomorrow, they could be heroes. Today, they are selfish and disloyal. In this world, they are the two most well-known players skipping their teams' bowl games to get ready for the NFL draft. And people hate it. Outsiders , fans, media , even Dallas Cowboys rookie Ezekiel Elliott, who jabbed at Fournette and McCaffrey by referring to \u201call these young guys deciding to skip their bowl games,\u201d and then raising the issue of disloyalty: \u201cI would do anything to play one more time with my brothers in that scarlet and gray,\u201d Ezekiel tweeted , referring to Ohio State\u2019s school colors. Good for you, Zeke. As for everyone else, stop seething and see what this could mean, if we\u2019re lucky:\u00a0The end of the bowl system as we know it. No, really. What Fournette and McCaffrey have done \u2014\u00a0and also Baylor running back Shock Linwood\u00a0 \u2014 is demonstrate the bowl system\u2019s abject irrelevance. Next stop, a much bigger playoff for college football? Let\u2019s hope so. Nothing happens fast, certainly nothing as big as the transition from meaningless bowl games to a much larger playoff. But that\u2019s where college football is heading. You have to know that. Dissatisfaction with the original bowl system led to the BCS. Dissatisfaction with the BCS led to the current four-team playoff. Dissatisfaction will set in on this, too. It already has, what with two Big Ten schools \u2014 Michigan and Penn State \u2014 having a legitimate argument for inclusion in a playoff filled by Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and Washington. Change comes. It comes slowly, but it comes. While we wait, let\u2019s stop trashing McCaffrey and Fournette and lobby instead for the end of a bowl system almost nobody likes in the first place. Other than bowl directors, who like to wear blazers and make a buck, the only people really happy that college football has 10 or 15 (or 20 or 25) useless bowl games are college football coaches. And their reasons are self-serving. Reaching a bowl game \u2014 even if it means their team is no better than, say, No. 74 out of 128 FBS teams in the country \u2014 can save a coach\u2019s job. Look at Indiana\u2019s Kevin Wilson. Leading IU to consecutive bowl games \u2014 the Hoosiers\u2019 first back-to-back bowls since 1990-91 \u2014 was seen as groundbreaking. It wasn\u2019t. Know how many bowls there were in 1991? There were 18 . Know how many bowl games there are now?\u00a0Forty. That\u2019s 80 teams. There are just 128 teams in FBS. It\u2019s harder not to play in a bowl game. Wilson went 6-7 in 2015. His team went 6-6 this season. Before being forced out for whatever legitimate reason he and IU agreed upon , Wilson was 26-47 overall. But \u2026 consecutive bowl games! Please. Only the top 10 or 12 bowl bids equate to an NCAA tournament invite in college basketball, and at the lowest levels \u2014 the bottom 10 or 15 bowls \u2014 a bowl berth is beneath even an NIT bid. Playing in the Foster Farms Bowl, where IU faces Utah on Wednesday , is similar to playing in one of the other college basketball postseason tournaments, the CBI or the CIT. Truth is, I had to look up the names of both tournaments. Had to look up the name of the Foster Farms Bowl, too. The Foster Farms Bowl is so important to the two schools involved, each is allotted barely 10 percent of the tickets \u2014 and they can\u2019t even sell those. Or come close. Indiana and Utah were allotted 7,000 tickets each. As of late last week, Utah had been able to sell (or \"give away\") less than half. IU had sold roughly one-third and was preparing to return thousands of tickets , hoping to break even financially on this postseason \u201creward,\u201d but preparing to suffer a small loss. Did you grow up on bowl games? I did. New Year\u2019s Day was magical in my house. The other bowls \u2014 the Gator, the Peach, the Bluebonnet \u2014 seemed meaningful. Times have changed. Former IndyStar Mr. Football Jaylon Smith suffered a devastating knee injury in last year's Fiesta Bowl. \u00a0(Photo: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports) Now we have players starting to avoid a pointless bowl system that could cost one of them millions. Actually, it already has. Notre Dame\u2019s Jaylon Smith, a top-5 draft prospect last year, tumbled to the second round after injuring his knee in the Fiesta Bowl. That kind of injury is a long shot, but we\u2019re not the ones rolling the dice \u2014 they are. And Smith lost almost $20 million . Instead of a guaranteed contract in the $23 million range, he received guarantees of $4.4 million from the Dallas Cowboys. Still hasn\u2019t played yet, either. Still trying to recover. Jaylon Smith has said he would play in the Fiesta Bowl again, which is fine. That\u2019s his choice. Fournette is skipping the Citrus Bowl, and McCaffrey the Sun Bowl, and that\u2019s their choice. By the way \u2026 Jeff Brohm skipped the Boca Raton Bowl. Well, he did. He left Western Kentucky two weeks earlier to become coach at Purdue . He got a raise worth millions. Temple\u2019s Matt Rhule skipped the Military Bowl. He left Temple to become coach at Baylor. Got a raise worth millions. Anyone picketing outside the gated communities of Brohm and Rhule? No? Hmmm. Fournette and McCaffrey are no more traitorous than Brohm and Rhule. Truth is, none of them is\u00a0traitorous. All have performed at such a high level, they\u2019re positioned for a once-in-a-lifetime payoff. It\u2019s their future, so why should this be our beef? Listen to this guy, some dude named Wright Waters: \"If we have someone who is just pulling out of the (bowl) game,\u201d he said, \u201cand they're just saying, 'I might get hurt,' and they don't have any problem, yeah, I've got a problem with that.\u201d Who is Wright Waters? He\u2019s a 67-year-old from Tuscaloosa, Ala. He\u2019s executive director of the Football Bowl Association . See, Leonard Fournette and Christian McCaffrey are threatening his paycheck. Whose side do you want to be on? Leonard Fournette? Or Wright Waters? Drop the anger toward Fournette, McCaffrey, Linwood and whoever skips a bowl game next season. Just hope someone does skip a bowl next season. Hell, hope everyone skips. The less star power for bowls, the less bargaining power with television networks like ESPN. As soon as they start losing revenue, bowl games \u2013 which have been sustained to make bowl directors rich, not to \u201cprovide opportunities to players\u201d \u2013 will find a way to generate more. Guess how they can do that \u2026 By turning the lowliest bowls into the first round of the playoffs. The next tier of bowls would be the second round, and so on. Eventually the best bowls become the Final Four, and the title game. This is where college football is going. Only question is: How long before it gets there? McCaffrey and Fournette don\u2019t have a bigger college football playoff as their goal, but so what? They are living, breathing, multi-million-dollar corporations of tomorrow, and they\u2019re allowed to plan their future today. And we\u2019re allowed to root for the demise of this bogus bowl system. Maybe both can happen at the same time. All the better.

Lake County Sheriff's Office squad car. (Bill Garrett / Lake County News-Sun) Privacy Policy A 43-year-old North Barrington man was critically injured Sunday after he rolled his all-terrain vehicle after swerving to avoid a dog, while police report his 7-year-old passenger was only slightly injured in the accident. The incident occurred at 4:15 p.m. in the 100 block of north Ravine Lane in North Barrington, where the 43-year-old man and the 7-year-old were traveling north on Ravine when he swerved to avoid hitting a dog, and that caused the ATV to roll over, according to Sgt. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff's Office. Covelli added that neither of the riders was wearing a helmet, and the 43-year-old man was transported to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville with life-threatening injuries, and his young passenger was treated and released at the scene. The crash remained under investigation Monday by the Lake County Sheriff's Office Technical Crash Investigations Unit. ",

U.S. President George W. Bush is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union speech before a joint meeting of Congress at 9:00 PM Eastern.  (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images Email WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax system, a heavy political lift that could ultimately affect families at every income level and businesses of every size. Their goal is to simplify a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants, and corporations that can easily shift profits - and jobs - overseas. It won\u2019t be easy. The last time it was done was 30 years ago. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have vowed to pass a tax package in 2017 that would not add to the budget deficit. The Washington term is \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d It means that for every tax cut there has to be a tax increase, creating winners and losers. Lawmakers would get some leeway if non-partisan congressional analysts project that a tax cut would increase economic growth, raising revenue without increasing taxes. Nevertheless, passing a massive tax package will require some tough votes, politically. Some key Republican senators want to share the political risk with Democrats. They argue that a tax overhaul must be bipartisan to be fully embraced by the public. They cite President Barack Obama\u2019s health law - which passed in 2010 without any Republican votes - as a major policy initiative that remains divisive. Congressional Democrats say they are eager to have a say in overhauling the tax code. But McConnell, who faulted Democrats for acting unilaterally on health care, is laying the groundwork to pass a purely partisan bill. Both McConnell and Ryan said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill. McConnell says he wants the Senate to tackle a tax plan in the spring, after Congress repeals Obama\u2019s health law. House Republicans are more eager to get started, but haven\u2019t set a timeline. Some things to know about Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code: --- THE HOUSE PLAN House Republicans have released the outline of a tax plan that would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The gist of the plan is to lower tax rates for just about everyone, and make up the lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits. The plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children. The standard deduction would be increased, giving taxpayers less incentive to itemize their deductions. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says the plan would reduce revenues by $3 trillion over the first decade, with most of the savings going to the highest-income households. That\u2019s not revenue neutral. Small business owners would get a special top tax rate of 25 percent. Investment income would be taxed like wages, but investors would only have to pay taxes on half of this income. --- Senate Republicans have yet to coalesce around a comprehensive plan, or even an outline. -- TRUMP\u2019S PLAN Trump\u2019s plan has fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. The Tax Policy Center says Trump\u2019s plan would reduce revenues by a whopping $9.5 trillion over the first decade, with most of the tax benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers. Trump has disputed the analysis. Like the House plan, Trump would reduce the top income tax rate for individuals to 33 percent, and he would reduce the number of tax brackets to three. He would also increase the standard deduction. Trump has embraced two ideas championed by Obama but repeatedly rejected by Republicans over the past eight years. Trump\u2019s plan would cap itemized deductions for married couples making more than $200,000 a year. It would also tax carried interest, which are fees charged by investment fund managers, as regular income instead of capital gains. --- CORPORATE TAXES The top corporate income tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world. However, the tax is riddled with so many exemptions, deductions and credits that most corporations pay much less. Both Trump and House Republicans want to lower the rate, and pay for it by scaling back tax breaks. Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Ryan says 20 percent is more realistic, to avoid increasing the budget deficit. --- BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX This is one of the most controversial parts of the House Republicans\u2019 tax plan. It is also key to making it work. Under current law, the United States taxes the profits of U.S.-based companies, even if the money is made overseas. However, taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company either reinvests the profits in the U.S. or distributes them to shareholders. Critics say the system encourages U.S.-based corporations to invest profits overseas or, more dramatically, to shift operations and jobs abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. House Republicans want to scrap America\u2019s worldwide tax system and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm\u2019s products are consumed, rather than where they are produced. Under the system, American companies that produce and sell their products in the U.S. would pay the new 20 percent corporate tax rate on profits from these sales. However, if a company exports a product abroad, the profits from that sale would not be taxed by the U.S. There\u2019s more: Foreign companies that import goods to the U.S. would have to pay the tax, increasing the cost of imports. Exporters love the idea. But importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say it could lead to steep price increases on consumer goods. The lobbying has already begun. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

Scientists better understand what dark matter isn\u2019t rather than what it is. Rubin never received the Nobel Prize for her work, but her name was long floated for the prestigious award.\u00a0 Emily Levesque, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle, is among those scientists who believe Rubin deserved the honor.\u00a0 \u201cThe existence of dark matter has utterly revolutionized our concept of the universe and our entire field; the ongoing effort to understand the role of dark matter has basically spawned entire subfields within astrophysics and particle physics at this point,\u201d Levesque told Astronomy Magazine in June. \u201cAlfred Nobel\u2019s will describes the physics prize as recognizing \u2018the most important discovery\u2019 within the field of physics. If dark matter doesn\u2019t fit that description, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d In addition to her breakthrough discoveries, Rubin was considered a champion for women in astronomy, putting constant pressure on powerful factions in the field to recognize women\u2019s contributions.\u00a0 Invited to the highly regarded Palomar Observatory outside San Diego early in her career, Rubin did not accept the building\u2019s lack of a women\u2019s restroom at face value. \u201cShe went to her room, she cut up paper into a skirt image, and she stuck it on the little person image on the door of the bathroom,\u201d former colleague Neta Bahcall of Princeton University told Astronomy Magazine. \u201cShe said, \u2018There you go; now you have a ladies\u2019 room.\u2019 That\u2019s the type of person Vera is.\u201d In recent years, Rubin was reportedly unhappy that stubborn gender inequities continued to pervade her field. In 2000, she told Astronomy writer Ann Finkbeiner she was \u201cgetting fed up... What\u2019s wrong with this story is that nothing\u2019s changing, or it\u2019s changing so slowly,\u201d the magazine reported. On Monday, scientists and admirers across the internet mourned Rubin\u2019s passing: Very sad to hear of #VeraRubin 's death. Every year, many of us in physics hoped this might finally be the year she got her Nobel Prize.

(Photo: AMY SMOTHERMAN BURGESS/NEWS SENTINEL) GATLINBURG, Tenn. \u2014\u00a0Atop a winding\u00a0road that weaves its way up a scorched\u00a0mountain above\u00a0downtown Gatlinburg, the city's mayor, Mike Werner, stood behind yellow caution tape on a plot of concrete covered in\u00a0ash and stared out into the Great Smoky Mountains . Nearly a\u00a0month ago, his family's\u00a07,000-square-foot, three-story Craftsman-style home rested\u00a0on the plot. But on this day, Werner stood among its ruins lamenting the aftermath of the late November wildfire\u00a0that swept through the tourist town and destroyed his family's home of 21 years. Want to help Gatlinburg? Come visit, biz owners say To his right, the home's scorched fireplace and stone\u00a0chimney\u00a0stood firmly intact. But little else remained aside from his wife's burned-out SUV and a bronze pile of charred kitchen appliances. \"It's only the strength of the Lord that's getting us all through this,\" said Werner as tow trucks passed behind him on the curving\u00a0street carting off scorched\u00a0cars from neighboring homes. \"It's been a daily wake-up of just taking\u00a0this one day at a time.\" The Nov. 28\u00a0inferno killed 14 people, injured at least 180, destroyed or damaged\u00a0more than 2,400 structures in Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and other parts of Sevier County, and caused more than $500 million in damages. Werner, 65, lived\u00a0with his wife, Cindy, and five of their seven children in the\u00a0house on Greystone Heights Road just north of\u00a0East Parkway,\u00a0the main drag that runs through the heart of downtown Gatlinburg. They are among\u00a0more than 2,100 people who lost their homes. Of the nearly two dozen homes that line\u00a0the mountain along their\u00a0street located directly above Ripley's Aquarium,\u00a0less than a handful survived the fire. All that remained of them this day were chimneys resting on the\u00a0foundations of each fire-razed home. \"We loved this home,\" said Werner, black glass crunching beneath his feet as he walked into what used to be his living room. \"Just to sit outside on our deck and have coffee and stare at the mountains' trees, the colors always changing. It was glorious.\" Another cherished past time he recalled at the home: Cooking in his outdoor kitchen for guests. \"We entertained here a lot,\" Werner said. \"People would identify this place as a place they could come and relax. But that's all gone now.\" Gatlinburg Mayor Mike Werner stands in the living room, among the ruins of his home of more than 20 years atop Greystone Heights Road on Thursday, Dec. 22, 2016, in downtown Gatlinburg. \u00a0(Photo: AMY SMOTHERMAN BURGESS/NEWS SENTINEL) 'That whole mountain is on fire' The day the fire hit the city, Werner, his wife and their youngest daughter, 12-year-old Sunni Rae, were in\u00a0Knoxville\u00a0Christmas shopping. \"During dinner my phone started blowing up,\" he recalled. \"People are being evacuated,\" one caller said. \"Don't come back,\" another warned. That same day Warner said his close friend, Davy Thomas, who manages\u00a0hotels in Sevierville, drove by the bottom of the mountain near the Werner's home and delivered the most gut-wrenching news. \"I'm so sorry,\" Thomas said. \"That whole mountain is on fire.\" Werner didn't sleep that night. The next day he ignored the\u00a0heeds to stay away, rushed back to Gatlinburg and drove straight into the burning town. Werner, his wife, their son Albert and his mother-in-law then attempted to drive up the mountain\u00a0to their home. \"The fire engulfed the whole mountain,\" he recalled. \"We drove as far as we could until\u00a0flames kept us from advancing any further. You could smell propane.\" \"We need to turn back,\" Cindy Werner told her husband. But their son got out and ran up the mountain toward the home. \"He just had to see,\" Werner recalled, tears now filling his eyes. The family waited\u00a0and a short time later, his son ran back to them and delivered the news. \"It's all gone.\" x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton talks about Smoky Mountains before telethon | 2:39 More than 20 country music singers will donate their time Tuesday for \u201cDolly Parton\u2019s Smoky Mountains Rise: A Benefit for the My People Fund.\u201d 1 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: Why is it \u2018personal\u2019 for you. | 0:17 Dolly Parton Q&A: Why is it \u2018personal\u2019 for you  to help all of the people affected by the wildfires? 2 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: Could you have ever imagined anything like this | 0:21 Dolly Parton Q&A: In all of your years growing up there, could you have ever imagined anything like this happening? 3 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parto Q&A: What is the ultimate goal with the telethon | 0:28 Dolly Parto Q&A: What is the ultimate goal or benchmark you\u2019re trying to reach with the telethon? 4 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: Approximately how many families are you anticipating being able to help | 0:30 Dolly Parton Q&A: Approximately how many families are you anticipating being able to help? 5 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A:Talk about the personal sense of responsibility | 0:38 Dolly Parton Q&A: Talk about the personal sense of responsibility you have to take action. 6 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: Explain why you are dropping everything to do this | 0:27 Dolly Parton Q&A: You\u2019re a very busy business lady ... you could have easily gone on with your busy packed schedule ... explain why you are dropping everything to do this. 7 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: What message does this send to other people who want to get involved | 0:26 Dolly Parton Q&A: What message does this send to other people who want to get involved? 8 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: Give us a sneak peek of some of the artists who will be performing | 0:24 Dolly Parton Q&A: Give us a sneak peek of some of the artists who will be performing on the telethon. 9 of 15 x Share DOLLY PARTON: Q&A ON TELETHON FOR GATLINBURG FIRE RELIEFDolly Parton Q&A: What is mountain tough | 0:52 Dolly Parton Q&A: We\u2019ve heard the term \u2018mountain tough\u2019 -- you\u2019re from there -- explain what that means to someone who doesn\u2019t live there.

People who never met their neighbors now knew one another on a first-name basis. As often as he could, Werner said he would meet\u00a0with friends in the community who lost their homes\u00a0to keep their spirits up. \"I'd tell them,' he said, cracking a smile, \"'Us homeless? We stick together.'\" City Manager Cindy Ogle and her family also lost their home to the wildfire. \"We started to make a pact that we wouldn't worry about ourselves until everyone else was taken care of,\" Werner said. He\u00a0remembered the outpouring of support from people nationwide, including his\u00a0close friend, Brian Ivey, who traveled from Nashville\u00a0to Gatlinburg the day after the fire. \"I'm not going to give you the shirt off my back, but I'm going to give you my coat,\" Werner recalled Ivey telling him, then handing him his yellow coat. Just last week, Food City, thanks to donations from its employees, customers and a slew of others, gave\u00a0$750,000 to help wildfire victims who lost their homes, jobs or a family member. Of that, $500,000 goes to the\u00a0Gatlinburg Chamber of\u00a0Commerce Foundation\u2019s Gatlinburg Relief Fund. The rest goes to the\u00a0Dollywood Foundation \"My People Fund.\" \"Everybody has been just unbelievable as far as their generosities, love and prayers,\" Werner said. 'We're going to bounce back' Since the fire, the Werner family moved into a house by the river\u00a0in Pittman Center just east of town. His said his children, including his\u00a0oldest son, Michael, who lives in Knoxville, remain optimistic and resilient. \"Every day since this happened he texts me, 'I love you, dad. Mountain Tough.'\" Werner's isolated\u00a0visit to his former home that December day was only one of a few since\u00a0the fire. \"It gets easier every time,\" he said. \"The first time was gut-wrenching.\" He recalled treasures he lost in the blaze, including a framed photo that hung in a hallway of the home\u00a0of himself, several city leaders\u00a0and Sevier County native Dolly Parton. The shot was taken\u00a0in 1997 when she donated $100,000\u00a0to open the Dolly Parton Birthing Unit at the LeConte Medical Center in Pigeon Forge\u00a0so expectant mothers wouldn't have to drive all the way to Knoxville when their time came.

    "text": "Privacy Policy Some of the shock of seeing \u201cFaith\u201d for the first (or 10th) time was that, just that summer, the man in it was getting all kinds of kids in trouble for singing \u201cI Want Your Sex\u201d not far into the AIDS era. After that, we should have been ready for \u201cFaith.\u201d But \u201cI Want Your Sex\u201d kept to MTV\u2019s gender norms, in which videos objectified sexy women (in that case, the stunning Kathy Jeung). \u201cFaith\u201d seemed exhilaratingly dirty by those standards: Mr. Michael was objectifying himself. \u201cFaith\u201d isn\u2019t as great a video as it is a song or an album. But it\u2019s important. Its hotness gave Mr. Michael this new, macho self to work with: somewhere between leather bar opening act and the boyfriend that girls in teen comedies think they want. He seemed both dangerous and \u201cdangerous.\u201d But the pleading in his voice made you take him more seriously than you would a star whose new look was \u201csexy Village Person.\u201d Mr. Michael\u2019s artistry ensured he would never be received only as camp. He was too good. He was too rueful and needy. Under the jacket and the shades and the stubble and the hair was a human who ached. Mr. Michael had a pretty, plainly textured voice that could quickly flare outward, into regret or shame, just for a few bars, the way it does in the bridge for 1984\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d one of those apologetic slow jams with the evergreen wisdom of a psalm. Photo Mr. Michael performing with Aretha Franklin in 1988. Credit Rob Kozloff/Associated Press It\u2019s clarifying to tally up all those excellent songs and discover just how many were about emotional desperation and sexual frustration (\u201cEverything She Wants,\u201d \u201cLast Christmas,\u201d \u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cHard Day,\u201d \u201cHand to Mouth,\u201d \u201cSomething to Save,\u201d \u201cToo Funky,\u201d \u201cOutside,\u201d to name just nine). The need for both liberty and intimacy also recur. So does the urge to let go or be released, to be truly seen and to give love. You don\u2019t always notice because Mr. Michael\u2019s singing smooths out any psychological cracks. He was ingenious with melody. There aren\u2019t that many pop stars with as many parts of as many songs that are as exciting to sing as George Michael has \u2014 bridges, verses, the fillips he adds between the chorus during a fade-out. \u201cFaith\u201d isn\u2019t just an album. It\u2019s a complex city of modern sound: a collection of songs, yes, and a skyline, too. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the psychological always tended to be present. The church organ at the beginning of that \u201cFaith\u201d video is playing the chorus of Wham!\u2019s \u201cFreedom.\u201d He sang about wanting to be free often enough to make you wonder whether he thought any freedom was ever attainable. He seemed to come to resent his fame. David Fincher\u2019s video for another \u201cFreedom\u201d \u2014 \u201cFreedom! \u201990\u201d \u2014 amounts to Mr. Michael\u2019s changing his mind about 1987. The stars of the video are Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz and Linda Evangelista \u2014 supermodels \u2014 not Mr. Michael, who\u2019s conspicuous by his absence yet represented by the demolition of that jukebox and the immolation of the leather jacket. He was rejecting \u201cFaith,\u201d and it was heretical. Photo Mr. Michael during his heyday. Credit Rob Verhorst/Redferns, via Getty Images \u201cFreedom! \u201990\u201d appears on \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d the album with Mr. Michael\u2019s strongest singing. There are want, hurt, protest and artistic risk. Prince, Mr. Bowie and Michael Jackson were theatrical performers. This was the first time Mr. Michael allowed himself to sound theatrical, too. The lyrics are explicitly personal, if poetically implicit. The record rejects the perfect pop songwriting of \u201cFaith\u201d and replaces a lot of the danciness of that album with gospel. It holds up as a work of art as well as the previous record holds up as an achievement of commercial intelligence. Those other men who died this year \u2014 Mr. Bowie and Prince and Prince Be \u2014 also managed to do interesting stuff with race: to sing black music while white; to be a world-class black guitarist in any genre; to be a fat, bohemian rapper who sang. For all Mr. Michael did to make gayness interesting and less threatening, he might have done more to help erase a barrier between who should and should not sing soul music. In his prime, he was a relatively frictionless ambassador among the races. He didn\u2019t cross all the way over, as Teena Marie did. He didn\u2019t \u201csound black.\u201d He sounded like himself \u2014 and that was enough to land him near the top of the black music charts. \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting for Me,\u201d from 1987, is still the best Aretha Franklin duet. Mr. Michael\u2019s black support was never an exploitative exhortation. It was never \u201cGo, white boy! Go, white boy! Go!\u201d It was: \u201cOh, he gets it.\u201d And by 2016, he wasn\u2019t done mattering. Photo Mr. Michael, left, with his Wham! partner, Andrew Ridgeley, in the early 1980s. Credit Peter Still/Redferns, via Getty Images Last spring, Key & Peele\u2019s stoner, shoot-em-up comedy, \u201cKeanu,\u201d came and went. But there\u2019s a running gag that\u2019s stayed with me. It\u2019s just three Los Angeles thugs and one uptight bureaucrat named Clarence (Keegan Michael Key) pretending to be a thug (long story; a good one, though) chilling in Clarence\u2019s minivan. To pass the time, they turn to the fake thug\u2019s iPhone for music, and up comes George Michael\u2019s \u201cFreedom! \u201990.\u201d One dude says, \u201cThat sounds kinda white.\u201d And Clarence begins a quick defense of his taste, studded with the n-word, that also makes a flashy British pop star sound like a gangsta from Crenshaw. The sequence culminates with their being oblivious to the shootout in the house they\u2019re parked in front of, belting \u201cOne More Try\u201d like a pack of wolves baying at the moon. For about 25 minutes, \u201cKeanu\u201d is smarter than the bad action comedy it turns out to be. And one thing it\u2019s brilliant about is the partial meaning of George Michael. Who knows if Mr. Michael found that annoying. Who knows if he was aware that \u201cKeanu\u201d existed. But the crush this movie has on him is the crush almost everybody did. At some point, Clarence takes a hit of some hot new street drug, and the first place his high takes him is dancing with Mr. Michael in the \u201cFaith\u201d video. He\u2019s up where even Mr. Michael\u2019s slowest, saddest music could take you. He\u2019s in heaven.

Milos Zeman told Czechs in his annual Christmas speech on Monday that \"today almost no one doubts the connection between the migration wave and terrorist attacks.\" In order to prevent terrorist attacks on Czech soil, the president said that the Czech Republic shouldn't take in migrants on a \"so-called volunteer basis,\" alluding to the European Union's efforts to distribute migrants across the continent. Zeman says he has nothing against helping migrants \"on their territory or on neighboring territories,\" or helping Italy and Greece , but \"placing Muslim, hardly compatible migrants on our territory would mean creating a breeding ground for potential terrorist attacks.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Email Hackers appear to have broken into the Twitter account of Sony Music, tweeting the false news that pop star Britney Spears had died. Sony Music sent out several strange tweets on Monday morning in what appeared to be a breach. News outlets captured the tweets before they were deleted: via Twitter via Twitter The tweets are no longer on the Sony Music Global Twitter account, which the company uses to share updates on the artists on its music label.\u00a0 \u201cBritney is fine and well,\u201d the artist\u2019s manager, Adam Leber, told CNN Monday. \u201cThere have been a few Internet clowns over the years who have made similar claims about her death, but never from the official Sony Music Twitter account.\u201d The tweets include a reference to OurMine, a known hacker group that just last week infiltrated the Twitter accounts \u00a0of NFL Networks, Marvel, and Netflix. Over the summer, OurMine hacked the Twitter accounts of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Rolling Stones\u2019 Keith Richards, and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. \u00a0 In an email exchange with CNET last week, Our Mine suggested it would keep the attacks going. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who is our next target,\u201d OurMine told CNET . On its website, OurMine frames itself as a neutral party that simply wants to point out security holes for high-profile individuals and organizations. The hacking group says that its protocol is to hand back control of all hacked accounts and provide users with tools with tips to better secure their account in the future.\u00a0 \u201cWe have no bad intentions and only care about the security and privacy of your account and network,\u201d OurMine says on its website. CBS News contacted OurMine via email to discuss Monday\u2019s tweets from Sony. The hacking collective declined to take responsibility for the initial tweet saying Britney Spears had died, instead saying that it broke into the account after noticing that strange tweet. OurMine did admit to posting subsequent tweets from Sony\u2019s account.\u00a0 Of course, this is not the first time Sony has been targeted by hackers. In November 2014, Sony Pictures was the target of a large-scale, destructive cyberattack when the studio was about to release \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a comedy that lampooned the leader of North Korea. The breach caused extensive damage to Sony computer systems, resulted in the leak of embarrassing internal emails, and had wider political implications. Weeks later, an FBI investigation\u00a0 pointed the finger at North Korea \u00a0and President Obama\u00a0 imposed new sanctions \u00a0on the country.\u00a0 CBS News reached out to Sony Music for comment, and will update this post with any further information. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

In an interview released Monday, Mr. Obama said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that if he had run for a third term, he could have \u201cmobilized a majority of the American people.\u201d Credit Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press HONOLULU \u2014 President Obama expressed confidence that, if he had run for a third term, he would have defeated Donald J. Trump , according to an interview released Monday with David Axelrod , his friend and former adviser. \u201cI\u2019m confident that if I \u2014 if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could\u2019ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Mr. Axelrod\u2019s podcast , \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d referring to his message of inclusion and helping middle-class Americans. \u201cI know that in conversations that I\u2019ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,\u201d he said. Several hours after the interview was posted, Mr. Trump responded o n Twitter . \u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe should say that but I say NO WAY! \u2014 jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.\u201d The discussion in the interview was pure political conjecture, because the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution limits a president to two terms. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama praised the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton , saying that she performed well under difficult circumstances and that there \u201cwas a double standard with her.\u201d \u201cFor whatever reason, there\u2019s been a longstanding difficulty in her relationship with the press that meant her flaws were wildly amplified,\u201d he said. But Mr. Obama also said she campaigned too cautiously. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He added: \u201cAnd the economy has been improving. There is a sense, obviously, that some communities have been left behind from the recovery and people feeling anxious about that.\u201d It was \u201cnonsense,\u201d Mr. Obama said, that Democrats had abandoned white working-class Americans, who rallied to Mr. Trump. \u201cLook, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn\u2019t vote for Hillary, didn\u2019t vote for me, but are being helped by this.\u201d The problem, Mr. Obama said, was that Democratic politicians were not communicating to these people \u201cthat we understand why they\u2019re frustrated.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we\u2019re bleeding for these communities,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional connection, and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means organizing, that means caring about state parties, it means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races, and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day.\u201d In a telephone interview on Monday, Mr. Axelrod, now a commentator on CNN, said it was his sense that Mr. Obama was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that his presidency is ending when his party has sustained such a dramatic loss. \u201cHe believes the momentum is still on his side in the long term,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a guy who thinks long term and has an amazing ability to do that.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 27, 2016, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama Says He\u2019s Sure He Would Have Beaten Trump.

    "text": "Pop music fans around the world are remembering George Michael, a superstar of the 1980s and '90s. He died suddenly on Christmas Day at his home ... During his earlier career, Michael\u2019s drug use and taste for risky sex were splashed across the tabloids. After years of avoiding the issue in public, he eventually came to speak openly about his homosexuality and referenced it in his music. Michael also revealed in a 2004 GQ interview that a former boyfriend had died in 1993 of an AIDS -related brain hemorrhage. HIV-related health issues or a drug overdose can also potentially lead to heart failure, said Lavie, but again noted that he is not privvy to any of Michael\u2019s personal health information. Sudden death from heart failure may not be the whole story, Dr. Dan Bensimhon, medical director of the Advanced Heart Failure & Mechanical Circulatory Support Program at Cone Health System in Greensboro, North Carolina, told CBS News.\u00a0 \u201cVery few things cause healthy people to die suddenly. I suspect he may have had a serious underlying health issue that led to his acute heart issue,\u201d said Bensimhon, who also had no involvement in Michael\u2019s case.\u00a0 \u201cPeople don\u2019t typically die suddenly from heart failure. Progressive heart failure is a slow, insidious process through which people are very symptomatic with shortness of breath, weakness and swelling,\u201d Bensimhon explained. \u201cThat said, people with weak hearts which cause heart failure are predisposed to dangerous heart rhythms which can kill them suddenly and that is why we place implantable defibrillators (ICDs) in these patients. I suspect the announcement that he died from heart failure is not the complete story.\u201d It seems especially unusual for someone Michael\u2019s age.\u00a0 \u201cThe incidence of heart failure increases with increasing age so we see it mostly in people over 60,\u201d Bensimhon said, \u201cbut we unfortunately can see it in younger people as well due to a variety of viruses and other causes.\u201d\u00a0 It can be hard for patients to recognize what\u2019s wrong and seek treatment. \u201cThe symptoms can be insidious at the onset, including progressive fatigue, cough and shortness of breath and often people aren\u2019t diagnosed until they have very advanced heart dysfunction and wind up in the hospital,\u201d Bensimhon said. There are medications and other treatments that can reduce symptoms and extend the lives of people experiencing heart failure, he added.\u00a0 Exercising, eating a low-sodium diet, maintaining a healthy weight and managing stress can help prevent heart failure, experts say. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

A large part of the fuselage was found. Credit Yevgeny Reutov/European Pressphoto Agency SOCHI, Russia \u2014 Russia mounted an expansive search-and-recovery operation in the Black Sea on Monday for the passengers and the fuselage of a military passenger plane that crashed a day earlier, killing all 92 people on board, including dozens of members of a storied army choir. In Moscow, famous performers and ordinary citizens, some of them in tears, dropped flowers at the entrance to the headquarters of the choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble. Another mountain of red carnations and candles piled up outside the Ostankino television center, as a tribute to nine journalists who were accompanying the choir to the Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The plane was carrying 68 performers and staff members of the ensemble, including an army choir and orchestra loved for its renditions of classical Russian songs and folk tunes. The most likely area where the plane plunged into the water moments after taking off from the southwestern resort city of Sochi has been identified, Lt. Gen. Viktor N. Bondarev, commander of the Russian Air Force, said at an early morning news conference at the airport. Continue reading the main story General Bondarev said that he did not expect the plane\u2019s fin, where the flight recorders are situated, to be as damaged as the fuselage, raising hopes that the recorders might be intact. Several chunks of the fuselage were located on Monday on the seabed about a mile offshore, initially by sonar and then by divers, the Ministry of Emergency Situations announced. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The transportation minister, Maxim Sokolov, who is leading a commission looking into the crash, said that terrorism had not been ruled out, but that it was unlikely to be the cause of the crash of the Tupolev 154, which was flying members of the choir and others to Syria for a New Year\u2019s Eve concert for troops stationed at an air base near Latakia. \u201cIn order to organize our work, we need to understand what happened,\u201d Mr. Sokolov said at the news conference. \u201cAs far as we know, the main versions do not include the terrorist act, so we base our work on the premise that technical malfunction or pilot\u2019s error caused the catastrophe.\u201d Some analysts have pointed to the possibility of terrorism, citing the sudden disappearance of the airplane from radar screens and the lack of an emergency call from the pilot. At the same time, officials emphasized that the airplane should have been technically sound, because it underwent repairs and resumed service in December 2014, and the pilot was experienced and had 1,900 hours of flying time at the control of Tupolev 154s. Video Russia Observes Day of Mourning for Crash Victims Russia observed a national day of mourning on Monday for the victims of a military plane crash that killed all 92 people on board, including 68 performers and staff members of the famed Alexandrov Ensemble. Mourners placed flowers and candles outside the choir's office in Moscow. By REUTERS and THE ASSOCIATED PRESS on Publish Date December 26, 2016. Photo by Sergei Ilnitsky/European Pressphoto Agency. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cThe plane was technically fit,\u201d General Bondarev told the news conference. \u201cThe pilot was well prepared.\u201d Criminal investigators as well as a Defense Ministry committee are in charge of determining the cause of the crash. Search efforts involving 45 ships and 135 divers continued on Monday. The bodies of 10 victims, as well as dozens of body parts that have been recovered, were flown to Moscow for identification, Russian officials said at the news conference. The government discouraged relatives of those on board from coming to Sochi during what was expected to be a long recovery operation, and the few that had done so were being isolated from journalists.

Russia observed a national day of mourning on Monday, with the main government television channels repeatedly playing mournful music and eulogizing those killed. A memorial service was conducted at a small chapel inside the Sochi terminal, with the airport\u2019s employees and passers-by carrying flowers and candles. In Khosta, a suburb of Sochi, security guards cordoned off a long strip of seashore. A number of men perused the pebbled beach looking for traces of material from the doomed jetliner. At a makeshift memorial heaped with flowers near Sochi\u2019s old seaport, Oganes G. Melikyan recalled his old army friend, Valery M. Khalilov, who was the artistic director of the ensemble. \u201cHe was extraordinarily intelligent with a great sense of humor,\u201d Mr. Melikyan, a 58-year-old construction worker, said as he held photographs of the orchestra from his own days in the army. Photo Residents of Sochi adding to a makeshift memorial on Monday for those killed in the crash of the military passenger plane. Credit Yevgeny Reutov/European Pressphoto Agency \u201cKind and good are not enough to describe him,\u201d said the army veteran, adding that news of the death hit him \u201clike a ton of bricks fell on my head.\u201d Several couples were ensnared in the disaster, according to various Russian news reports. Dmitri Papkin, 35, a choir singer, was on an earlier plane that had already arrived in Syria. His wife, Maria Klokotkova, 34, believed to be in the dance troupe, died on the second flight. Mikhail Vasin, 25, a basso profundo in the choir, proposed to Ralina Gilmanova, a 22-year-old ballerina, last New Year\u2019s Eve. She accepted, and the couple were planning to get married early in 2017. Both were aboard the flight that crashed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Scattered band members survived because they did not go on the trip. The lead soloist, Vadim P. Ananyev, had stayed home to help his wife with their newborn. The stunned singer told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, \u201cI don\u2019t even have the words\u201d to describe the tragedy. The civilians on board included Yelizaveta P. Glinka, a prominent philanthropist who received a state award this month from President Vladimir V. Putin for her humanitarian work. She was taking a shipment of medicine to Syria. \u201cWe never know if we will return alive, because war is hell on earth, and I know what I am talking about,\u201d Ms. Glinka said at the award-presentation ceremony in the Kremlin . \u201cBut we are sure that goodness, compassion and mercy are more powerful than any weapon.\u201d The Tupolev 154 was once a workhorse of the Soviet air transportation system. Most civilian airlines have phased them out, but they are still used by government agencies. The plane that crashed over the weekend was built in 1983. Russia deployed military forces to Syria in September 2015, mainly air force bombers. Mr. Putin said at the time that he was sending forces there to fight Islamic extremists, but so far the main goal appears to have been shoring up the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian government forces with Russian backing recaptured the eastern half of Aleppo, a key rebel stronghold, last week. The Russian plane crash was the second deadly episode in a week linked to Syria, after Moscow\u2019s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated on Dec. 19 by a Turkish gunman saying he was taking revenge for Aleppo. After another crash last year, when a Russian civilian Airbus went down in the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people on board, the Russian authorities did not confirm for weeks that a bomb had been responsible, despite the Islamic State claiming responsibility hours after the episode.

    "text": "advertisement Part 1 in a Series Donald Trump was elected to president on a platform of politics not as usual, so it is fitting he inherits a world in flux. Post-World War II rules are dying, old alliances shifting and traditional roles shed. While Trump is a giant question mark on the world stage, NBC News' Chief Global Correspondent Bill Neely looks at major international challenges the president-elect faces upon inauguration on Jan. 20. LONDON \u2014 The flamboyant leader of the Philippines flew to Beijing in October and declared his nation's decades-old alliance with the United States dead . President Rodrigo Duterte said it was time to \"say goodbye\" to America and claimed that \"only China could help\" his country. By any standard, his pivot was dramatic and signaled the most important realignment in the region in decades. It was also a symbol of a major challenge facing president-elect Donald Trump \u2014 the rise of China. After hundreds of years of looking inward, China is flexing its muscles regionally by building aircraft carriers, asserting its dominance over most of the disputed South China Sea and sending troops abroad. While the U.S. remains the world's dominant military and economic power, China now is the world's second-biggest economy and has the largest military. And China will not be ignored. The relationship with China \"is the most important \u2026 for the next president to get right and will have the greatest consequences if they get it wrong,\" said Xenia Wickett of the British think tank Chatham House. President Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader in decades, is sending Washington a strong message, which is that China has changed and old assumptions about global power and American dominance don't hold anymore. Chinese President Xi Jinping steps out from behind China's flag as he takes his position for his joint news conference with President Barack Obama, on Sept. 25, 2015, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington. Evan Vucci / AP, file As a result of an assertive Beijing, Trump will have to decide whether to continue irritating Beijing by sailing aircraft carriers in waters China claims. Beijing's willingness or unwillingness to restrain North Korea's nuclear ambitions may provoke some sort of reaction from Washington. Trump has not wasted time in rattling Beijing's cage \u2014 that may hint at things to come. On the campaign trail Trump talked tough on China, accused it of \" raping\" the U.S. economy and threatened to slap huge tariffs on Chinese imports . If his future policy can be judged by his decision on personnel, China will be concerned that he has appointed Peter Navarro as head of the new trade body, the National Trade Council. Navarro is an outspoken critic of China in his books \"The Coming China Wars\" and \"Death by China.\" In his first days as president-elect, Trump spoke to the leader of a nation China regards as nothing more than a renegade province \u2014 Taiwan. Trump's telephone conversation with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on Dec. 3 was followed by the comment that he didn't feel \"bound by a one-China policy,\" which has ruled Washington-Beijing relations since President Richard Nixon's administration.

An estimated 7,100 cheetahs remain in the wild across Africa and in a small area of Iran, and human encroachment has pushed the wide-ranging predator out of 91 percent of its historic habitat, according to a study published on Monday. Consequently, the cheetah should be defined as \"endangered\" instead of the less serious \"vulnerable\" on an official watch list of threatened species worldwide, the study said. \"This period is really crunch time for species like cheetah that need these big areas,\" said Sarah Durant, a cheetah specialist at the Zoological Society of London and the lead author of the report published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A cheetah observes the plains in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve on July 24, 2008. The annual zebra and wildebeest migration is expected to attract a large number of tourists after the post-election violence when many cancelled their holidays to the country.  REUTERS/Radu Sigheti (KENYA) - RTX82TG Radu Sigheti / Reuters About 77 percent of cheetah habitats fall outside wildlife reserves and other protected areas, the study said, requiring outreach to governments and villages to promote tolerance for a carnivore that sometimes hunts livestock. Besides habitat loss, cheetahs face attacks from villagers, loss of antelope and other prey that are killed by people for their meat, an illegal trade in cheetah cubs, the trafficking of cheetah skins and the threat of getting hit by speeding vehicles. A cheetah has been recorded running at a speed of 95 feet per second. The species may move more slowly while hunting and it can only maintain top speeds for a few hundred meters. Related: Giraffes Could Face 'Silent Extinction,' Conservationists Warn More than half of the world's cheetahs live in southern Africa, including in Namibia and Botswana, which have relatively sparse human populations. Cheetahs have been virtually wiped out in Asia, save for fewer than 50 in Iran, according to the study, whose contributors included the Panthera group and the Wildlife Conservation Society. Durant said there was uncertainty over the 7,100 number, which was based on data from experts in areas where cheetahs live and estimates for other areas. Cheetahs are difficult to find because they move over vast regions, she said. Durant also led a previous assessment of nearly 6,700 cheetahs published last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which keeps a watch list of threatened species. Since then, experts have provided new information and refined counting methods, contrasting with rough estimates in the 10,000-range in recent decades. Related: U.S. Adds Seven Types of Bees to Endangered Species List for First Time The cheetah population in Zimbabwe declined from an estimated 1,500 in 1999 to between 150 and 170, according to a survey conducted between 2013 and 2015 by a group called Cheetah Conservation Project Zimbabwe. The group solicited cheetah photographs and reports of sightings from tourists, safari guides and others and interviewed more than 1,000 people, including village heads and cattle managers. Cheetah experts note that Angola is developing a plan to protect cheetahs and African wild dogs. That could yield better data on cheetah numbers in a country where information has been thin, said Rosemary Groom, a conservationist who participated in an October workshop on the subject in Angola's Quicama National Park. Despite habitat loss across the continent, the Mara area in southwest Kenya and in the adjacent Serengeti National Park in Tanzania still offers a refuge, said Femke Broekhuis, head of the Mara Cheetah Project. Recent data from a GPS collar on one Mara cheetah showed that it traveled 12 miles overnight, she said. Cheetahs often roam alone, though on Monday morning Broekhuis saw a rare sight: five male cheetahs, together. The Associated Press ",

Michael Putland / Getty Images Share advertisement Music legend George Michael, known for hit songs such as \"Faith,\" \"Freedom '90\" and holiday favorite \"Last Christmas,\" died at age 53 on Christmas Day, reportedly of heart failure. But the legacy of the pop star, who sold well over 100 million albums in the span of his career, extends far beyond his music. In this file photo from July 21, 2007, George Michael is seen performing in his 'Live 25' tour concert in Rome. Laura Antonelli / REX/Shutterstock \"George was probably the first gay pop star in the modern era, who was totally unabashed about gay sexuality,\" Martin Aston, a music journalist and author of \" Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache: How Music Came Out ,\" told NBC Out. Even though Michael was forced out of the closet, once he was out, Aston noted, \"he took a great leap forward\" and \"came out guns blazing.\" Infamous Outing Michael's moment of liberation followed what seemed at first to be a time of deep humiliation. He was blessed with sensual good looks and an exquisite voice, attributes he used to become first a teenybopper heartthrob and then a mature solo artist with videos that played up his considerable appeal. He kept his own sexual orientation private, until he was arrested in 1998 for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer. In an earlier era, that might have doomed his career. Instead of retreating, however, he made a single and video \u2014 \"Outside\" \u2014 that ridiculed the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police officers who busted him. The memorable image of the two uniformed policemen kissing in the video \u2014 both funny and outrageous at the time \u2014 helped Michael come out as a proud gay man. LGBTQ Legacy Despite his infamous outing, \"he never dealt with [his sexuality] in terms of shame,\" Aston told NBC Out. \"He realized he had to be true to himself, and that had to have helped bust that closet door open.\" George Michael performs on stage, Australia, March 1988. Michael Putland / Getty Images Aston referred to the late pop star as a \"very good role model\" and credited him with helping pave the way for openly gay contemporary artists such as Adam Lambert and Sam Smith. Smith, who tweeted Monday for the first time in more than six months, seems to agree: \"I would not be the artist I am if it wasn't for you. @GeorgeMichael.\" I would not be the artist I am if it wasn't for you. @GeorgeMichael \u2014 Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) December 26, 2016 In a separate tweet , the Grammy Award-winning artist referred to Michael as \"one of the most magical, talented, bravest & important figures in music & life as I know it.\" Adam Lambert also took to Twitter to remember the singer, writing simply \"RIP @GeorgeMichael.\" \u2014 ADAM LAMBERT (@adamlambert) December 25, 2016 While Michael was far from the first musician to come out as openly gay, his status as a mainstream pop icon and his \"huge female fan base\" made him unique, according to Aston. \"For somebody of that ilk to not worry about their career or their image and be that open about it, was incredibly positive,\" he said. \"From the time he was out, there was no sense of shame,\" Aston reiterated, adding \"the regret was that he hadn't done it sooner.\" George Michael performs on his Symphonica Tour at The LG Arena on September 16, 2012 in Birmingham, England. Dave J Hogan / Getty Images Following Michael's passing, a long list of celebrities paid tribute to the music legend, but openly gay entertainer George Takei may have said it best in a comment posted to Twitter on Christmas night: \"Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael. You've found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you.\" Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael. You've found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) December 25, 2016 (The Associated Press contributed to this reporting.)

(Nov. 29) AP Women participate in a self-defense class at the Muslim Community Network in New York on Dec. 3, 2016. (Photo: Religion News Service) Melissa Grajek was subjected to all kinds of taunts for wearing the hijab, but an incident at\u00a0\u00a0Discovery Lake in San Marcos, Calif., sealed the deal. Her 1-year-old son was playing with another boy when an irate father saw her and whisked his son away, telling Grajek: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until Trump is president because he\u2019ll send you back to where you came from.\u201d The man then scooped up a handful of wood chips and threw them at Grajek\u2019s son. At that moment, Grajek thought, enough was enough. She decided to take off her head covering. \u201cI had been on the fence regarding hijab, but that incident made it clear my religious choices could be putting my son at risk,\u201d she said. Grajek\u2019s decision to doff the hijab follows reports of assaults against Muslim women. Last week, Ilhan Omar, a\u00a0newly elected Minneapolis state representative, was leaving the White House, where she discussed\u00a0policy initiatives, when a cab driver\u00a0threatened to yank her hijab while shouting expletives and calling her \u201cISIS.\u201d Ilhan Omar speaks to a group of volunteers on Election Day in Minneapolis. \u00a0(Photo: Stephen Maturen, AFP/Getty Images) A day earlier, a man pushed a New York City transit worker down a staircase at\u00a0Grand Central Terminal, yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist, go back to your own country!\u201d And two weeks ago in Brooklyn, another man threatened an off-duty police officer with his pit bull, telling her and her son to \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d All three women were wearing hijabs. x Share Two Muslim women working for authorities in New York suffered hate crimes just 36 hours apart, officials say, following an explosion in such incidents across America since the election of Donald Trump. Video provided by AFP Newslook Assaults or intimidation of Muslims had been steadily rising well before the election, but they became more common during the divisive campaign of President-elect Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and proposed a registry for U.S. Muslims. A Pew Research Center analysis of\u00a0hate crimes statistics from the FBI shows that the number of physical assaults against Muslims reached 9/11-era levels last year. The number of anti-Muslim intimidation crimes \u2014 defined as threatening bodily harm \u2014 also rose. Now some imams across the country are saying it\u2019s OK to take\u00a0the hijab off, at least temporarily. Imam Abdullah Antepli recently asked a group of women at the Islamic Association of Raleigh (N.C.) how many of them felt unsafe in public. Dozens of hands shot up. He then told them the extraordinary circumstances under which Muslim Americans now live may require extraordinary measures \u2014 including taking off\u00a0the hijab, at least for a while. George Takei: Trump's Muslim registry is 'prelude to internment' \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be alarmist,\u201d said Antepli, the chief representative of Muslim affairs at Duke University. \u201cBut the nation is being sucked into a combustible mix. We have to think unconventionally.\u201d Antepli\u2019s call to remove the hijab, which he repeated at a mosque in Cary and in home gatherings of Muslims in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, is rare but not unheard of. In Texas, Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and resident scholar\u00a0at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, said women\u2019s fears should be taken seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s important to give our women support and validate the fear they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Suleiman said.\u00a0 \u201cFear isn\u2019t quantifiable; it\u2019s to the person\u2019s own experience.\u201d While Suleiman doesn\u2019t foresee a blanket call to abandon the head scarf, he advises women to consider practical measures, such as wearing a hoodie instead of a hijab if they feel like they may be in danger.

    "text": "Obama: I could have won third term Published               December 26, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Obama suggested in an exit interview with his former top adviser that, had he been able to run, he could have won a third term in the White House. Describing his confidence in an America that is \u201ctolerant\u201d and \u201cfull of energy,\u201d Obama said: \u201cI am confident in this vision because I'm confident that \u2026 if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump fired back Monday in a tweet: \"He should say that but I say NO WAY!\" He cited the rise of the Islamic State terror group and trouble with Obama administration agenda items including ObamaCare. The outgoing president made the comments as part of an extensive interview with David Axelrod, for his podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago. Axelrod was one of Obama\u2019s top advisers during the 2008 campaign and his first term in the White House. \u201cI know that in conversations that I've had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,\u201d Obama told Axelrod, defending his assertion. Obama was term-limited and could not run, clearing the way for his former primary rival \u2013 and secretary of state \u2013 Hillary Clinton to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2016. She nevertheless ran in large part on Obama\u2019s agenda, vowing to preserve some of his signature policies as Donald Trump and his Republican allies campaigned against them. As other top Democrats have done in the wake of President-elect Trump\u2019s victory, Obama did acknowledge that Democrats and progressives face political challenges, especially in rural areas. \u00a0 \u201cIf we can't find some way to break through what is a complicated history in the South and start winning races there and winning back Southern white voters without betraying our commitment to civil rights and diversity -- if we can do those things, then we can win elections,\u201d he said. Obama also warned about an \u201cera where we are looking for simple solutions \u2026 that we end up starting to shut ourselves off from different points of view, shutting down debate, becoming more dogmatic, becoming more brittle. And I don't see that being a successful strategy for us winning over the country.\u201d He reminded listeners that his party won the popular vote on Election Day, but said: \u201cWe don't have very good population distribution from a democratic perspective.\u201d Vice President Biden offered a somewhat tougher critique of his party in a similar exit interview with the Los Angeles Times . He said his party failed to connect with working-class, largely white voters, and warned that \u201ca bit of elitism\u201d has \u201ccrept in\u201d to party thinking. He recalled watching a Trump rally in Pennsylvania near where he grew up. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re all the people I grew up with,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re their kids. And they\u2019re not racist. They\u2019re not sexist. But we didn\u2019t talk to them.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Cuban President Raul Castro Faces Deep Problems in 2017 By andrea rodriguez, associated press HAVANA \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 7:55 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Cubans Mourn Fidel Castro 0 Shares Email Alex Romero was delighted when President Barack Obama came to Havana in March bearing the promise of a bright new future. Like so many other Cubans, the 42-year-old state photography shop employee thrilled at the president's vision of restored ties between the U.S. and Cuba . Families would reunite. A flood of American business would lift the stagnant centrally planned economy, fueling its slow path toward reform. Even as Obama spoke, an 80 percent surge in U.S. visitors was drenching state-run and private businesses with hundreds of millions of desperately needed dollars. Nine months later, the world seen from Havana looks very different. President Raul Castro faces what could be his toughest year since he took power in 2006. 2017 brings a possible economic recession and a U.S. president-elect who has promised to undo Obama's normalization unless the Cuban government makes new concessions on civil rights. Resistance to pressure from Washington is a founding principle for the Cuban communist system, making domestic concessions in exchange for continued detente a virtual impossibility. \"People expected that after Obama came there would be changes in the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba but that we could keep the best of what we have, the benefits for the people,\" Romero said. \"Trump's not going to be able to get what he wants, another type of Cuba. If the world's number one power takes us on, 2017 is going to be really bad for us.\" Castro must manage these twin economic and diplomatic challenges during a year of transition. The 85-year-old general has promised to hand over the office in early 2018 to a successor, widely expected to be Miguel Diaz-Canel, a 56-year-old official with neither the Castro name nor revolutionary credentials. The change will occur without Castro's older brother Fidel, the revolutionary leader whose largely unseen presence endowed the system he created with historical weight and credibility in the eyes of many Cubans before he died last month at 90. \"Even if those two events hadn't taken place \u2014 Trump's victory and Fidel's death \u2014 2017 was going to be a very difficult year for Cuba,\" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny Perez, a visiting professor at Keio University in Tokyo. Cuba publishes few credible economic statistics, but experts expect the country to end this year with gross domestic product growth of 1 percent or less. It maintained a rate close to 3 percent from 2011-2015. One bright spot is tourism, booming since Obama and Castro's Dec. 17, 2014, detente announcement set off a surge in overall visitor numbers, up more than 15 percent in 2015 and again this year. \"I've never seen as many tourists as I have this year,\" said Magalys Pupo, a street-corner pastry vendor in Old Havana. \"They're everywhere and they're the income that we need in this country.\" The slowness of macroeconomic growth despite a surge of interest in foreign investment and the greatest tourism boom in decades attests to both long-term mismanagement of the Cuban economy and the depth of the crisis in other sectors, particularly aid from Venezuelan in the form of deeply subsidized oil. Analysts believe that as Venezuela's Cuba-inspired socialist economy has disintegrated, exports to Cuba has dropped from 115,000 barrels daily in 2008 to 90,000 in recent years to 40,000 a day over the last few months. Venezuela was the prime destination alongside Brazil for Cuban doctors and other professionals whose salaries go directly to the Cuban government, providing another vital source of hard currency believed to be slackening in recent years. Nickel, another of Cuba's main exports, has seen a sharp price drop this year. The revenue drop may be creating a vicious cycle for Cuba's state-run industries. Experts say cutbacks in imported industrial inputs this year will lead to lower productivity in Cuba's few domestic industries in 2017 and make zero growth or recession highly likely. \"Raul Castro's government has a year left and it should be planning what needs to be done,\" said Pavel Vidal, a Cuban economist at the Universidad Javeriana in Cali, Colombia. \"Above all, it will be managing a crisis.\" The government cut back summer working hours and gas rations for state-owned vehicles and has so far avoided any sustained power outages. But a crackdown on black-market gasoline sales to taxi drivers led them to increase prices, causing drivers to raise their prices, squeezing many Cubans already struggling to get by on state salaries of about $30 a month. Many Cubans say, however, that worsening conditions could drive them to rally around the government rather than against it. \"It's going to be a tough year,\" said Antenor Stevens, a 66-year-old retired public water specialist. \"We're a people who've suffered a lot. We've felt a lot of need, but there's still a revolutionary consciousness.\" One cushion will be remittances from Cuban expatriates in the United States and other countries, estimated by some experts to be in excess of $3 billion a year and rising as Cubans flood to the United States in fear that they may soon lose special immigration privileges. Another bright spot is Cuba's growing private sector, particularly businesses boosted by increased demand from tourists. While rising food prices are a constant problem for ordinary Cubans, many of those investing in food production are finding success. Fernando Funes, owner of a farm that supplies vegetables to about 30 private restaurants in Havana, most with tourist clienteles, has nearly doubled his workforce from 12 to 20 in recent years, all earning about $25 a week. Five have begun cultivating their own plots of land alongside to produce food for sale to similar clients. \"We have a lot more opportunities to start projects these days,\" Funes said. \"Personally I'm optimistic about 2017.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Andrea Rodriguez on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ARodriguezAP Michael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein 0 Shares ",

Instead, the family lived deep in Venezuela\u2019s interior, where even cooking oil was scarce and products like bread and corn flour vanished almost as quickly as they arrived in stores. At times chicken was available, but the price was too high. Kevin and Mr. Castro had heard about an abandoned field a 45-minute walk from their home where other neighbors had been foraging for bitter yuca.

She lost her job in May, leaving her unable to afford what little food was left in the neighborhood, on the edge of what was once a prosperous oil boom town. Credit Meridith Kohut for The New York Times As they emerged from the field, four men with pistols surrounded them and demanded their cellphones, Mr. Castro said. It was a narrow brush with disaster, and the two men breathed a sigh of relief that they still had the yuca. They did not know the worst was to come. The family knew the risks of bitter yuca and had tried to dry it to extract the toxins, a practice used to make a dried bread served locally. \u201cWe had nothing else to eat,\u201d Mr. Castro said. But by 11:30 p.m. on July 25, the night before Kevin\u2019s birthday, the family was getting sick. Mr. Castro said he was vomiting. Kevin was on the floor. Because they had no car, an hour passed before they found a neighbor\u2019s car to take Kevin to the hospital. As he finally left, Kevin remembered the piece of cake. \u201cI will be back tomorrow for it,\u201d Ms. Lugo recalled him saying.

They lost their factory jobs when the economic crisis hit. Credit Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Dr. Luis Brice\u00f1o, the hospital\u2019s director, said it was a common situation at his hospital, which is stretched thin. Sometimes his emergency room, with a capacity for 200 people, is packed with 450 patients seeking help. \u201cThere is always someone who doesn\u2019t receive treatment,\u201d Dr. Brice\u00f1o said. He said medical shortages were so common that patients often had to find and buy their own supplies, like intravenous solutions, though he thought the hospital probably had some the night Kevin arrived. But Ms. Lugo said a nurse had told the family to go out and buy the intravenous solution itself. Relatives found it from a black-market seller. The cost \u2014 about $4 \u2014 was more than they could afford. Finally, another family with extra bottles of the solution gave two to Kevin, but there was little change in his condition. Around 4 a.m. on July 26, the morning of his birthday, Kevin could barely speak. \u201cHis stomach felt like stone,\u201d his mother said. Ms. Lugo was alone with her son. She recalled a black liquid oozing from his mouth. Then, at 4:45 a.m., Kevin was dead. The next morning, Jes\u00fas Maestre, a 17-year-old friend of Kevin\u2019s, saw his friends gathered outside the hall in Kevin\u2019s school. They were speaking in hushed tones. \u201cThey asked, \u2018Did you hear what happened to Kevin?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen it hit me \u2014 he was gone.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kevin\u2019s coffin was trailed by a long parade of friends the day of his funeral, a path his mother retraces every Sunday when she visits the grave. On a recent day, she pointed out the Catholic church where he was baptized and the street he played on as a child. A cousin of his walked by. \u201cLook at him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey look exactly the same.\u201d And she said it again: \u201cSince my mother raised me, and now with my children, we always had a tradition of singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 in the morning.\u201d The day of the funeral, she sang the song before the coffin was lowered. \u201cWe did everything together,\u201d Ms. Lugo said later, pointing to the headstone where her son\u2019s name had been etched in wet concrete. Gesturing toward the empty plot beside it, she said, \u201cThey will bury me there one day.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Yamilet Lugo breast-feeding on the porch with her daughter Kimberlit and her grandchild. Credit Meridith Kohut for The New York Times But back home, there were more mouths to feed. Ms. Lugo had given birth to another child two months before. Her 13-year-old daughter, Kimberlit, had recently given birth, too. The two spent an afternoon nursing the babies together on the porch. That was the only food in the household. There was nothing in the kitchen. Jesymar A\u00f1ez contributed reporting.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe presents a wreath at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl in Hono\u00adlulu on Dec. 26, 2016. (Hugh Gentry/Reuters) By David Nakamura and Brittany Lyte December 26 at 6:24 PM Follow @davidnakamura Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s historic visit to Pearl Harbor with President Obama on Tuesday punctuates the Obama administration\u2019s multiyear effort to prod Japan and its neighbors in Asia to decrease tensions by moving beyond lingering wartime grievances . But as the two leaders pay homage to the 2,403 Americans who died in the surprise Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941, the geopolitical backdrop for the event has been clouded by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pugnacious and unpredictable foreign-policy pronouncements. During the campaign, Trump raised alarms in both countries when he questioned the value of the U.S. military\u2019s basing agreements in Japan and suggested the island nation consider developing its own nuclear weapons. Abe is set to become the first Japanese leader to take part in a ceremony at the USS Arizona Memorial, which honors the American sailors and Marines who perished aboard the battleship 75\u00a0years ago. The trip, in the works before Trump\u2019s election last month, is intended as a symbolic bookend to Obama\u2019s visit in May to Hiroshima, where the United States deployed the world\u2019s first atomic bomb. Like Obama, Abe does not plan to apologize for Japan\u2019s sneak attack, which wounded an additional 1,178 and prompted the United States\u2019 entry into World War II. Rather, he will reflect on history \u201cand renew the determination of the Japanese people not to repeat the devastation of war,\u201d said Tamaki Tsukada, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington. U.S. military veterans are expected to take part in a ceremony that will be \u201ca powerful demonstration of how the two countries can overcome a very painful history to become the closest of allies and friends,\u201d Daniel Kritenbrink, the White House\u2019s senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters. The USS Arizona Memorial, marking the resting place of the crewmen killed on December 7, 1941 when Japanese Naval Forces bombed Pearl Harbor, is pictured on December 24, 2016. (Jerome Cartillier/AFP/Getty Images) Abe\u2019s visit marks another delicate step toward broader regional reconciliation in Asia, though it is unlikely to satisfy demands in South Korea and China that the Japanese government formally apologize and atone for wartime atrocities. Three of Abe\u2019s predecessors, including his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, a former prime minister, purportedly visited Pearl Harbor in the 1950s , but none took part in a ceremony to pay homage to the dead over concerns about right-wing political opposition in Japan. Such a visit seemed unlikely as recently as three years ago, when Abe, leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, visited Tokyo\u2019s Yasukuni Shrine, the paean to Japan\u2019s wartime dead, in a move that inflamed regional tensions and irritated the White House. The Obama administration has sought to improve relations in Asia, especially between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, to hedge against China\u2019s rise and address shared challenges, such as a nuclear-armed North Korea. Since then, Tokyo has negotiated, with support from the White House, a resolution with Seoul over the forced use of women as sex slaves by Japan\u2019s imperial army. And Abe expressed remorse for the war during remarks to a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress last year ahead of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Obama\u2019s speech in Hiroshima , where he warned of the danger of nuclear weapons and urged disarmament, was well received in Japan, prompting Abe to pursue the reciprocal visit to Pearl Harbor. Obama is in Hawaii for his annual two-week winter vacation. Their visit \u201cis a demonstration about how far the world has come in many instances,\u201d said Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D), the son of a World War II veteran who in 2014 became the state\u2019s second governor of Japanese ancestry. About one-sixth of Hawaii\u2019s population is of Japanese ancestry, and Japan sent 1.5\u00a0million tourists to the state last year, more than any other country. Abe, who arrived in Oahu on Monday, opened his visit with a wreath-laying ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, a military cemetery known as Punchbowl. The prime minister is scheduled to have a formal bilateral meeting with Obama before visiting the USS Arizona Memorial. Ige said the relationship between the Japanese people and Hawaii \u201cis more than business, more than friendship \u2014 it\u2019s family.\u201d He called the U.S.-Japan military alliance \u201cthe most important to keeping the peace in Asia.\u201d The question is what becomes of that alliance under Trump. Along with questioning U.S. basing agreements in Japan and South Korea, Trump suggested in March that the two U.S. allies are freeloading off the United States\u2019 security umbrella. His suggestion that they consider developing their own nuclear weapons drew sharp rebukes from the Obama White House, which called the idea \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d and national security experts in both political parties. Trump also has vowed to rip up the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration that includes Japan. Abe expended significant political capital to move the accord through the Japanese parliament over objections from protectionist domestic rice and automobile industries. Within days of Trump\u2019s election, Abe rushed to begin building ties, becoming the first foreign leader to meet with the president-elect during a stopover in New York in November en route to an Asia-Pacific economic summit in Peru. \u201cTrump\u2019s campaign rhetoric is campaign rhetoric,\u201d said Tsukada, the embassy spokesman. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the electorate or constituents take those message literally. In fact, you might have noticed that throughout the campaign, at one stage his rhetoric was extremely anti-Japan, with Japan-bashing type of language, but after a certain point it disappeared. By and large, we think he has a normal kind of balance.\u201d Some foreign-policy analysts have speculated that Abe will seek to leverage the uncertainty around Trump\u2019s agenda to speed his own long-standing efforts to bolster the mission and capabilities of Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces. Abe played host this month to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, who visited the prime minister\u2019s home town, in a bid to improve bilateral relations between their countries. That meeting, which had been in the works before Trump\u2019s victory, caused consternation in Washington. Trump\u2019s antagonistic posture toward China, including his unprecedented phone conversation with the president of Taiwan this month, also has unsettled the region. Analysts said Abe would welcome a shift of U.S. policy toward Taiwan, but they cautioned that China\u2019s response to an escalation of tensions with the Trump administration could be aimed at Japan, as well. Tokyo is \u201crelatively reassured that [Trump\u2019s] campaign rhetoric of extreme isolationism is gone, but the unpredictability factor is still the biggest challenge,\u201d said Sheila Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhat Abe will want to do with Trump is to hug him close, and teach him about Japan and Asia. \u201cI suspect they\u2019re holding their breath a little bit,\u201d Smith added. \u201cBut I do think in Mr. Abe\u2019s personal visit and his subsequent follow-up, he\u2019s trying to be the ally of choice for Mr. Trump.\u201d Lyte reported from Hono\u00adlulu. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "December 26, 20164:52 AM ET Doreen McCallister One of President-elect Donald Trump's top aides unexpectedly announced over the holiday weekend that he will not accept a position at the White House. Trump rounded out his White House communications team last week \u2014 installing several trusted campaign advisers to senior West Wing positions. Among them was Jason Miller who was named director of communications. But on Saturday, Miller issued a personal statement saying he wouldn't be joining the Trump team as announced \u2014 adding he wanted to spend more time with his family. Miller said the job would be too demanding and that his growing family was more important. He and his wife are expecting their second child next month. Sean Spicer, who last week was named White House press secretary, will take over the duties of communications director, Miller said in his statement. Spicer is a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Joining Spicer in the West Wing will be Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who will be director of strategic communications, and Dan Scavino, who will be director of social media. Both Hicks and Scavino had the same roles in Trump's presidential campaign. Also on Thursday, the Trump transition team announced the Kellyanne Conway will serve as counselor to the president. Article continues after sponsorship Conway was the third and final manager of the successful Trump campaign. She often served as an on-camera spokeswoman for Trump and is credited with bringing much-needed discipline to both the campaign's message and the candidate himself. ",

By Lenny Bernstein and Philip Rucker December 25 Follow @LennyMBernstein Follow @PhilipRucker Twitter messages apparently posted by one of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s aides have added some intrigue to the sudden resignation of Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s choice for communications director. A tweet from the account of A.J. Delgado, an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign and a member of the transition team, appeared Thursday with the message: \u201cCongratulations to the baby-daddy on being named WH \u00adComms Director!\u201d Delgado also appeared to call Miller \u201cThe 2016 version of John Edwards,\u201d a reference to the former U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate who carried on an extramarital affair with his campaign videographer. Two other tweets called on Miller to resign \u2014 which he did. \u201cWhen people need to resign graciously and refuse to, it\u2019s a bit . . . spooky,\u201d one tweet read. It was followed by another saying Miller \u201cneeded to resign . . . yesterday.\u201d Delgado deactivated her Twitter account Saturday and could not be reached for comment \u00adSunday. Miller, who had been named Thursday to the high-level post of overseeing White House communications strategy, unexpectedly announced Christmas Eve that the West Wing job would be too demanding and he wanted to focus on his family. 1 of 31 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

Cliff Owen/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The departure of Miller, one of Trump\u2019s top campaign advisers and a leading spokesman for his transition efforts, has been an unwelcome distraction for the transition team as it assembles a government. \u201cAfter spending this past week with my family, the most amount of time I have been able to spend with them since March 2015, it is clear they need to be my top priority right now and this is not the right time to start a new job as demanding as White House Communications Director,\u201d Miller said in a statement. He added: \u201cMy wife and I are also excited about the arrival of our second daughter in January, and I need to put them in front of my career. I look forward to continuing to support the President-elect from outside after my work on the Transition concludes.\u201d Contacted on Sunday about the Twitter messages, Miller said in an email that \u201cI\u2019ll let my previous statement stand at this time.\u201d Delgado, an attorney, is a former columnist for Mediaite and was one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders during the campaign. In early October, as some Republicans abandoned Trump after a videotape revealed lewd talk years earlier by the GOP nominee, Delgado tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s talk has zero impact on how his policies would affect Americans. But sure, let\u2019s waste a day in the Ivory Tower feigning outrage.\u201d She frequently defended him in TV appearances during the campaign. Sean Spicer, a veteran GOP operative who was named White House press secretary, will take over what were expected to be Miller\u2019s duties and will also have the title of communications director, Miller said in the statement. According to the New York Post, Delgado, Miller and another Trump aide were seen in a Las Vegas Strip club on the night before the final presidential debate in October with three employees from CNN, NBC and ABC. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Miller, who has worked as a political consultant at Jamestown Associates, has a long history in GOP politics. Miller joined Trump\u2019s campaign as senior communications adviser shortly before the \u00adRepublican National Convention, after serving as a top communications aide for the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). He oversaw the Trump \u00adcampaign\u2019s communications throughout the general election. He continued in that role during the transition, sharing lead spokesman duties with Spicer. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The oil fields of the Uintah Basin, southeast of Vernal, Utah. (Trent Nelson / Salt Lake Tribune) William Yardley Contact Reporter The election of Donald Trump has thrilled many people across the West\u2019s oil and gas industry who say his promises to roll back regulations will free it from unfair and unnecessary obstacles\u00a0imposed by President Obama . \u201cIf the Trump administration does nothing but stop being hostile to us, we\u2019ll be happy,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance. Yet how much will things really change under a Trump\u00a0administration? Even as some\u00a0in the oil and gas industry are optimistic \u2014 and\u00a0as conservation groups gird for protests and court fights to protect public lands \u2014 experts say blaming government, or giving it too much credit, for restricting oil and gas is mostly missing the point. If another Western energy boom is around the corner, they say, it will be because prices rise, not because regulations decline. \u201cThe market is the elephant in the room,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research, an industry consulting firm. \u201cAll this other talk about access to public lands and such for oil and gas, it\u2019s a pretty minor issue.\u201d Although the Obama administration is often criticized by the fossil fuel industry, it presided over a boom that saw domestic oil and gas production soar. The administration allowed a broad and controversial expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which infuriated many conservation groups while it transformed parts of North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and the Rockies into meccas for energy workers and the United States became a powerful new global energy player. \u201cFor a Democrat, he\u2019s really been pro-oil,\u201d Lynch said of Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s been a lot nicer to oil than some Republicans.\u201d But the boom helped deflate itself by driving up supply\u00a0and driving down prices for oil and gas. Around the same time, the administration began paying more attention to climate change \u2014 limiting emissions from power plants and methane from oil and gas production, removing certain public lands from energy development, and rejecting or withholding decisions on projects such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. Those efforts, which intensified in 2015 before the Paris climate talks, came to define the Obama administration in the minds of many in the industry. Sgamma, who has praised Trump\u2019s selection of people who question climate science  for top positions in his administration,\u00a0said\u00a0that in the last two years her group, which is based in Denver, had fought to shape 71 regulatory processes initiated under the Obama administration and that it had submitted 62,000 pages of documentation while doing so. She\u00a0said regulations reduce production during periods of low prices because they raise the floor price at which production is profitable. \u201cThe industry is cautiously optimistic on the market front but a bit exuberant on the political front,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cActually, take away the \u2018a bit.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Federal approval processes do take longer than state processes, which the energy industry often cites as sufficient. But complaints over regulatory delays have persisted for decades, through Democratic and Republican administrations. \u201cTwenty years ago, someone said, \u2018The best day of your career is when you get a lease on federal lands and the worst day in your career is when you get a lease on federal lands,\u2019 because it\u2019s such a pain,\u201d said Lynch, who favors a faster federal process. Sarp Ozkan, a manager of drilling analytics for Drillinginfo.com, said that with benchmark oil prices currently well below $60 a barrel, companies are inclined to focus on known sources such as the Permian Basin of West Texas rather than explore public lands. But Ozkan did say Trump could make a difference. Should he approve a project like the Dakota Access pipeline, for example, that could make drilling in western North Dakota more profitable at lower prices because transporting oil by pipeline is cheaper than  by rail. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be focusing on what makes you the most money, what gets you the quickest return on your capital,\u201d Ozkan said of industry. Michael Freeman, a staff attorney for the law firm Earthjustice who specializes in oil and gas issues, noted that energy companies retain hundreds of leases on public lands in the West that they are not acting on because of low prices. \u201cThis idea that the current administration has been strangling the industry by over-regulating them is just not accurate factually,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThey\u2019re got plenty of permits to drill if they want to drill.\u201d This month,\u00a0the global energy company BP announced plans to open  an office in Denver. At first glance, the move might seem like evidence of the\u00a0exuberance Sgamma described. In announcing the move, BP, which will transfer 200 people from Houston to a new building in the city\u2019s trendy Lower Highlands area in early 2018, said the decision\u00a0was driven by its desire \u201cto be closer to its substantial asset position in the Rocky Mountain region and an important energy hub of the future.\u201d But the company\u00a0says that future took shape long before Trump stunned the world with his victory in November, that the move\u00a0was motivated by the changing energy market, not a changing administration, and that it reflects a broader awareness that dependence on fossil fuels will decline as the world fights climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s an abundance of natural gas in the Rockies,\u201d David Lawler, chief executive of BP\u2019s Lower 48 division, said in an interview. \u201cAs a company, our strategy is to grow more toward gas. We see it as an environmentally friendly bridge fuel to the future as renewables become more important. It has a lower carbon footprint, and that\u2019s part of our strategy as we go forward.\u201d Lawler, who grew up in Denver and graduated from the Colorado School of Mines, said BP was optimistic about the Trump administration but uncertain of what might change. \u201cWe worked well with the Obama administration, and we look forward to working with the Trump administration as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really see a red wellhead or a blue wellhead. We think it\u2019s energy that\u2019s vital to America and we want to provide that energy to America and do it in a way that protects the environment.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss George Michael \u00a0is dead at 53; South Asian immigrants \u00a0take\u00a0a gamble and lose; Christmas dinner at Midnight Mission ; and the pressure is on for\u00a0 D.A.

The campus of low-rise buildings has been added to Preservation Chicago's list of the city's seven most-threatened historic places. (Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune) Angela Caputo Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune With an overhaul imminent for the only large public housing complex on Chicago's North Side, a decades-old legal battle over segregation has been reignited. A team of public interest lawyers petitioned a federal judge last month to require the Chicago Housing Authority to replace hundreds of family-friendly apartments on the North Side now that it's only a matter of time before they are lost in the redevelopment of the Julia C. Lathrop Homes. Housing activists have long feared that Lathrop, a historic complex that stretches across 32 acres in the affluent neighborhood of Lincoln Park, would eventually be turned over to a private developer that would replace scarce North Side housing for low-income families with upscale units. Next month, financing is expected to close on the redevelopment project, freeing up money to begin building, or reconfiguring, more than 1,100 units on the sprawling riverfront campus. Roughly a third of the apartments will be reserved for public housing residents. (Blair Kamin) But now, housing officials and advocates have reached a truce of sorts. The housing authority and the nonprofit Business and Professional People for the Public Interest recently reached an agreement over the Lathrop replacements that will add to the stock of North Side housing and avert potential delays. While the agreement has buoyed housing activists, they have concerns about how it will be carried out. For example, there is no mandate on whether the apartments will have to be as large as those demolished at Lathrop. At minimum, they will all have one bedroom. And the housing authority won't be under any time pressure to create the new housing. \"We could set an arbitrary deadline, but we'd have to change it,\" said Julie Brown, an attorney with Business and Professional People for the Public Interest. The housing authority will be required, however, to provide progress reports. In a statement, housing authority officials said that they \"are pleased that, given the long-standing partnership between BPI and CHA, new, quality affordable housing will be made available to low-income residents on the North Side of Chicago.\" The agreement is long in coming. For years, the complex \u2014 which opened in 1938 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places \u2014 has been steadily emptying out, following a 16-year leasing freeze. Today, just a small fraction \u2014 142 of 925 \u2014 of Lathrop's red brick walkups remain occupied. Boards nailed over windows have become unofficial tally marks of each family that has moved out. One of the few signs that there's still life inside is the bursts of steam that pour out of a chimney that towers over a busy stretch of Damen Avenue. The stillness is ever in contrast to the construction boom \u2014 of homes, condos and big-box stores \u2014 in the neighborhood around it. ",

    "text": "Fans mourn pop's George Michael as charities reveal his work Remembering George Michael from Wham! through his career as a solo artist. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Grieving fans on Monday mourned the death of George Michael as British charities revealed that the pop star had secretly been a major behind-the-scenes donor who gave his time and money to support cherished causes. The man with the reputation for self-indulgence had actually given millions of pounds (dollars) to charities involved with helping children, cancer victims and AIDS sufferers. He was also remembered for small acts of kindness: helping his village in north London get a Christmas tree, and volunteering at a homeless shelter. Former Beatle Paul McCartney posted a statement on his website praising Michael's \"sweet soul music,\" which he said will live on. The singer's death was announced late Sunday. Many paid tribute on Facebook and Twitter and others cited years of good works that received little publicity \u2014 largely because Michael insisted on keeping his charity work out of the limelight. Fans placed flowers and other tributes at his homes in north London and in Goring, England, where he died of apparent heart failure. Michael's later years were marked by occasional brushes with the law and a series of driving incidents related to substance abuse, but this was overlooked Monday as directors of major charities and advocacy groups stepped forward to praise him. Among the groups he supported were the Terrence Higgins Trust, which helps people with AIDS, Macmillan Cancer Support, and Childline, which offers confidential phone counseling for young people. Childline founder Esther Rantzen said Michael gave royalties from his 1996 hit \"Jesus To A Child\" to the charity along with many other donations. George Michael , who died at home in England at the age of 53 , was a perfect fit for MTV when he made his debut with Wham! in the '80s. When Michael embarked on a successful... From neon fingerless gloves to aviator sunglasses paired with a leather jacket draped with a string of pearls, British singer George Michael , who died at home in England at the age of 53 , was a perfect fit for MTV when he made his debut with Wham! in the '80s. When Michael embarked on a successful... (Chicago Tribune staff) \"Over the years he gave us millions and we were planning next year, as part of our 30th anniversary celebrations to create, we hoped, a big concert in tribute to him \u2014 to his artistry, to his wonderful musicality but also to thank him for the hundreds of thousands of children he helped,\" she said. She said Michael was determined that no one outside the charity should know \"how much he gave to the nation's most vulnerable children.\" Jane Barron from the Terrence Higgins Trust said Michael made many donations and gifts, including the royalties of his \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" duet with Elton John in 1991. Michael had spoken publicly about the pain of losing a partner to AIDS early in the epidemic, but he kept his long history of donations to the Trust private. Rights activist Peter Tatchell, who knew Michael before he achieved fame, said Michael had hidden his homosexuality in the early part of his career because gay public figures were subjected to vicious treatment by the British tabloid press. He praised the singer for making his sexual orientation known after he was arrested in 1998 for lewd behavior in a public toilet in Los Angeles. Tatchell said Michael's response to his arrest amounted to \"a defiant defense of the right to be gay\" that had an impact throughout the gay community. Associated Press ",

You were a vindictive, nasty year marred by fake news, mean people, and countless hacks. But for all the bad, there were some heartwarming and hilarious spots in the world of tech. As the year draws to a close, here's a look at some of the top tech talkers - both the sweet and the sour - that helped encapsulate the year in technology. \"Your revenge has been served well, cold and (until now) anonymously.\" - Nick Denton, founder of Gawker Nick Denton penned a letter to Peter Thiel after the PayPal billionaire was revealed to be financing the Hulk Hogan sex tape lawsuit against the Gawker website. Thiel explained his motivation for going after the popular, snarky site in a New York Times editorial, writing, \"As an internet entrepreneur myself, I feel partly responsible for a world in which private information can be instantly broadcast to the whole planet. I also know what it feels like to have one's own privacy violated.\" Thiel's side ultimately won. Gawker's assets were sold to Univision and the flagship site was shuttered. SpaceX founder Elon Musk speaks during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. Refugio Ruiz / AP \"I really don't have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets, except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multi-planetary.\" - Elon Musk Thiel's old PayPal friend Elon Musk finally revealed his master plan in September for how he wants to help colonize Mars. I'M ONE OF THE TOP WOMEN IN THE WORLD \u2014 Caity Weaver (@caityweaver) October 4, 2016 \"I've always considered myself one of the top women in the world, so I would say this shows excellent judgement on his part.\" - Caity Weaver, upon hearing that she was the only woman Elon Musk followed on Twitter GQ reporter and former Gawker star Caity Weaver was, for a brief time, the only woman in the world Musk followed. It appears he's since hit the unfollow button. The follow came around the same time a Motherboard analysis of Musk's Twitter account revealed he didn't follow any women. (Musk said he only follows news organizations and has an equal balance of the sexes on Instagram.)

It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?

Leslie Jones attends the 2016 American Museum of Natural History Museum Gala at the American Museum of Natural History on Nov. 17 in New York City. Michael Loccisano / Getty Images \"I was recently hacked myself...Yeah, all they did was release some nude pics of me, which is nothing because I don't know if you all know this about me, but I ain't shy.\" - Leslie Jones Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones talked about her hacking ordeal on \"Weekend Update.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during an event at the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. PETER DASILVA / EPA \"Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it's a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.\" - Mark Zuckerberg The Facebook CEO was responding to critics who said his social network helps spread fake news. Zuckerberg addressed the issue in subsequent posts, and ultimately implemented a plan to stop fake news sites from making money and easier ways for people to report it when they see it. Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook discusses the iPhone 7 during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \"The courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.\" - Apple's Phil Schiller, on the missing headphone jack Apple's senior vice president of marketing gave a moving eulogy to the 3mm headphone jack as he introduced the new port in the iPhone 7. \"I'm a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri.\" - author Mustafa Bayoumi responding to Trump's call to report suspicious activity Author Mustafa Bayoumi had one of the most viral tweets of the election, playing off a remark from Trump asking Muslims to report suspicious activity. During the second presidential debate, when Trump had been accused by some of \"stalking\" Clinton around the stage, Bayoumi took to Twitter to do his part. Alyssa Newcomb ",

A massive search operation has been underway ever since, The Associated Press reports: \"On Monday, more than 3,500 people on 45 ships \u2014 including 135 divers from across Russia \u2014 were sweeping a vast crash site in the Black Sea and along the shore, according to the Defense Ministry. Ten helicopters, drones and two deep-water submersibles were being used to help spot bodies and debris. The search area covered over 10 square kilometers (about 4 square miles) and was plagued by underwater currents. \"Divers in the afternoon found parts of the jet a mile away from the shore and 25 meters (82 feet) under the sea, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Some of the debris was recovered and divers were going back into the water to search for more, it said, adding the fuselage has not been found yet. \"The plane's black boxes have not been found yet either, Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Puchkov said. Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said plane's flight recorders did not have radio beacons, so locating them in the water was going to be challenging.\" Article continues after sponsorship A day of mourning has been declared in Russia. \"The crash of a military plane hit especially hard because 64 members of a world-famous military choir were on board,\" Lucian Kim reports. \"They were on their way to perform for Russian personnel in Syria.\" Also on the plane was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor renowned for her charity work. \"She's a famous humanitarian activist \u2014 she was helping children in Ukraine a lot, she was helping some hospitals in Syria,\" the BBC's Olga Ivshina reports. Ivshina says mourners in Moscow have gravitated to two sites \u2014 where the choir was based, and where Glinka was working. ",

(Photo: Carnegie Institution of Washington via AP) PRINCETON, N.J. \u2014\u00a0Vera Rubin, a pioneering astronomer who helped find powerful evidence of dark matter, has died, her son said Monday. She was 88. Allan Rubin, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University, told The Associated Press his mother died Sunday night of natural causes. He said the Philadelphia native had been living in the Princeton area. Vera Rubin found that galaxies don\u2019t quite rotate the way they were predicted, and that lent support to the theory that some other force was at work, namely dark matter. Dark matter, which hasn\u2019t been directly observed, makes up 27%\u00a0of the universe \u2014 as opposed to 5% of the universe being normal matter. Scientists better understand what dark matter isn\u2019t rather than what it is. Rubin\u2019s scientific achievements earned her numerous honors, including becoming the second female astronomer to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She also received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in 1993 \u201cfor her pioneering research programs in observational cosmology.\u201d Rubin\u2019s interest in astronomy began as a young girl and grew with the involvement of her father, Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer who helped her build a telescope and took her to meetings of amateur astronomers. She was the only astronomy major to graduate from Vassar College in 1948. When she sought to enroll as a graduate student at Princeton, she learned women were not allowed in the university\u2019s graduate astronomy program, so she instead earned her master\u2019s degree from Cornell University. Rubin earned her doctorate from Georgetown University, where she later worked as a faculty member for several years before working at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, a nonprofit scientific research center. During her career, Rubin examined more than 200 galaxies. 38 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ho7mNM NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Vera Rubin works at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., in 1965. Carnegie Institution hide caption toggle caption Vera Rubin works at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., in 1965. Carnegie Institution Vera Rubin, the groundbreaking astrophysicist who discovered evidence of dark matter, died Sunday night at the age of 88, the Carnegie Institution confirms. Rubin did much of her revelatory work at Carnegie. The organization's president calls her a \"national treasure.\" In the 1960s and 1970s, Rubin was working with astronomer Kent Ford, studying the behavior of spiral galaxies, when they discovered something entirely unexpected \u2014 the stars at the outside of the galaxy were moving as fast as the ones in the middle, which didn't fit with Newtonian gravitational theory. The explanation: Dark matter. Adam Frank, an astrophysicist who writes for NPR's 13.7 blog, described dark matter by comparing it to a ghost in a horror movie. You can't see it, he writes \u2014 \"but you know it's with you because it messes with the things you can see.\" Adam continued : \"It was Vera Rubin's famous work in the 1970s that showed pretty much all spiral galaxies were spinning way too fast to be accounted for by the gravitational pull of the their 'luminous' matter (the stuff we see in a telescope). Rubin and others reasoned there had to be a giant sphere of invisible stuff surrounding the stars in these galaxies, tugging on them and speeding up their orbits around the galaxy's center.\" Article continues after sponsorship The existence of dark matter had been proposed by Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s, but hadn't been confirmed until Rubin's work. If Dark Matter Can't Be Seen, What About Ghosts? Now it's believed that more than 90 percent of the universe is composed of dark matter \u2014 but it remains \"invisible\" and \"mysterious,\" NPR's Rob Stein reports. In addition to her groundbreaking work on dark matter, Vera Rubin was a pioneering advocate of women in the sciences. She was passionate about astronomy from the age of 10. Rubin once explained to an interviewer that it's not like she was planning on breaking into an all-male world. \"I didn't know a single astronomer, male or female,\" she said in the interview, republished in her book Bright Galaxies, Dark Matters. \"I didn't think that all astronomers were male, because I didn't know.\" But as her career advanced, the scarcity of women in her field was readily apparent. According to a profile of Rubin from Cosmic Horizons, she was the only astronomy major to graduate from the women's college Vassar in 1948. She was rebuffed by Princeton's astronomy program because it didn't accept women, a policy in place until 1975. Instead, she studied at Cornell and Georgetown \u2014 where, she notes, she started her Ph.D. program at the age of 23, with one young child and another on the way. She was the first woman allowed to observe at Caltech's Palomar Observatory, the Carnegie Institution says. Rubin, who was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and awarded the National Medal of Science, continually pushed for women to be admitted to scientific institutions and organizations. \"I live and work with three basic assumptions,\" Rubin once wrote: \"1) There is no problem in science that can be solved by a man that cannot be solved by a woman. \"2) Worldwide, half of all brains are in women. \"3) We all need permission to do science, but, for reasons that are deeply ingrained in history, this permission is more often given to men than to women.\" Rubin also advocated for scientific literacy in the world at large. \"We need senators who have studied physics and representatives who understand ecology,\" she said in a commencement address in 1996. And \u2014 appropriately for a woman whose most famous discovery is an enduring mystery \u2014 she expressed a deep appreciation for all that remains unknown about the universe. \"No one promised that we would live in the era that would unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. The edge of the universe is far beyond our grasp,\" she wrote in her book's preface . \"We have peered into a new world and have seen that it is more mysterious and more complex than we had imagined. Still more mysteries of the universe remain hidden. Their discovery awaits the adventurous scientists of the future. I like it this way.\" ",

    "text": "Will the Fed's Janet Yellen 'take away the punch bowl' after Trump takes office? Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen listens to a reporter's question during a news conference in December. Alex Brandon / Associated Press Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen listens to a reporter's question during a news conference in December. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen listens to a reporter's question during a news conference in December. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press) Don Lee and Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporters After three years of almost single-handedly juicing up the slow-growing economy, Janet L. Yellen and the Federal Reserve should be looking at easier days ahead. Yellen, in what will probably be her last full year as Fed chair, may\u00a0finally get help from somewhere else in Washington. Tax cuts and infrastructure spending planned by President-elect Donald Trump , if backed by the Republican-controlled Congress , would lighten the load for a Fed whose easy-money policies have been the primary economic support for the nation. She is already\u00a0breathing\u00a0easier on the Fed\u2019s employment mandate; the jobless rate has fallen\u00a0to a nine-year low of 4.6%. Inflation, too, is under control and, by all accounts, creeping toward the central bank\u2019s optimal level of 2%. And yet, Yellen\u00a0may come under as much economic and political pressure\u00a0as ever, on both the Fed\u2019s policy and the independence of the institution. The Trump administration is almost certain\u00a0to push back as she and her colleagues lift interest rates from historical lows. The Fed began with a small increase in its benchmark rate earlier this month, only the second rise in more than a decade. But officials signaled a quickening of rate hikes in 2017. \u00a0 Fear of a Trump-triggered recession gives way to hope for short-term economic boost \u00bb As a presidential candidate, Trump offered contradictory views\u00a0when it came to the Fed. He first applauded Yellen, saying he, too, was a \u201clow-interest-rate person.\u201d Later he accused the Fed leader\u00a0of keeping rates low for political reasons and said he would most likely replace Yellen\u00a0when her four-year term expires in early\u00a02018. Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said after his selection that he thinks Yellen has done a good job. No one knows for sure where Trump and his economic team stand on monetary policy. The New York real estate developer, who has capitalized\u00a0on cheap rates, didn\u2019t comment or tweet\u00a0about the Fed\u2019s widely expected rate bump on Dec. 14. But if history is any guide, he\u2019s not likely to favor faster interest rate increases. \u201cNo president ever does,\u201d said Alice Rivlin, a former Fed vice chairwoman from 1996 to 1999. That\u2019s because higher interest rates increase\u00a0borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which tends to slow lending and investments. The interest-sensitive housing market will be particularly vulnerable. The 10-year bond yield, a benchmark for mortgages, already has jumped to 2.6% from 1.8% in early November, on expectations that a major fiscal stimulus would lift economic growth and inflation. Fed policymakers have forecast the equivalent of three quarter-point rate increases for next year, but some economists see four or more hikes coming. And while Yellen has been cautious to reserve judgment on any anticipated fiscal stimulus, she seemed somewhat cool to the idea when asked at a news conference immediately after the Fed\u2019s rate increase announcement. \u201cI do want to make clear that I have not recommended running a hot economy as some sort of experiment,\u201d she said. Like other economists, Yellen may be questioning whether this is the right time for a massive fiscal stimulus. Given that the economy is at or near full employment \u2013 the point where much faster growth could spur inflation \u2013 Yellen will be watching carefully\u00a0and could\u00a0\u201ctake away the punch bowl just as the party gets going,\u201d as the famous saying goes on the Fed\u2019s job to keep the economy from overheating. Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist and a fellow at the\u00a0Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he couldn\u2019t recall a period when there was\u00a0a large fiscal injection at a time\u00a0the economy was at full employment. The last big stimulus package, about\u00a0$800 billion of federal spending and tax cuts, was\u00a0passed at the start of President Obama\u2019s first term in early 2009 to fight the Great Recession. How Trump could use the presidency to help his business interests \u00bb \u201cThe opportunity for fiscal stimulus in doing good is gone,\u201d Gagnon said, arguing that if anything, it would\u00a0only cause the Fed to raise rates faster. With more money chasing higher rates in the U.S., he said, that would push up the dollar, which in turn would hurt\u00a0the housing market and Trump\u2019s effort to correct the nation\u2019s trade imbalance. As former Fed officials and historians know, White House staff in the past, for example in the Nixon administration, leaned on the Fed to back off raising rates and keep the money supply flowing. Even so, most economists don\u2019t think Trump should be worried about Yellen taking away the punch bowl. For one thing, even if the Fed raised rates four times next year, the so-called federal funds rate would still probably end 2017 at 1.5% to 1.75% \u2014 well below normal for the benchmark overnight lending level. \u201cYellen\u2019s largely off the hook for being a spoiler next year. She won\u2019t be able to raise rates far enough to make a difference,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, managing director at Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group in New York. Rather than from the Fed, the Trump administration is more likely to face constraints from financial markets as investors react to prospects of faster economic growth and inflation, says Lynn Reaser, chief economist for Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. \u201cThe challenge to fiscal policy, interest rates and the dollar \u2013 those are not being led by the Fed but by the markets,\u201d she said. At the moment, it\u2019s hard to see inflation getting out of hand. Inflation has been well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target over the last few years and most recently was running about 1.5%. Wage gains are starting to pick up. But the stronger dollar and global competitive pressures on commodities and other goods are curbing inflation, as is a major predictor of future inflation:\u00a0consumer expectations of price increases. Rivlin, the former Fed vice chairwoman, says one indication of just how tempered those expectations are can be seen in the mock exercise she does with her students. \u201cI can\u2019t even get them interested in inflation as a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are 20-somethings and they\u2019ve never heard of inflation \u2014 \u00a0and that\u2019s a very large portion of the population.\u201d To be sure, Yellen and the Fed could determine that the economic engine is running too fast and then act more aggressively to slow growth, in effect leading, not following, the markets in setting higher interest rates. That would more likely put the Fed in the crosshairs of the new president, who has spoken of doubling annual economic growth to 4%. I think her public relations operation is going to have to be strong. \u2014 Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) \u201cIt very definitely could be a dicey year\u201d for Yellen, said Reaser. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant turning point from monetary to fiscal policy, and you have the challenge [from Trump] to the notion that a 2% growth track is the new normal.\u201d On top of potential clashes over policy, Trump and an emboldened Republican-controlled Congress appear eager to rein in the century-old Fed, by authorizing so-called audits of its monetary policy decisions and reducing its regulatory power. \u201cI expect this is going to be a target of the Trump administration,\u201d said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. Republican lawmakers have been critical of the Fed since the central bank\u2019s aggressive steps \u2014\u00a0emergency lending, repeated bond purchases \u2014 \u00a0taken during\u00a0the financial crisis and slow recovery under Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and then-Vice Chairwoman Yellen. More recently, Waters said, \u201cthey have not liked the fact that she\u2019s been responsible for holding down interest rates.\u201d There are two vacancies on the Fed\u2019s seven-member Board of Governors that Trump will be able to fill, and a third slot could open up if  Daniel Tarullo steps down in 2017 as some expect. Yellen, for her part, has made it emphatically clear that she intends to serve out her term as chairwoman until it ends Feb. 3, 2018. Interest rate policies aside, some influential Republican lawmakers want the Fed to make changes in the way it operates. \u201cThem getting more sensitive and acknowledging what\u2019s happening in the marketplace does not somehow take away the reason for having more predictability and less opacity,\u201d said Rep. Bill\u00a0 Huizenga (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s monetary policy and trade panel. \u00a0\u201cJust because they raised rates a quarter point does not suddenly let them off the hook.\u201d Huizenga\u2019s bill, called the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act, passed the House by 241 to 185 in 2015. The legislation would require the Fed to develop a rule-based formula for interest rate moves and allow the Government Accountability Office to review monetary policy decisions. The Fed\u2019s other activities already are subject to audits and GAO reviews. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern that they\u2019ve continued to get more and more political in terms of their decision-making. They keep saying they want to make their decisions data-driven. What\u2019s the data?\u201d Huizenga said. Yellen has told lawmakers that enacting the legislation would be \u201ca grave mistake.\u201d She has expressed concerns that additional audits would \u201cpoliticize monetary policy and bring short-term political pressures into the deliberations.\u201d What\u2019s more, Yellen, like Bernanke before her, has argued that a rule-based formula for interest rate decisions would tie the central bank\u2019s hands, rendering it\u00a0inflexible to deal with extreme situations such as the Great Recession. John B. Taylor, a Hoover Institution economist whose name is associated with the Taylor Rule, which prescribes interest rate changes following the movement of inflation and output, has championed the idea that adhering to a\u00a0rule-based system would help guide the Fed and help the public understand\u00a0the principles behind the central bank\u2019s\u00a0actions and when policymakers deviate from them. Thus far, Yellen and Bernanke have fended off sometimes-intense congressional pressures for tougher restrictions on the institution. Waters, who opposes Huizenga\u2019s bill, said Yellen will need to spend time in 2017 talking with lawmakers to try to stop it. Yellen has met frequently with members of Congress from both parties, and that is expected to continue, if not increase. For the first 10 months of this year, Yellen\u2019s publicly released calendar showed 27 phone calls or face-to-face meetings with House and Senate members. \u201cI think her public relations operation is going to have to be strong,\u201d Waters said.

The new research project is using zebrafish to identify the genetic and environmental factors that in combination may lead to the development of childhood leukemia. Leukemia is the most common cancer in children and teens, accounting for almost one out of three cancers. The work is being funded by Kids Without Cancer, a non-profit group of parents whose children have been treated for cancer at Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan. The group has committed $356,000 to Wayne State University School of Medicine researchers. Meet the 7-year-old battling leukemia who inspires the likes of Andrew Luck, Steph Curry The financial support will result in the creation of a new zebrafish aquatic housing system in WSU\u2019s Integrative Biosciences Center and support of 10 years of pediatric cancer research. The new system will be installed in 2017. The goal? Researchers hope to find out if a common pesticide is a trigger that flips a switch in a specific gene, causing leukemia in children. First, researchers, with financial support from Kids Without Cancer, were able to breed zebrafish with the human leukemia genes. \u201cWe had so much success with our original support that we saw the potential of additional scientific breakthroughs if we could ramp the research up,\u201d said Chris Vandenberg, executive director of Kids Without Cancer. Man dies of leukemia hours after getting married Now, they are looking for the trigger that causes some children with those genes to develop leukemia and others to not develop it, according to developmental geneticist Ryan Thummel, an assistant professor of anatomy and cell biology in the WSU School of Medicine. They are using fish that are practically see-through. Although small in their tanks, researchers can see the spinal column and blood moving throughout the fish. That allows them to quickly notice if the fish has been switched to have leukemia \u2014 the fish turns off-white, Thummel said. There\u2019s another reason researchers are using the zebrafish \u2014 they are a lot cheaper than the traditional mice used in these types of experiments. A mouse can cost up to $100 per year, while a fish is a $1 per year. There\u2019s also a number advantage to using the fish. Because a low percentage of fish, and people, with the gene develop leukemia, researchers can introduce various triggers to thousands of fish at a time, letting them study a large number of fish with the disease at a time. \u201cZebrafish can produce thousands of offspring from a single mating event,\u201d Thummel said. \u201cThis allows us to screen genetically similar siblings on a very large scale.\u201d The first pesticide to be tested will be propoxur, which is commonly used against grass, forestry and household pests and fleas. The project grew out of work done in treating children with leukemia by Dr. Jeffrey Taub, chief of oncology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan and professor of pediatrics in the WSU School of Medicine. He\u2019s searching for ways to identify the possibility children could develop leukemia. He\u2019d like to be able to use blood already taken for newborn screenings to test for the gene and allow doctors to carefully monitor those children and their exposure to whatever trigger is found to help treat the leukemia. So that might mean a young child with the gene might need quarterly monitoring visits with their pediatrician instead of yearly visits. Environmental toxicologist Tracie Baker, an assistant professor in WSU\u2019s institute of environmental health sciences, is joining the research team. She has extensive experience using zebrafish to understand the adverse health effects of exposure to environmental toxins. The zebrafish facility will be built by Aquaneering, an internationally recognized leader in the manufacturing of zebrafish housing systems. In addition, Aquaneering is donating a $7,000 gift-in-kind toward the project. The facility will include three rows of floor-to-ceiling (7-foot-tall) racks with an approximate capacity of 6,000 adult zebrafish. It will be in the university\u2019s IBio building, which was recently built to help researchers from a variety of disciplines work together on research projects. \u201cThis collaboration between a practicing clinician and research scientists is extremely well-suited for revealing previously unrecognized environmental influences and genes that can trigger the development of leukemia,\u201d said Larry Burns, president and CEO of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful this partnership will prove scientifically fruitful, as well as expand our fund-raising opportunities.\u201d Follow David Jesse on Twitter: @reporterdavidj 1126 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ho5PHG NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Dems prepare for battle with Trump on Cabinet picks, agenda Published               December 27, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 After blasting Republican colleagues for years over their blockade of President Obama\u2019s agenda, Democrats are gearing up for their turn as the opposition party \u2013 planning to throw up early roadblocks for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and proposals. With the new Congress set to convene Jan. 3 \u2013 and Trump set for his inauguration on Jan. 20 \u2013 House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi last week issued a call to action to her rank and file to fight Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, one of Republicans\u2019 top agenda priorities for 2017. Pelosi is planning to intensify the \u201cdrumbeat\u201d in the week before the inauguration, setting Jan. 14 as a \u201cnational day of action with events across the country.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 bid to fend off Republican attacks on Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement is no surprise. But the resistance extends well beyond fortifying their ObamaCare defenses. Bloomberg reports that Democrats are preparing for a separate fight with Republicans over plans to overhaul the tax code. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be opposition if these tax cuts are directed to the people at the top again,\u201d Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the next top Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told Bloomberg. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty united.\u201d While Democrats have not put forward their own plan, House Republicans and Trump both have outlined overhauls. Both would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, including reducing the top rate for individuals from 39.6 percent to 33 percent. The gist of the plans is to lower tax rates for most people, and make up lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits.\u00a0 LOBBYING EFFORT IN FULL SWING TO CONFIRM SESSIONS The House plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children. As Democrats prepare to fight proposed tax breaks for top earners, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have signaled they may play hardball. Both GOP leaders have said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are signaling a potentially rocky road ahead for some of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, last week demanding extensive financial information on some of his wealthy candidates. \u00a0 Frustrated by the slow response of billionaires and multimillionaires to their request, 16 Democrats delivered an ultimatum Thursday, saying no committee should vote on a nominee until the individual has cleared an FBI background check, provided a financial report and an ethics agreement with the Office of Government Ethics, and responded to \"reasonable requests for additional information\" such as tax returns. \"The United States Senate has a rich, bipartisan tradition of vetting nominees to the president's Cabinet,\" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader. Republicans controlling the Senate want to make quick work of Cabinet confirmations once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Democrats have limited options to block nominees outright because they changed filibuster rules when they controlled the Senate in 2013, and Cabinet nominees can win approval on a simple majority vote. Republicans will hold a 52-48 advantage next year. However, Democrats could drag out the process in committee or force longer Senate debates than usual. Trump's choice of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state has been a focal point of the complaints. In a letter to colleagues, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s top Democrat, said he asked the Trump transition team for three years' worth of tax returns because Tillerson was \"actively engaged with many foreign governments\" at ExxonMobil. Cardin said Tillerson \"promised to provide\" the tax information in response to a question on a standard questionnaire that all nominees submit prior to appearing before the committee. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the committee chairman, quickly responded with a statement saying the GOP-controlled panel never officially asked for the tax returns and insisted that Tillerson was ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee. He said it is not the practice of his committee to request tax information, and the committee's own financial disclosure forms \"are very expansive.\u201d In addition to Tillerson, Trump has tapped Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, for treasury secretary, and Betsy DeVos, daughter of the Amway co-founder, for education secretary. Trump\u2019s conservative allies outside Capitol Hill are preparing for confirmation turbulence. The Judicial Crisis Network recently launched a website touting the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general and defending his record in office. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, told Fox News last week that he anticipates congressional Democrats will fall into a few groups as Trump joins with majority Republicans to pursue his agenda. \u201cYou're going to have the hard left -- the Elizabeth Warrens who aren't going to support anybody. They'll be hostile and bitter and nasty. You're going to have the partisan group -- Pelosi is a good example. They are going to be tough-minded,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are going to be a lot of Democrats that are going to say \u2018I don't want to deal with eight years of yelling no.\u2019\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Although he complimented Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, saying she \"performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances,\" he also expressed confidence that his progressive vision for the country still has broad appeal in the wake of her stunning defeat of in the general election this November. President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign rally with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on July 5, 2016 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images, file \"I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I \u2014 if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama told Axelrod in an interview published on Monday. Obama, as he has in other public comments following Clinton's defeat, insisted that the loss was neither a rebuke of his policies nor does it mean his party left middle America behind. Instead, Democrats failed to communicate how much \"we care about these communities.\" \"If you think you're winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer . And the economy has been improving,\" he added in reference to the Clinton campaign. \"There is a sense, obviously, that some communities have been left behind from the recovery and people feeling anxious about that. But if she was looking at the campaign and saying 'OK, I'm winning right now' \u2014 and her economic agenda was in fact very progressive.\" Related: Obama Says He'll Give Trump a Chance, Even If He Attacks Legacy President-elect Donald Trump won several districts in crucial Rust Belt states that the president had triumphed in previously, a fact Obama and Axelrod discussed during the show. The numbers may back up the president's argument. For months now, Obama has enjoyed approval ratings north of 50 percent , with even a decent portion of Trump voters still holding a favorable view of him. In the November election, Clinton was not able to outperform the president in key demographic groups (women, minorities, young people) which have come to be known as \"the Obama coalition,\" but that doesn't mean the president believes all is lost. President Barack Obama speaks at campaign event for Hillary Clinton in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Sept. 13, 2016, at Eakins Oval in Philadelphia. Carolyn Kaster / AP, file \"In the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that somehow, it really was a fantasy,\" Obama said of his historic 2008 White House run and eventual victory. \"What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism.\" In order for Democrats to avoid being permanently marginalized, Obama made the case that the party must embrace its roots as a party of average Americans. \"We're not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we're bleeding for these communities,\" he said. \"It means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day.\" Trump on Monday afternoon tweeted his response to Obama's claims saying \"no way\". President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 Then Trump added another tweet saying that the world was better for him having won the election, in almost messianic terms, saying: \"The world was gloomy before I won \u2014 there was no hope.\" The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 Adam Howard ",

    "text": "Email TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency is reporting the deputy transport minister as saying that his county will only pay half of the announced price for 80 new Boeing planes , given the reductions in its purchasing options. According to the Sunday report, Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan says that despite an initial $16.8 billion deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes, \u201cRegarding the style of our order and its options, the purchase contract for 80 Boeing aircraft is worth about 50 percent of the amount.\u201d He did not elaborate. Boeing has made no immediate comment. Iran announced earlier this month that it had finalized the deal, which was made possible by last year\u2019s landmark nuclear agreement . It is the largest single contract with an U.S. company since the 1979 revolution and takeover of the U.S. Embassy. The deal covers 50 single-aisle 737 Max 8s, a soon-to-be-introduced version of Boeing\u2019s existing narrow-body 737 line. It also includes 30 777s, a wide-body, twin-engine plane typically used on long-haul routes that is popular with other Persian Gulf carriers such as Dubai-based Emirates. Half of the order will cover the 777-300ER version, while the rest will be of the 777-9 model still under development. Iran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency said the planes would be delivered over the next decade. The first will start to arrive in 2018, Boeing said. In September, Washington granted permission to Boeing and Toulouse, France-based Airbus to sell billions of dollars\u2019 worth of aircraft to Iran. Airbus needed U.S. approval because at least 10 percent of its planes\u2019 components are of American origin. The U.S. and other world powers agreed last year to lift crippling sanctions on Iran in exchange for it curbing its nuclear activities. The U.S. still maintains extensive sanctions on Iran for activities unrelated to its nuclear program. President-elect\u00a0 Donald Trump and several Republican lawmakers have criticized the nuclear deal , but it\u2019s unclear whether they would scrap the agreement, which was reached with Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. \u00a0 The Republican-led House of Representatives last month voted to bar commercial aircraft sales to Iran in a move that could block the Boeing deal. That legislation must still pass the Senate, where it will likely face opposition from Democrats. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will veto the bill if it reaches his desk before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Boeing made a point of saying it worked closely with the U.S. government throughout the deal-making process and will continue to \u201cfollow all license requirements.\u201d The Iran Air deal \u201cwill support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs\u201d linked to the 777s alone, it said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The concerns voiced by dissident doctors do not appear to imperil Senate confirmation of Mr. Price, but they do ensure that his confirmation hearings next month will be as contentious as any held for a Trump nominee, featuring a full public examination of the new president\u2019s proposed health policies. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cDoctors are divided big time,\u201d said Dr. Carl G. Streed Jr., a primary care doctor at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a member of the A.M.A. house of delegates, the organization\u2019s principal policy-making body. The controversy began soon after Mr. Trump announced on Nov. 29 that he had chosen Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which controls Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal health insurance exchange, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Within hours, the A.M.A. \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest medical advocacy group, which has nearly 235,000 members and calls itself \u201cthe voice of the medical profession\u201d \u2014 issued a statement saying it \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the selection. It noted Mr. Price\u2019s experience as a doctor, a state legislator and a member of Congress. It praised, in particular, his support for \u201cpatient choice and market-based solutions\u201d and his efforts to reduce \u201cexcessive regulatory burdens\u201d on doctors. The enthusiasm was understandable at one level: Mr. Price has been a member of the A.M.A. house of delegates since 2005 and was an alternate delegate for a decade before that, according to the A.M.A. and the Medical Association of Georgia. \u201cFor those who are attacking Dr. Price, I have to ask whom you would rather have at the helm of H.H.S. \u2014 a career bureaucrat? A former governor who views doctors as a cost center to be controlled?\u201d said Dr. Robert E. Hertzka of San Diego, an anesthesiologist and former president of the California Medical Association. \u201cTom Price may turn out to be the best friend that physicians and patients have ever had in that role.\u201d Many doctors are not willing to take that chance. More than 750 people who identify themselves as members of the A.M.A. signed a letter to the association\u2019s board objecting to the endorsement. The \u201cunqualified support\u201d for Mr. Price is inappropriate, the letter says, because he has been \u201ca strong opponent of so much of our clearly delineated A.M.A. policy\u201d on issues like the Affordable Care Act, contraception and gay rights. Some doctors also said patients could be hurt by major changes in Medicare and Medicaid that Mr. Price, along with other House Republicans, has advocated. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Andrea S. Christopher, 32, an internal medicine doctor at the veterans hospital in Boise, Idaho, said she had decided not to renew her A.M.A. membership over the endorsement, which she called especially upsetting to her generation of physicians. \u201cDr. Price has been an outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act, which has done so much to address the needs of our most vulnerable patients and reduced the uninsured rate to the lowest level on record,\u201d Dr. Christopher said. Dr. Kristin M. Huntoon, a 37-year-old neurosurgery resident at Ohio State University in Columbus, said the group\u2019s support for Mr. Price had increased the chances that the Affordable Care Act would be dismantled \u2014 and that has put her patients at risk. Ohio has extended Medicaid coverage to more than 600,000 people under the federal health care law . If that expansion is reversed, Dr. Huntoon said, some patients will not receive imaging or treatment at an early stage of their disease, and they are more likely to arrive when tumors have spread to the brain. \u201cAt that stage,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s often nothing I can do for the patient.\u201d Physicians have long been a focus of Mr. Price\u2019s legislative efforts. He led the push to fix widely recognized flaws in Medicare\u2019s formula for paying doctors and supported changes in malpractice laws that could make it easier for doctors to defend themselves. He supported changes in Medicare that would allow doctors to get around fee limits by signing contracts with patients. He has also backed changes in antitrust law that would enhance doctors\u2019 bargaining power in negotiations with insurance companies. \u201cPocketbook issues \u2014 the economic well-being of physicians \u2014 may well be a factor contributing to the A.M.A.\u2019s endorsement,\u201d said Dr. Manan Trivedi, a former Democratic candidate for Congress, who is the president of the National Physicians Alliance, a group of 10,000 doctors that opposes Mr. Price\u2019s confirmation. Dr. Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the A.M.A., strongly defended the group\u2019s actions and suggested that Mr. Price could surprise critics as Dr. C. Everett Koop did in the 1980s, when he was surgeon general under President Ronald Reagan. Liberal politicians and women\u2019s groups initially criticized Dr. Koop because of his opposition to abortion , but when he stepped down after more than seven years in office, he was widely praised for his role in fighting AIDS and discouraging the use of tobacco. \u201cWe do realize that there is a diversity of opinion on Dr. Price,\u201d Dr. Harris said in an interview. \u201cWe respect that diversity. We take the concerns that have been expressed by some of our members and by physicians in general seriously. \u201cOur support for Dr. Price is based on our history with him, his extensive involvement with A.M.A.,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s a longtime member, he\u2019s a delegate. For us, he has always been accessible. He listens, and he really knows how policies impact the delivery of care and the physician-patient relationship.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price had been endorsed by many medical groups and was \u201cuniquely prepared\u201d for the job. \u201cIf confirmed,\u201d he said, \u201cDr. Price will work to restore the patient-doctor relationship and clamp down on government overreach.\u201d Mr. Price has introduced legislation to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, including its expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for the purchase of private insurance. He advocates tax credits to help people buy insurance, greater use of individual health savings accounts and state-run \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d for people with pre-existing conditions who might otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage. As a member of the House Budget Committee, and then its chairman, he has supported proposals to shift Medicare away from its open-ended commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary, which could be used for either private insurance or traditional Medicare. Such proposals could increase costs for some beneficiaries or limit the amount of care they receive, health policy experts say. Mr. Price has also backed turning Medicaid into block grants to state governments. Critics say that states would probably respond by restricting eligibility, cutting Medicaid benefits or reducing payments to health care providers. In leading efforts to repeal the president\u2019s health law, he is pursuing a goal in opposition to the policies of the A.M.A. In a 2010 letter to congressional leaders, Dr. J. James Rohack, who was then president of the A.M.A., said the law took \u201can important step toward improving the health of the American people,\u201d by \u201cextending coverage to the vast majority of the uninsured\u201d and \u201cimproving competition and choice in the insurance marketplace.\u201d Dr. Samantha G. Harrington, a doctor at Cambridge Hospital in Massachusetts, said she had canceled her A.M.A. membership because she found its endorsement of Mr. Price \u201cembarrassing and shameful.\u201d Dr. Thomas M. Gellhaus, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said Mr. Price had \u201cworked closely with us\u201d on many issues. But, he said in a recent letter to the congressman, \u201csome of the bills you supported in Congress would not serve women\u2019s health well.\u201d Mr. Price has supported efforts to restrict abortion and cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood clinics. If confirmed, Mr. Price would be only the third physician to serve as secretary in the 63-year history of the Health and Human Services Department and its predecessor, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

    "text": "December 26, 20165:00 AM ET Katherine Hobson Some of the broader claims about the benefits of gratitude aren't backed up by science. Simone Golob/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Some of the broader claims about the benefits of gratitude aren't backed up by science. Simone Golob/Getty Images It's a time of year when we're often urged to be grateful; for friends, for family, for presents under the tree. But not everyone experiences gratitude as a positive force in their life. People who score higher on measures of autonomy experience less overall gratitude and value it less, according to experiments conducted by Anthony Ahrens , an associate professor of psychology at American University, and his colleagues. Autonomous folks who really value independence might feel that gratitude undermines that independence, says Ahrens. And authors of a 2015 meta-analysis wonder if people who tend to be perfectionists may also have neutral or negative reactions if they reflect on benefits they've received from others. Does that mean that people who experience gratitude as negative should push through it anyway in pursuit of some benefit? \"That's a big 'I don't know,' \" says Ahrens. \"We will need data to answer that.\" He does, however, worry that people who are uncomfortable with gratitude and with receiving gifts may be undermining their interpersonal relationships. It turns out that the science of gratitude is pretty complex. I keep reading that regularly spending a few minutes tallying up the people and things for which I'm grateful can give me access to a wealth of benefits, both physical and mental. Article continues after sponsorship But when I talked to psychologists who study gratitude, I found out it's not quite that simple. It's still not clear whether quick, easy interventions like a gratitude journal or expressing gratitude to a friend orally or in a letter can produce significant and permanent benefits. And as the new research shows, there may be some people who don't get as much out of those practices. Gratitude Is Good For The Soul And Helps The Heart, Too Gratitude is clearly associated with physical and mental well-being. It's linked to better sleep . People who are more grateful seem to have more energy, less depression and possibly even a lower risk of heart disease . Those positive associations hold for both the trait of gratitude \u2014 that is, being a generally grateful person \u2014 and the state of gratitude \u2014 a temporary behavior or feeling, says Philip Watkins , a professor of psychology at Eastern Washington University. But, some of the broader claims about the benefits of gratitude aren't backed up by science, says Watkins. He says he's \"very pro-gratitude.\" But messages \"claiming that it's going to do everything for you, including making you have a longer life and permanently happier,\" are not on solid footing, he says. \"I wouldn't question that the positive state of gratitude generally has lots of benefits,\" says Don Davis , a psychologist at Georgia State University. \"I think it's a powerful way to teach people to regulate their emotional state.\" But, he says, \"What is in question is how much a minimal dose of gratitude in your week can cause shifts to lead to all these benefits.\" Davis is an author of the meta-analysis published last year that looked at randomized clinical trials of activities designed to \"cultivate a sense of gratefulness,\" most of which were short in duration. He and his co-authors wanted to see how the interventions performed on measures of gratitude, anxiety and psychological well-being. Their conclusion: There is \"weak evidence for the efficacy of gratitude interventions.\" That doesn't mean that they don't work for at least some people. But at this point, there's not a ton of evidence that they have big effects. When you dig into the details of the studies, that's not altogether surprising, says Davis. In many cases, the studies looked at whether a quick intervention would actually change the trait measure of gratitude \u2014 in other words, whether it could change your personality and make you a more grateful person. That's a tall order. More realistic would be to change how often people experienced gratitude over a shorter period of time, like a week or a day. Many people are already pretty grateful, which makes it harder for them to increase their gratitude even further. And Watkins suggests that tracking people long term might show more benefit, since some evidence points to a bigger effect after the treatment period ends. It's also possible that gratitude isn't always the best emotion to have in every circumstance \u2014 say, if someone were in an abusive relationship, or in some other situation that required urgent action to change, says Davis. \"I think it's important to look at the subtypes of people who might benefit,\" says Jeffrey Froh , an associate professor at Hofstra University. He was an author of a 2010 review of gratitude and well-being , which found gratitude interventions to be promising but said that encouraging everyone to adopt them was \"premature.\" It may be, for example, that they're most effective when targeted at people who are lower in happiness to begin with, or maybe in men, who seem to be less likely to feel and express gratitude . Froh says there is no reason to keep a gratitude journal or write gratitude letters if you don't enjoy it or feel like you're getting anything out of it. Just as there are more ways to exercise than go out for a run, he says there are plenty of other ways to pursue gratitude. For example, you could practice mindfulness, say prayers of thanksgiving, take time out to savor the past, be more generous, or spend time in nature and away from your phone, he says. For that advice, I am very grateful. Katherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y. She's on Twitter: @katherinehobson . ",
