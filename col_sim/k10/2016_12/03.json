According to police, 15-year-old James Means was shot in the chest and in the back Nov. 21 by 62-year-old William Pulliam after they bumped into each other outside a Charleston store and twice exchanged words. Police said Pulliam showed no remorse and told investigators, \"That's another piece of trash off the street.\" Pulliam, who faces a first-degree murder charge, said in a jailhouse interview that he shot in self-defense after he felt threatened. \"He told me that he shot him because he was hassling him,\" Charleston Police Det. Chris Lioi testified during Pulliam's preliminary hearing Thursday. According to Lioi, Means had a BB gun in his waistband, though video footage showed nothing in his hands when he was killed. \"James Means had nothing in his hands and I observed Mr. Pulliam pull out a gun and discharge one round. James Means then falls to the ground. As he gets up, William Pulliam fires another round,\" Lioi said. The detective also said that audio captured from the footage suggested Pulliam knew the BB gun was a toy. \"That toy gun is going to get you (expletive) killed,\" Lioi said Pulliam could be heard saying before Means was shot. \"No, it's not,\" Means responded, according to the detective. Pulliam's attorney, Richard Holicker, said neither he nor his client have seen the footage, and he argued that prosecutors should play it in court. \"Hopefully, one day the state will let us see the video so we'll know what happened,\" Holicker said in his closing statement. \"The fact that Mr. Pulliam shot Mr. Means doesn't make this a first-degree murder,\" he said. A Kanawha County magistrate found probable cause to send the case to a grand jury. 0 Shares ",

BioInvasions Records. 2016) A Burmese python in the Everglades with a penchant for venison gulped down three whole deer \u2014 one doe and two fawns \u2014 before wildlife officials captured and euthanized it, a new study reveals. The gustatory feat sets a record: It's the first invasive Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) caught with three deer in its gut, said study co-lead author Scott Boback, an associate professor of biology at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. The python probably attacked and ate the deer at different times over a 90-day period, Boback said. That time span may seem long, but it's actually quite surprising that a snake would eat three enormous meals in a relatively short window, Boback told Live Science. [Photos: This Invasive Python Ate Three Wild Deer ] \"If a python is capable of eating three deer in three months,\" what else are they eating that we don't know about, he asked. \"We don't even know how many of them are out there [in the Everglades].\" More From LiveScience Photos: Giant Pythons Invade Everglades Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia, but for reasons still shrouded in mystery, they became established in the Everglades during the 1990s. The snakes can grow to be up to 18 feet long in the Everglades (and up to 26 feet long in Southeast Asia). They use their strong muscles to wrap around prey, obstructing their victims' blood flow until circulation stops. Deer trio It's unclear how the python attacked the deer, but the snake may have hid in the water, waiting for the deer to stop for a drink. That would have left the deer within striking distance of the snake, Boback said. The 15.6-foot-long female snake was almost done digesting its three massive meals when officials caught and euthanized it on June 3, 2013. A necropsy, or animal autopsy, revealed an empty stomach but intestines packed with poop. The fecal matter was immense: more than 14 lbs., or 13 percent of the snake's body mass , Boback said. Study co-researchers Teresa Hsu and Suzanne Peurach, scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, sieved through the excrement and found mats of fur and several undigested hooves, bones and teeth, indicating that the python had eaten white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) \u2014 and not just one, Boback said. It's no surprise that the fur, hooves and teeth were undigested, as pythons can't break down keratin or enamel, Boback said. However, they can digest bone, which would explain why the researchers found only fragments of bone in the dung, he said. The size and shape of the hooves \u2014 as well as the presence of a deciduous, or baby, tooth \u2014 indicated that the adult doe was at least 1 year old and about 99 lbs., one fawn was about 1 month old and 37 lbs. and the other fawn was about 2 weeks old and 29 lbs., the researchers wrote in the study.\u00a0[In Images: Hungry Python Eats Porcupine Whole ] Python invasion Pythons are ravenous eaters, and they've been wreaking havoc on the Everglades ecosystem, Boback said. The hungry snakes hunt the region's native animals, including birds, mammals and at least one reptile \u2014 the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), the researchers wrote in the study. Although other Everglades studies have shown correlations between the presence of pythons and a drop in mammals \u2014 such as raccoons, opossums, bobcats and rabbits \u2014 the new report shows concrete evidence that pythons can eat more than one deer within a short period of time, Boback said. \"It just begs the question, 'How often are they eating these things?'\" he said. The study was published in the November issue of the journal BioInvasions Records. Original article on Live Science . Trending in Science ",

    "text": "AP December 2, 2016, 6:27 PM In Macedonia's fake news hub, this teen shows how it's done Computer screens display stories from USA Daily News 24, a fake news site registered in Veles, Macedonia.\u00a0 AP Photo/Raphael Satter Email VELES, Macedonia --\u00a0On the second floor of a noisy sports center in the Macedonian town of Veles, a teenage purveyor of fake news cracked open his laptop and laid out his case for why lying is more lucrative than the truth. Real news gets reported everywhere, he argued. Made-up stories are unique. \u201cThe fake news is the good news,\u201d the 18-year-old said, pointing to a graph showing his audience figures, which reached into the hundreds of thousands, a bling watch clasped firmly around his wrist. \u201cA fake news article is way more opened than any other.\u201d As President Barack Obama, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , journalists and academics argue over the impact of social media-driven propaganda on the latest American election, this sleepy former manufacturing town overlooking the Vardar River in central Macedonia has found itself increasingly drawn into the debate. Fake news websites and stories are flooding the internet. Be careful out there. Here are some to keep an eye out for. BuzzFeed News identified Veles as a hub of the fake news industry seeding sensationalized or falsified information across Facebook . A reporter from Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News chased the industry\u2019s adolescent kingpins across town, cornering one 16-year-old fake news baron who said he had no plans to stop \u2014 even though he acknowledged it was wrong. But there were no such qualms from the teenager who spoke to The Associated Press at Veles\u2019 Gemdidzii Sports Hall. Retreating from a spirited indoor soccer game into an empty office, he walked an AP journalist through the ins-and-outs of his fake news operation on condition that neither he nor his stable of bogus news sites would be identified, because otherwise that would hurt his business. He showed the AP how he ripped much of his material off The Political Insider, a right-wing news site that produces a steady drumbeat of pro-Donald Trump pieces. He then flipped over to Google Analytics , an audience tracking tool, to show that he\u2019d managed to gather more than 685,000 page views a week. Facebook is promising changes to fight the spread of misinformation and fake news on the social network. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is layin... The teen said his monthly revenue was in the four figures, a considerable sum in a country where the average monthly pay is 360 euros ($383). As he navigated his site\u2019s statistics, he dropped nuggets of journalism advice. \u201cYou have to write what people want to see, not what you want to show,\u201d he said, scrolling through The Political Insider\u2019s stories as a large banner read \u201cARREST HILLARY NOW.\u201d Using the web intelligence service Domain Tools, the AP confirmed that the teen is behind more than a dozen different websites, including knockoffs of well-known U.S. media outlets. Typical headlines include \u201cWow! Queen Elizabeth Invited Trump - This Is A Game Changer\u201d or \u201cBREAKING: What George Soros Just Did Will Leave You SICK!\u201d Both pieces carried untrue or questionable assertions. A simple Domain Tools search revealed roughly 200 U.S.-oriented news websites registered in Veles, most created within the last 12 months. These sites tend to follow one of two patterns: Some masquerade as well-known outlets like The New York Times or Fox News, while others operate under made-in-America-sounding names like USA Daily News 24. That latter site\u2019s lead story \u2014 \u201c Michelle Obama DEMANDS Americans PAY UP To Give Her Mom A Cushy $160k Pension\u201d \u2014 is entirely false. A message seeking comment from USA Daily News 24\u2019s administrator, Goran Trajkov, was not immediately returned. Most of the sites appear fueled by plagiarism. Stories are cribbed from blogs, conspiracy sites and fake news outlets, and reposted across social media. For the residents of Veles, a Macedonian rust belt town of 50,000 people with shuttered factories and high unemployment, the thousands of dollars brought in by fake news operations aren\u2019t necessarily unwelcome. \u201cThey see it in a positive way,\u201d said local journalist Petar Peckov. \u201cThey say, \u2018The boys are working. There is money and we will benefit from it.\u2019\u201d For everyone else on Facebook, Veles\u2019 new cottage industry means a bewildering assault of misinformation and propaganda. \u201cTelling real from fake is difficult when people are intentionally trying to mask this from you,\u201d said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data & Society, a New York-based institute that studies the cultural impact of technological change. \u201cThe headlines that this Macedonian guy was using would have, could have been found a few years ago on something like \u2014 not in the same political sentiment \u2014 on Upworthy or on Elite Daily\u201d she said in a telephone interview, referring to two websites that pioneered the viral news phenomenon. \u201cThey\u2019re building off of practices that people have become really used to.\u201d The Macedonian teenager says he\u2019s indifferent to politics. He sees it all as a money-making scheme, as well as a preparation for his career after high school, where he has been studying marketing and politics. Shrugging off the handwringing over the ethics of fake news , he said the onus was on readers. \u201cThey can read it if they want to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the one pushing them to click on the article.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Email TERRYTOWN, La. -- The sheriff investigating the death of a former NFL player told reporters Friday that the man who shot Joe McKnight was in his vehicle when he fired the fatal shots. \u201cMr. Gasser did not stand over Mr. McKnight and fire shots into him,\u201d said Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand. Joe McKnight while playing for the USC Trojans in 2009. WWL Normand said he was revealing these details to address reports that witnesses saw Gasser standing over McKnight with a gun as the 28-year-old tried to apologize. The shooting happened about 3 p.m. Thursday in Terrytown, a suburb of New Orleans just across the Mississippi River. Police say Ronald Gasser, 54, has admitted to shooting McKnight. Gasser was released from custody early Friday and has not been charged with any crime. \u201cMr. Gasser isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d said Normand. \u201cHe has been completely cooperative.\u201d Sheriff Normand told reporters the investigation into the fatal shooting is ongoing: \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned.\u201d Ronald Gasser, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Joe McKnight WWLTV Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said that McKnight sustained three gunshot wounds and Sheriff Normand said three bullet casings were found inside Gasser\u2019s vehicle. Normand said they know of no video of the incident. McKnight\u2019s grandmother said family members are still seeking information on his death and why Gasser was released. Barbara Franklin told The Associated Press by phone Friday that relatives are \u201ctrying to find out our own selves\u201d more about what happened. She said family members haven\u2019t had any communication with the sheriff\u2019s office about Gasser\u2019s release, saying she learned of it through a radio broadcast Friday. \u201cHe might be released now, but God is going to bring about justice in it,\u201d Franklin said of the release. At the Friday news conference, Coroner Cvitanovich said that McKnight sustained three gunshot wounds: one in his hand; one which entered through his shoulder and punctured his lung; and one which entered his chest and went through his liver and kidney. \u201cThe wounds are not consistent with being shot from above,\u201d said Cvitanovich. CBS affiliate WWLTV reports that a news release from the sheriff\u2019s office stated that prior to the shooting, both vehicles were on Behrman Highway, parallel to one another. Preliminary accounts from witnesses and the shooter suggested that the events were the culmination of a road rage incident. The witnesses told the sheriff\u2019s office that the two men were in a heated verbal exchange followed by the sounds of gunfire. After the shooting, witnesses told investigators that Gasser was at the rear of the vehicles with a gun in his hand. McKnight was on the pavement between both vehicles. Eventually he was moved to the back of the vehicles where a civilian performed CPR. Gasser stayed on the scene and waited for responding deputies.\u00a0 Normand said he wouldn\u2019t be influenced by \u201coutside forces\u201d and noted the racial angle to the incident. McKnight is black and Gasser is white. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about race,\u201d Normand emphasized. \u201cIn fact, the man who raised Joe McKnight Jr. used to work for this office.\u201d Normand said that out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d he would not share more details of the case, nor what Gasser told investigators, so as not to taint other potential witnesses. \u201cA rush to judgment does not equal anything,\u201d Normand said. \u201cIn fact, in the criminal justice process, if you don\u2019t dot every \u2018i\u2019 and cross every \u2018t\u2019 and there are deficiencies, it has dire consequences. Out of respect to the decedent and the individual who shot and killed Mr. McKnight, that\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

I think that adds tremendous pressure to a young person.\" Yet it's not as simple as pinning the youth suicide surge entirely on social media. Suicide rates have been on the rise in the U.S. since 1999, affecting both men and women in nearly every age category, and experts insist the underlying causes are more complex. For example, it's possible that rising divorce rates and economic despair may be contributing to the overall increase in suicide, which hit a 30-year high in 2014. Experts are also quick to stress that, compared to other age groups, suicide is rare among 10 to 14-year-olds. In 2014, the CDC determined that the number of children in that age bracket who died by suicide came out to 425. By contrast, the number of people between the ages of 45 and 64 who died by suicide that year hit 16,294, according to research published in April by the CDC. Nevertheless, the spike in youth suicides is alarming \u2014 especially when compared to the number of deaths from car accidents. In 1999, the CDC found that the mortality rate of children between the ages of 10 and 14 who died in car crashes was about four times higher than the rate of death by suicide. Over the next 15 years, the death rate for car accidents declined 58 percent, while the death rate for suicide fluctuated and then doubled between 2007 and 2014. \"Any time you see a doubling like that it's noteworthy,\" said the CDC's Curtin. \"It behooves all of us to try and figure out what's going on here and nip it in the bud before the rate goes even higher.\" With only 425 suicides among 10 to 14-year-olds, it's difficult to draw conclusions about which demographics are most affected, as researchers require larger numbers to make statistically significant findings. In general, said Curtin, rural areas see more suicides than urban areas, where there tend to be a greater number of mental health and suicide prevention resources. Additionally, Curtin's research shows that while more boys die by suicide than girls, the rate among girls is rapidly rising. Between 1999 and 2014, the number of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 who died by suicide tripled from 50 to 150. Some see the data as a major wake-up call for greater state and federal investments in suicide prevention. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, which was enacted by Congress in 2004, allocates millions of dollars worth of grants to states and tribal communities for suicide prevention and early intervention programs. But the amount of federal funding for that effort pales in comparison to what the government has invested in safe driving. In 2015, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration funded over $576 million in grants to promote motor vehicle safety, according to the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention , while the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funded approximately $60 million in grants for suicide prevention programming. \"Motor vehicle prevention safety is ten times what we spend on suicide prevention,\" said Draper of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. \"We refer to the reduction in motor vehicle accident deaths as the public health achievement of the 20th century. If we can make a similar kind of investment in protecting families from suicide, it can be the great public health achievement of the 21st century.\" Connor Ball poses in Boston's Fenway Park. Courtesy of Ball family Municipalities, schools and individual families also have an important role to play in terms of investing in training for teachers and students to be able to spot the warning signs and find proper help before a suicide attempt, experts say. There are a number of curriculum-based, peer-to-peer prevention programs \u2014 such as SOS Signs of Suicide \u2014 that SAMHSA has determined to have \" evidence of effectiveness\" at decreasing suicides and suicide attempts in middle and high school. But Meghan Diamon, youth programs manager of SOS, says many schools are unaware such courses even exist. \"We don't find funding to be the main barrier to suicide prevention,\" said Diamon in an email. \"Many schools may not realize that this type of program is available to them because the stigma around mental health and suicide keeps many people from talking about the issue.\" For Ball, who has spent the last half-decade searching for reasons that can help explain the unexplainable, it may never become clear whether her son showed warning signs that could have been detected. He wasn't active on social media, she said, and wasn't bullied at the time of his death. From time to time he would get very angry at the dinner table talking about something as commonplace as politics, but she insists it wasn't anything adolescent moodiness couldn't explain. Still, her non-profit, Connor's Climb Foundation, works to provide the SOS program to New Hampshire schools, free of charge. Earlier this month, her son's former school \u2014 Exeter High, which saw two other suicides in addition to her son's between 2010 and 2012 \u2014 began incorporating the program into its 10th grade health class. \"My heart is broken,\" she said. \"That's why this is important to me.\" Emma Margolin ",

The 70-story tower has secured financing, its developers said. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Gail MarksJarvis Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune As apartment developers in Chicago face increasing difficulty getting lenders to provide loans for new luxury apartment construction after a multiyear building boom, Related Midwest has closed on a $240 million loan to construct One Bennett Park, a 70-story tower. \"It was good news and a relief,\" said Curt Bailey , president of Related Midwest. He said it took about a year to secure the funding. Wells Fargo is the lead along with other lenders, he said. Funding will be adequate to construct a tower including 279 apartments and 69 large condominiums at 451 E. Grand Ave. in the Streeterville neighborhood, he said. He declined to elaborate on financing. The building had been expected to cost $400 million, and Bailey said funding that has been secured will allow the company to carry out its original plans. Although lenders have been reluctant to commit more money to apartment construction after a record level of new apartments going up downtown during the next three years, Bailey said his project is unique.

Lemmann, a New Orleans-based attorney who was not connected with the case, cautioned that it was too early to tell but it could indicate Gasser says he acted in self-defense. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the matter. They can continue to investigate. They can always bring charges but what it indicates to me is that there was some basis to believe that the homicide was justified. And the most typical justification of a homicide is self-defense,\u201d Lemmann said. McKnight played three seasons for the New York Jets and one with the Kansas City Chiefs. He spent this season in the Canadian Football League, playing two games for the Edmonton Eskimos and three for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He ran for 150 yards against Toronto on Oct. 15 in his Saskatchewan debut. \u201cWe send our deepest sympathies to Joe\u2019s family, friends, and all those impacted by this tragedy,\u201d Roughriders general manager and coach Chris Jones said in a statement. McKnight was considered the No. 1 running back recruit in the country when he came out of John Curtis Christian School in Louisiana in 2006 and signed with the University of Southern California, where he played under Pete Carroll. With his running and catching skills, McKnight was often compared to do-it-all running back Reggie Bush, a USC star who was the No. 2 overall pick by New Orleans in the 2006 draft. Bush took to Twitter to offer his condolences: \u201cRIP my brother Joe McKnight,\u201d he posted, \u201cthis one hurts bad.\u201d \u201cFor a life to be lost so senselessly is just beyond description,\u201d said JT Curtis, McKnight\u2019s high school coach. \u201cRight now it\u2019s pretty devastating.\u201d \u201cHe was just a good kid,\u201d the coach added. After a sometimes-spectacular college career in which he ran for 2,213 yards and 13 touchdowns and caught 66 passes for 542 yards and two scores in three seasons, McKnight was drafted by the Jets in the fourth round in 2010. Former NFL player Joe McKnight killed in shooting His NFL career got off to a shaky start, marked by his first rookie camp practice in which he dropped a few passes, had both calves cramp up and later vomited on the side of the field because of nerves and lack of conditioning. McKnight saw limited action as a rookie, but started the regular-season finale and rushed for 158 yards on 32 carries. McKnight assumed the role as the Jets\u2019 primary kick returner in 2011, and led the NFL with a 31.6 yard kickoff return average that season. That included a franchise-record 107-yarder in 2011 against Baltimore that also stands as the team\u2019s longest play. He was released by the Jets as part of their final cuts after training camp in 2013 and spent that season out of football. McKnight signed with Kansas City in January 2014 and had two touchdown catches in a game for the Chiefs early that season before tearing his Achilles tendon during a practice and missing the rest of the year. Several of McKnight\u2019s former teammates and friends took to social media to express shock and sadness at the news, and to offer condolences to his family. The Jets posted a photo of McKnight with the words \u201cJoe McKnight 1988-2016\u201d on their official Twitter account. \u201cRest in peace, Joe McKnight,\u201d the team said. \u201cOur thoughts and condolences are with his loved ones.\u201d Former Jets teammate Antonio Cromartie wrote on Twitter: \u201cJust got a message saying my former teammate Joe McKnight was killed today. This hurt to the heart. I can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The juror in a letter to the court said \"I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict\" against Michael Slager, a former patrolman who pulled over Walter Scott in North Charleston, and ended up shooting him as a bystander recorded the incident on video. The jury foreperson said in a separate note to the court that it was only one juror who was \"having issues,\" Circuit Judge Clifton Newman said. The juror opposed to conviction said in the letter, \"I cannot and will not change my mind,\" Newman said. But the jury said it wanted to continue deliberating, and requested to return at 9 a.m. Monday. The jury said it would have questions at that time. Slager was charged with murder in Scott's killing, although the jury was allowed to consider a lesser charge of manslaughter in addition to murder. Former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, center, sits in the courtroom during his murder trial at the Charleston County court in Charleston, S.C., Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. Grace Beahm / Post and Courier via AP Earlier, the jury said at around 1 p.m. Friday that it had been unable to come to a conclusion, and Newman ordered them to resume deliberations. The jury at that time sent a message to Newman asking to see a transcript of the testimony from the man who took cellphone video of Slager shooting Scott. Newman offered to let jurors listen to audio of the testimony, but they declined, saying they didn't believe it would change anything and said they couldn't reach a verdict. \"If you do not agree on a verdict, I must declare a mistrial,\" Newman said. \"The same participants will come, and the same lawyers will likely ask basically the same questions, and get basically the same answers and we will go through this whole process again.\" Related: Judge Allows Jury to Consider Manslaughter in Walter Scott Trial Slager, 35, has been charged with murder in the death of Scott, 50, who was not armed. Scott was shot five times in the back while running from Slager during the traffic stop. On Wednesday, Newman said he would grant a request from the prosecution to let jurors consider a lesser charge of manslaughter in addition to murder. Murder carries a penalty of 30 years to life, while manslaughter is punishable by 2 to 30 years behind bars. Related: Michael Slager Testifies About Killing Walter Scott: 'It's Been a Nightmare' Slager testified for the first time in the trial on Tuesday and told the court that life has been a \"nightmare\" since the fatal shooting. He is free on bond. \"My family's been destroyed by this. Scott's family has been destroyed by this,\" he told the defense, holding back emotion. Elizabeth Chuck ",

Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool Andy Savage, defense attorney for former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager, awaits a verdict from the jury on Friday. Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Pool Updated at 6:40 p.m. ET The jury in the murder trial of former North Charleston, S.C., police Officer Michael Slager told the judge on Friday afternoon that it's having trouble coming to a unanimous verdict. They will resume deliberating Monday. Slager is accused of murder for shooting Walter Scott multiple times as he ran away from the officer in 2015, after a routine traffic stop. The jury heard nearly a month of testimony in the case, including testimony from Slager. Friday was the third day of deliberations. The jurors had three options if they hoped to avoid a mistrial: a guilty verdict on murder or voluntary manslaughter, or an acquittal. Former S.C. Police Officer Takes The Stand At His Murder Trial But, as a series of Friday afternoon notes from the jury to the judge made clear, one of the 12 jurors could not agree with the other 11 on a guilty verdict. In a letter read from the bench by Judge Clifton Newman, the dissenting juror wrote, \"I understand the position of the court, but I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict. ... I expect those who hold opposing views will not change those views.\" \"We all struggle with the death of a man and with all that has been put before us,\" the letter continued. \"I still cannot convict the defendant. At the same time my heart does not want to tell the Scott family that the man who killed [Walter Scott] ... is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.\" Two other notes to the judge were both from the foreperson of the jury, who wrote in the first, \"It's just one juror who has the issues,\" and in the second, \"That juror needs to leave, he is having issues. Thank you. Sorry for all the notes.\" Article continues after sponsorship Around 4 p.m., Judge Newman asked the foreperson to clarify in writing whether the jury was hopelessly deadlocked. At that point, attorneys for the defense requested a mistrial, and the jury sent another note saying it was \"hopelessly deadlocked.\" But when the jury reentered the courtroom, the foreperson did not confirm that the jury would be unable to reach a unanimous verdict if they were given more time, saying instead that they felt more information about the law would have been helpful. About half an hour later, the foreperson told the judge the jury wished to keep deliberating. Earlier in the day, the judge refused to answer a question from the jury about the difference between \"fear\" and \"passion,\" which seemed to relate to the question of whether Slager acted in self-defense when he shot Scott. At one point in the afternoon, Judge Newman called the jury into the courtroom and encouraged members to break the deadlock. \"You should not give up your firmly held opinions just to be in agreement,\" Newman said, but \"the majority should consider the minority's position, and the minority should consider the majority's position.\" The judge said: \"If you cannot agree on a verdict, I must declare a mistrial. In that case, it doesn't mean anyone wins. It just means at some other time I will try this case with some other jury sitting where you now sit. The same participants will come, and the same lawyers will ask basically the same questions and get basically the same answers.\" As The Two-Way has reported, cellphone video from a bystander appears to show Slager shooting Scott multiple times in an empty lot at a distance of more than 15 feet. When Slager took the stand earlier this week, he said in his testimony that he had been \"in total fear\" during the incident, and contended, as he has previously, that Scott had taken his Taser stun gun. Video of the shooting does not appear to show any Taser in Scott's hand. The City of North Charleston has already approved a $6.5 million civil settlement with Scott's family in connection with the killing, and Slager is also facing separate federal civil rights charges for shooting Scott. As we've reported, \"in that indictment , federal prosecutors accuse Slager of deliberately misleading investigators by telling them he had fired his weapon 'while Scott was coming forward at him with a Taser.'\" The indictment continues, \"In truth and in fact, as defendant MICHAEL SLAGER then well knew, he (SLAGER) repeatedly fired his weapon at Scott as Scott was running away from him.\" ",

Mattis has not commented publicly on the incident, which was chronicled in a 2011 New York Times bestselling book, \" The Only Thing Worth Dying For ,\" by Eric Blehm. The book portrays Mattis as stubbornly unwilling to help the Green Berets. His actions, which were not formally investigated at the time, are now likely to get far more scrutiny during the retired general's Senate confirmation process. Trump's transition team did not respond to request for comment from NBC News. Nor did Mattis, whose 2013 retirement from the military means he would need a waiver from Congress to serve as the civilian Pentagon chief. Mattis is a highly decorated former wartime commander who became famous for leading the 1st Marine Division's lightning fast movement into Baghdad during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. James M. Mattis (2R), U.S. Marine General, aboard the USS Peleliu in 2001. JIM HOLLANDER / EPA On December 5, 2001, as the wreckage of the twin towers still smoldered in lower Manhattan, a team of Army Green Berets accompanying Hamid Karzai, the future president of Afghanistan, was hit by a U.S. smart bomb in a case of friendly fire. Two American soldiers died instantly and a third was badly wounded. He would later die, thought it is unclear whether that soldier would have survived had a rescue team arrived more quickly. Dozens of Afghans also were killed, and the CIA officer who now runs the agency's spying arm protected Karzai with his body. Mattis , then a brigadier general commanding a nearby group of Marines, refused repeated requests to send helicopters to rescue the Green Berets, people involved in the operation tell NBC News. The helicopters under Mattis' command at Camp Rhino were about 45 minutes away, according to the book. And, as commander, Mattis had final approval for the decision not to dispatch a rescue mission from there. Play Who is Gen.

The 15th anniversary of the Afghanistan friendly fire incident is Monday. Master Sgt. Jefferson Donald Davis, 39; Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Henry Petithory, 32; and Staff Sgt. Brian Cody Prosser, 28, were killed. Ultimately, an Air Force Special Forces unit based three hours away, in Pakistan, sent older helicopters to rescue Amerine and his men. Three more Afghans and a badly-wounded American, Brian Cody Prosser, died on the way to the hospital, according to the book. It is not known whether any of them could have been saved. FILE PICTURE: General James Mattis testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington July 27, 2010, on his nomination to be Commander of U.S. Central Command. YURI GRIPAS / Reuters Mattis declined to be interviewed for the book, Blehm, its author, told NBC News. Other witnesses quoted Mattis saying that he didn't want to send a rescue mission into an uncertain situation. According to witness accounts in the book, Mattis reportedly questioned why a rescue mission was needed and worried about whether the situation on the ground was secure. Later, when a special forces Sergeant, David Lee, protested his decision, Mattis threw him out of his office, Blehm wrote. The Obama administration was criticized for years by many Republicans\u2014including Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u2014 for failing to mount a military rescue when a diplomatic post was attacked in 2012 in Benghazi, Libya, despite military officials saying no rescue was possible. In this case, another military unit had to act because Mattis did not, Blehm said. \"The Air Force Special Operations Command had the same exact information as Mattis.

DON EMMERT / AFP - Getty Images Blehm spent three years researching the book, including a long interview with Karzai, he told NBC News. He interviewed six of the surviving eleven Green Berets involved in the operation. \"Every one of them said, when they were this mass casualty situation, either wounded tending to the wounded of their buddies, every one of them were thinking, where in the hell are the Marines?\" In his Facebook post, Amerine \u2014 who declined to speak on the record to NBC News \u2014 said it was ironic that Mattis later became famous for relieving a battalion commander for alleged indecisiveness during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \"The delay of Mattis in launching MEDEVAC on December 5th was never in question, not even by him,\" Amerine said. \"The only debate was whether it was justified and how many died as a result.\" Ken Dilanian ",

    "text": "CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration The idea was to ensure that the nation's armed forces be controlled by a civilian. Congress almost immediately waived the rule, allowing President Truman to name revered Army Gen. George Marshall to serve as defense secretary in 1950. The law was changed in 2008, reducing from ten to seven the number of years that a nominee must be retired from the military. Still, Mattis does not qualify, because he retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. The question is, how big of a problem is this for Mattis' confirmation chances? A few Democrats have already weighed in. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York issued a statement Thursday , saying: \"While I deeply respect General Mattis's service, I will oppose a waiver. Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.\" The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Adam Smith of Washington, says hearings will be needed if he is to support a waiver: \"[While] I like and respect General Mattis a great deal, the House of Representatives would have to perform a full review, including hearings by the Armed Services Committee, if it were to consider overriding the statutory prohibition on recent military officers serving as the Secretary of Defense.\" Mattis' nomination seems to have strong support from Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain of Arizona says the nation \"will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again\" and that he will move forward with the confirmation process as soon as possible. Article continues after sponsorship Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, says McCain also committed to writing legislation granting Mattis a waiver. Gillibrand could require the Senate to come up with 60 votes to approve a waiver, meaning at least eight Democrats would have to join presumably unified Senate Republicans to move the nomination to the confirmation process.

    "text": "Trump speaks with Taiwan's president, risking China tensions Published               December 02, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print FILE - In this Oct. 10, 2016, file photo, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen delivers a speech during National Day celebrations in front of the Presidential Building in Taipei, Taiwan. \u00a0(AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying, File) NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0President-elect Donald Trump spoke Friday with the president of Taiwan, a move that will be sure to anger China. It is highly unusual, probably unprecedented, for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979. Washington has pursued a so-called \"one China\" policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan. A statement from Trump's transition team said he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who offered her congratulations. \"During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties ... between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year,\" the statement said. Trump tweeted later: \"The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\" A Taiwanese source with direct knowledge of the call confirmed it had taken place. The source requested anonymity to speak about it before an official statement was issued on it from Taipei. The White House learned of the conversation after it had taken place, said a senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive diplomatic relations involved. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Friday's call is the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy. TRUMP'S EARLY CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORTERS FIND THEIR LOYALTY REWARDED Tsai was democratically elected in January and took office in May. The traditional independence-leaning policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing. Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable. Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. Although the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it has close unofficial ties. Taiwan's government has a representative office in Washington and other U.S. cities. The U.S. also has legal commitments to help Taiwan maintain the ability to defend itself. Taiwan is separated from China by the 110-mile-wide Taiwan Strait. The island counts the U.S. as its most important security partner and source of arms, but it is increasingly outgunned by China. Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on \"cross-strait\" issues. \"We remain firmly committed to our 'one China' policy,\" Price said. \"Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-strait relations.\" The NSC stressed that every president has benefited from the \"expertise and counsel\" of the State Department on matters like this, which suggested that the White House was frustrated by Trump's conversation with the Taiwanese leader. Still, the White House said Obama remains committed to a smooth transition to the new administration. Diplomatic protocol dictates that Taiwanese presidents can transit through the U.S. but not visit Washington. Douglas Paal, who served as head of the American Institute in Taiwan during the George W. Bush administration, said that to his knowledge the call was unprecedented. He said he expected Beijing to issue a verbal warning that there's no space to change the rules over Taiwan relations.

At a press conference this morning, New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu announced that 20-year-old Jordan Clay has been identified as one of two men allegedly involved in the deadly shooting. Police said today that they believe Clay and another man were in a dispute, then met on Bourbon Street, where the shooting happened. Clay has been arrested for second-degree murder , officials announced this morning. He is being held in St. Martin Parish and will be extradited to New Orleans, they said. It's unclear whether Clay has obtained a lawyer. Meanwhile, police are looking for the second suspect, the man that Clay met. That man's name has not been released. Authorities are urging anyone with information about what happened on Bourbon Street early Sunday to come forward. The deceased victim, who was caught in the crossfire, was 25-year-old Demontris Toliver, of Baton Rouge. His father spoke at this morning's news conference, saying his son was a triplet and urging his other children to stay strong through the family tragedy. ",

    "text": "WATCH NBA Pulls All-Star Game From North Carolina Over 'Anti-LGBT' Law 0 Shares Email Internal emails show that city and state officials blame a North Carolina law limiting LGBT protections for a company's decision to pick another state for a new project that includes 700 jobs. The Charlotte Observer (http://bit.ly/2gI2CAn) reports that emails obtained through public records requests show that the law known as HB2 was cited as a key factor in CoStar Group's decision not to put its hub in Charlotte. One email to city officials says the real estate research firm's CEO received pushback from his board over HB2 when they were deciding where to create a base for real-estate research operations. The company ultimately chose Richmond, Virginia, for the facility that will employ about 730 people. Jeff Edge, a Charlotte Chamber of Commerce official who was recruiting the company, wrote that CoStar's CEO was \"broadsided with their pushback over the HB2 issue in Charlotte\" when the CEO sought approval from his board to do final negotiations. Edge says in the Sept. 20 email to a city economic development official that CoStar was rethinking Charlotte \"due to all of the press and chatter over HB2 in the past week.\" The email was written not long after the NCAA and ACC moved sporting events out of the state because of the law. Edge wrote: \"They have re-opened the competition to look more closely at Atlanta and Richmond now.\" Edge also added: \"Heaven knows how many deals we've been crossed off ... and didn't know we were even being considered for since March.\" HB2 was enacted in March. A spokeswoman for CoStar said Friday that company officials wouldn't comment on what role HB2 played in their decision. Costar's decision to build its hub in downtown Richmond was announced on Oct. 24 by Virginia's governor. The company headquartered in Washington, D.C., is known for its Apartments.com website. An Oct. 25 email from a North Carolina economic development official makes an apparent reference to HB2. The email was to state officials from Garrett Wyckoff, senior manager of business recruitment for the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. \"It is my understanding that we lost the project. I have selected the following reason for this status change: Local issues,\" Wyckoff wrote in the email obtained by the Observer. For further explanation, Wyckoff added: \"Spring 2016 Legislation,\" a reference to when HB2 was passed. Wyckoff said in an email that he couldn't comment. Edge didn't respond to a phone message seeking comment Friday. HB2, enacted in March, requires transgender people to use restrooms corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings. It also excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from statewide antidiscrimination protections. Other large companies including Deutsche Bank and PayPal said publicly they chose not to bring more jobs to North Carolina because of the law. Scores of other companies have signed a letter seeking its repeal or joined a legal filing asking a judge to rule against it. The relocation of the NCAA and ACC events was estimated to deprive the state of tens of millions of dollars. The law also had an impact on the governor's race, which is still undecided. Currently, incumbent Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, who has defended the law, trails Democrat Roy Cooper, who opposed it, by thousands of votes. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "House Passes $611 Billion Defense Policy Bill by Wide Margin By richard lardner, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 2, 2016, 1:01 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH ABC's David Muir Visits the Guantanamo Detention Center 0 Shares Email The Republican-led House on Friday overwhelmingly backed a $611 billion defense policy bill that rejects a number of President Barack Obama's key proposals for managing the nation's vast military enterprise. Lawmakers passed the legislative package, 375-34. The bill now goes to the Senate where a vote is expected early next week. The bill, crafted after weeks of talks between House and Senate negotiators, prohibits Obama from following through on his longstanding campaign pledge to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bill also bars the Pentagon from reducing the number of military bases even though senior U.S. defense officials said there is excess capacity, and it awards U.S. troops their largest pay raise in six years. Obama had recommended a smaller pay increase. The bill would prevent the Pentagon from forcing thousands of California National Guard troops to repay enlistment bonuses and benefits they received a decade after they signed up to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. Soldiers would have to return a bonus only if a \"preponderance of the evidence\" shows they knew they weren't eligible to receive the money. Even at $611 billion, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee lamented that more money is needed in the defense budget to restock the U.S. arsenal worn down by 15 years of conflict. Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas said he is hopeful President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged during the campaign to spend more on the military, will ask Congress early next year to boost fiscal year 2017 military spending even further. During his 2008 bid for president, Obama pledged to close the detention facility at Guantanamo, which he called a recruiting tool for extremist groups. But Republicans and a number of Democrats repeatedly thwarted his goal over the ensuing years, arguing the prison was badly needed for housing suspected terrorists. The ban on closing the prison also includes a prohibition on moving Guantanamo detainees to secure facilities in the U.S. Trump has not only pledged to keep Guantanamo open, he said during the campaign that he wants to \"load it up with some bad dudes.\" The defense legislation also authorizes a 2.1 percent pay raise for the troops \u2014 a half-percentage point higher than the Pentagon requested in its budget presentation. The Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said it's the largest military pay increase since 2010. The White House Office of Management and Budget objected to the larger raise, telling lawmakers earlier this year that the lower amount would save $336 million this fiscal year and $2.2 billion through 2021. A bigger increase, the budget office said, would upset the careful balance between competitive pay and acquiring cutting-edge equipment and training. The bill blocks the Pentagon's planned reductions in the number of active-duty troops by prohibiting the Army from falling below 476,000 active-duty soldiers \u2014 16,000 more than Obama's defense budget had proposed. The bill also adds 7,000 service members to the Air Force and Marine Corps. House and Senate negotiators dropped a House plan to shift $18 billion from the emergency wartime spending account to pay for additional weapons and combat gear the Pentagon didn't include in its budget request. They elected instead to boost the wartime account, which isn't constrained by mandatory budget limits, by $3.2 billion to help halt a decline in the military's ability to respond to global threats. The decision may have been motivated by Trump's assurances that he would increase defense spending dramatically, allowing the armed forces to add tens of thousands more troops and acquire new weapons. The defense bill contains $5.8 billion in additional war-related funding Obama requested last month primarily for operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That includes $2.5 billion to maintain elevated U.S. troop levels of 8,400 in Afghanistan as announced over the summer. About $383 million would pay for air strikes against Islamic State militants. Lawmakers avoided wading more deeply into social policy issues by stripping two contentious provisions from the bill. One, opposed by Democrats, would have allowed federal contractors to discriminate against workers on the basis of sexual or gender orientation. Another, opposed by Republicans, would have required for the first time in U.S. history that young women sign up for a potential military draft. The Obama administration on Thursday declared its support for requiring women to register for the military draft, a symbolic but significant shift that reflects the U.S. military's evolution from a male-dominated force to one seeking to incorporate women at all levels. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner 0 Shares ",

James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis -- Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the nation\u2019s next defense secretary -- has acquired a reputation as a blunt, bull-headed, \u201cMarine\u2019s Marine.\u201d And it\u2019s easy to see why. The four-star general is a decorated war veteran who\u2019s led expeditionary forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most recently, Mattis served as chief of U.S. Central Command until 2013, when he retired amid disagreements with the White House over its foreign policy in the Middle East. The Marine Corps Times has since dubbed him \u201cthe most revered Marine in a generation.\u201d And when it comes to his straight-talking ways, the words that have come out of Mattis\u2019 mouth certainly live up to the legend. Here are some of the mad dog\u2019s most colorful quotes:\u00a0 \u201cBe polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\u201d -Gen. Mattis gave this piece of advice to Marines in Iraq, as quoted in \u201cFiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq\u201d In a similar vein, Mattis has also said: \u00a0 \u201cThere are some people who think you have to hate them in order to shoot them. I don\u2019t think you do. It\u2019s just business.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing better than getting shot at and missed. It\u2019s really great.\u201d On the flip side, the general would rather not be on the receiving end of it.\u00a0 \u201cYou go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn\u2019t wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain\u2019t got no manhood left anyway. So it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually it\u2019s quite fun to fight them, you know. It\u2019s a hell of a hoot. It\u2019s fun to shoot some people.\u201d\u00a0 Mattis said this during a 2005 panel in San Diego, California, according to a\u00a0 CNN \u00a0transcript. Later, his boss Gen. Hagee chastised his frank speech, saying Mattis \u201cshould have chosen his words more carefully.\u201d \u201cThe first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some a**holes in the world that just need to be shot.\u201d This was a line in a motivational address\u00a0to his Marines at Ayn al-Asad Airbase, an Iraqi Armed Forces and U.S. armed forces base located in western Iraq. \u201cI come in peace. I didn\u2019t bring artillery. But I\u2019m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you f*** with me, I\u2019ll kill you all.\u201d Mattis reportedly said this to Iraqi tribal leaders.\u00a0 \u201cPowerPoint makes us stupid.\u201d\u00a0 ",

McKnight, 28, was struck three times after he was shot by a man identified as Ronald Gasser, 54, who authorities have said remained at the scene following the shooting at around 2:43 p.m., officials said. Gasser was released without charges overnight but the case is still under investigation, Jefferson County Sheriff Newell Normand said. Joe McKnight in a team photo with the New York Jets in 2013. AP \"Mr. Gasser isn't going anywhere,\" Normand said. \"He has been completely cooperative with us in every request that we have made so that's not the issue.\" Gasser remained at the scene and admitted to the shooting, the sheriff's office said. Investigators believe Gasser and McKnight were part of a road rage incident that stretched from the Greater New Orleans Bridge to Terrytown, a route that stretches approximately six miles, officials said. Gasser fired three shots from a .40-caliber handgun from the driver's seat of his blue Infinity and fired the shots through the open passenger side window, the sheriff's office said. Normand said three casings were found inside the vehicle, and disputed reports in some media outlets and on social media that the shooter fired at McKnight as he the former NFL player was on the ground. \"I would strongly suggest that you stop believing what you're reading, so let me put just a couple of things that I've been made aware of to rest. \"Mr. Gasser did not stand over Mr. McKnight and fire shots into him. The three casings were located within the vehicle. Mr. Gasser was in his vehicle when he fired three shots.\" He also said no video has been found and police have no witness account of an apology from McKnight to Gasser, contradicting what he said was false information making the rounds. Gasser family source: \"We send our thoughts & prayers to the McKnight family. We pray all will be patient & wait for the facts to come out.\u201d \u2014 Jacob Rascon (@Jacobnbc) December 2, 2016 The coroner, Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich, said an autopsy shows that McKnight was struck three times \u2014 in the index finger of his left hand, in his right shoulder and in his right chest. \"The wounds are not consistent with being shot from above while [McKnight was] on the ground,\" he said. The sheriff was adamant that he had released Gasser so that the sheriff's department could collect more evidence and witness testimony \u2014 as they believe there are still more to be found. The department had been criticized after it released Gasser late Thursday night without pressing charges. Normand said Louisiana has statutes \"that provide defenses to certain crimes\" but did not elaborate, and said arresting Gasser would have forced police to reveal parts of the investigation. \"External influences will not motivate this office one way or the other as to how we're going to conduct this investigation strategically,\" Normand said. The sheriff said as many as 40 members of law enforcement were working on the case.

Michael DeMocker / The Times-Picayune Protesters had collected outside of the sheriff department's office. Normand also said he had received the protest organizers request that the office close a portion of the highway for their demonstration. He made it clear that he would not close any roadways. \"It's not going to happen,\" he said. \"I will work with you to get your message across, but it's not going to be the detriment of the other citizens of Jefferson Parish,\" he said, explaining that he would not hesitate to arrest demonstrators who did not adhere to local and state laws. He also dismissed any suggestions that his office was racist or not fully investigating the case. Normand pointed to a longstanding relationship that the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office has held with McKnight's family. \"I'll throw this out there, the gentleman who raised Joe McKnight Jr. used to work for this office,\" he said. \"This office is close to his family.\" According to the sheriff, McKnight's guardian was a deputy for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. NBC News has been unable to confirm this detail. Phil McCausland ",

USA TODAY WASHINGTON \u2014 By calling Taiwan's president Friday, President-elect Donald Trump broke a 37-year precedent that limited direct talks with a U.S. president or president-elect and the leader of the island nation off the coast of China. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, center. \u00a0(Photo: SAM YEH, AFP/Getty Images) \u201cPresident-elect Trump spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, who offered her congratulations,\" a Trump transition team statement released Friday said. \"During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties\u00a0exists\u00a0between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.\u201d No U.S. president has spoken directly to a Taiwanese leaders since 1979, when President Jimmy Carter announced full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and ended relations with Taiwan. Later Friday evening Trump tweeted about the call in an attempt to clarify who made the call. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 The White House immediately responded to the Trump phone call, emphasizing that there has been no change to the longstanding, bipartisan U.S. policy. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to our \u2018one China\u2019 policy,\u201d said Ned Price, a spokesman for President Obama\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cOur fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations.\u201d It is the second call this week in which Trump risked a diplomatic rift by talking to a foreign leader. On Wednesday, he spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whom he praised as a great leader. A longtime U.S. ally, Pakistan has also been the source of frustration for U.S. leaders because of its nuclear weapons program and long rivalry with India, with which it has fought three major wars since 1947. Details of Trump's call were first reported by the Financial Times of Great Britain, which quoted former White House official Evan Medeiros: \u201cThe Chinese leadership will see this as a highly provocative action, of historic proportions.\" Criticism was swift. Ari Fleisher, who was press secretary under George W. Bush and has been critical of Trump,\u00a0reflected on his time in the administration following the news. Uh-oh. I wasn't even allowed to refer to the gvt \"of\" Taiwan. (I could say gvt \"on\" Taiwan.) China will go nuts. https://t.co/vJcBD2rika \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) December 2, 2016 Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy went on a tweetstorm over the news, calling for Trump to nominate a secretary of State, \"like really really soon\" to try and get a strategy together. (1) Foreign policy consistency is a means, not an end. It's not sacred. Thus, it's Trump's right to shift policy, alliances, strategy. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 2, 2016 (2) What has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy w/out any plan. That's how wars start. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 2, 2016 (3) And if they aren't pivots - just radical temporary deviations - allies will walk if they have no clue what we stand for. Just as bad. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 2, 2016 (4) It's probably time we get a Secretary of State nominee on board. Preferably w experience. Like, really really soon. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 2, 2016 \"I'm shocked, shocked, that ignoring the State Department and winging conversations with foreign leaders has triggered an international incident! \" Daniel W. Drezner, who is a\u00a0professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said in an email to USA TODAY. \u00a0\"Now Americans have to hope that Beijing responds by retaliating against Trump's business interests rather than American interests in the Pacific Rim.\" And some linked the call to Trump's business interests in Taiwan. \"Everything we feared about Donald Trump wreaking havoc is coming true,\" said Jessica Mackler, president of the Democratic super PAC American Bridge..\" A report that Trump risks a major rift with China by speaking with the Taiwanese leader proves that Trump is dangerously incapable of keeping the United States safe \u2014\u00a0and this is still nearly two months before his inauguration. Was Donald Trump interested in breaking with more than forty years of U.S. policy because he wants to make money by building a hotel in Taiwan? Or is Trump simply threatening our precarious relationship with China because he is naive?\" American Bridge pointed to a Shangaiist article that said\u00a0 mayor of Taoyuan confirmed earlier this week that Trump was considering building hotels and resorts in the Taiwanese city.

The fires, described as the state's largest in 100 years, are believed to be human-caused, authorities said. Twelve of the victims died as a direct result of the firestorm, and one victim died of a heart attack while trying to escape a blaze, officials said at a news conference this morning. The briefing was held in Gatlinburg -- one the worst-hit cities in Sevier County. \"It certainly is distressing and saddening to all of us, and we are extending our sympathy to all the families that are involved,\" Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said. \"I can\u2019t describe you the feeling that we have over this tragedy, and, especially, the loss of lives.\" SLIDESHOW: SLIDESHOW: Wildfires Devastate Eastern Tennessee Town The identifies of six of the 13 deceased have been confirmed, Waters said. He emphasized that authorities want to make sure they are \"absolutely certain\" that they are accurate on the names of the deceased and that their immediate families have been informed before releasing such information to the public. Six victims were identified by officials today. - John Teglar, 71, and Janet Teglar, 70 -- who had been visiting from Canada - Jon Summers, 61, and Janet Summers, 60 -- who had been visiting from Memphis, Tennessee - May Vance, 75, a Gatlinburg, Tennessee, resident who died from heart attack related to smoke inhalation - Alice Hagler, 70, a Gatlinburg, Tennessee, resident At least 85 other people have been injured as a direct result of the fires, and more than 1,000 structures have been severely damaged or destroyed, according to Waters. Officials believe that 90 percent of the affected areas in the county will have undergone a preliminary search by this evening, Waters said. He added that \"we hope and pray\" the death toll does not climb. Bill May/Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts/EPA A school building burns as wildfires move through Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Nov. 28, 2016. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is continuing to follow up on leads to locate reported missing persons, Waters said. Anyone who wants to report a missing person, or knows of a missing person who has been found, is urged to call the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND. Homeowners and renters in Gatlinburg have also finally been allowed to go into the city to check on their properties as of this morning, Waters said. He added that officials hope to have Gatlinburg open to the public by Wednesday, Dec. 7. Property owners can also check on the condition of their properties via an interactive map at www.seviercountytn.org , Waters said. He added that it was important to note that the map will be gradually updated, so owners should check back frequently throughout the weekend.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam , Sen. Lamar Alexander and Sen. Bob Corker also attended the news conference this morning. Haslam said he has received calls of support \"from almost every governor in the country,\" as well as from President Obama, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \"We all love these mountains,\" Haslam said. \"It's a special place.\" Yin Bogu/Xinhua/Redux Pictures Local resident Ralph Cogdill checks the debris of his house which was ruined by a wildfire in Pigeon Forge, Sevier County, Tennessee, on Nov. 30, 2016. Alexander said though the fire was \"terrifying and impressive,\" the community's and nation's response to it \"is even more impressive.\" \"My heart breaks for the families who've lost loved ones and homes, but I know you'll be back because east Tennesseans are strong, tough and resilient,\" he said. Corker acknowledged that having 13 lives lost was \"an incredible tragedy,\" but he said he also wanted to give his \"hats off\" to the first responders and volunteers. Brian Blanco/Getty Images Volunteers and evacuees watch a news segment about the nearby fire in Gatlinburg, Tennessee at a shelter, on Nov. 29, 2016, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Towards the end of the news conference, a few reporters got into a heated exchange with officials. The reporters questioned if people in the area were given early enough notice to evacuate. Officials noted that an evacuation alert was sent out to mobile phones in the area around 9:04 p.m. Monday, though power outages made some notifications difficult to send. One official noted that if some people did not receive the alert sent out then, \"of course we're unsatisfied.\" Waters said at another news conference this afternoon that the storm was a tragedy and that authorities did the best they could. \u201cWe're going to evaluate the responses and what went on at the appropriate time,\" he said. \"That time is not now.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "December 2, 20166:01 PM ET The Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters went to court Friday to prevent or halt election recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, less than two weeks before the states would have to complete the tasks to meet a federal deadline to certify their election results. 5 Fact Checks From Trump's Cincinnati 'Thank-You Tour' Kickoff The legal actions seeking to block or halt the recounts in three states Trump narrowly won could cause delays that would make them extremely difficult or impossible to complete on time. Even if the recounts happen, though, none would be expected to give Democrat Hillary Clinton enough votes to emerge as the winner. The recounts were requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who says they're necessary to ensure that voting machines weren't hacked, even though there's no evidence that they were. Critics say Stein is simply trying to raise money and her political profile while building a donor database. Wisconsin Agrees To Presidential Vote Recount At Third-Party Candidates' Requests \"In an election already tainted by suspicion, previously expressed by Donald Trump himself, verifying the vote is a common-sense procedure that would address concerns around voter disenfranchisement,\" Stein said in a statement. \"Trump's desperate attempts to silence voter demands raise a simple question: why is Donald Trump afraid of these recounts?\" Wisconsin is the only state where a recount is underway. It began Thursday, and one of the state's 72 counties had already completed its task by Friday, with Clinton gaining a single a vote on Trump. Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. Two pro-Trump groups, the Great America PAC and the Stop Hillary PAC, along with Wisconsin voter Ronald R. Johnson went to federal court late Thursday to try and stop the recount. U.S. District Judge James Peterson on Friday rejected their request for a temporary restraining order to immediately halt the recount, saying there was no harm in allowing it to continue while the court considers their lawsuit. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Dec. 9. The lawsuit says Wisconsin is violating the U.S. Supreme Court's 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling because it doesn't have uniform standards to determine which votes should be counted in a recount. They also argue that it threatens due process rights because it may not get done by the federal deadline to certify the vote, putting Wisconsin's electoral votes in jeopardy. Article continues after sponsorship Clinton Campaign Says It Will Participate In Recount Efforts If states miss the deadline, Congress would allot their electoral votes. The Wisconsin Department of Justice was reviewing the lawsuit, said Johnny Koremenos, spokesman for Attorney General Brad Schimel. Michigan's elections board deadlocked Friday on a Trump campaign request to deny Stein's recount request and on how a recount would be conducted. Both Republican members voted to prevent the recount while both Democrats voted to allow it, meaning it likely would begin Wednesday unless the courts intervene. It also would be conducted by hand, as Stein requested. In separate lawsuits against the state, Michigan's Republican attorney general and Trump asked state courts to prevent the recount, saying Stein should not be allowed to seek one because she finished so far behind Trump and Clinton that she couldn't have won, even if some votes were miscounted. Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in all three states. The Michigan courts appeared unlikely to rule immediately, with one asking for a response from state elections officials by Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, a hearing is scheduled for Monday on Stein's push to secure a court-ordered statewide recount there. Republican lawyers filed a motion that was posted on the court's website Friday accusing Stein of engaging in legal antics and saying her recount request endangers Pennsylvania's ability to certify its electors by the federal deadline. Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the votes in all three states suggest that there could have been tampering with the vote, perhaps through a well-coordinated, highly complex cyberattack. Elections officials in the three states have expressed confidence in their results. Trump defeated Clinton in Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. His margin of victory in Michigan was even slimmer, at about 10,700 votes out of 4.8 million cast. An updated count Friday by Pennsylvania election officials showed Trump's lead over Clinton in that state had shrunk to 49,000 from 71,000, as more counties wrap up final tallies. That put Trump's lead at 0.8 percent, down from over 1 percent, out of 6 million votes cast. It's still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount. ",

    "text": "Dec 2 2016, 5:51 pm ET Suspect in Murder 'Witnessed' By Family Parrot Appears in Court by Corky Siemaszko JUNE 3: Parrot May Have Witnessed Murder, Repeating Victim's Last Words 2:12 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161203000927if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/698340419516\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> A Michigan woman accused of gunning down her husband appeared in court Friday, but the only witness to the alleged crime remained behind bars. A bird cage, to be exact. The case of Glenna Duram made national news last year when it was revealed that her parrot Bud was the sole witness of the fatal shooting of her 45-year-old husband Martin on May 12, 2015. And remains to be seen if he will sing like a canary during the trial. \"Don't f---ing shoot,\" Bud could be heard on a video that family members recorded several weeks after the killing \u2014 and in which they insisted he was mimicking the couple as they were arguing. Family members believe an African grey parrot named \"Bud\" may have witnessed the fatal shooting of his owner. WOODTV \"That bird picks up anything and everything,\" the victim's mother, Lillian Duram, told Today in June . \"He's got the filthiest mouth around.\" Duram, who survived what prosecutors believe was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, is charged with first-degree murder. Witnesses took the stand as Duram heard evidence against her at the preliminary hearing Friday. One witness said the state of the house suggested a struggle, NBC affiliate WOOD in Grand Rapids reported. The local prosecutor previously told the station that he has not ruled out putting the African Grey parrot on the stand. But Bud's current owner told the station the prosecutor believes he has enough evidence against Duram to convict her and won't need to make the caged bird sing. Still, if the prosecutor puts Bud on the stand \u2014 the legal feathers could fly. \"This is unusual,\" NBC analyst Lisa Bloom said earlier on Today . \"We don't often have an animal being called to come in and testify as an eyewitness to a murder.\" Duram was her husband's second wife and police said the marriage was strained by financial and gambling problems. Police, earlier, said Duram left several suicide notes. She denied writing them and is being held without bond at the Newaygo County Jail. Corky Siemaszko ",

The college in Amherst had lowered the U.S. flag to half-staff after Election Day. The flag was found burned on Veterans Day, and the school chose to stop flying it \u2013 and any other flags \u2013 a week later. \"We understand that many who hold the flag as a powerful symbol of national ideals and their highest aspirations for the country -- including members of our own community -- felt hurt by our decisions, and that we deeply regret,\" the college's president, Jonathan Lash, stated Friday. He added, \"We did not lower the flag to make a political statement. ...\u00a0We acted solely to facilitate much-needed dialogue on our campus about how to dismantle the bigotry that is prevalent in our society.\" SNOOP DOGG SLAMS COLIN KAEPERNICK FOR CASTRO PRAISE The school's choice to stop flying the flag\u00a0triggered widespread condemnation and a protest by veterans groups and their supporters outside campus. Last weekend,\u00a0dozens of vets and other activists held American flags and chanted, \"U.S.A.,\" in a rally that organizers called a \"peaceful demonstration of freedom.\" Mayor Domenic Sarno of nearby Springfield and others at the rally said the school's decision disrespected veterans and current military members. In video that aired Wednesday on \" The O'Reilly Factor ,\" Fox News' Jesse Watters confronted Lash, who refused to comment on the controversy at that time. \"Hampshire staff and faculty have led facilitated discussions, I have held multiple focus group sessions, and all of our students, faculty, and staff have been invited to contribute their opinions, questions, and perspectives about the U.S. flag. This is what free speech looks like,\" Lash said Friday. \u00a0\u00a0 Fox News' Kendall Gastelu and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

The blizzard this week, she said, has only deepened the campers' resolve. She said there is a \"community\" of people who chop wood all day to be used for fires in the evening. Each group coordinates with other tents throughout the camp, all with the goal of ensuring that all of the estimated 5,000-6,000 people at camp are provided with warm shelter through the night.

As the temperature dips at the camp, protesters hunker down in Yurts \u2014 portable round tents made with animal skins or felt that have kept Mongolian nomads warm for more than 3,000 years. \"They provide an incredible amount of warmth, especially when you have a portable wood stove inside,\" said the 24-year-old Grassrope, who was one of the first to reside at the camp in late summer. \"We are natives and we know how to live with the land.\" Snow covers the ground at Oceti Sakowin Camp on Thursday.

    "text": "WATCH New Details in Sherri Papini's Alleged Kidnapping 0 Shares Email On Wednesday, Nov. 2, Sherri Papini, a 34-year-old mother of two, went out for a jog in the family\u2019s Redding, California, neighborhood, and mysteriously vanished. \u201cI remember everything about that day,\u201d her husband, Keith Papini, told ABC News' \u201c20/20\u201d in an exclusive interview. That day began like any other for the Papini family. It was about 6:50 a.m. when Keith said he was on his way out the door to head to his job as an audio-video specialist. Sherri was checking on their 2-year-old daughter, Violet, when Keith said he met her at the door, gave her a hug and kiss, and left for work. That was the last time he saw Sherri before she would be allegedly kidnapped and held captive for the next 22 days. Watch the full story on ABC News' \"20/20\" TONIGHT at 10 p.m. ET. The Moment Keith Knew Something Was Wrong When Keith returned home from work that evening, he said he was expecting to have his wife, daughter and 4-year-old son, Tyler, greet him at the door, but only found unsettling silence inside the house. \u201cI looked in different rooms and couldn\u2019t find anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018Maybe they\u2019re outside,\u2019 and I looked around outside ... but at the time I thought, \u2018Huh, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all together.\u2019 I had no reason to believe otherwise.\u201d ABC News Keith Papini spoke to ABC News' Matt Gutman about the ordeal his wife Sherri Papini went through. Keith said he opened up the \u201cFind My iPhone \u201d feature on his iPhone to search for Sherri\u2019s iPhone and see if he could find her location. It showed Sherri\u2019s phone was near their mailbox, about a mile away from the house. At first, Keith said he thought maybe she had taken the kids for a walk to get the mail. Keith said he called his mother and asked her if she had spoken to Sherri. When she told him no, he called the kids\u2019 day care. \u201cThe first thing I said was, \u2018What time did Sherri pick up the kids today?\u2019\u201d Keith said. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018The kids are here.\u2019 It was like, \u2018Something is wrong, there is something wrong right now.\u2019\u201d \u201cI got in the car and immediately drove down the end of our mailbox, and was anticipating I would see her walking,\u201d he said. But his wife nowhere to be seen. Frantic, Keith started driving around, scouring their area around their property. He went back to the mailbox where the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d feature had first pinpointed Sherri\u2019s phone. \u201cIt did not take me long [to find it]. It was right off the road,\u201d he said. Next to her phone, Keith found Sherri\u2019s headphones, which he said were tangled with strands of her blond hair. \u201cIf she would have lost her phone driving home one day and she had put it on the roof of her car one day and drove off, you know OK, I could see that happening,\u201d he said. \u201cBut her car was at home and the kids were at school. I knew something was wrong.\u201d Keith went into full crisis mode and dialed 911. Within hours, deputies launched a search for Sherri, and over the next several days, more than 100 people volunteered to help. \u201cPeople would see me and start crying and give me hugs ... total strangers,\u201d Keith said. Telling The Children That Their Mom Was Missing Keith said he spent many sleepless nights caring for his family and searching for his wife. \u201cI was just worried about her health,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they feeding her? Is she hot? Is she cold? Just little horrible things that I would go through.\u201d Courtesy of Keith Papini Keith and Sherri Papini are pictured together in this undated photo. In searching for his wife, he admits there were times of immense despair. \u201cThere was a moment where we were heading back after we did a few mile search and we look up and we start to see birds circling,\u201d Keith said. \u201cAnd I went to my knees and I thought, \u2018Am I really hiking out here to look for my wife and I don\u2019t want to find her right now, but I do want to find her' ... that was a tough one for me that day.\u201d As he was dealing with the agony of losing his wife, Keith said he still had to care for their two kids, and his family and friends came to the rescue to help keep them entertained and happy. But after a couple of days, Keith couldn\u2019t hide the fact that Sherri was missing from Tyler. \u201cI told him I had something important to tell him and he jumped on the couch and he knew something was up and said, \u2018Dad, you can tell me anything,\u2019\u201d Keith said, through tears. \u201cFor a little 4-year-old to say that I wasn\u2019t prepared for that. \u201cAnd I just said, \u2018Son, mommy went running and she didn\u2019t come home and we\u2019re all looking for her right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we just held each other ... and I said, \u2018We\u2019re going to find her and we\u2019re going to get her back.\u2019\u201d One day, Keith said he found Tyler standing in front of Sherri\u2019s picture. \u201cHe was just standing there and he had his left hand on her face,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was just staring at her ... and he just, you know, tears in his eyes with his hands on her face.\u201d At this time, Keith, his family and friends were growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in his wife\u2019s missing persons case. \u201cI was very upset. I wanted more involvement with everybody ... I wanted every law enforcement agency out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted Marines, the Army ... I wanted everything of course. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to find my wife.\u201d Sherri\u2019s older sister, Sheila Koester, who is seven months pregnant, says she focused on protecting Keith, and making sure he ate and was taking care of himself. \u201cI think Keith and I supported each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made sure that I stayed in the house and wasn\u2019t traipsing through fields, going through places, because he knows I probably would have been doing that.\u201d The Search for Sherri and Suspects Although any husband would be a suspect in his wife\u2019s disappearance, Koester said she knew he had nothing to do with it. The family knew Sherri as \u201csuper mom\u201d and Keith was a wonderful husband, she said. \u201cYou would hope that your child or your daughter would find someone so loving, so dedicated to their spouse,\u201d she said. To ease any doubt, Keith consented to taking an hours-long polygraph test. \u201cThey asked me multiple questions. He said, \u2018These things you have to pass with a 100 percent. You can\u2019t get 99.\u2019 To me, I was like, \u2018No, problem. Let\u2019s hurry this up and get this over with,\u2019\u201d recalled Keith. It took at least nine days before police cleared Keith of any suspicion. \u201cWe were going through investigating hundreds of tips, looking at cell phone data,\u201d Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko told \u201c20/20.\u201d Bosenko said they followed up on more than 400 tips, none of which led them to Sherri. \u201cThe investigators had basically been working three weeks straight, nonstop -- pouring their heart and souls into this investigation. But so far, no viable leads,\u201d said Bosenko. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever lost hope, but it was eating away at me big time,\u201d Keith said. \u201cDid I do everything I could? Yes or no? I just wanted to make sure I checked 'yeah' on every single thing.\u201d The Papini family started a GoFundMe account, and they raised nearly $50,000 in donations. Then, Keith took a chance with a man named Cameron Gamble, who said he represented an anonymous donor. Gamble, who calls himself an international kidnapping ransom consultant, and the anonymous donor set up a website and offered a large cash ransom. \u201cOne of the big things was finding a creative way to get her story out there bigger,\u201d Gamble told \u201c20/20.\u201d Like Keith, Gamble was convinced that Sherri had been abducted. He was also confident that Keith wasn\u2019t involved, and that Sherri didn\u2019t walk way voluntarily. Though investigators did not support Gamble\u2019s involvement, Keith said he was willing to do anything to get Sherri home. \u201cFor me, I was going to do everything I could to get my wife back, and if this was going to work, I was going to try it,\u201d Keith said. On Nov. 23, the day before Thanksgiving, Gamble posted a video online informing Sherri\u2019s alleged captors that the ransom was \u201coff the table\u201d and calling for the public to find Sherri in exchange for a hefty reward. \u201cI wanted to make it so tempting that the abductor\u2019s own mother would have turned him in,\u201d Gamble said. The Day Keith Learned His Wife Had Been Found Alive The next day, before dawn, Keith missed a phone call on his cell phone from a number he didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cImmediately after that, my home phone rang,\u201d Keith said. \u201cIt was my wife screaming in the background, yelling my name, and a CHP [California High Patrol] officer that seemed somewhat confused at the moment, like, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u2026 [the officer] said, \u2018I need you to be calm. I need you to be calm.\u2019 \u2026 I already know it\u2019s her. I can tell her voice.\u201d At first, Keith said he didn\u2019t know what happening, whether his wife was hurt or not. He could only hear her screaming. \u201cI get the phone and, [I said], \u2018Oh my God, honey.\u2019 And of course she's screaming,\u201d Keith said. \u201cIt's very emotional. And, \u2018I love you, I love you, I love you, Oh my God, you're here. You're back. Where are you?\u2019 And then the phone gets taken away from her. Like, super quick.\u201d Getting that phone call and hearing his wife screaming made him feel \u201cvery mixed emotion[s],\u201d Keith said. \u201cI'm panicked but I'm happy because at this point this is the first time I've heard her voice,\u201d he added. \u201cI know she's alive.\u201d Soon after getting the call, Keith said he told the couple\u2019s two children their mother had been found. He said he told their 4-year-old son first. \u201cI sat him down, and I was on my knees and he was standing up,\u201d Keith said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You know what, buddy? I found mom,\u2019 and he got the biggest grin.\u2019\u201d He then told their 2-year-old daughter. \u201cI wanted to do it one by one,\u201d Keith said. After learning that his wife was found alive, Keith raced to the hospital where she was taken over two hours away. He said at first he was not allowed into the hospital, but when he was, he raced to see her. \u201cI just wanted to hold her. And we just had her. We just embraced each other and cried together. And I mean, I was so happy, though. I mean -- how do you explain it? You're upset and everything at what happened, but you're happy. She's here,\u201d Keith said. Keith said Sherri\u2019s face was very badly beaten and that her long, blond hair had been chopped off to above her shoulders. Sherri also lost almost 15 percent of her body weight. \u201cThe bruises were just intense. The bumps from, you know, being hit and kicked and whatever else. Her nose, so dark and yellow,\u201d Keith said. \u201cIt made me sick that there [are] people out there that could do something like this.\u201d When Sheila saw her sister for the first time at the hospital, she said she was as battered as Keith described. \"It was amazing to see her but it was hard to see her in the condition that she was in,\" she said. \"But it was just amazing to see her alive and talking and saying our names. It was the best present that I could have ever received from anyone.\" Sherri hasn\u2019t spoken publicly yet about how she got to the highway where she was found or how she was freed from her captors. The story of her release comes solely from her account to police and to her husband. According to Keith, Sherri was bound with a chain around her waist inside a vehicle with her alleged captors. Keith said his wife told him that at some point her alleged captors stopped the vehicle on a road. \u201cThey opened the door. She doesn't know because she had a bag over her head. They cut something to free her of her restraint that was holding her into the vehicle and then pushed her out of the vehicle,\u201d Keith said. According to Keith, Sherri said her captors then drove away. \u201cSherri obviously has one free hand that still has some kind of, something like a hose clamp if you will, and then took obviously the bag off of her head,\u201d Keith said. \u201cShe, at this point, has no idea where she's at, and gets up and basically tries to find help, runs to a house that didn't have any lights on, and didn't look what she said was very inviting, looked scary, and obviously if you could imagine her state of mind at this point.\u201d Keith continued, \u201cThere was a junkyard or some kind of yard or something like that that she tried to get into and a big dog started barking and scared her, and then she went and familiarized herself with where she was at by standing in the overpass and noticed I-5 symbols and she knew that I-5 North is where we live. Anything past our house, you're up in Mount Shasta area.\u201d Keith said Sherri saw lights and ran to another building. When she could not get into that building, Keith said, Sherri then ran to the freeway. Stranded in the middle of nowhere, Keith said Sherri attempted to flag passing motorists on the highway. Alison Sutton happened to be driving down I-5 North when she saw Sherri. \u201cI saw a woman frantically waving what looked like a shirt up and down, trying to flag somebody down. I was started to see her. It was dark and she pretty much just came out of nowhere,\u201d Sutton told \u201c20/20.\u201d \u201cIf I had swerved to the right at least a little bit, I would have hit her with my car. She had, like, a wide-eyed, panicked kind of look. I figured if she was willing to risk being hit by a car trying to get somebody\u2019s attention that she must really need some help.\u201d Sutton said she pulled off the highway and called 911. Dozens of other drivers also called 911 on Sherri\u2019s behalf. Keith said that Sherri was trying to flag people down for an extended amount of time and that several people drove past her without stopping. \u201cShe screams so much. She said she was coughing up blood from the screaming, trying to get somebody to stop,\u201d Keith said. \u201cAgain, just another sign of how my wife is: She\u2019s saying, \u2018Well, maybe people aren\u2019t stopping because I have a chain. It looks like I broke out of prison.\u2019 So she tried to tuck in her chain under her clothes.\u201d Rescue workers raced to the scene, which was 150 miles away from the Papinis' Redding home. Sherri was disoriented from 22 days in captivity and didn\u2019t know what time or what day it was, Keith said. \u201cShe thought it was late that night, so when the paramedics finally were talking to her, they were the first people to tell her, 'Happy Thanksgiving.' It just blew her mind and then she's like, 'Oh, it's Thanksgiving night?' And they said, \u2018No, it\u2019s Thanksgiving morning,\u2019\u201d Keith said. Where the Case Stands Today and How the Papini Family Is Healing Authorities are still hunting for the alleged kidnappers. Based on Sherri's description of her alleged captors, Sheriff Bosenko told ABC News that authorities are searching for two Hispanic female adults armed with a gun and driving a dark SUV. One suspect, the younger of the two, was described as having long curly hair and a thick accent, pierced ears and thin eyebrows, Bosenko said, while the other woman, the older one, was described as having straight black hair with some grays and thick eyebrows. Police artists are now working on a composite sketch. Keith said he is focused on what is next for his family\u2019s healing. \u201cYou would expect that I want to get these people ... and then your mind goes into a place that it shouldn\u2019t and I think most people are doing that,\u201d Keith said. \u201cClearly, I want justice but right now I\u2019m just happy that my wife is back. I don\u2019t have to raise my kids without her.\u201d Even in the midst of the gratitude he feels, Keith said he knows his wife\u2019s road to recovery won\u2019t be easy. \u201cWhen lights are off, when doors shut, when she hears certain sounds, I mean it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t know how to deal with and we\u2019ll need somebody who can help her through that from a professional standpoint,\u201d Keith said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to have to reach out for something for some of my feelings as well. It\u2019s not just a long road. It\u2019s something we\u2019re never going to forget.\u201d ABC News' Jim DuBreuil, Lynn Redmond, Andrew Paparella and Astrid Rodrigues contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Miller , USA TODAY 8:21 p.m. EST December 2, 2016 Share The D.C. landmark will remain closed for repairs until at least 2019. USA TODAY The Washington Monument is lit up as it undergoes repairs in Washington on July 8, 2013. (Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) Businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein has agreed to donate $2 to $3 million to renovate the Washington Monument's elevator, but the D.C. landmark will remain closed at least until 2019. Rubenstein's gift will allow the National Park Service to modernize the monument's elevator\u00a0by replacing its computer system and adding diagnostic technology to better monitor and repair its problems. The gift will also improve the mechanical hardware of the existing system. Rubenstein had already donated $7.5 million to repair the monument after a 2011 earthquake left it damaged and cracked. The monument was\u00a0open for two years after the earthquake repairs were finished before\u00a0closing again\u00a0on\u00a0Aug. 17 due to ongoing issues with its\u00a0elevator. \"Mr. Rubenstein\u2019s continued support for the Washington Monument will ensure generations of visitors can safely enjoy this historically significant monument for years to come,\"\u00a0Director of the National Park Service\u00a0Jonathan B. Jarvis said in a press release. There is no start date for the project,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0 reported , because the park service wants to fund and and construct a new security screening entrance at the same time. The park service has requested federal funds for that project as a part of the next fiscal year's budget. D.C.\u2019s Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton said in a statement that she will urge Congress to include the project in its continuing resolution that will likely fund the government into next spring so that the park service can save both time and money by working on both projects at the same time. Earlier this year, Rubenstein, co-founder of the private equity firm the Carlyle Group,\u00a0also donated\u00a0$18.5 million for restorations to the Lincoln Memorial and\u00a0$5.37 million last year for the\u00a0U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial. Will Shafroth, president of the National Park Foundation said in a press release that Rubenstein\u00a0\"carries on the legacy of private citizens who came together to establish and support our national parks.\" Follow Ryan Miller on Twitter @MILLERdfillmore 9537 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 21 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gvMRPb ",

Trump's objection ultimately failed as the board, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, split 2-2 along party lines. Play Will battleground state recounts make a difference? 5:18 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161202212632if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/819563075601\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \"I believe we are now having a recount, and it will be done by paper ballot,\" said Democratic board member Julie Matuzak at the end of the vote on the objection, which was filed Thursday. Attorneys Gary Gordon and John Pirich argued on behalf of Trump and his presidential campaign that former Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein's petition for a recount should be invalidated. \"Being disappointed in the results is not aggrieved,\" Gordon said. He argued that a fourth place-finishing candidate such as Stein had no reason to believe that a recount would change her fate in the election. Michigan certified its election results on November 28, showing Trump beating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton 2,279,543 votes to 2,268,83 votes. Stein captured just 51,463 votes. Trump's attorneys worked to convince the room Stein had not been aggrieved while emphasizing the cost of a recount for the state's taxpayers. \"If you have no evidence of wrongdoing\u2026why should we impose a $5 million charge on the state of Michigan?\" asked Gordon. While there is no determined cost yet, state officials estimate the recount could cost the state more than $4 million. \"This is not a petition for a recount, this is a statement,\" later asserted Pirich, referring to the brevity of and lack of details in the original petition filed by Stein's lawyers on November 30th. Pirich said the petition should be \"disqualified,\" consistent with the Trump objection filed on December 1. Stein attorney Mark Brewer argued primarily that because his client's petition was filed appropriately and within the allotted timeframe, the Trump team's arguments were \"legally irrelevant\" to the question of if the recount should be blocked. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette filed a Friday morning lawsuit to try to stop the recount in court. \"The Attorney General\u2026asks this court to immediately issue a writ of mandamus to prohibit the recount because Stein is not an aggrieved candidate,\" read the lawsuit provided to NBC News. \"If the court enjoins us from moving forward, then we're enjoined and it won't go forward,\" said Thomas. The board brought up a separate motion to count the votes using tabulation machines instead of hand counting as is precedent in Michigan, but that vote too failed in a deadlocked 2-2 vote. Thomas argued that hand counting the ballots will actually be faster than using machines. \"The hand recount will beat the machine every day,\" Thomas told NBC News. Speed is important to all sides, as the federal deadline for states to complete their recounts is December 13, ahead of the state electors convening on December 19th to cast their Electoral College votes. Thomas suggested it is possible to meet the deadline. If there is no court action, the recount is scheduled to begin sometime between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning of next week. MI certified their results on November 28 with these results: Trump won with 2,279,543 votes Clinton came in second with 2,268,839 votes Stein came in fourth with 51,463 votes Danny Freeman ",

Mark Humphrey/AP In eastern Tennessee, officials say a wildfire that tore through resort towns in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains earlier this week killed at least 13 people and destroyed nearly 1,000 structures, according to local officials and the state emergency management agency. The confirmed death toll in and around the tourist town of Gatlinburg in Sevier County has climbed steadily since the fire raced into town overnight on Monday. On Friday, search and rescue crews from state law enforcement agencies and the national guard were still looking for people who had not made it out of town before they were trapped by flames. The state bureau of investigation has set up a hotline to report missing people. A charred birdcage sits in the smoldering remains of a home in Gatlinburg, Tenn. Brian Blanco/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption A charred birdcage sits in the smoldering remains of a home in Gatlinburg, Tenn. Brian Blanco/Getty Images The Knoxville News Sentinel reported that, although the deadly wildfire had been burning in nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park for days before it moved into town, an emergency evacuation notice did not get to some residents until after the fire was already within city limits. The newspaper added : \"The citywide evacuation order was never relayed directly to area mobile devices due to the constraints of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, which limits the text messages to 90 characters, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dean Flener confirmed Thursday. \" 'You cannot just tell them (to evacuate.) You have to tell them what to do,' Flener said. 'People will panic more and you will get people in dangerous situations because you have not told them more.' \"Instead, the evacuation notice was issued to area TV and radio outlets for broadcast \u2014 several hours after the flames had reached Gatlinburg.\" Article continues after sponsorship More than 24 hours before the fire entered city limits, the National Weather Service issued a high wind watch for the area, warning of \"winds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts over 60 mph possible across higher terrain.\" Gatlinburg Fire Department Chief Greg Miller said at a press conference Thursday the fire had moved very quickly, overwhelming the resources of his department and national park fire authorities, who did not know that winds would gust as violently as they did. Miller told reporters: \"I believe it was around 5 p.m. on Monday I gave a press release that said there are zero fires within the city of Gatlinburg. \"Within that next 50 to 60 minutes, because of the wind pushing the ... fires closer to the corporate limits [of Gatlinburg], and [because] we had wind speeds started in excess of 87 miles an hour, we had trees going down everywhere. Power lines \u2014 all those power lines [falling] were just like lighting a match, because of the extreme drought conditions. \"So we went from [no fires in the city] to over 20 plus structure fires in a matter of minutes. And that grew and that grew and that grew.\" Much Of The Southeast U.S. Is Grappling With Drought Despite the rain this week \u2014 including a destructive band of tornadoes that hit multiple southern states including Tennessee \u2014 much of the southeastern U.S., including eastern Tennessee, are still suffering from extreme drought conditions, according to the latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor . So far, the Gatlinburg fire, known as Chimney Tops 2, charred almost 18,000 acres of public and private land, according to the InciWeb national fire management system . The latest report said more than 450 people were fighting the wildfire, including a fire management team from Colorado. It said the blaze \"was human-caused and is currently under investigation.\" An update posted Friday morning eschewed the usually staid language of official updates. \"While many areas within the basic fire perimeter did not burn, the city of Gatlinburg lies literally in the center of the fire perimeter,\" the update read . \"This fire hit the communities of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and surrounding areas adjacent to Great Smoky Mountains National Park hard as they were preparing for both Christmas and the final few weeks of a bustling tourist season. The feelings of loss are palpable.\" ",

Slager testified that he feared for his life when he said Scott wrestled with him, got control of his Taser and pointed it at him. The 12-member jury - comprised of 11 white members and one African-American - heard testimony from 55 witnesses during the month-long trial. The jury is allowed to consider a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, which is shooting someone in the heat of passion. A murder conviction, which requires the jury to agree that Slager had malice toward Scott, carries a sentence of 30 years to life. Voluntary manslaughter carries a sentence of from two to 30 years.\u00a0 On Thursday, the jurors asked for transcripts of key testimony and wondered about the difference between passion and fear. Judge Clifton Newman told the jurors Friday morning that the court could not instruct them on those definitions, saying it\u2019s a distinction jurors must decide.\u00a0 At around 1:00 p.m. Friday, the jury asked for the testimony of Feidin Santana, the man who recorded the cellphone video of the shooting. Newman said he would be willing to re-play Santana\u2019s statement to the court. Shortly after requesting the testimony, the jury again sent a note to the judge, this time saying, \u201cIt is clear that jurors will not be able to reach a consensus.\u201d Newman ordered them to continue deliberating. \u201cIt isn\u2019t always easy for even two people to agree, so when 12 people must agree, it becomes even more difficult,\u201d Newman said. However, the judge said the jurors have a \u201cduty\u201d to make every effort to reach a unanimous verdict. While he said each juror has a right to their own opinion and cautioned against giving up firmly held beliefs, he said \u201cyou should carefully consider and respect the opinions of everyone and re-evaluate your positions for reasonableness, correctness and impartiality.\u201d\u00a0 Newman ordered jurors to \u201clay aside all outside matters and re-examine the questions before you based on the law and the evidence in this case.\u201d The jury was handed the case Wednesday evening. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

But his company would be vulnerable to competitors in Mexico, Colombia and Australia. They would be free to draw on China\u2019s supply chain and sell their wares into the American market unhindered. \u201cOur chair would be priced out of the market,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cIf it impacts our sales, that puts jobs at risk.\u201d Trade experts dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs as campaign bluster that will soon give way to pragmatic concerns about growth and employment. Between 1998 and 2006, the imported share of components folded into American manufacturing rose to 34 percent from 24 percent, according to one widely cited study . International law also limits the scope of what the Trump administration can do. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization , the United States cannot willy-nilly apply tariffs. It must develop cases industry by industry, proving that China is damaging American rivals through unfair practices. Talk of across-the-board tariffs is \u201cpure theater,\u201d said Marc L. Busch, an expert on international trade policy at Georgetown University in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do. It violates the rule of law.\u201d Photo Chuck Reid of First Class Seating estimated that a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods would raise the costs of making a recliner at his factory in Michigan by 20 percent Credit Sean Proctor for The New York Times But Mr. Trump has suggested taking the extraordinary step of abandoning the W.T.O. to gain authority to dictate terms. His successful strong-arming of Carrier, the air-conditioner company, which agreed to keep 1,000 jobs at a plant in Indiana rather than move them to Mexico, attests to his priorities in delivering on his trade promises. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The people advising Mr. Trump on trade have records of advocating a pugnacious response to what they portray as Chinese predations. There is Dan DiMicco , the former chief executive of the American steel giant Nucor, who has long advocated punitive tariffs on Chinese goods . There is Peter Navarro, a senior policy adviser and co-author of a book titled \u201c Death b y China: Confronting t he Dragon \u2014 A Global Call to Action .\u201d In an email on Friday, Mr. Navarro, the Trump transition team\u2019s economic adviser, said that imposing steep tariffs on China was an essential step to begin to address the American trade deficit with China, which reached $365 billion last year. He blamed Chinese trade practices for \u201cdestroying entire industries, hollowing out entire communities\u201d and \u201cputting millions out of work.\u201d But Mr. Navarro also cast the threat of tariffs as an opening gambit in a refashioning of trade positions.

The goal is to force manufacturers to come back to the United States as a condition of selling into the American market. A full-on trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies would cost American jobs in the immediate term, Mr. Autry said, but eventually millions of new ones would be created as the United States again hummed with factory work.

It\u2019s going to take a few years, but it\u2019s going to be a much better America.\u201d Even if factory work does return to the United States, though, that is unlikely to translate into many paychecks. As automation spreads, robots are primed to secure most of the jobs. Photo Woodworth Wooden Industries opened a factory in Vietnam after the United States imposed tariffs on Chinese-made furniture. Credit Christian Berg for The New York Times At Mr. Reid\u2019s factory, talk of a bountiful future through trade barriers resonates as dangerous nonsense. Mr. Reid has a business to run in the here and now. His customers are waiting for product. He must be able to tap the supply chain. \u201cYou can\u2019t just turn your ship around and bring that stuff back,\u201d he said. In threatening tariffs, Mr. Trump is wielding a blunt instrument whose impacts are increasingly easy to evade by sophisticated businesses with operations across multiple borders. The geography of global trade is perpetually being redrawn. In China, factory owners, casting a wary eye on Mr. Trump, are accelerating their exploration of alternative locales with lower-wage workers across Southeast Asia and even as far away as Africa. In Vietnam, entrepreneurs are preparing for a potential surge of incoming investment from China should Mr. Trump take action. In Europe, factories that sell manufacturing equipment to China are watching to see if Mr. Trump will unleash trade hostilities that will damage global growth.

His company, the Guangzhou Shuqee Digital Tech Company, makes movie chairs, exporting about 20 percent of its wares to the United States. It is an exemplar both of China\u2019s manufacturing prowess and of the conditions that make it a competitive threat. Mr. Jiang pays his factory workers $290 a month. They work six days a week. Lax environmental rules allow him to dispose of pollutants cheaply. The total cost of making one of his best-selling products, a cloth-lined movie chair, runs $72. He sells it for $116 to wholesalers who export to the United States. Photo A worker carved details into wood at a Woodworth Wooden Industries plant in Vietnam. Credit Christian Berg for The New York Times Back in September, Mr. Jiang gathered with other Chinese movie chair manufacturers to discuss the alarming statements coming from Mr. Trump. The consensus view was not to worry. \u201cOnce he takes up the post, he will certainly return things to the normal state,\u201d Mr. Jiang said. Still, he has a backup plan. Even before President Trump entered the lexicon, Mr. Jiang was exploring a transfer of some of his work to lower-cost places like Vietnam. His company would not be the first to make the journey. A dozen years ago, the United States Commerce Department accused China of dumping wooden bedroom furniture at below cost. It imposed protective tariffs. Advertisement For Lawrence M. D. Yen, who had a furniture factory in southern China, that was the impetus to move to Vietnam. Labor costs were cheaper. Photo SSM makes the most sophisticated components for its textile machines at a plant in Switzerland and in Italy, while lower-grade machines are made in China. Credit Pascal Mora for The New York Times Today, Mr. Yen\u2019s company, Woodworth Wooden Industries, operates a factory in Cu Chi, on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, a district best known for the elaborate tunnels used by Vietcong guerrillas in their battles against American forces. This former hive of combat is now the workplace for 5,000 people making sofa beds, recliner chairs and bedroom furniture. Three-fourths of the products are destined for the United States, including Las Vegas casino resorts like Mandalay Bay and the MGM Grand. Woodworth\u2019s plant churns out more than 10,000 three-seater sofas each month. This year, the company opened a second Vietnam factory. Arithmetic gives Mr. Yen confidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s talk will be muted by the realities of the marketplace. Brands that deliver factory-made goods to American retailers have leaned heavily on Asian suppliers to secure low prices. In pledging to bring manufacturing back, Mr. Trump is effectively pitting the interests of a relatively small group of people \u2014 those who work in factories \u2014 against hundreds of millions of consumers. Photo Assembled textile machines at SSM in Horgen, Switzerland. Credit Pascal Mora for The New York Times \u201cThe retail industry now employs an awful lot more people than apparel industries ever did,\u201d said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at Georgetown. Seven years ago, the Obama administration accused China of unfairly subsidizing tires. It imposed tariffs reaching 35 percent. A subsequent analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics , a nonpartisan think tank, calculated the effect: Some 1,200 American tire-making jobs were preserved, but American consumers paid $1.1 billion extra for tires. That prompted households to cut spending at retailers, resulting in more than 2,500 net jobs lost. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The TAL Group claims to make one of every six dress shirts sold in the United States. It produces finished goods for Brooks Brothers, Banana Republic and J. Crew, operating 11 factories worldwide. If Mr. Trump places tariffs on China, the company will accelerate its shift to Vietnam, said TAL\u2019s chief executive, Roger Lee. If that trade is disrupted, the work would flow to other low-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. Mr. Lee can envision no situation in which the physically taxing, monotonous work of making garments will go to the United States. \u201cWhere are you going to find the work force in the U.S. that is willing to work at factories?\u201d Mr. Lee said. Photo EBW Electronics in Holland, Mich., produces circuit boards for automobile lighting systems. Credit Sean Proctor for The New York Times Supplying the Suppliers Horgen, a Swiss village on the shores of Lake Zurich, seems far removed from the gritty industrial zones of Asia. With its gingerbread homes and mountain views, it looks more like a resort. But Horgen is home to SSM, a company that has become an important supplier to Asia. Its machines turn polyester and other synthetic fibers into custom-designed threads. If the rise of textiles in Asia has been a gold rush, this Swiss company has been among those cashing in by making the picks and shovels. Workers at the factory earn roughly 6,000 Swiss francs ($5,940) a month \u2014 some 10 times what SSM pays its workers at its Chinese factory. It makes its most sophisticated components in Switzerland and at another plant in Italy. It uses China for lower-grade machines. The company sells virtually all of its products abroad, chiefly in Asia. It buys metal parts from the Czech Republic and Poland, electronic components from Malaysia, and electric motors from an American company that makes them at a factory in India. Another American company supplies software. \u201cThere is not a single machine that we have that we are able to build with materials from one country,\u201d said Mr. Maurer, the SSM chairman. Photo A piece of equipment being inspected at EBW Electronics. The Michigan company uses integrated circuits made in China and the Philippines. Credit Sean Proctor for The New York Times If the United States were to impose trade barriers on China, that might slow Chinese demand for Swiss-made textile machinery. That would potentially reduce Swiss purchases of American goods and services. Advertisement But Mr. Maurer struggles to see how this would create any jobs in the United States. The American textile industry is small and increasingly dominated by robots. The rest of the world holds billions of hands willing to work cheaply. \u201cSomeone else will pick up the business,\u201d Mr. Maurer said. \u201cThese markets are very fast.\u201d But the textile and apparel trades are relatively simple businesses. If the cost of making trousers becomes less appealing in China, a room full of sewing machines in Cambodia can quickly be filled with low-wage seamstresses. Industries involving precision machinery are not so easily reassembled somewhere else. An abrupt change to the economics would devastate factories that could not quickly line up alternative suppliers. American automakers are especially dependent on the global supply chain. Between 2000 and 2011, the percentage of imported components that went into exported American-made vehicles grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At EBW Electronics in Holland, Mich., workers in lab coats tend boxy soldering machines as they make circuitry for LED lights that go into cars. It buys tiny parts and slots them into circuit boards, which are sold to major automakers. Some 80 percent of the components are imported from China. Even that number fails to capture the degree to which the company \u2014 and its 240 workers \u2014 depend on unfettered trade. Pat LeBlanc, the chairman, pointed to a nib of metal on a circuit board. The silicon was extracted at a plant in Minnesota, then processed into a thin wafer at another factory in Massachusetts. The wafer was shipped to China for testing, cut into pieces at another Chinese factory, and then delivered to the Philippines for a chemical process. Then it went back to China to be put onto a reel that can be inserted into soldering machines here in Michigan. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt literally is a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. LeBlanc said. Mr. Reid, the owner of the theater seating company, could not imagine having to buy everything from American suppliers. Buying upholstery domestically would raise his fabric costs as much as 40 percent. \u201cAll the componentry, all the cords, it all comes from China,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you could ever get all of that made in the United States. Some of these industries have just been abandoned.\u201d He wandered into the paint shop, where a worker was spraying chair backs. He picked up a can of paint and read the label: \u201cMade in the U.S.A., with Global Materials.\u201d Peter S.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic But the retired general, a lifelong bachelor who has said that he does not own a television and has often been referred to as a \u201cwarrior monk,\u201d is also famous for his extensive collection of books on military history. \u201cThanks to my reading, I have never been caught flat-footed by any situation,\u201d he wrote a colleague in 2003. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead.\u201d General Mattis would be the first former ranking general to assume the post of defense secretary since George Marshall in 1950-51. He would need a special congressional waiver to serve as defense secretary. He retired from the Marines in 2013, and federal law stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years. But he has strong support in Congress, especially from John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In a recent phone call, Mr. McCain urged Mr. Trump to consider appointing General Mattis or Gen. Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chief of staff, as defense secretary. But General Keane has decided against returning to government in a full-time capacity. Mr. McCain said in a statement that General Mattis was \u201cwithout a doubt one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops.\u201d He added, \u201cAmerica will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again.\u201d But Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and also a member of the Armed Services Committee, said that while she respected General Mattis\u2019s service, she would oppose a waiver to allow him to serve. \u201cCivilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy,\u201d she said in a statement. Photo General Mattis appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee as a general in 2010. Credit Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times The selection of General Mattis is a boost for the Marines. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be working with Joseph F. Dunford, the four-star Marine general who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It would also create an unusual situation at the Pentagon because the new defense secretary would be General Dunford\u2019s former commanding officer. During the Iraq invasion, General Dunford was a colonel who led a Marine regiment that reported to General Mattis. Advertisement Continue reading the main story General Mattis led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. He later commanded American troops during the hard-fought battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in 2004. As head of the Central Command, General Mattis was heavily involved in plans to counter Iran\u2019s military and protect the sea lanes in the Persian Gulf. William Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard and a staunch opponent of Mr. Trump\u2019s, sought to persuade General Mattis to mount an independent presidential bid. And he was courted by both the campaigns of Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton to speak at the political conventions, but declined. In a new book, \u201cWarriors and Citizens,\u201d which General Mattis edited with Kori Schake, a Hoover Institution fellow who served in the George W. Bush administration, he complained that politicians had relied too much on military commanders to make the case for their policies. \u201cPresident Bush left to Gen. David Petraeus the task of overcoming congressional opposition to the 2006 Iraq surge,\u201d General Mattis and Ms. Schake wrote. \u201cPresident Obama has been mostly silent on the war in Afghanistan since 2009; the case for continuing American troop presence has been made entirely by the military.\u201d Military commanders, they wrote, have a responsibility to carry out and advocate the president\u2019s policies. \u201cThis does not remove elected officials from the responsibility to win political arguments instead of depending on the military to do so,\u201d they added.

The suspension announced Friday likely ends McClain's career in Dallas and is his third since the end of the 2014 season, his only full season with the Cowboys after reviving his career following a year away from the game. He had a one-year contract this season. NFL MVP tracker: Raiders' Derek Carr leads for first time The 27-year-old McClain was suspended the first 10 games this season for a substance-abuse violation after sitting the first four games in 2015. McClain was eligible to return for the Thanksgiving game this season, but owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he wouldn't report to the team. Jones declined to be more specific.

By Anne Gearan December 2 at 5:38 PM Follow @agearan President-elect Donald Trump spoke Friday with Taiwan\u2019s president, a major departure from decades of U.S. policy in Asia and a breach of diplomatic protocol with ramifications for the incoming president\u2019s relations with China. The call is the first known contact between a U.S. president or president-elect with a Taiwanese leader since before the United States broke diplomatic relations with the island in 1979. China considers Taiwan a province, and news of the official outreach by Trump is likely to infuriate the regional military and economic power. The exchange is one of a string of unorthodox conversations with foreign leaders that Trump has held since his election. It comes at a particularly tense time between China and Taiwan, which earlier this year elected a president, Tsai Ing-wen, who has refused to accept the notion of a unified China under Beijing\u2019s rule. Her election angered Beijing to the point of cutting off all official communication with the island government. It is not clear whether Trump intends a more formal shift in U.S. relations with Taiwan or China. On the call, Trump and Tsai congratulated each other on winning their elections, a statement from Trump\u2019s transition office said. President-elect Donald Trump talks with workers during a visit to the Carrier factory on Dec. 1 in Indianapolis. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \u201cDuring the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties . . . between Taiwan and the United States,\u201d a statement from Trump\u2019s transition office said. [ Taiwan\u2019s leader wants to revitalize the economy. Don\u2019t expect China\u2019s help. ] A spokeswoman for Taiwan in the United States said she could not immediately confirm that the conversation took place and said she was seeking guidance from Taiwan. The conversation was first reported by the Financial Times and the Taipei Times. The president-elect tweeted out Friday evening, \u201cThe president of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.\u201d The United States has pursued what it calls a \u201cOne China\u201d policy since 1972, when then-President Richard M. Nixon visited China. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter recognized Beijing as the only government of both mainland China and Taiwan, and Washington closed its embassy in Taiwan a year later. China guards the structures of its formal relationship with the United States very carefully \u2014 especially the founding document that established the One China policy. U.S. officials typically tiptoe around any mention of Taiwan or the Chinese goal of full reunification. \u201cThis phone call calls into question whether or not Trump adheres to the basic foundation of the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d said Evan Medeiros, a former top China adviser to President Obama who is now an adviser at the \u00adEurasia Group. \u201cThis action guarantees that U.S.-China relations under Trump will get off to a very rocky start.\u201d Trump\u2019s growing team of national-security and foreign-policy advisers includes several people who have been strong supporters of Taiwan in Republican administrations. They include Stephen Yates, deputy national security adviser under Vice President Richard B. Cheney, who was reported to be visiting Taiwan when the call occurred. Trump apparently considered hotel investments in Taiwan earlier this year. The mayor of Taoyuan said last month that a representative from the Trump Organization had visited and was interested in constructing hotels in the northwestern Taiwanese city, according to China Times. Trump has said he will separate himself from his businesses before he is inaugurated. In recent years, in the face of Taiwan\u2019s waning economic power and decreasing international recognition as a separate entity from mainland China, Taiwanese diplomatic representatives in Washington have been trying to raise their stature. They have courted government officials and journalists with Taiwanese film screenings, expensive soirees and other cultural events around town. For years it has looked like a losing battle. But the Trump call could constitute a major and unexpected coup for Taiwan\u2019s new administration by showing the island\u2019s continued relevance. Michael J. Green, a senior Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, said the call will not necessarily lead to lasting bad blood with China. \u201cTaiwan is a very good friend, and it is good to let the world know that,\u201d Green said, adding, \u201cThe president-elect\u2019s phone call may have been unconventional, but it\u2019s not completely unprecedented.\u201d President Ronald Reagan infuriated the Chinese by inviting a Taiwanese delegation to his inaugural ball, and his administration included a long-running tussle over whether to \u201cre-prioritize \u00adTaiwan,\u201d Green said. Bush caused a kerfuffle when he suggested the United States might defend Taiwan militarily, but that, too, blew over, Green noted. Earlier Friday, Trump reportedly extended an invitation for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to visit the United States next year. That what would mark a startling turnabout for a foreign leader who famously called Obama a \u201cson of a whore.\u201d Trump transition officials confirmed the Duterte call but did not say whether Trump had issued the invitation. Perhaps not surprisingly, the mold-breaking Republican has infused the usually banal routine of congratulatory calls from foreign leaders with drama. Most of the more than 50 calls held by Trump or Vice President-elect Mike Pence came without the knowledge or guidance of the State Department. That means no talking points about issues of particular importance \u2014 or land mines to avoid. \u201cWe stand by to assist and facilitate and support communication that the transition team is having with foreign leaders,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said Friday. The calls have appeared haphazard and out of order \u2014 Russia and Ireland before close ally Britain, for example \u2014 and the conversations have a casual tone that the British press sniffed is \u00ad\u201cun-presidential.\u201d Some calls, as described by Trump aides or the other country, have elicited a raised eyebrow or two. There was Trump\u2019s offhand suggestion to British Prime Minister Theresa May to \u201clet me know\u201d if she happened to be coming to town. A state visit typically takes months of planning and involves a numbing amount of diplomatic protocol of the who-sits-where variety. And there was the conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which the two agreed, according to the Kremlin, \u201con the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations\u201d and committed to \u201cnormalize\u201d the relationship. The United States and Russia maintain cordial official ties \u2014 Secretary of State John F. Kerry met with the Russian foreign minister Friday \u2014 but both countries have accused the other of meddling. Some Trump communications have yielded questions and worries among U.S. diplomats and foreign powers, most notably a call Wednesday between Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. A vivid account of the conversation released by Pakistan has Trump heaping praise on Sharif as \u201ca terrific guy\u201d and Pakistanis as \u201cone of the most intelligent people.\u201d The United States \u2014 and Trump when he was a candidate \u2014 have said Pakistan has not done enough to combat terrorism, and the majority-Muslim country would be heavily affected by Trump\u2019s proposed restrictions on Muslim immigration. Nonetheless, when Sharif invited him to visit Pakistan, Trump replied that he would \u201clove to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people,\u201d the Pakistani statement said. A Trump statement came with no such color, but transition officials did not disavow the quotes. Most disturbing to diplomats in the United States and elsewhere was the Pakistani account of Trump pledging partnership that could suggest favoritism in Pakistan\u2019s eternal \u2014 and nuclear armed \u2014 rivalry with India. Trump told Sharif he would \u201cplay any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country\u2019s problems,\u201d according to the Pakistani account. China, North Korea and Russia, as well as India, are likely to take note of that, diplomats said. \u201cThe one thing you learn is, you\u2019ve got to be very careful what you say because everything you say or tweet matters,\u201d said William Danvers, a former senior official in the Obama State Department, Pentagon and CIA. \u201cYou have a grace period when you\u2019re president and you deserve it, but it\u2019s mostly a domestic grace period,\u201d Danvers said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if Kim Jong Un is going to say, \u2018Oh you just became president, so I\u2019ll hold off on my missile test.\u2019 It kind of makes us look like we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d As for Duterte, who had announced a public \u201cbreakup\u201d with the United States before the election, the State Department\u2019s Kirby said little. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any specific support that was provided for that call,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to make sure they know we are a ready resource. How they make decisions and how they conduct dialogue and communication with foreign leaders is really for them to decide.\u201d Trump communications director Jason Miller told reporters Friday that the calls are not off the cuff. Trump and Pence \u201care briefed in advance of their calls, obviously working with the teams that we have put together,\u201d Miller said before news of the Duterte call had broken. White House press secretary Josh Earnest urged Trump to take advantage of diplomatic know-how as he contacts foreign leaders ahead of his inauguration in January. \u201cI\u2019m confident that as President-elect Trump takes office, those same State Department employees will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the United States overseas,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll take it.\u201d Trump\u2019s outreach to Duterte could echo Obama\u2019s election pledge to try to talk to adversaries, although Trump has denounced Obama\u2019s main claims to success in that effort \u2014 openings to Iran and Cuba. Obama presided over a reversal of the U.S. relationship with the Philippines and its new leader. Duterte\u2019s denunciations of the longtime alliance between the two nations and personal insults of Obama prompted the president to cancel a planned meeting with Duterte in China in September. Duterte has said U.S. troops should leave his country within two years. He also cozied up to Chinese President Xi Jinping, alarming the Obama administration, which had backed the Philippines\u2019 challenge at an international tribunal last summer over China\u2019s maritime claims in waters used by Filipino fishermen. The tribunal ruled against China, but Duterte has signaled a willingness to negotiate a deal with Beijing that could allow the Chinese navy to remain in control of the region.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story In his court filing, Mr. Schuette, a Republican who is widely mentioned as a possible candidate for governor in 2018, said, \u201cThis court cannot allow a dilatory and frivolous request for a recount by an aggrieved party to silence all Michigan votes for president.\u2019\u2019 Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Wisconsin, a lawsuit against the state Elections Commission was filed Thursday in Federal District Court by the Great America PAC, the Stop Hillary PAC and Ronald R. Johnson, a Wisconsin resident. The lawsuit said that the recount could \u201cunjustifiably cast doubt\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in that state. The plaintiffs argued that the recount, which began across the state\u2019s 72 counties on Thursday morning, should be halted immediately, in part because there was a substantial chance that it cannot be accurately completed by mid-December. Results must be certified before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19. In 2011, a statewide recount took close to a month. A federal judge said Friday that he would not halt the recount, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Lawyers for Mr. Trump and his allies are also seeking to halt legal proceedings by Ms. Stein to contest the statewide election results in Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has participated only lightly, paying for lawyers to be present at recount sites. Still, the recounts have generated excitement among some of her supporters, hoping that the small margins in the three traditionally Democratic states might swing to Mrs. Clinton in a recount. But Edward B. Foley, director of the Election Law Project at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law, said there was no comparison between this recount and the 2000 Florida impasse between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Then, he said, \u201cit was quite plausible that Gore might prevail in a recount.\u2019\u2019 The chance that these state recounts could reverse the outcome of the 2016 election, Mr. Foley said, was \u201cessentially zero or infinitesimal.\u201d Ms. Stein, in a statement, said the challenges to the recounts were an effort to put \u201cparty politics above country.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s desperate attempts to silence voter demands for recounts raise a simple question: Why is Donald Trump afraid of these recounts?\u201d she said. Advertisement In Michigan, where the recount is still pending, the Board of State Canvassers on Friday heard a formal objection from Mr. Trump and his campaign to plans to recount that state\u2019s 4.8 million votes. Breaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world. Lawyers for Mr. Trump told the state board, which is made up of two Democrats and two Republicans, that it should not allow a new count, describing it as needless, too expensive and not required under Michigan law. Ms. Stein, who got 51,463 votes in Michigan, hardly met the state\u2019s standard as an \u201caggrieved\u201d party, the lawyers argued. But a lawyer for Ms. Stein, Mark Brewer, said Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was making a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to avoid a recount. Of the three states where recounts are contemplated, Michigan had the smallest gap between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton: 10,704 votes. \u201cI would remind everybody that the original source of the allegation that this election was rigged was Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Brewer, a former chairman of Michigan\u2019s Democratic Party, told the board. In the end, after several tense exchanges over the practical value and cost of a recount, the Board of State Canvassers split, 2 to 2, along party lines, meaning the recount objection failed. Barring a court order in Mr. Schuette\u2019s case or some other legal development, Michigan, which has not seen a statewide recount in half a century, could begin a hand recount by Wednesday. In Pennsylvania, Ms. Stein\u2019s recount campaign is operating along dual tracks, with its challenge of the statewide results proceeding along with petitions to recount specific voting districts. Lawrence J. Tabas, general counsel of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, said in an interview on Friday that Ms. Stein\u2019s lawyers had fallen short of demonstrating that there was fraud or illegal action in the Nov. 8 election. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThey know they have no claim,\u201d he said. \u201cThis action by Jill Stein and her supporters \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even call it a Hail Mary pass, because that would be insulting to the Hail Mary pass,\u201d said Mr. Tabas, who along with other lawyers, submitted a lengthy court brief on Thursday. On Friday afternoon in Philadelphia, teams of observers were monitoring election workers as they rechecked counts on electronic voting machines used in 75 precincts, a small fraction of the nearly 1,700 across the city. The groups \u2014 which included representatives from each of the parties and candidates \u2014 quietly made their way from machine to machine in a dimly lit warehouse in North Philadelphia where the city stores its 4,000 machines. Philadelphia has been using the machines, which record votes on cartridges, since the early 2000s. The review mirrored the steps that automatically take places after elections, said Al Schmidt, a city commissioner and a Republican, who said he did not expect the vote tally to change. \u201cWe are doing the exact same thing that we did during the computation process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just doing it once again.\u201d Rich Garella, 50, a Stein supporter who petitioned for the recount and was serving as a monitor on Friday, said the effort felt worthwhile, but he had hoped that election officials would approve a more rigorous forensic audit of the machines, which Ms. Stein had requested. \u201cWe as voters don\u2019t really understand how these machines work,\u201d Mr. Garella said. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how they are programmed.\u201d He predicted that one result of the recount effort, at least in Philadelphia, could be to shed light on the unseen part of the voting system. \u201cWhat we may end up showing from this is just that we are not being allowed to see how our election works and to see that our votes are being counted properly,\u201d he said. Monica Davey reported from Lansing, Julie Bosman from Chicago and Steve Eder from Philadelphia.

    "text": "Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Members of the tony East Bank Club might want to give the gym's locker room a wide berth if they spot former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and Mayor Rahm Emanuel getting changed at the same time. The frosty relationship between the two macho men might cause anyone caught in the middle to catch a chill. \"I haven't spoken to the mayor since last December 1st,\" said a visibly upset McCarthy in an interview with WGN-TV Ch. 9 on Friday. \"I ran into him a couple of times at the East Bank Club.\" Asked if he wanted to speak to Emanuel, he said, \"Um, that's a great question. I'm not sure how to answer it. You stumped me because I'm really angry about what happened, and I'm very angry about what is happening. \"I would give him an earful if we were to have a conversation.\" McCarthy \u2014 who was fired a year ago in the wake of the release of the video of police Officer Jason Van Dyke killing Laquan McDonald, 17 \u2014 has always worn his heart on his sleeve and in recent weeks has made a number of public statements defending his record and criticizing the police policies he says are contributing to Chicago's soaring homicide rate. More than 700 killings were recorded in the first 11 months of 2016. Yet even by his standards, Friday's appearance was emotionally raw, with McCarthy baring his bruised ego for all to see. ",

The U.S. action designates 16 entities and seven individuals for their suspected ties to the North Korean government or its nuclear and weapons proliferation effort.

By Jerry Markon and Sean Sullivan December 2 at 6:19 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @WaPoSean Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are moving aggressively to challenge Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein\u2019s push for a recount in three states, filing legal challenges and criticizing the effort as quixotic and ill-conceived. Trump and his backers have filed challenges the past two days in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which were critical to Trump\u2019s surprise victory last month because they punctured the so-called blue wall of states expected to carry Democrat Hillary Clinton to victory. Trump narrowly won the trio of states. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) on Friday tweeted that Stein\u2019s request was \u201can expensive & a risky threat\u201d as he announced he had filed an emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court to stop it. Stein, who has raised millions of dollars from supporters to help pay for the costly recount efforts, blasted back at what she called \u201ca politically motivated attempt by Bill Schuette to side with Donald Trump in opposition to a fair and accountable voting system.\u2019\u2019 She added in a statement that \u201ccitizens in Michigan and across the country of every political party have expressed their concerns around our voting system and deserve to have their votes counted.\u2019\u2019 Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Stein has raised concerns about possible hacking or other irregularities in the vote in the three states, but has presented no evidence of malfeasance. Election officials in all three states have expressed confidence in their results, and voting rights experts have said the effort is highly unlikely to overturn the results that are sending Trump to the White House. Clinton\u2019s campaign has joined Stein\u2019s recount effort, though her team has said it does not expect the outcome of the election to change. The Clinton campaign had no immediate comment on Friday. In Wisconsin, where Trump defeated Clinton by one percentage point, a recount is underway. But Great America PAC and Stop Hillary PAC, both pro-Trump groups, said Friday they had filed a legal challenge a day earlier in federal court in conjunction with a Wisconsin voter to stop the new count. Stein\u2019s team said Friday that it will fight the challenge. \u201cCitizens in Wisconsin and across the country have made it clear that they want a recount and deserve to see this process through to ensure integrity in the vote,\u201d Stein attorney Matthew D. Brinckerhoff said in a statement. In Pennsylvania, where Stein has acknowledged the path to forcing a recount is more difficult but has initiated an effort to do so nonetheless, attorneys for Trump filed an objection to Stein\u2019s request in state court on Thursday. \u201cEven with the heroic efforts by state and local elections officials involved in the recounts, as well as expeditious review by this Court, Stein\u2019s proposed process will last weeks, perhaps even months. Either way, her request puts Pennsylvania at grave risk of having not certified its Presidential electors by December 13, the deadline for doing so,\u201d says the filing. On Friday, the focus of the escalating battle was in Michigan, as the Board of State Canvassers deadlocked 2-2 over an objection that attorneys for Trump filed Thursday against Stein\u2019s recount request. Trump argued that Stein cannot, as the state\u2019s fourth-place finisher, claim that she is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the way the vote unfolded and that there isn\u2019t enough time to complete the recount by the Dec. 13 deadline to certify Michigan\u2019s election results. Retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Because of the deadlock, the office of Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson (R) said in a tweet that \u201cthe recount is expected to commence early next week, barring court action.\u201d Schuette then filed his emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court. It was not immediately clear whether a hearing has been set. The earliest a Michigan recount could start would be next week. Meanwhile, the president-elect resumed his schedule of transition meetings at Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower on Friday, bringing in two well-known experts on foreign policy. The president-elect met with Robert M. Gates, who served as defense secretary under President Obama and had derided Trump as \u201cunqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief\u201d in a September op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. Gates spoke briefly with reporters afterward, saying he had praised Trump\u2019s selection of retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis as defense secretary, which Trump announced Thursday. \u201cI told him I thought his selection of General Mattis to be secretary of defense was terrific, very supportive,\u201d said Gates, who declined to answer further questions. Trump also sat down with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations. He was at one point considered a candidate for secretary of state, but Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, told Fox News on Friday that Trump has narrowed that search to four finalists. According to Conway, they are 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, retired Army Gen. David Petraeus and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Opponents of Romney have waged an extraordinary public campaign against his nomination for the post and urged Trump to reward Giuliani for his loyalty during the campaign. It is unclear when Trump will make a final decision. Alice Crites contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Stolen Chevrolet Corvette returned to owner after 40 years Published               December 02, 2016 \u00a0(Red Bluff CHP) Score one for those know-it-alls who hang around classic car shows. An eagle-eyed enthusiast with a keen attention to detail at a recent gathering in the northern California town of Red Bluff was checking out a 1964 Corvette when he noticed the vehicle identification number (VIN) was for a different model, evidence that the car was once stolen. The Red Bluff Daily News reports that the owner then brought it to the local California Highway Patrol to get it checked out. Sure enough, the VIN was originally from an Impala, while another number on the car matched that of a 1964 Corvette that was reported stolen down in Anaheim...in 1976. Revealed\u00a0 : Stash of WW II-era cars hidden in French quarry. The unidentified man had no idea, having been given the car as a gift by his wife in 1987, who bought it from a dealer that's now out of business. Some more sleuthing by the police, which included digging into the Anaheim PD's ancient microfiche records, turned up the name of the original owner, Modesto Flemming, who had since relocated to Arizona. Related Image Expand / Contract (Red Bluff CHP) The police were able to reach out to Flemming, and she made the trip to Red Bluff to retrieve the car she never thought she'd see again, which happens to be in great condition and is probably worth $50,000 or more today. A police spokesperson told FoxNews.com that the recent owner and his wife aren\u2019t in any trouble, as they were unwitting parties after the crime, but didn't know what if any compensation they received from insurance, or otherwise, for having to return the car.

    "text": "Email Anyone coming down with an illness has probably heard the advice from a doctor, parent or well-meaning friend: \u201cDrink plenty of fluids.\u201d But medical researchers say there is actually little evidence behind that well-intentioned recommendation, and no clear definition of how much is enough. While staying hydrated is necessary for good health, some doctors are warning that overdoing it can be harmful , too. In an article published this week in BMJ Case Reports, doctors describe the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed hyponatraemia \u2014 a condition that occurs when the level of sodium in the body is abnormally low \u2014 from drinking too much\u00a0 water \u00a0to help with a recurring urinary tract infection. \u201cThe effect of illness on the body as well as people\u2019s natural tendency to stop eating and drinking when unwell combine to make the risk of dehydration during illness a real concern,\u201d Dr. Maryann Noronha, an emergency-medicine physician at the Royal London Hospital in England and the senior author of the report, told CBS News. \u201cTo counteract this, medical advice has always been to ensure to stay well hydrated during periods of illness,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the whole this advice is followed within reasonable limits. However, if taken to extremes, as in this case, the consequences can be as serious as that of not consuming enough water.\u201d In the case Noronha and her colleague Dr. Laura Christine Lee describe in the paper, the woman they treated had heard that she should drink a glass of water every half an hour. This was \u201ccertainly an over-zealous interpretation of the advice,\u201d Noronha said. The patient was admitted to the ER and prescribed antibiotics and painkillers for her infection. Soon she became progressively shaky, muddled, vomited several times, and had significant speech difficulties. Tests showed her sodium levels were dangerously low \u2014 a result of\u00a0 water intoxication . The condition is a medical emergency, the doctors said, and requires prompt recognition and action. To treat the patient, the doctors restricted her fluid intake to just one liter over the next 24 hours. By the following day, her blood tests had returned to normal and she was discharged. The authors note this case mirrors a previous incident, in which another female patient developed hyponatraemia and later died from drinking excessive amounts of water during an episode of the stomach illness gastroenteritis. Other instances have occurred with fatal results in people following endurance exercise or after use of the drug MDMA, also known as Molly . Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told CBS News that case described in the BMJ report highlights the importance of not consuming excessive amounts of water to try to clear a routine urinary tract infection. \u201cThe old adage to \u2018drink plenty of water\u2019 should be approached with caution if you are not vomiting, or experiencing diarrhea, or excessive sweating,\u201d he advises. \u201cYour thirst is often the best guide to gauge when you need to drink more water if you have no history of kidney disease. There is a complex feedback loop from the kidney that stimulates special receptors in the brain that trigger the sensation of thirst.\u201d Both Glatter and Noronha say that the vast majority of people do not need to worry too much about hyponatraemia. \u201cIn general, the average person should not be overly concerned about over-hydrating ,\u201d Glatter said. \u201cDrinking one to two or even up to three to four extra glasses of water per day for the average person with normal kidney function and in otherwise good health is not a concern.\u201d And Noronha warns that the dangers of dehydration during an illness are much more common and better documented. \u00a0 \u201cHowever, if you are the type of person who excessively increases the amount of water you consume during a period of illness (i.e. doubles or triples), it maybe it is something to bear in mind if you start developing unusual symptoms such as a headache or slurring of your words.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs was photographed in a 1981 training manual for caterers. Keystone/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs was photographed in a 1981 training manual for caterers. Keystone/Getty Images Actor Andrew Sachs, best known for his beloved portrayal of a hapless Spanish waiter named Manuel on the British sitcom Fawlty Towers, has died at 86. Sachs had \"suffered from dementia for four years,\" according to the BBC . He died on Nov. 23 and was buried Thursday. In the 1970s BBC comedy, Sachs plays a constantly confused waiter who speaks only a little English, working at a small hotel. Manuel provided a vehicle for the show to lampoon the classism of British society. \"\u00bfQu\u00e9?\" he says over and over again, frequently directed at the hotel's bullying owner Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese. YouTube Most of the gags involving Sachs are centered on Manuel and Basil misunderstanding each other \u2014 in fact, that was the reason Cleese suggested the character of Manuel in the first place, as he told the BBC : \"The idea that one could constantly have misunderstandings between Basil and Manuel was a terribly simple one, but it worked well and of course it could happen at any point.\" Here's a scene that epitomizes that tension and gave Sachs one of his most often-repeated lines, \"I know nothing\": YouTube Basil rushes in to ask Manuel not to divulge that he has put money on a horse race. As usual, it's a delight to watch the two agonizingly speak past each other. \"I could spend the rest of my life having this conversation,\" Basil says, holding his head in his hands. \"Please try to understand before one of us dies.\" Article continues after sponsorship Despite Manuel's unfailing earnestness and constant good-natured attempts to please, Basil frequently hits the skilled physical comedian, usually with a spoon. \"I never got upset when he hit me,\" Sachs said in 2014, according to the BBC. \"He's my friend, I must say yes, yes [it hurt], several times, more than once.\" Among Manuel's other counterpoints was the relatively posh, obtuse Major Gowen, with whom he appears in this clip: YouTube In addition to his role on Fawlty Towers, the BBC reports that Sachs \"had dozens of other acting roles, both serious and comic \u2014 including stints in TV's two biggest soaps\" \u2014 Coronation Street and EastEnders. Sachs was \"born in Berlin before his family fled the Nazis to settle in Britain,\" according to The Guardian . Cleese spoke about his easy rapport with Sachs, as the Guardian reported: \"It's like playing tennis with someone who is exactly as good as you are. And you play with them every week, sometimes he wins and sometimes you win, but somehow there is a rapport. It comes from the very deepest part of ourselves. We never had to work at it, it all happened so easily.\" In a series of tweets after his death, Cleese hailed Sachs as a \"very sweet gentle and kind man and a truly great farceur.\" \"I could not have found a better Manuel,\" he said. \"Inspired.\" ",

(Photo: RNS/Courtesy of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City) VATICAN CITY - An American missionary priest killed in Guatemala in 1981 has moved a step closer to being named a Catholic saint after Pope Francis declared him the first-ever American martyr. The Rev. Stanley Rother, a priest from the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, served for nearly 15 years in Guatemala before being shot dead during the country\u2019s bloody civil war that divided the country from 1960 to 1996. Rother was 46 when he was gunned down in the rectory of his church in Santiago Atitlan, a village 50 miles west of Guatemala City, on the same day government troops killed 13 townspeople and wounded 24 others there, according to Catholic News Service. Rother, one of many priests killed during the Guatemalan civil war, is the first American to be recognized by the Vatican as a martyr. The Congregation for the Causes of the Saints declared that\u00a0he had fulfilled the requirement of having \u201cdied in hatred of the faith.\u201d The pope signed the declaration on Thursday, and it\u00a0was announced by the Vatican on Friday. \u201cStanley Rother has been approved for beatification,\u201d said Archbishop Paul S. Coakley, head of Oklahoma City\u2019s archdiocese, in a reaction he shared on Facebook and Instagram. \u201cHe is the first US born martyr and priest to receive this official recognition from the Vatican! And of course the first from Oklahoma!\u201d Unlike other candidates for sainthood, martyrs do not need to have performed a Vatican-approved miracle to be beatified on the path to sainthood. Rother\u2019s beatification is expected in the coming weeks. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, has previously indicated that priests killed during Latin America\u2019s right-wing dictatorships died for their faith. Last year, the pope formally declared Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero a martyr and beatified him.\u00a0Romero, a prominent human rights activist, was assassinated while celebrating Mass in 1980, allegedly by a right-wing death squad. But his martyrdom was delayed for decades by conservative prelates who feared it would be interpreted as an endorsement of left-wing politics. 14002 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 34 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gWhDxp ",

Pool/AP hide caption toggle caption Smiley N. Pool/AP Former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel sits while his defense attorneys confer with the prosecution during his initial hearing in May 2016 in Dallas. Smiley N. Pool/AP The Dallas County District Attorney has reached an agreement to drop assault charges against former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, as long he as meets conditions such as attending an anger management course and a substance abuse program. Former Cleveland Browns QB Johnny Manziel Is Indicted On Assault Charge Manziel's former girlfriend Colleen Crowley \"has accused him of hitting her and rupturing her eardrum in January,\" as The Two-Way reported . He was indicted in April on a misdemeanor charge of assault that caused bodily injury, a charge that \"carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine,\" according to The Associated Press. These are the conditions that Manziel must meet for a year in order for the case to be dismissed, according to the text of the agreement: \"Complete Anger Management Course Approved By Court\" \"Attend Domestic Violence Victim Impact Panel\" \"Participate fully in the NFL's Policy and Program for Substance of Abuse, or if program is unavailable, Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation at Court Approved Location.\" \"No Contact with Complainant Colleen Crowley.\" \"The Defendant's progress will be monitored by the Dallas County District Attorney's Office and upon successful completion of these new conditions within the next 12 months, and if the defendant commits no new offenses, the District Attorney agrees to dismiss the case,\" the agreement states. \"The judge overseeing the case will still have to approve the dismissal agreement,\" according to The Dallas Morning News . Prosecutors tell The Associated Press that the process is not over. \"A conditional dismissal is only the beginning of the process of educating an individual on how to make better choices when facing conflict,\" prosecutors tell the wire service. \"It is an important first step for a defendant. Success or failure will depend upon one's commitment to the treatment programs included.\" Article continues after sponsorship Manziel is under investigation for a separate incident, the Morning News reports: \"Earlier this week, a bar employee in Austin sued Manziel in a Travis County court and accused him of punching him and breaking his nose. Austin police are investigating the alleged incident. It is unclear if Manziel will face any charges in that case.\" Manziel won the Heisman Trophy while playing at Texas A&M; University, and as we reported, \"his career has been marked by reports of substance abuse and time at a rehab facility.\" ",

Exterior of the Markham Courthouse on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Steve Mills and Todd Lighty Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune The Cook County judge who let a law clerk wear her robe and hear traffic cases this summer was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and can no longer perform her duties, the state board that oversees judges said in documents Friday. The Judicial Inquiry Board charged that Judge Valarie Turner has memory loss and is \"mentally unable\" to do her job. The board made no accusation, however, that Turner had engaged in misconduct when she allowed law clerk Rhonda Crawford to put on her judicial robe and hear three traffic cases during the afternoon court call at the county courthouse in south suburban Markham. At the time, Crawford had won the Democratic primary for the 1st Judicial Subcircuit and was unopposed in the general election. In a filing with the Illinois Courts Commission, the board said the commission should simply take \"appropriate\" action against Turner. The board's filing brings closer a resolution to an unusual and embarrassing episode for one of the nation's largest court systems. The filing would also seem to signal the end of Turner's legal career, which began with law school at the University of Chicago and a stint at the prestigious Kirkland & Ellis law firm and the U.S. attorney's office, although she spent the past few years hearing traffic and other municipal cases, sometimes in a basement courtroom. She was first elected to the bench in 2002, and was assigned to Markham in February 2005. Turner's lawyer, Gino DiVito, said there was no reason for the matter to be referred to the Courts Commission. Instead, he said, it should have been handled by the judge's retirement system. ",

    "text": "By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist December 2 at 12:57 PM Follow @sulliview You may think you are prepared for a post-truth world, in which political appeals to emotion count for more than statements of verifiable fact. But now it\u2019s time to cross another bridge \u2014 into a world without facts. Or, more precisely, where facts do not matter a whit. On live radio Wednesday morning, Scottie Nell Hughes sounded breezy as she drove a stake into the heart of knowable reality: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore, of facts,\u201d she declared on \u201c The Diane Rehm Show \u201d on Wednesday. Hughes, a frequent surrogate for President-elect Donald Trump and a paid commentator for CNN during the campaign, kept on defending that assertion at length, though not with much clarity of expression. Rehm had pressed her about Trump\u2019s recent evidence-free assertion on Twitter that he, not Hillary Clinton, would have won the popular vote if millions of immigrants had not voted illegally. A shouting match erupted at an election postmortem session, where aides from both campaigns met to discuss the election. The Washington Post's Margaret Sullivan and Callum Borchers talk about what happened. (The Washington Post) (The apparent gen\u00adesis of Trump\u2019s claim was Infowars.com, a site that traffics in conspiracy theories and is run by Alex Jones, who says the 2012 massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., was a government-sponsored hoax .) What matters now, Hughes argued, is not whether his fraud claim is true. No, what matters is who believes it. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tweet, amongst a certain crowd, a large \u2014 a large part of the population, are truth. When he says that millions of people illegally voted, he has some \u2014 in his \u2014 amongst him and his supporters, and people believe they have facts to back that up. Those that do not like Mr. Trump, they say that those are lies, and there\u2019s no facts to back it up.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s a fact: I heard it live, as did Rehm, Politico\u2019s Glenn Thrush, and the Atlantic\u2019s James Fallows, who wrote about it , citing a recording of the show . One might be tempted, though, to dismiss it as one woman\u2019s opinion: Maybe Hughes, the political editor of RightAlerts.com , was just having a hallucinatory day. But at a high-profile event the next evening, two other Trump surrogates echoed this sentiment. Ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, speaking during an election post-mortem at Harvard University\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, blamed journalists for \u2014 yes \u2014 believing what his candidate said. \u201cYou guys took everything that Donald Trump said so literally,\u201d said Lewandowski, who was another ill-advised CNN hire. \u201cThe American people didn\u2019t. They understood it. They understood that sometimes \u2014 when you have a conversation with people, whether it\u2019s around the dinner table or at a bar \u2014 you\u2019re going to say things, and sometimes you don\u2019t have all the facts to back it up.\u201d Hear from The Washington Post reporters who criscrossed the country to cover Donald J. Trump, Hillary Clinton and the voters who will choose one of them to be president. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Yes, Corey, but Trump is not a guy at a bar; he was the Republican nominee for president of the United States and will pretty soon be the leader of the free world, such as it is. So, how should Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign have been covered? Should reporters have added something like this in the second paragraph of every news story? \u201cTrump probably didn\u2019t mean that he would appoint a special prosecutor/build a wall/deport millions of immigrants. His statements are not meant to be taken literally but rather as broad suggestions of a feeling he was experiencing on a particular day.\u201d There was more from the Harvard event. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway about the same election-fraud claim discussed above \u2014 specifically, whether disseminating misinformation was \u201cpresidential\u201d \u2014 it was clear that she and Hughes got the same memo. \u201cHe\u2019s the president-elect, so that\u2019s presidential behavior,\u201d Conway said, using mind-bending pseudo-logic, reminiscent of the Nixonian \u201cWhen the president does it, that means that it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d These surrogates\u2019 disdain for facts should not be surprising, given Trump\u2019s own casual relationship with verifiable truth. It\u2019s time to dust off your old copy of \u201c 1984 \u201d by George Orwell and recall this passage: \u201cThe Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink.\u201d And be vigilant.

Got it By Lawrence H. Summers December 2 at 12:31 PM President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 1 celebrated a deal that will keep jobs at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis and announced that he chose retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis for secretary of defense. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) There are many aspects of the economic policy of the new administration that I find misguided. But I am most troubled by what President-elect Donald Trump did with Carrier to hold on to an extra 700 jobs in Indiana . Ronald Reagan\u2019s response to the air traffic controllers\u2019 strike was a small act that had profound consequences.\u00a0I fear in a similar way that the negotiation with Carrier is a small thing that is actually a very big thing \u2014 a change very much for the worse with regards to the operating assumptions of American capitalism. Market economies can operate anywhere along a continuum between two poles. I have always thought of American capitalism as dominantly rule and law based. Courts enforce contracts and property rights in ways that are largely independent of just who it is who is before them. Taxes are calculable on the basis of an arithmetic algorithm. Companies and governments buy from the cheapest bidder. Regulation follows previously promulgated rules. In the economic arena, the state\u2019s monopoly on the use of force is used to enforce contract and property rights and to enforce previously promulgated laws. Even though we know of instances of corruption, abuse of power, favoritism and selective enforcement, we take this rules-based system for granted.\u00a0 But looking around the world today or back through American history, this model is hardly a norm. Many market economies operate what might be called ad hoc or deals-based capitalism : Economic actors assume that they have to protect their property and do their own contract enforcement. Tax collectors use discretion in assessing taxes. Companies and governments buy from their friends rather than seek low-cost bids.\u00a0 Regulators abuse their power. The state\u2019s monopoly on the use of force is used to enrich and satisfy the desires of those who control the apparatus of the state. This is the world of New York City under Tammany Hall, of Suharto\u2019s Indonesia, and of Putin\u2019s Russia. Reliance on rules and law has enormous advantages. It greatly increases predictability and reduces uncertainty. It reduces expenditures on both guarding property and seeking to appropriate property. It promotes freedom because most of the people most of the time do not take political positions with a view to gaining commercial advantage. The advantages of the rule of law are so great that I would claim that there is no country more than 2/3 as rich as the United States that does not have a strong tradition of the rule of law-based capitalism.\u00a0 And I know of no country where the people are free where the rule of law does not largely govern market interactions. President-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect Pence have convinced air conditioning manufacturer Carrier to keep 1,000 jobs at its Indianapolis, Ind. plant instead of moving them to Mexico. This is a major publicity score for Trump who had previously criticized Carrier and other manufacturers on the campaign trail. But putting pressure on individual businesses doesn't make for a winning long term strategy. Wonkblog's Jim Tankersley explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) What about Carrier? The president-elect of the United States decided in a purely ad hoc basis that he wanted Carrier to remain in Indiana. He deployed some combination of carrots and sticks at his disposal to lever Carrier into doing what he wanted. Implicitly or explicitly, there must have been sticks, as press accounts suggest that the tax benefits provided offset only a small part of the savings forgone by staying in Indiana. It is not hard to see from the point of view of United Technologies, the parent of Carrier, that for a company with more than $50 billion in revenue it's surely worth $60 million to not be on the wrong side of a possibly vindictive president of the United States. It seems to me what we have just witnessed is an act of ad hoc deal capitalism and, worse yet, its celebration as a model. As with the air traffic controllers, only a negligible sliver of the economy is involved, but there is huge symbolic value. A principle is being established: It is good for the president to try to figure out what people want and lean on companies to give it to them. Predictability and procedure are less important than getting the right result at the right time. Like Hong Kong, as mainland China increasingly imposes its will, we may have taken a first step toward a kind of reverse transition from rule of law capitalism to ad hoc deal-based capitalism. The commentary on the president-elect\u2019s actions has emphasized its novelty, has emphasized the difficulties of scaling, and in the case of Sen.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders \u00a0(I-Vt.), has argued that the actions taken were insufficiently forceful because some workers will still be relocated to Mexico. All of this misses the point. Presidents have enormous latent power, and it is the custom of restraint in its use that is one of the important differences between us and banana republics. If its ad hoc use is licensed, the possibilities are endless. Most companies will prefer the good to the bad will of the U.S. president and his leadership team. Should that reality be levered to get them to locate where the president wants, to make contributions to the president\u2019s reelection campaign, to hire people the president wants to see hired, to do the kinds of research the president wants carried out, or to lend money to those that the president wants to see assisted? 1 of 24 ",

Dagmar Sporck/EyeEm, via Getty Images Set your meetings, phone calls and emails aside, at least for the next several minutes. That\u2019s because today you\u2019re a bee. It's time to leave your hive, or your underground burrow, and forage for pollen. Pollen is the stuff that flowers use to reproduce. But it\u2019s also essential grub for you, other bees in your hive and your larvae. Once you\u2019ve gathered pollen to take home, you or another bee will mix it with water and flower nectar that other bees have gathered and stored in the hive. But how do you decide which flowers to approach? What draws you in? In a review published last week in the journal Functional Ecology , researchers asked: What is a flower like from a bee\u2019s perspective, and what does the pollinator experience as it gathers pollen? And that's why we're talking to you in the second person: to help you understand how bees like you, while hunting for pollen, use all of your senses \u2014 taste, touch, smell and more \u2014 to decide what to pick up and bring home. Maybe you're ready to go find some pollen. But do you even know where to look? Good question. How about an answer? No, I\u2019m an expert bee. Get me out of this hive.

(Photo: John Salangsang, AP) Amy Schumer\u2019s next movie role may see the actress, producer and comedian getting dolled up. The Trainwreck star is in talks to play a real-life Barbie in Sony\u2019s live-action Barbie movie, USA TODAY has confirmed with Schumer\u2019s rep, Carrie Byalick. Slated for a summer 2018 release, the long-simmering film is the first-ever live-action adaptation for the Mattel toy and will follow the lead character as she is exiled from Barbieland for failing to meet the benchmark of perfection and forced to travel to the real world, where she learns to embrace herself. Per The Hollywood Reporter , the film is meant to serve as a \"contemporary spin on beauty, feminism, and identity,\" issues Mattel has at times struggled to navigate. Writer/producer Hilary Winston conceived the original idea and screenplay though THR reports that Schumer and her sister, Inside Amy Schumer producer Kim Caramele, are expected to rewrite the script. Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, and Amy Pascal\u00a0will produce the project, which is still seeking a director. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Prosecutors try to use evidence 'from beyond grave' at Hobos' trial Paris Poe Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago drug dealer Keith Daniels was secretly cooperating against leaders of the notoriously violent Hobos street gang in 2013 when he gave chilling testimony to a federal grand jury describing one gang member's disdain for police informants. Paris \"Poleroski\" Poe was with Daniels when they had learned about the killing of another person who had been cooperating with law enforcement, according to a recent court filing by prosecutors. Poe's reaction was \"laughter,\" Daniels told the grand jury. Just weeks after that testimony, Poe came calling for Daniels, federal prosecutors alleged. Dressed in all black, Poe waited behind some bushes and fatally shot Daniels in front of his fiancee and their two young children as they pulled into the parking lot of their south suburban apartment complex, prosecutors charge. Now, prosecutors want to use Daniels' grand jury statement about Poe in the ongoing racketeering conspiracy trial against Poe and five other alleged Hobos leaders. The charges alleged the gang was responsible for nine killings \u2014 including Daniels in April 2013 and another police informant a decade ago \u2014 as well as a slew of shootings, robberies and home invasions. Daniels' \"beyond-the-grave\" testimony promises to be among the most compelling evidence brought by prosecutors, who are nearing the end of their case after calling dozens of witnesses over nearly three months. Attorneys for the defendants have asked U.S. District Judge John Tharp to block prosecutors from using certain statements Daniels made to the grand jury, including the comment about Poe laughing. But prosecutors said in a filing Friday that the testimony backs up allegations that Poe and his cohorts used violence and intimidation to silence witnesses against them. \"The fact that Poe was pleased and amused by the murder of an informant is clearly relevant to his opinion about persons who cooperate with law enforcement,\" the filing stated. (Jason Meisner) Tharp will rule on the request before Daniels' testimony is presented to the jury next week. Prosecutors have alleged the Hobos' ruthless use of violence fueled the gang's rise to the top of the city's drug trade. Among the casualties were two gang rivals who had just attended a funeral, a semipro basketball player who was slain in a case of mistaken identity, an innocent bystander from Los Angeles visiting relatives and an elderly woman killed in a car crash as police chased a fleeing Hobo member, according to the charges. In addition to Daniels' killing, witnesses have testified that Poe and another alleged Hobo lieutenant, Arnold Council, fatally shot Wilbert \"Big Shorty\" Moore outside a South Side barbershop in 2006 because they believed Moore had provided information to police that led to a raid on a Hobos residence. Daniels, who was Council's brother, was slain just four days after Hobos kingpin Gregory \"Bowlegs\" Chester was arrested on drug conspiracy charges at a high-rollers table at an Indiana casino, court records show. (Jason Meisner) Those charges were brought after Daniels had worn a wire to record Chester during drug buys and testified at length to the grand jury about the gang's hierarchy and illegal activities, records show. According to the prosecution filing Friday, Daniels testified that Chester had taken him under his \"wing\" and shown him the ropes of the drug trade. Daniels said the gang had access to an arsenal of weapons and that he once traveled to Indiana with Chester to buy a \"high-powered gun\" for Poe. Chester was the clear leader of the gang and other members were willing to kill anyone to protect him, Daniels told the grand jury, according to the prosecution filing. Daniels also alleged to the grand jury that Chester had asked him to kill someone on behalf of the gang in the summer of 2011. Earlier this week, Daniels' fiancee, Shanies Peatry, testified she and Daniels had just pulled up to the Dolton apartment where the family had been relocated by authorities for their protection when a gunman opened fire on their car. Peatry told jurors she ducked in the back seat to push their kids to the floor. Daniels, meanwhile, bailed out of the passenger side and fell to the ground. The gunman took his time, walking over to Daniels and standing over him, pumping round after round into his chest as their children screamed, said Peatry, who added she recognized him as Poe from his eyes and by the dreadlocks sticking out from under his mask. Statements given by the children to law enforcement could come into the trial as early as next week. In an interview with authorities in 2013, the younger child said the \"boogeyman\" who shot Daniels was wearing a Spider-Man mask \u2014 an account that seems to conflict at least in part with Peatry's testimony. The other child also claimed the gunman had a mask covering his entire face. As part of the defense case, Poe's attorney, Patrick Blegen, is expected to present depositions of the children that he video-recorded this week. ",

    "text": "By Drew Harwell December 2 at 9:11 PM Follow @drewharwell President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s ultra-wealthy Cabinet nominees will be able to avoid paying millions of dollars in taxes in the coming weeks when they sell some of their holdings to avoid conflicts of interest in their new positions. The tax advantage will allow Trump officials, forced by ethics laws to sell certain assets, to defer the weighty tax bills they would otherwise owe on the profits from selling stock and other holdings. The benefit is one of the more subtle ways that the millionaires and billionaires of Trump\u2019s White House, which already will be the wealthiest administration in modern American history, could benefit financially from their transition into the nation\u2019s halls of power. The legal tax maneuver, offered for years to executive-branch appointees and employees, was designed to help ease the sting of being forced to suddenly sell investments. But the federal program, encoded in Section 2634 of federal ethics laws and known as a \u201ccertificate of divestiture,\u201d has never been tested quite like this. Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks have amassed assets worth billions of dollars from lifetimes in banking and investing, much of which they will be able to sell tax-free. President-elect Donald Trump named Wilbur Ross as his nominee for commerce secretary. Here's what you need to know about the billionaire investor. (Monica Akhtar,Osman Malik,Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) [ Trump is assembling the richest administration in modern American history ] Trump has not committed to divesting his fortune. But if he does, federal ethics advisers said, the self-described billionaire could potentially reap the same tax advantage. The Office of Government Ethics, which leads the program, said this week that it was researching whether the \u00adpresident-elect could qualify. The benefit was used to great effect when Henry Paulson, then chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as treasury secretary. Paulson sold roughly half a billion dollars\u2019 worth of Goldman stock and used the benefit to avoid what the Economist estimated was $200\u00a0million in taxes. Some ethics advisers defend the tax benefits as a smart way to ensure new government officials can avoid heavy tax burdens on holdings they are required by law to sell. \u201cYou don\u2019t want someone, just because they\u2019ve done well in the private sector, to pay a penalty for taking a job in the government,\u201d said Ken Gross, a former Federal Election Commission enforcement official who has advised candidates of both parties. \u201cSome of these people are some of the most valuable public servants, who know how things are run on the private side,\u201d Gross added. \u201cTo jeopardize their ability to serve by hitting them with a massive tax bill is not good public policy.\u201d Trump transition and company representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Trump, in a New York Times interview last month, suggested divesting would be \u201ca very hard thing to do\u201d because of his broad holdings in real estate and other assets. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet When new officials join the government, federal ethics advisers review their holdings and instruct them on how they should cut through entanglements, such as recusing themselves or divesting stocks and other assets in cases where potential conflicts could arise. People who sell company stock typically have to pay taxes on any profits, known as capital gains. But the divestiture benefit allows officials to skip that tax bill, as long as they reinvest the gains into assets where conflicts are less likely, such as U.S. Treasury bonds or diversified mutual funds. It is unclear what Trump officials will be asked to divest, but the tax savings on sold-off holdings could be monumental. Trump\u2019s choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is the heiress of a family Amway fortune worth roughly $5\u00a0billion. [ Trump picks Betsy DeVos, school voucher advocate, as education secretary ] The heads of financial divisions, including the Treasury Department, are traditionally advised to sell stocks, bonds and other instruments affected by the country\u2019s fiscal policy. Upon his appointment in 2009 as treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner pledged to divest his holdings in several investment funds and college-savings accounts, an ethics letter from the time shows. That could mean big tax benefits for Trump\u2019s financial leaders. Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s pick for treasury secretary, is a hedge-fund founder and former Goldman Sachs banker who has made tens of millions of dollars on Wall Street. His portfolio includes about $100\u00a0million of stock in banking giant CIT Group, according to compensation research firm Equilar. [ Video: Who is Steven Mnuchin? ] Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, has a net worth nearly 10\u00a0times that of all of Bush\u2019s first Cabinet in 2001 combined, including tens of millions of dollars in stock and more than $1\u00a0billion in cash and assets, Bloomberg data show. Capital gains are taxed at a far lower rate, 15\u00a0percent, than the typical income most people make from working. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, was criticized because his tax rate was so low, largely as a result of the capital gains from his investing career. The tax benefit has been offered since 1989 by the Office of Government Ethics. The federal agency said in a tweet Wednesday that the only way for Trump to fully avoid conflicts of interest is to divest his assets. Some ethics experts say the benefit has practical value for officials at all levels. Many agencies have their own conflict-of-interest rules prohibiting the ownership of certain stocks. For example, Environmental Protection Agency employees in the office that regulates toxic chemicals are banned from owning pesticide-company stock. \u201cIf you suddenly had to absorb the capital-gains taxes of substantial parts of your holdings, it would be a real body blow to some people financially,\u201d said Robert Lenhard, a campaign-finance lawyer and former FEC chairman. \u201cI just think of it as an act of fairness for those people entering public service.\u201d The stock-selling demand could come at a fruitful time. The Dow Jones industrial average has in recent weeks hit all-time highs. But it could prove most lucrative for top officials with broad holdings in stocks and bonds. Trump\u2019s tax plan has called for \u201cacross the board\u201d cuts, which means administration officials could preside over the same \u00adcapital-gains tax cuts from which they could later benefit. Whether Trump could qualify for the tax advantage if he divests his assets remains unclear. The law says it must be ruled \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for an official to divest shares, but the president is exempt from conflict-of- interest laws that bind most other government officials. Trump said in a financial disclosure filing in May that he owned up to $40\u00a0million of stock, including in companies whose value could rise as a result of his policies. Divesting those shares, if he qualified for the benefit, could prove deeply lucrative. Whether Trump pays any federal income taxes is another question entirely. He has refused to release his tax returns and for many years used real estate and other deductions to drop his tax bill to zero. Some who have criticized Trump\u2019s stance on conflicts of interest would be happy if he reaped the tax advantage. At least then, they said, they would know he had agreed to divest the assets that could create conflicts down the road. \u201cI\u2019d be the first to stand up and applaud if the president-elect\u201d divested, said Norm Eisen, a former chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be the first to defend his right to the certificate of divestiture.\u201d business ",

By Jenna Johnson December 2 at 6:01 PM Follow @wpjenna CINCINNATI \u2014 Susan Meyer becomes giddy as she explains just how excited she is for President-elect Donald Trump to take office. Her tone changes at the mention of \u201csecretary of state.\u201d Meyer trusts Trump, but she simply doesn\u2019t understand why he would put Mitt Romney on his shortlist to head the State Department. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like Romney; she voted for him in 2012 and considers him fully capable. But how could Trump forget the things Romney said about him during the primary? Why would he trust someone like that? \u201cHe outwardly spoke against him in a malicious way,\u201d said Meyer, a retired teacher in her 70s who once taught students for whom English was a second language. \u201cIs he loyal? Is he going to be loyal to the president? I would question that.\u201d In the three weeks since Trump won the election, he has dropped or leaned away from a number of key campaign promises, puzzling some of his supporters. Appointing a special prosecutor to investigate former rival Hillary Clinton is no longer a top priority for Trump, who sympathetically said that Clinton already \u201c went through a lot .\u201d He has said he is now open to amending the Affordable Care Act instead of fully repealing it. And several of his Cabinet picks are longtime players on Wall Street or in Washington \u2014 the \u201cswamp,\u201d in Trump\u2019s words, that he has pledged to drain. [ The election is over, but the Trump rallies continue ] President-elect Donald Trump held a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, part of what his team has called the USA Thank You Tour 2016. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Many of Trump\u2019s supporters who showed up to his first post-election rally in this Midwestern city Thursday night said they completely trust their president-elect to make the right decisions for the country, even if they don\u2019t understand his motives. And they were quick to come up with explanations for why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing \u2014 like suddenly being buddies with Romney. Meyer said that Trump is \u201ctrying to bring the party together\u201d after the bruising election. The guy sitting behind her at the rally agreed. \u201cIf he could be someone who could really benefit his Cabinet and be better for America, I say go for it,\u201d said Joe Terry, a 54-year-old father of five who works in maintenance. Terry said he has no problem with Trump\u2019s pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin , a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood producer who co-founded a bank during the financial crisis that foreclosed on thousands of homeowners. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, he\u2019s going to look out for corporations, to make things work for them, to bring jobs back home,\u201d Terry said. \u201cAnd as things trickle down \u2014 as they\u2019re going to because it\u2019s America \u2014 the little guy will get something, too.\u201d For secretary of state, Meyer said she hopes Trump will ultimately pick someone like former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who stood by Trump when few would, or retired Gen. David H. Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material and is still on probation. \u201cHe paid the price,\u201d said Meyer, who lives across the river from Cincinnati in northern Kentucky. \u201cWhen you pay the price, then you\u2019re forgiven. And he did a fraction of what Hillary did.\u201d Meyer\u2019s favorite debate moment was when Trump told Clinton that if he were president, she would be in jail. \u201cHe looked right at her, and I loved it,\u201d she said. But Meyer and her husband said that while they want to see Clinton held responsible for using a private email server while secretary of state, neither of them expected Trump to take on the issue himself. \u201cI know what he was saying, but the president can\u2019t prosecute anybody,\u201d said Robert \u201cBob\u201d Meyer. \u201cI think that\u2019s out of Trump\u2019s hands. He should leave it to the Justice Department, and she should be prosecuted.\u201d His wife agreed, adding: \u201cIt was a debate. . . . He doesn\u2019t always think. He\u2019s not a politician. He just says it.\u201d Still, at Trump\u2019s first mention of Clinton during the rally that night, the whole arena began chanting: \u201cLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d Trump stood by and smiled. Sitting one section over from the Meyers was another couple in their 70s who were convinced that Trump\u2019s change in tone on Clinton is just a strategic act. [ The trick to persuading Trump? Flattery, proximity and snappy pitches. ] \u201cI don\u2019t think it would stick anyhow because Obama could pardon her,\u201d explained Bob Knopp, 74, a retired civil engineer. \u201cI think it\u2019s really too early for him to really say a whole lot about anything. When Obama gets out of there, it might change again.\u201d For Susan Meyer, it feels like the country has already changed since the election \u2014 and she gave Trump credit for keeping open a Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis rather than letting it move all of its jobs to Mexico. \u201cIt made my heart feel good to know that these families will have a Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt so good when he did that. And that\u2019s what I love about him. He didn\u2019t wait until his inauguration. He did it. He\u2019s a worker. He started calling up, and he\u2019s Donald Trump, and they listened to him.\u201d The deal didn\u2019t happen quite that way. Carrier agreed not to shift about 800 manufacturing and management positions south of the border, in exchange for a $7\u00a0million incentive package from the state. About 1,300 jobs will still move to Mexico, however.

But one of Maddon's biggest duties was taken away as the result of details of the new collective bargaining agreement released Friday. The commissioner\u2019s office now will select seven players from the NL (including four pitchers) and five players from the American League (four pitchers) for the All-Star Game . Those selections will replace the selections given to the managers of the AL and NL in the previous agreement. In past seasons, many managers used that privilege to select their own players.

A dog was also rescued from the rubble. USA TODAY NETWORK Crews work the scene Dec. 2, 2016, after a building collapse at 10th Street and Phillips Avenue in downtown Sioux Falls, S.D. (Photo: Joe Ahlquist, (Sioux Falls, S.D.) Argus Leader) SIOUX FALLS, S.D.\u00a0\u2014 A construction worker was killed and a woman rescued after a building collapsed during remodeling in downtown Sioux Falls on Friday morning, officials said. The construction worker's body was recovered shortly before 6 p.m. after a special K-9 dog was brought in to help find the man, Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras said. The woman who was rescued, identified as Emily Fodness, 22, who lived in the building,\u00a0had been speaking on the phone with her mother as crews worked to clear debris. \u201cShe\u2019s alive and well, does have some injuries to her legs,\u201d said the city's emergency manager, Regan Smith. \"We don\u2019t know the extent of that at this time.\" The woman\u2019s family later released a statement saying she was in good condition. The construction worker was making pounding noises after the collapse to try to communicate with emergency crews, Sideras said, but\u00a0rescuers became concerned when the\u00a0worker's pounding stopped. The collapse was reported at around 10:30 a.m. CT Friday. The first to be removed from the rubble was a dog, found at about 1 p.m. and apparently unharmed.

Woman rescued after 6 days in collapsed building in Kenya The building has been vacant since a bar called the Copper Lounge closed in September. It was being remodeled to house a drugstore that was to open in the spring. The owner of the building, Norman Drake, was in Minneapolis on business when he got a call that the building he purchased earlier this year had collapsed. He said he didn\u2019t have any details on work was taking place there but was cutting his trip short because of the emergency. Tim Kant, who owned the building for 10 years before its sale, said construction crews had been\u00a0trying to remove a wall between the Copper Lounge and the former\u00a0Skelly's bar. 2 suspects die in building collapse after police chase \"All I know is they were taking down the old brick wall and replacing it with a 2-by-6 wood wall,\" said Kant, who still owns\u00a0a smoke shop attached to the building. The manager at his business was not trapped. Brady Lynch, who works in a fifth-floor office nearby, said he saw a cloud of dust from his window. \"We could see that half of a building was gone,\" Lynch said. Mike Klatt was working in Coffea espresso bar when the building collapsed. He saw a few bricks fall first, then the building buckled, followed with a cloud of dust. \"It came down fairly quickly,\" Klatt said.

By Steven Pearlstein December 2 at 2:46 PM Follow @StevePearlstein President-elect Donald Trump speaking at Carrier in Indianapolis. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Determined not to let any Trump\u00a0action go unchallenged, the media has been full of comments from economists (including Larry Summers and Justin Wolfers ) that Donald Trump\u2019s intervention to save jobs at Carrier\u2019s Indiana facility is just a showman\u2019s one-off \u2014 that it can\u2019t be easily replicated and will be ultimately ineffective in changing the job prospects in a country that creates and destroys a couple of million jobs every month. This is simply not the way things are done in a country that values free markets and the rule of law. Methinks they are missing the story. One of the blind spots economists have is around norms of behavior \u2014 the unwritten rules that are the guiderails for how people act. There was a time in America when there was an unwritten pact in the business world \u2014 workers were loyal to their companies and successful companies returned that loyalty by sharing some of their profits with their workers in the form of higher wages, job security and support for the local community. In some cases, this social contract was reinforced by a union contract, but it was also embraced even in non-union situations because there was a broad public consensus that it was the right thing to do. Business leaders conformed to the norm not only because it helped them attract good workers and customers and have clout in dealing with governmental leaders, but also because it made them feel good about themselves. Then came the 1980s, and all that began to change as American industry began to falter because of foreign competition. Consumers decide they cared more about cheaper products than socially conscious corporate behavior. And just as significantly, investors, after years of lousy returns, decided they cared more about maximizing shareholder value than they did about maximizing the social value of the enterprise they owned. So the social norm changed. A new breed of corporate executive, incented with boatloads of stock options, decided that the right thing to do was to cut costs at any price, including the economic health of their workers or their communities. Indeed, for a while, if a corporate executive didn\u2019t have an aggressive plan to shift production overseas, they were criticized by Wall Street and the business press and threatened with takeovers by what we now call \u201cactivist investors.\u201d Although the public never much liked the idea of closing plants and shipping jobs overseas, it no longer was socially unacceptable. Now comes Donald Trump \u2014 in the public mind, a successful businessman \u2014 who as the new president, suddenly declares that the new norm is no longer acceptable, and he intends to do whatever he can to shame and punish companies that abandon their workers. It\u2019s one thing for a company to sustain a few days of bad headlines in the local newspaper when it decides to close a facility. It\u2019s quite another when the president of the United States is not only willing, but from a political point eager, to make a federal case out of it. Suddenly, maximizing shareholder value no longer provides the political and social inoculation that it used to. Unlike their patron saint, Adam Smith, modern-day economists tend to ignore such shifts in social norms because they can\u2019t quantify them in the same way they can quantify trade flows or technological innovation or changes in educational attainment. And if they can\u2019t quantify something, they can\u2019t include it in their complex mathematical models, or even the simpler mental models in their heads of how the economy operates. They assume that social norms change in response to economic fundamentals rather than the other way around. Donald Trump understands better. He knows that he and his new commerce secretary will have to engage in a few more bouts of well-publicized arm twisting before the message finally sinks in in the C-Suite. He may even have to make an example of a runaway company by sending in the tax auditors or the OSHA inspectors or cancelling a big government contract. It won\u2019t matter that, two years later, these highly publicized retaliations are thrown out by a federal judge somewhere. Most companies won\u2019t want to risk such threats to their \u201cbrands.\u201d They will find a way to conform to the new norm, somewhat comforted by the fact that their American competitors have been forced to do the same. Just as much as changes in the law, this is how norms of business behavior are changed. Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt understood that. So did Ronald Reagan when he fired thousands of striking air traffic controllers and set back the union movement for several decades. Barack Obama, not so much. And here\u2019s a little secret: Privately, many of the executives will welcome the change. They chafe under the tyranny of maximizing shareholder value and they don\u2019t like being widely viewed as ruthless and selfish. In his bombastic, narcissistic, self-serving way, Donald Trump may have actually done them a favor. 1 of 24 ",

Trump regarding the presidential election recount that was requested by Green Party nominee Jill Stein ,\" a statement released by Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson's office read. Recount activity in Michigan was halted on Thursday when the state's election board \"received an objection from representatives of Donald J. Trump,\" the Michigan Secretary of State's office said Thursday. According to the secretary of state's office, the recount will resume next Wednesday. According to MLive , the board voted 2-2 in a meeting this morning and because a majority was not reached, the recount can continue as planned. On Monday, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers certified Trump as the winner of presidential election in Michigan. The Great Lake State was the last to be called in the election. Stein has raised millions to request vote recounts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as well, and she has already paid for a recount in Wisconsin, which is currently underway. ",

The site of the bloodshed, the Inland Regional Center, is across the street from\u00a0San Bernardino Golf Club, where Ferazzi has played, and which she thought could allow her closer access to the crime scene.

It will remain silent until next year when it will again ring 14 times, officials said. \u00a0 Dec. 2, 2016, 3:41 p.m. San Bernardino The Inland Regional Center, where 14 people lost their lives in a terrorist attack one year ago,\u00a0is the focal point of daytime prayers, flowers and tears.

County employees Paula Garcia and Zen Martinsen, said they took time off work to attend the ceremony. They were working at a county office in Yucaipa when the attack took place. Garcia remembered listening to broadcast coverage\u00a0and feeling helpless. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything to help but pray,\u201d she said.

Here's a dispatch from the Associated Press: Since the attack, San Bernardino Police Sgt. Emil Kokesh said he also has been reminded of the need to stay fit. Kokesh arrived at the scene of the onslaught minutes after the shooting and was there for more than a day. He said he was sore for two weeks, which prompted him to take up cycling to get in shape with some fellow officers. That led to the memorial bike ride held Friday. \"On that day, it pushed a lot of us to our limits \u2014\u00a0physically, mentally, and emotionally,\" he said. Now, Kokesh said he often reminds his fellow officers: \"You may work in an office, you may do investigations, and not do much field work anymore, but you are going to be the ones who respond to something like this, so stay fit, stay prepared.\" Dec. 2, 2016, 12:40 p.m. SAN BERNARDINO 'We will never forget this day' Associated Press \u00a0At the moment when shooters unleashed terror on San Bernardino a year ago, county employees remembered their fallen colleagues with a moment of silence late Friday morning. A bell rang 14 times in memory of each person slain in the terror attack that also wounded 22 others at the Inland Regional Center. \"We will never forget that day or the victims of this senseless act of violence. We strive to move forward and search for the good that is in us all,\" said Lavinia Johnson, executive director of the center. Earlier, cyclists conducted a 14-mile bike ride -- one mile for each person who was killed. \u00a0 Dec. 2, 2016, 12:06 p.m. SAN BERNARDINO ",

Bruce Rauner 'bailed on' Chicago children Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media regarding a veto of $215 million in state pension funding for CPS by Gov. Bruce Rauner during a news conference at Curie Metropolitan High School on Dec. 2, 2016, in Archer Heights. (Alyssa Pointer/Chicago Tribune) Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks to the media regarding a veto of $215 million in state pension funding for CPS by Gov. Bruce Rauner during a news conference at Curie Metropolitan High School on Dec. 2, 2016, in Archer Heights. (Alyssa Pointer/Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at Gov. Bruce Rauner on Friday over a veto of $215 million in state pension funding for Chicago Public Schools , suggesting Rauner cared more about corporations like Exelon and ComEd than the city's students. \"The governor said he was going to sign a bill to bail out the utilities and then vetoed a bill that bailed on the children of the city of Chicago. That's the way I look at it,\" said Emanuel of a measure that raises electricity rates for consumers and keeps open two nuclear power plants. \"He made a decision that he was going to support a bill that, in my view, bailed out the utilities and then he said in a pique of anger that he was going to \u2026 bail on the children of the city of Chicago, and I just disagree with that fundamentally and I think it is the wrong choice,\" said the mayor at a Southwest Side high school, fresh off a trip to Mexico City for a climate change conference. Emanuel's comments came just hours after the Republican governor urged the mayor and Democratic legislative leaders to act \"mature.\" Gov. Bruce Rauner Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune Gov. Bruce Rauner was a speaker at the Illinois Manufacturers' Association's annual luncheon at the Marriott on Dec. 2, 2016. Gov. Bruce Rauner was a speaker at the Illinois Manufacturers' Association's annual luncheon at the Marriott on Dec. 2, 2016. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) \"This is rhetoric \u2014 heated rhetoric doesn't help, getting emotional doesn't help, pointing fingers doesn't help. Let's stay mature. Let's stay thoughtful. Let's stay positive. Let's stay persistent,\" Rauner told reporters after addressing the Illinois Manufacturers' Association luncheon at a Loop hotel. Emanuel said his comments were \"no different than the parents whose kids are going to our universities\" and \"no different than the parents who saw their cuts in day-care assistance\" \u2014 shots at two areas where state spending has decreased as Rauner and Democratic state lawmakers have failed to agree on a permanent state budget. The back and forth came as Rauner and legislative leaders are scheduled to meet in Chicago this weekend for budget talks with a six-month spending plan for the state scheduled to expire Jan. 1. Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan , Rauner's chief political nemesis, has agreed to participate in the negotiations but also wants the CPS funding issue to be part of the discussion. But underscoring the lack of trust \u2014 and respect \u2014 between the GOP governor and Democratic leaders, Madigan also wants Rauner to put in writing any spending agreements that are reached, something known as memorandums of understanding. Such memorandums were last used when the now-imprisoned Rod Blagojevich sat in the governor's chair.

(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Rauner defended his veto of the state funding for CPS pensions, saying the money was conditional on Democratic leaders advancing comprehensive changes to state and local public pension systems by year's end. \"We had a clear understanding in June that major statewide pension reform, that both state and local pensions, would be part of the final agreement and that the CPS pension arrangement would be part of that final deal,\" Rauner said. \"And again, I am not walking away. I'm not taking anything off the table. What I'm saying is, 'Let's honor our agreements with each other. Let's stay consistent and let's stay positive and keep negotiating.'\" Democratic Senate President John Cullerton said he had broached such comprehensive pension legislation with Rauner earlier in the week and was surprised by the governor's veto on the last scheduled day of the fall session. Madigan, in suggesting CPS pension money be part of the weekend discussions, said that in light of Cullerton's \"presentation just the other day on pension reform, it seems that this (veto) was simply a punitive move meant to harm the schoolchildren of CPS.\" Emanuel agreed, and added that Rauner's move to instead help Exelon was not \"by any stretch of the imagination \u2026 a turnaround\" \u2014 a dig at the governor's so-called \"turnaround agenda\" of economic reforms that would weaken unions and help businesses. For his part, Rauner said merely signing the CPS pension funding measure without also getting more comprehensive changes in public employee pensions across the state was \"not fair.\" Rauner also defended his intention to sign into law a measure raising rates for ComEd residential and commercial customers in exchange for keeping nuclear plants in Clinton and the Quad Cities operating for 10 years, saying all states are extensively involved in energy policy. \"It's not perfect. It was bipartisan. It has some flaws. But we're preserving jobs,\" he said. \"We're keeping Illinois competitive. We put very tight caps on how much energy costs are allowed to go up.\" But critics of the CPS funding veto contend the lack of the state money, which the city's schools had baked into its budget, also could lead to potential layoffs \u2014 including teachers. Asked how CPS would come up with $215 million it would lose as a result of the veto, Emanuel did not offer an answer. Instead, the mayor took another swing at Rauner, noting that lawmakers previously had to override a veto of a plan to solidify Chicago police and fire pensions. The governor's office has issued a threat to veto pending legislation involving the city's municipal and laborers' government worker pension funds. \"Not everything should be this hard when we're finally doing the right thing and getting our pensions paid for, getting our financial and fiscal house in order,\" Emanuel said. \"The state should be a partner rather than a roadblock.\" bruthhart@chicagotribune.com ",

President-elect Donald Trump broke precedent on the U.S.'s long-standing policy when he spoke to the president of Taiwan. Former U.S. Ambassador ... Mr. Trump is the first president-elect to talk to the Taiwanese president since the U.S. cut formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979. China regards the island as a renegade province, although Taiwan has operated as an independent state since the conclusion of the Chinese civil war.\u00a0 The transition team said that during their conversation, Tsai congratulated Mr. Trump, and the two \u201cnoted the close economic, political and security ties\u201d between Taiwan and the U.S. Mr. Trump also congratulated Tsai on her victory earlier this year. President-elect Donald Trump has made some controversial political choices since the election-and then on Friday night, he broke precedent by spe... The modern Taiwanese state was founded by anti-communist Chinese general Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, and formally styles itself the Republic of China. Since then, war between the two nations has nearly broken out on several occasions, and the current Taiwanese government favors formal independence from China. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with the Taiwanese president reflects a change of policy towards China. Nevertheless, experts say the phone call threatens to inflame U.S. relations with Beijing, which have been particularly rocky in recent years due to expansionist Chinese policies, particularly with regard to the South China Sea.\u00a0 A White House spokesman told CBS News there is \u201cno change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues.\u201d \u201cWe remain firmly committed to our \u2018one China\u2019 policy based on the three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.\u00a0 Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations,\u201d the White House said.\u00a0 After the news broke, Mr. Trump responded with two tweets about the phone call and a comment on U.S. policy on Taiwan.\u00a0 The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 \u201cThe Chinese leadership will see this as a highly provocative action, of historic proportions,\u201d Evan Medeiros, a former Asia director at the White House national security council, told the Financial Times, which first reported the call. \u201cRegardless if it was deliberate or accidental, this phone call will fundamentally change China\u2019s perceptions of Trump\u2019s strategic intentions for the negative.\u201d The U.S. adopted a \u201cone China\u201d policy after Richard Nixon visited the communist-controlled mainland in 1972. China then became a de facto American ally in the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and is now a major trading partner. Trade with China became a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, with Trump repeatedly threatening to install a major tariff on Chinese goods in order to protect American manufacturing. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The airline, whose only operable aircraft was the British Aerospace 146 Avro RJ85 that crashed, was also grounded. Morales said Friday that the elder Vargas served as his pilot in 2006. But he said that he had no knowledge of the airline\u2019s existence and called for a \u201cprofound investigation\u201d to explain whether Vargas\u2019 son, also named Gustavo Vargas, favored the airline, which has transported the national teams of Argentina and Brazil, as well as many other top-flight South American clubs. One of the suspended officials, Marcelo Chavez, the regional director of the agency that controls air traffic in Bolivia, told The Associated Press that an inspector for the agency had pointed out irregularities in the airlines\u2019 flight plan, including the fact that the aircraft\u2019s fuel capacity was barely enough to fly directly to Medellin. Chavez said the airline decided to go ahead with the flight anyway and air traffic controllers had no authority to prevent them. Members of the first-division Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense are seen on the field before the start of play during a match in Brazil, in a photo posted to the team\u2019s Facebook page, Nov. 21, 2016. A chartered plane carrying the team to Medellin, Colombia, crashed before landing on Nov. 28, 2016.\u00a0 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol/Facebook On Thursday, the airlines\u2019 operations director told an Argentine radio network that he also had disapproved of the flight plan.\u00a0 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have flown direct,\u201d the executive, Marco Rocha, said. At LaMia\u2019s office in a small, middle-class home in Santa Cruz, a secretary on Thursday said the airline had yet to be notified of any sanctions. A black rose was left outside the door. A recording of conversations between a pilot of the doomed flight and air traffic controllers, as well as the account of a surviving flight attendant, indicated the plane ran out of fuel before crashing just a few miles from Medellin\u2019s international airport.

A 2015 study by the Center for American Progress found that Walden students received the most federal graduate loans in the 2013-2014 academic year, with over $756 million. The 2012 Senate investigation found that over 70 percent of the school's revenue came from federal financial aid programs. In October, two law firms filed a suit against Walden in the Southern District of Ohio on behalf of lead plaintiff LaTonya Thornhill, a former graduate student at Walden. Attorney Paul Lesko said Thornhill, who was a doctoral student in management from 2011 to 2015, reached out after the NBC News report aired. That same month, the state Office of Higher Education in Minnesota, where Walden is based, launched a review of online Ph.D programs at the school. Lesko is also representing Wright, and filed suit of her behalf Thursday in Minnesota. \"After filing LaTonya Thornhill's suit in Ohio, we were contacted by many other Walden doctoral students who shared their experiences with us. Those conversations were the impetus for this lawsuit,\" said Lesko. \"Do they think we are suckers? I guess I had that sign on my forehead.\" \"At its heart, this lawsuit is not complex; it's really a consumer fraud claim. We allege Walden promised X, knowing it would not deliver X. We think the fact that the Trump University litigation was settled supports our case. Like our case, the Trump University case alleged promises were made, but not delivered.\" Walden University logo. In a statement, a Walden spokesperson said, \"We are sorry to hear about [Wright's] experience as we take the concerns and experiences of our students very seriously. \"While we can't comment on pending legal matters, our top priority at Walden University is the success of our students. As demonstrated by a recent Gallup survey , our graduates fare well comparatively, and are more likely to cite their degree as a factor in both promotion and salary increase than a nationally representative sample of graduate degree-level holders. \"Walden also takes its financial aid responsibilities very seriously and has worked hard over many years to be good stewards of federal financial aid. Our three-year cohort default rate of 6.7 percent is well below the national average.\" Asked why Walden had recruited graduate students in Wright's hometown, the spokesperson said \"Walden is interested in advancing the careers of teachers in higher-need areas. We are filling an important national educational gap to prepare qualified educators who can make a positive impact on student achievement.\" Jennifer Wright next to a black leopard\u2019s cage at Forever Wild Animal Rescue in Phelan, California, where she often takes her students on field trips. Jennifer Wright The Minnesota Office of Higher Education declined to comment on the suits filed against Walden. Last year, Wright sought relief through a different avenue \u2014 she sent a letter to her local congressman, Rep. Paul Cook (R.-California), describing her situation and requesting \"any type of help you and your office can provide.\" Cook's office contacted the Department of Education, and got a response. \"Unfortunately,\" said the agency, \"our staff has reviewed Ms. Wright's concerns and determined that the U.S. Department of Education does not have jurisdiction over matters of this sort.\" After that answer from the federal government, Wright decided to join the lawsuit. \"I can't sit idly by,\" she said. \"This is total injustice.\" Anna R.

WLTX Former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager (Photo: Grace Beahm, AP) A South Carolina judge ordered a jury Friday to continue deliberating the fate of former North Charleston police officer who fatally shot a black man during a scuffle after a traffic stop. Jurors had sent out a note about 1 p.m. saying they couldn't reach a verdict. But Circuit\u00a0Judge Clifton Newton told them to keep trying. Deliberations began Wednesday in the monthlong trial. Michael Slager, 35, who is white, could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted of murder in the death of Walter Scott. A voluntary manslaughter conviction could bring a sentence of up to 30 years. An emotional Slager testified this week that he pulled over Scott, 50, for a broken tail light on April 4, 2015. Scott fled the traffic stop and attempted to wrest away Slager's Taser in an ensuing scuffle, the officer said. He said he shot Scott out of fear for his own life. A bystander's cellphone video, which\u00a0begins seconds before Slager started shooting, shows Scott fleeing from Slager, who fires eight shots. Scott was hit three times in the back, once in the buttocks and once on the ear. In closing arguments Wednesday, defense lawyer Andy Savage said Scott was killed because he attacked a police officer. The case, Savage said, sends an ominous message to officers that they can face murder charges for life-and-death decisions made \"in the heat of battle.\" Officer's 'mind was like spaghetti' when he shot Walter Scott Prosecutor Scarlett Wilson accused Savage of using \"smoke and mirrors\" to confuse the jury. \"That badge is supposed to be a shield, not a sword,\" she said. \u201cOur community has one fountain for justice. It's time for Michael Slager to take his drink.\" Slager was fired from the force and charged with murder within days of the release of the cellphone video. He has been free since January on a $500,000 bond. Slager also is awaiting trial in federal court, charged with violating Scott's rights, obstruction of justice and a gun violation. The city of North Charleston agreed to pay a $6.5 million settlement to the Scott family. 225 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gPm514 ",

Brandy Vela\u2019s family says cyberbullying pushed the 18-year-old over the edge, leading her to shoot herself in the chest Tuesday afternoon at the family\u2019s Texas City home as family members watched. Her father, Raul Vela, said she had been receiving abusive text messages for months from bullies using an untraceable smartphone application. Her father said someone made a fake Facebook page of her, creating another cyberbullying medium. On Tuesday, Brandy sent an email to her family members telling them she was going to kill herself, CBS Houston affiliate KHOU-TV reports . They rushed home and found her alive. \u201cWe tried to persuade her to put the gun down, but she was determined,\u201d Raul Vela told KHOU-TV. \u201cShe said she\u2019d come too far to turn back. It was very unfortunate that I had to see that. It\u2019s hard when your daughter tells you to turn around. You feel helpless.\u201d \u201cI heard someone crying,\u201d Brandy\u2019s 22-year-old sister, Jacqueline Vela, told KPRC-TV of Houston, \u201cso I ran upstairs and I looked in her room, and she\u2019s against the wall and she has a gun pointed at her chest and she\u2019s just crying and crying and I\u2019m like, \u2018Brandy, please don\u2019t. Brandy, no.\u201d Jacqueline Vela said she went to her parents\u2019 room, \u201cand I just heard the shot and my dad just yelled, \u2018Help me. Help me. Help me.\u2019\u201d \u201cI was almost certain that I could persuade her to put that gun down. It didn\u2019t work. She pulled the trigger,\u201d Raul Vela said. Her final cellphone text to her family was, \u201cI love you so much just remember that please and I\u2019m so sorry for everything.\u201d Her family said the harassment focused mainly on Brandy\u2019s weight. \u201cThey would make dating websites of her, and they would put her number and they would put her picture (on the sites), and lie about her age and say she is giving herself up for sex for free, to call her,\u201d said Jacqueline Vela. The family said they reported the bullying to the Texas City school district and several law enforcement agencies. \u201cSchool was a safe environment for Brandy,\u201d said school district spokeswoman Melissa Tortorici. \u201cShe had a lot of friends and was thought of warmly by her peers and teachers. She did bring it to the school\u2019s attention before Thanksgiving break that she was getting harassing messages to her cellphone outside of school. Our deputy investigated it, and the app that was being used to send the messages was untraceable. We encouraged her to change her phone number.\u201d Brandy Vela changed her number, but bullies always found her, her family said. \u201cWe have lots of incident reports, and they always say the same thing: They can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Jacqueline Vela said. A Texas City Police Department statement says it continues to investigate the Velas\u2019 complaints. Jacqueline Vela told KPRC that she and her siblings have a good idea who may have been behind some of these attacks and have been assisting in the investigation. The father said that he hopes for stricter laws against cyberbullying and greater awareness of the problem to give some meaning to his daughter\u2019s death. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

An evacuation alert was blasted out to area phones at around 9 p.m. Monday, John Mathews, director of the Sevier County Emergency Management Agency, said at a news conference Friday. Mathews said officials are \"unsatisfied\" after some people have said they failed to receive a warning and also complained they were only told to evacuate hours after the inferno grew. More than 14,000 people were forced to evacuate as the fires scorched more than 17,000 acres, mostly in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Nearly 1,000 structures have been destroyed and 3,000 customers were without power as of Friday evening, Tennessee officials said at a press conference.

The message was issued via the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, and also went out on TV and radio. But Flener said people in an area where a cell tower was damaged by the fires likely wouldn't have received the message. Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said officials would evaluate their response but would not get into \"Monday morning quarterbacking right now.\" Main roads were expected to be open by Wednesday and power to be fully restored by next week, officials added on Friday.

So we went from nothing to over 20-plus structure fires in a matter of minutes,\" Miller said. Local officials, bowing to pressure from frustrated property owners, began allowing people back into most parts of Gatlinburg on Friday morning.

Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean via AP Authorities have also been tasked with identifying victims who perished in the rubble. They include a Memphis couple, Jon and Janet Summers, who were separated from their three adult sons during the wildfires. Two of the three remained hospitalized, while a third was discharged Thursday night, reported NBC affiliate WBIR . Other fatalities include an elderly couple from Canada, Jon and Janet Tegler, and May Vance, who was vacationing in Gatlinburg and died of a heart attack after she was exposed to smoke. The identities of the other victims have not been released. In communities near Gatlinburg, there were signs of normalcy.

Tired of unwanted calls on your smartphone at different times of the day. (Photo: Getty Images) 90 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE You may find this surprising. Many of us remember when people\u2019s names, addresses, and phone numbers were listed in the telephone book and distributed for free. All we ever worried about were junk mail, telemarketers, and the occasional prank call. Times have changed. Phone books are now history. You can message anyone you know (or don\u2019t) on Facebook, Twitter, or other means. And most importantly, your phone number is a gateway to your primary means of communication, entertainment and safety. Once your number is compromised, it\u2019s far more intrusive than ever before. Spam texts and robocalls Every year or so, a hoax burns like a wildfire through email inboxes and social networks warning that all cellphone numbers are about to go public. It also says there's a deadline to register your cellphone, and, once registered, it only blocks your number for five years. Oddly enough, the only thing the hoax message gets right is the number to call. For the record, mobile telephone numbers have never been in any danger of being made public or released to telemarketers. Additionally, there has never been a deadline to register your cellphone. And you don't need to renew every five years (this was a rule for landlines that was axed in 2007). If you get an unsolicited marketing call on your cellphone, first ask the caller how they got your number and firmly tell them you don't want to be contacted again. If they call back, file a complaint with the FTC at donotcall.gov or 1-888-382-1222. But these days, many companies find it cheaper, easier and more profitable to send advertisements by text. You may also receive a host of \u201crobocalls,\u201d pre-recorded messages that automatically play when you pick up. With so many cellphone numbers being collected in databases, companies have a massive list of potential customers. Remember that texts, robocalls, and telemarketers may just as likely be scammers in disguise. Use extreme caution when answering these messages, and never give away personal data. Click here to learn how to stop telemarketing calls for good . Better yet, you can install apps on your phone that keep annoying telemarketers off your line. Click here for three apps that protect you from tele-predators. People know it is you calling when your caller ID pops up on their phone, but it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. There are two ways to keep your identity secret while making a call: one is permanent; the other is temporary on a call-by-call basis. Here\u2019s a tip that covers both methods. Callers sometimes threaten jail time and demand money on the spot. \u00a0(Photo: Getty Images) Check your apps When you receive an unwanted solicitation by phone, you may wonder: How did they get my number? You\u2019ve only given it to friends. You haven\u2019t posted your number on social media. You barely use your phone to make calls anymore. So what gives? One way to protect your cellphone number is to examine your apps and what permissions they require. People hand over their numbers often without even realizing it. When you install a new app, you receive a lengthy \u201cterms of service\u201d document. Buried in that fine print, there is often a clause about releasing your number to third parties. By accepting these terms of service, you typically give the company permission to use or sell your cellphone number. For example, PrivacyGrade took a look at the Brightest LED Flashlight app and found it can read the phone\u2019s current state information like phone signal, carrier, device ID, and phone number. Three years ago, the Federal Trade Commission settled with the creator of a different flashlight app for sharing users' information to third parties without their consent. Before you install an app, take a moment to learn exactly what information the app is collecting and how the developers intend to use the data. Fortunately, most of the heavy lifting has been done for you. Click here to learn more about how PrivacyGrade shows you an A+ to D rating on any given app's permissions . Social media and phone numbers Many people are careless on Facebook, giving criminals heaps of personal information without a second thought. They post their birthdays and home addresses, and they even indicate when they\u2019re home or away. Putting your cellphone number on social media can be hazardous, especially if you have a lot of \"friends\" who you don\u2019t know in real life. You may have tight privacy settings, but if you agree to be friends with a stranger, your data could be easily copied-and-pasted into nefarious hands. Use your thinking cap. You may find it easy to find volunteers for your upcoming benefit by posting your cell number on Twitter. You may take a picture of your \u201cMissing Dog\u201d sign and post it on Instagram. But the short-term benefits aren\u2019t worth the potential data breach. Phone numbers and security verification Password? Check. Secret security question? Check. Phone number? More and more, secure websites are using your phone number to verify your identity. If you have an Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft or Apple account, give them your cellphone number in your security settings. This way, if someone signs into your account using a new device or location, you receive an immediate alert. In addition, you can also receive an alert if someone tries to change your password. If a hacker steals your password and tries to log in to your account on an unknown computer, the site will ask them for the second code. Unless the hackers also stole your phone and were able to unlock it, they would not have the second code needed to log in. It\u2019s called two-factor authentication and it\u2019s an important safety measure. If you have not set it up yet, don\u2019t wait for something bad to happen.

Here's what we do know Victims of the San Bernardino shooting rampage Courtesy of family / Los Angeles Times A composite photo of the 14 victims of the San Bernardino shooting rampage. A composite photo of the 14 victims of the San Bernardino shooting rampage. (Courtesy of family / Los Angeles Times) Richard Winton Contact Reporter A year ago today,\u00a0 Syed Rizwan Farook \u00a0and\u00a0 Tashfeen Malik \u00a0killed 14 people in a\u00a0 terrorist attack \u00a0at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Since then, federal authorities have said the couple was \u201cself-radicalized\u201d in part by reading radical Islamic literature online. But why did they pick the Christmas gathering held by colleagues of Farook, who worked as a health inspector for San Bernardino County? Here is we know: Why was the IRC targeted? Officials said they don\u2019t know for sure. San Bernardino Police Lt. Mike Madden noted that in 2014, Farook attended another work event in that room, which was decorated for Christmas. Malik later stated in an online account that she felt Muslims should not have to attend Christian events, Madden said. Madden added that she did not specifically mention the event in her posting and that it\u2019s far from clear that it played any role in last year\u2019s attack. \u201cIt is open to speculation why they chose the party,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can say with any certainty why the party was chosen apart from it was a soft target.\u201d San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan agreed. \u201cThere are a lot of questions, and we don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cWe never established the motive. The best we can do is theorize.\u201d What was the timeline of events? Farook left his Redlands home at 8:37 a.m. Dec. 2 and arrived at the Inland Regional Center 10 minutes later. His co-workers were gathered for a holiday event and training session there. He carried with him a bag containing a bomb, authorities say. He stuck around the center for about two hours before leaving. He returned to the event at 10:56 a.m. with his wife. They were armed with AR-15s, and their faces were covered. They sprayed the room with bullets before fleeing. They left behind an explosive device made of several pipe bombs. They later were killed by police at the end of a high-speed chase. How extensively did they plan an attack? Officials believe they planned for months, gathering weapons and building bombs in their garage. Farook traveled to the Middle East before the attack and came back with his wife. Farook was born in Illinois, but Malik was raised in Pakistan and lived in Saudi Arabia before marrying him. From the beginning, one of the biggest questions was whether the attack was part of a larger international plot hatched by Islamic State or some other Islamic terror group. Malik posted a note on Facebook pledging allegiance to Islamic State shortly after the attack, authorities said. The FBI concluded fairly quickly that the two were \u201cself-radicalized.\u201d They were inspired by terrorist groups, officials said, but did not receive financial support from any foreign or domestic organizations. A year later, the investigation continues. What are memorial plans today? San Bernardino will sponsor a \u201cNight of Remembrance\u201d Friday at 6:30 p.m. at\u00a0Cal State San Bernardino\u2019s Coussoulis Arena. \u201cOur community continues to stand together\u00a0united in solidarity and support for the victims, survivors, and families of those affected by the December 2nd terrorist attack,\u201d Mayor\u00a0R. Carey Davis said in a statement. A memorial bicycle ride is planned to the IRC Friday morning. A special lighting formation in the hills above San Bernardino to memorialize the victims is also planned. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump is set to preside over the most affluent Cabinet in U.S. History , the mountain lion known as P-45 has been given a second chance , before election day, L.A.

    "text": "Why There Is Civilian Control of the Military and When That Tradition Began By Luis Martinez Dec 2, 2016, 3:25 PM ET 0 Shares Star Mike Segar/Reuters Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Nov. 19, 2016. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump's pick of retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to be the next Defense Secretary will require a congressional waiver for him to assume the post because he has not been retired from military service more than seven years. The pick has called attention to the requirement set in the National Security Act of 1947 that the head of the Defense Department must be a civilian. Any nominee with prior military experience must have been retired from active duty for seven years. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps three years ago. The concept of civilian control of the U.S. military required by the law is one that dates to the nation's earliest days and reflects the balance of powers outlined in the Constitution. Here's a look at how civilian control of the military has become a trademark of American national security. It Is in the Constitution The concept of civilian control of the military was written by the Founding Fathers into the Constitution emerging from the colonial reality of citizen-soldiers. Reflecting the balance of power established by the Constitution, the president was made commander in chief of the military and Congress was given the authority to declare war and fund the military. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states, \"The President shall be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States when called into the actual Service of the United States.\" The roles of Congress outlined in Article I, Section 8 include, \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years; To provide and maintain a Navy.\" When Was Civilian Control Required? With the president as commander in chief, the day-to-day management of the nation's military was left to the secretary of war. With very few exceptions, civilians held the post of secretary of war, reflecting the constitutional authority given to the executive branch of government over the military. But it was the National Security Act of 1947 that replaced the War Department with the Defense Department that also made it a requirement that only civilians could lead the department. That legislation also created the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force, which, through additional legislation, also became civilian-only positions. Seventeen of the 24 men who have served as defense secretary have had some kind of military service. Since most of their service years occurred during their youth, the seven-year gap requirement between military and civilian life did not come into play. Only George Marshall's nomination in 1950 has required a congressional waiver similar to the one that Mattis will require to become defense secretary. 0 Shares ",

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, left, and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, Chinag Ying-ying, File) Tribune news services Contact Reporter China's foreign minister said Saturday he hopes Beijing's relations with the U.S. would not be \"interfered with or damaged\" after President-elect Donald Trump broke with decadeslong diplomatic tradition and spoke directly with Taiwan's leader. It is highly unusual, probably unprecedented, for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the call between Taiwan's president and Trump was \"just a small trick by Taiwan\" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV. \"The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,\" Wang was quoted as saying. Washington has pursued a so-called \"one China\" policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan. A statement from Trump's transition team said he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who offered her congratulations. \"During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties ... between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year,\" the statement said. Trump tweeted later: \"The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!\" The Taiwanese presidential office issued a statement early Saturday saying Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan. \"The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer cooperative relations,\" the statement said. \"The president also told U.S. President-elect Trump that she hopes the U.S. will continue to support Taiwan's efforts in having more opportunities to participate in and contribute to international affairs in the future,\" Tsai's office said.
