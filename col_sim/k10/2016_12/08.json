Biden's response at the time was that everyone knew he drove a Corvette, not a Trans-Am. Said McConnell: \"This son of a used-car salesman will always be a muscle car guy at heart.\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, became so emotional that he had to stop speaking while telling a story about how Biden met with a first-time voter who was so sick with sickle cell anemia that it was difficult for him to vote. He added that that story epitomizes Biden \u2014 someone who \"offers joy\" to people who are struggling. Arizona Sen. John McCain, meanwhile, talked about their 40 year friendship that began when McCain was a Navy Senate liaison who used to carry Biden's bags on overseas trips. He recalled a lighter moment from Biden's early senate days when McCain and Biden's wife, Jill, once danced on a table at a bar. Related: Biden Emotional at Vote on Cancer Funding Bill Partly Named for Son Beau Dr. Jill Biden and much of their family sat in the Senate gallery watching the tribute, eyes filled with tears the celebration of his life and relationships stretched on. Biden told reporters off the Senate floor that he had no intention of running for president again in 2020, despite teasing references over the last few days. During appearances on Capitol Hill each day this week, Biden had stoked speculation by not ruling it out, but not taking questions about it seriously. Biden further dismissed speculation Tuesday night on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" but added an important caveat. \"I don't plan on running again, but to say you know what's going to happen in four years I just think is not rational.\" He added that he's learned over his 74 years that he should \"never say never.\" Both Republican and Democratic Senators acknowledged the speculation and joked about him being president. \"Thank you, Mr. President, and it does bring me some joy to call you Mr. President,\" said Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware. The senator presiding over the senate is referred to as president. Biden decided against running in 2016 because of the pain he suffered from the death of his son. He has said many times that his heart would not have been in it, and he told Colbert that he doesn't regret not running because it was the right decision for his family. Play ",

News Sentinel 4:10 p.m. EST December 7, 2016 x Share Photographer Brandon Reese and his work partner walked through the fire that scorched the town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, classifying it as 'an apocalyptic wasteland.' USA TODAY NETWORK Rain falls as cars drive through downtown Gatlinburg, Tenn., Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Authorities have made two arrests \u2014 both teenagers \u2014 in last week's deadly wildfires. Authorities made the announcement Wednesday during a news conference at the Sevier County Courthouse. The teens remain in custody in Sevier County, charged with aggravated arson, said Jimmy Dunn, 4th Judicial District attorney general. They await a bond hearing in Juvenile Court and could be transferred to Criminal Court if prosecutors move to try them as adults. \"Everything is on the table,\" Dunn said. He refused to give any details about the case, including the teens' ages or genders, except that \"they are from Tennessee \u2014 not from Sevier County.\" Sara Reynolds, a youth services officer in Sevier County Juvenile Court, wouldn't provide a copy of the petition charging either teen. State law typically denies public access to juvenile records, except in certain cases such as murder or rape. Arson isn't on the list. Those court records would become public if the case were transferred to Criminal Court. The\u00a0Tennessee Bureau of Investigation\u00a0has operated a hotline to coordinate reports of people missing since last week's firestorm that ravaged Gatlinburg and surrounding areas, killing 14 people and injuring nearly 150 others. The flames damaged or destroyed more than 1,700 homes and businesses. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Richard T.

According to senior police officer Khurram Rasheed, the plane crashed in a village in the district of Abbottabad, 45 miles northwest of the capital, Islamabad. The small twin-propeller aircraft was travelling from the city of Chitral to Islamabad when it crashed shortly after takeoff. He said the rescue work is over and that they had transported the remains of the passengers to a local hospital, where doctors were performing DNA tests to identify the victims. According to Daniyal Gilani, the spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the plane had lost touch with the control tower prior to the crash. He said the plane was carrying 42 passengers, five crew members and a ground engineer. Two Austrians and a Chinese citizen were among the dead, he said.\u00a0 Villagers retrieved remains of passengers killed in a plane crash and placed them in shawls and covered bodies with cloth near Havelian, Pakistan, Dec. 7, 2016. Daily Akhbar Abbottabad PIA has released names of passengers, who included Junaid Jamshed, a famous singer-turned-Islamic-preacher. \u201cThere are no survivors. All passengers and members of crew are dead,\u201d Azam Sehgal, chairman of the PIA told a news conference at the Islamabad airport late Wednesday. He said the plane\u2019s black box recorder had been found. Sehgal said the pilot of plane told the control tower at 4:09 p.m. that an engine had developed a technical fault. Moments later he made a \u201cmayday call,\u201d shortly before the plane disappeared. Sehgal said the plane was fit to fly and it was unclear what caused the crash. TV footage showed debris from the plane and a massive fire at the site of the crash. The footage showed local villagers collecting the remains of the passengers and covering the bodies with cloths. Several bodies were later transported to the Ayub Medical Complex, where mourning relatives began arriving to receive the remains. Among such mourners was tearful Ghulam Rasool Khan, 24, who said his brother Umair Khan was on board the plane. Ghulam asked police to allow him to identify his brother\u2019s body. However, police officer Iqbal Khan told him there was no point in going to the mortuary as, \u201cthere is nothing left which you can recognize.\u201d Khan said he had heard that the plane was not fit to fly. \u201cIt is a murder and I want to know who killed my brother,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Relatives and friends of Pakistani singer-turned Islamic preacher Junaid Jamshed, comfort each other outside his home following a report that he died in plane crash, in Karachi, Pakistan, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016.\u00a0 AP Altaf Hussain, a rescue worker who transported the remains of passengers in an ambulance, told the AP that the crash site smelled of burnt flesh and oil and that body parts were scattered everywhere. \u201cWe collected the burned bones of the ill-fated passengers and wrapped them in cloth,\u201d he said. Ambulance driver Duray Hussain said the remains of the passengers were \u201cbeyond recognition.\u201d One official, Farman Ghori, was crying outside the hospital, saying he saw the faces of two toddlers among the remains. \u201cOh God, I never saw such a tragedy,\u201d Ghori said. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed his \u201cdeep grief and sorrow\u201d over the crash. In a statement, he said \u201cthe entire nation is deeply saddened over today\u2019s unfortunate crash and shares the grief of the families who lost their dear ones.\u201d Plane crashes are not uncommon in Pakistan. About 150 people were killed in a crash in the hills of Islamabad in 2010.  In 2015, a military helicopter carrying several diplomats also crashed in the country\u2019s north, killing eight people. A private plane also crashed near Islamabad due to bad weather in 2012, killing all 127 people on board. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Michigan Recount Now in Doubt; Pennsylvania Sets Hearing By roger schneider and ed white, associated press DETROIT \u0097 Dec 7, 2016, 1:39 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Judge to Rule on When Michigan Vote Recount Can Start 0 Shares Email Michigan's presidential recount suddenly appears in doubt after a state appeals court said the Green Party candidate's poor showing disqualified her from seeking a second look at the votes. Meanwhile, the fate of a statewide recount push in Pennsylvania must wait at least until Friday, when a federal judge has scheduled a hearing. President-elect Donald Trump narrowly defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in both states and Wisconsin, which started its recount last week. The recounts requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein were not expected to change enough votes to overturn the result of the election. Stein, who received about 1 percent of the vote in all three states, says her intent is to verify the accuracy of the vote. She has suggested, with no evidence, that votes cast were susceptible to computer hacking. Here's what's happening in each state and in Nevada, where a partial recount of the race was requested by independent presidential candidate Roque De La Fuente: \u2014\u2014\u2014 WISCONSIN Trump had widened his victory margin over Clinton in Wisconsin by 146 votes, with 23 of the state's 72 counties having finished their recounts as of Tuesday. In those counties, Trump gained 105 votes and Clinton dropped 41 votes. Trump defeated Clinton in Wisconsin by about 22,000 votes. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for Friday in a lawsuit filed last week by a Trump voter and two super PACs seeking to stop the recount. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MICHIGAN A recount that started Monday might end after the state appeals court said Stein has no standing to have the votes recounted. The court said she finished fourth in the election and doesn't qualify as an \"aggrieved\" candidate under Michigan law. The court ordered the state election board to reject her recount petition. The board meets again Wednesday. Attorney General Bill Schuette said the decision means the recount \"must stop.\" But Stein's attorney, Mark Brewer, insisted the recount isn't over. The ruling came a day after U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith ordered an immediate statewide recount of roughly 4.8 million ballots. Eight counties have started, including the largest, Wayne County. But Goldsmith's decision dealt with the timing of the recount, not whether Stein had standing. Goldsmith called a hearing for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday to address Schuette's request to set aside the ruling in light of the state court's decision. Trump won Michigan by about 10,700 votes over Clinton. Also Tuesday, a Republican-controlled committee in the Legislature approved a measure that would require candidates who lose by more than 5 percentage points to pay 100 percent of the estimated recount cost. The bill would apply to Stein, though Democrats questioned the legality of changing the rules \"in the middle of the game.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 PENNSYLVANIA U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond in Philadelphia on Tuesday scheduled a hearing Friday on the request for a recount. The Republican Party and Trump warned that the case threatens Pennsylvania's ability to certify its election before the Dec. 13 federal deadline. Stein's team hasn't produced evidence of hacking, but calls Pennsylvania's election system \"a national disgrace.\" Also Tuesday, Pennsylvania election officials updated the state's vote count to show that Trump's lead over Clinton had shrunk to about 44,000 out of more than 6 million votes cast. That is still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount. A state spokeswoman said 15 provisional ballots remain uncounted. \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEVADA A partial recount is underway in Nevada at the request of De La Fuente, who finished last with a fraction of 1 percent of the vote. He paid about $14,000 for the recount to provide what he called a counterbalance to the recounts sought by Stein. Most of the 92 precincts being re-counted are in the Las Vegas area, with eight of the precincts in four other counties. If the sample shows a discrepancy of at least 1 percent for De La Fuente or Clinton, a full recount will be launched in all 17 Nevada counties. Clinton defeated Trump in Nevada by 27,202 votes, out of 1.1 million votes cast. Nevada Secretary of State spokeswoman Gail Anderson said the recount will be finished by the end of this week. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Ed White in Detroit; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin; and Ken Ritter in Las Vegas contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Dec 7 2016, 2:10 pm ET The 'Man in the Hat' Spills Terror Gang's Secrets by Duncan Gardham, NBC News Security Analyst Share March 28, 2016: Watch Security Video of Brussels Airport Bombing Suspect 0:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161208001328if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/653429315741\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> After the Brussels airport bombing that killed 16 people last March, a man in a black hat was seen walking calmly from the scene. Closed-circuit cameras caught the same man prior to the blasts, in hat and glasses and tan coat, pushing a loaded luggage cart alongside the two suicide bombers who would soon detonate their devices. A manhunt began for the mysterious Man in the Hat. What he told officials about his work for ISIS after his capture \u2014 revealed in the just completed trial of another jihadi in the U.K. \u2014 shows how the terror group runs its operations and hands out its deadly missions. The Man in the Hat was a prolific burglar, a Manchester United fan with a gambling habit, and a neighborhood friend of several of the plotters in the Paris and Brussels terror attacks who traveled to Syria and Britain as a courier for ISIS. Mohamed Abrini, 31, a Belgian of Moroccan descent, was picked up in Belgium on April 8. His confession allowed authorities to identify and charge two men from Birmingham, England as accomplices in the attacks. But Abrini didn't like the way his statements were leaked to the media, and how he was branded a \"supergrass,\" or snitch. He refused to testify against the two men, who were charged with supplying money for the attacks. Prosecutors used his confession as evidence instead, reading the transcript aloud in court. A jury found Belgian national Zakaria Boufassil, 26, guilty on Tuesday. Mohammed Ali Ahmed pleaded guilty last month. A composite handout photograph provided by Belgian Federal Police shows Abrini at the Brussels airport on March 22, 2016. Belgian Federal Police via EPA Journey to Raqqa Abrini was friends with at least three of the Paris and Brussels attackers, Bataclan massacre mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud and brothers Salah and Brahim Abdeslam. Brahim blew himself up in a restaurant during the Nov. 13, 2015, Paris attacks, while prosecutors say Salah provided transport to the attackers and may helped assemble explosives. All shared a history of petty crime, and one of Abrini's brothers had already traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS. Abrini would soon follow. Authorities would later say that in addition to participating in the Brussels attack on March 22, he had driven Salah Abdeslam to Paris two days prior to the Bataclan massacre, in which 130 people died. In his statement to Belgian police, Abrini said that he knew Abaaoud \"from the neighborhood,\" the heavily immigrant suburb of Brussels known as Molenbeek, \"but didn't really hang out with him much.\" Abrini ran a snack bar at Rue Ransfort. Abaaoud, who sometimes worked at his family's clothing store, had a police record for assault and other offenses. \"He had a business only meters from my place and so our paths crossed often and we chatted together now and then, no more,\" he said. Abrini said he went to Syria simply to pay tribute to his little brother. \"My reason for going to Syria was to see my young brother's Soulaymene's grave,\" he added. Soulaymene went to Syria in June 2014 and died in Deir Ezzor in Syria around August 2014. Before heading to Syria, said Abrini, he contacted two people, Youssef Barzarouj and Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Barzarouj explained the journey to him, telling him how to get into Syria, he said. \"He told me which steps to follow and it was he who gave my number to the border crossing facilitator so that I would be able to cross the border,\" Abrini said. Belgian Federal Police released a photo of Mohamed Abrini, a suspect in the Paris terrorist attacks. Belgian Federal Police \"He called the person in question and I took the phone from him and we discussed things.\" Barzarouj had been fighting in Syria. He told Abrini that his friend and neighbor Abaaoud was \"near Iraq.\" Abrini said that at this point he had nothing more than a phone contact for Abaaoud, obtained through \"a person from the neighborhood.\" At the end of June or the beginning of July 2015, Abrini went to Turkey. He used money earned at the snack bar, he said, to buy his round-trip ticket to Istanbul, paying 700 to 800 euros in cash at a travel agency in central Brussels. \"In fact, initially I thought I would be able to go to Syria directly and then from Syria back to Turkey during the time that I had booked the travel,\" he claimed. \"I booked a ticket to Istanbul and a hotel near the Blue Mosque in the centre of Istanbul.\" Abrini arrived in Istanbul and bought a phone card at the airport, presenting his passport for identification, before ringing Barzarouj on a number he said he couldn't remember any more.

Once in Syria, he headed to Telabiad where he stayed in a small house, which served as a staging post to Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic Caliphate. A \"man in a van\" who was \"part of Islamic State\" took him to Raqqa, he said. \"In Raqqa I was put in a house that had everything - TV, food in the fridge,\" he added. Abrini met Abaaoud \"at the entrance to Raqqa\" and they spent an hour together. \"We talked a bit about everything and anything he talked about battles he had been part of where my brother had died and the circumstances of the death,\" Abrini told the officers. Abrini and Abaaoud arranged a second meeting. \"The first time we talked about a bit of everything and anything and the second time he asked me if I could do him a favor,\" he added. The Mission Abaaoud gave him two phone numbers in the U.K. and told him to travel to the U.K. and call the numbers when he arrived. \"I only knew that I was supposed to go to the U.K. make contact with the numbers that Abaaoud gave me.\" Abrini left equipped with two British phone numbers and the knowledge that a Belgian was supposed to receive the money. \"From Turkey, I then went to the U.K., to London to be precise. In the beginning I did not know which city I had to go to. I only had the contact numbers that Abaaoud Abdelhamid gave me. Without thinking too much about it I asked for a plane ticket to London.\" In London, he went to an internet cafe to buy a British SIM card to phone his British contact, although he had not been given a name, he said. \"As I understood it, the person I was supposed to meet in the U.K. was in contact with an individual in Syria and that individual in Syria had loaned money to Abdelhamid Abaaoud,\" he said. Related: Paris Terror Files Reveal Missed Opportunities to Stop Attacks \"That is at least what I understood but I am not sure.\" In London, he also made contact with Abaaoud to let him know he had arrived safely and \"to say everything was in order,\" he said. He described a message-taking system designed to try and keep ISIS operatives safe. \"The Turkish numbers I was contacting belonged to people of the Islamic State who are in contact with Abdelhamid Abaaoud. \"They are actually intermediaries for Abdelhamid Abaaoud \u2014 they are numbers based in warehouses, houses that do not really correspond to any person, but to places and are managed by the caretakers of these houses.\" After arriving in London, he was redirected to Birmingham where he picked up a taxi from the bus station. \"I did not know Birmingham and I asked the driver to take me to a reasonably priced hotel in a Muslim neighborhood,\" he said. The hotel was opposite Small Heath Park, where Abrini later met Ahmed, a U.K. national, and Boufassil, the Belgian he'd heard about. The Meeting There was a dummy run on July 10, when Abrini was directed to the park but the other two men circulated around the area checking him out. Then on the afternoon of July 11, Mohammed Ali Ahmed and Zakaria Boufassil directed Abrini to a local pizzeria. \"They asked me to wait opposite that specific pizzeria. I went there as agreed. After various phone contacts, a person on the telephone with a mix of Arabic and English asked me to face the park and to wait for a person with a blue jacket with a kind of short 3/4 trousers,\" he said. \"After that phone contact I waited for about ten minutes and the person arrived. This person then told me to follow him while keeping a distance of between 10 and 15 meters between us. \"I did what he told me. We then crossed the large park then outside the park we crossed a bridge that passes outside the motorway. After the bridge there was a little forest and we went into there. \"There was actually a second person who waited in the forest and it was him who had the money that needed to be given to me.\" He said they \"spoke a little bit about the trip\" and the man then asked who had sent him to get the money. \"I answered it was Abelhamid Abaaoud. On those words he took his bag out and gave me the money,\" Abrini said. Police officers detain a suspect during a raid in which fugitive Mohamed Abrini was arrested in Anderlecht, near Brussels, Belgium, April 8, 2016 in this still image taken from video. Sebastien Dana-Kamran via Reuters TV The men didn't count the cash, but Abrini said it was in \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes and he later changed it into euros, \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 at a time. \"It is at that moment as well that Zakaria explained to me that it had taken long because he had to verify with Syria that I was the right person,\" he added. Although the three men had their phones switch off for an hour, Abrini claimed the meeting had been \"for only a brief moment.\" \"From the forest I went to the park and from the park I went to my hotel. I left the money in the hotel and then I went for a walk,\" he said. \"I stayed another day or two in that city before going to Manchester. In Birmingham during the day I used to go to the cafes and shopping. At night I used to go to the casinos,\" he added. It can now be reported that the British government had been surveilling Ahmed, but it was not a 24-hour operation, and the meeting with Abrini was missed. Had the British witnessed the meeting, they might have alerted Belgian authorities to Abrini long before the Paris and Brussels attacks. Abrini turned himself in to Belgian police 11 days after he returned but denied he had anything to do with ISIS. \"I Am A Player, A Fan of Casinos\" Abrini told the Belgian officers that weather was \"exceptional for the U.K.,\" adding: \"I remember that it was nice. The sun was shining. People went out in shorts and t-shirts.\" As part of the trip he traveled to Manchester where he took more than 30 photographs on a two-hour tour of the Manchester United football stadium. He denied any plan to attack Britain, saying: \"On being arrested by you, neither in London, nor in Birmingham, nor in Manchester, have I been on any reconnaissance trips in relation to preparatory terrorist attacks.\" He added: \"There's no plan to target England as a potential site for a terrorist act. From what I know, it's France who is the declared enemy of Islamic State. \"I think England has a more developed secret service, better observation techniques etc... and it's therefore more difficult to attack.\" Abrini also made at least five visits to casinos in London, Birmingham and Manchester and police wanted to know why. \"I am a player, a fan of casinos,\" he said. \"I play, I am registered a little everywhere in casinos \u2014 Lille, Essen...I am a player it's my addiction. \"I play Russian roulette, poker and the slot machines, but only in Lille for the slot machines.\" It's unclear if \"Russian roulette\" \u2014 normally played with a handgun to the temple \u2014 was actually the game he played. Abaaoud funded his trip to Britain with \u00a32,000 because he only had 300 to 400 euros left, Abrini said. Play ",

Paul Sancya/AP hide caption toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Sen. Robert Dole, seated next to then-vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, receives a standing ovation at the Republican National Convention in July. Paul Sancya/AP President-elect Donald Trump's phone call with the president of Taiwan last week, initially characterized by Trump transition staffers and Taipei officials as just a small courtesy, has emerged as part of a lobbying strategy by a quintessential Washington insider. Former Sen. Bob Dole, a war hero, lion of the Senate and 1996 Republican nominee for president, was an early supporter of Donald Trump, even when other Republican leaders were still wary. Dole explained his reasons on NPR's Morning Edition in June. Both Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton had flaws, he said. \"Republicans say, 'Well, I can't vote for Trump.' I have an obligation to the party. I mean what am I gonna do? I can't vote for George Washington.\" Dole is the Taipei government's man in Washington \u2014 has been, in fact, for 18 years, since Bill Clinton was president. In official jargon, Dole is a registered foreign agent. The law requires foreign agents to file itemized lists of what they do for their clients. Dole filed his latest six-month report last week, and it shows the phone call wasn't a one-off event. Article continues after sponsorship Since May, Dole has been arranging contacts between Taiwanese officials and Trump campaign advisers. He facilitated a Taiwan delegation's attendance at the Republican National Convention when Trump was nominated. And he helped them get favorable language into the Republican platform. As for that phone call last week, it came after the report's end date. Dole told The New York Times he helped arrange it. His office couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. \"Dole was pushing on a somewhat open door, because talking to the leader of Taiwan was consistent with Trump's stance on China and also his willingness to ignore what might be the conventional wisdom,\" Jordan Tama , a foreign policy professor at American University, told NPR. Dole was in a perfect position to give that somewhat open door a shove. Aside from his nearly two decades lobbying for Taiwan, Dole was also the only Republican former presidential nominee to endorse Trump this year. \"Trump, we have good reason to think, values and rewards loyalty, and so the fact that Dole endorsed him certainly would be something Trump would be aware of,\" Tama said. Dole didn't report contacting any other presidential campaign on behalf of Taipei. Disclosure reports covering November 2015 through October 2016 show that Taipei's Washington office paid his law firm $200,000. ",

Authorities in Minot, North Dakota, issued a travel advisory to community members because of the treacherous weather conditions. The Minot International Airport reopened this morning after closing for nearly 12 hours because of snow and strong winds, the airport's director, Rick Feltner, told ABC News. Videos of the airport's runway conditions were posted on Facebook. \"We had a blizzard warning in effect starting Sunday night ... and this was on top of about 17 inches of snow we got last week. While the storm didn't produce a great deal of new snow, the temperatures plummeted, and the wind picked up, 30 to 35 miles per hour. In those conditions, visibility is greatly reduced,\" said Feltner. \"It was an unusual situation for us to close the airport. We're usually pretty good at keeping things open here, but it was more than we could keep up with this time,\" he added. Roommates Lauren Otradovec and Natasha Harvey live 20 miles north of Minot in Glenburn. On Tuesday morning they opened the front door of their house to find a wall of snow. \"I honestly felt claustrophobic. I didn't want to feel like there was no way out,\" Harvey told ABC News. So she attempted to shovel her way out. \"We shoveled our side door, and within an hour, all the snow had blown back in. We're at the same point today,\" she added. \"There are hardly any trees here, and we live in a really small town, so the wind is pushing everything to our direction. The first layer on our house is pretty much ice, and the snow that keeps blowing is just freezing to that,\" she said. Harvey hasn't been able to make it to work for the past two days. \"I'm used to this weather, but this is crazy,\" she said. Courtesy Lauren Ashley Otradovec A Glenburn, North Dakota, home was bombarded with snow all the way up to the front door. A National Weather Service wind chill advisory is in effect for most of western North Dakota. The temperature in some areas is expected to feel like 30 degrees below zero with the wind chill.

(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP) Senate Republicans and Democrats may disagree on a lot, but they made it clear Wednesday they agree on one thing: They love Joe Biden. The vice president's former Senate colleagues at 3 p.m. began an hour of tributes Biden, honoring a life marked by unspeakable loss and remarkable resilience. Biden looked on, appearing\u00a0moved, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and others recounted\u00a0how Biden overcame a childhood stutter, the loss of his first wife and two children and brain aneurysms. And how he\u00a0served 36 years representing Delaware, passing major women's rights legislation\u00a0in the Senate, before becoming vice president and pushing\u00a0his \"Moonshot\" initiative to cure cancer following the death last year of his son and Delaware's former attorney general, Beau Biden, at the age of 46. \"He\u2019s been blessed in many ways,\" said McConnell, who called Biden a \"real friend and trusted partner.\" \"He\u2019s also been tested, knocked down, pushed to the edge of what anyone could be expected to bear. But from the grip of unknowable despair\u00a0came a new man, a better man, stronger and more compassionate, grateful for every moment, appreciative of what really matters.\" A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Is Jimmy Kimmel the right Oscars host for this Donald Trump moment? Jimmy Kimmel at the ABC upfronts ABC/Ida Mae Astute Jimmy Kimmel will host the 2017 Oscars. Jimmy Kimmel will host the 2017 Oscars. (ABC/Ida Mae Astute) Steven Zeitchik Contact Reporter Modern Oscar telecasts, like upscale restaurants and traveling viruses, tend to get the hosts they deserve. Maybe it\u2019s that producers intuit a prevailing vibe. Or maybe it\u2019s just that a solid pro bends a ceremony to the moment. Whatever the reason, Academy Awards hosts can reflect a certain zeitgeist. A roiling year of Oscars So White and Black Lives Matter yielded a race-minded provocateur like Chris Rock last February. A post-crash 2009 gave way to the song-and-dance pick-me-up of Hugh Jackman . A gay-rights movement that crested in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 and saw the best picture nominations of such films as \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d\u00a0and \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d \u2014 brought Ellen DeGeneres\u200e and Neil Patrick Harris to the Dolby podium. It\u2019s not a one-to-one correlation, of course, and hosts and larger events don\u2019t always line up. But look back at Oscar emcees over the past few decades and you\u2019ll get a surprisingly \u200erepresentative view of where the culture found itself at a given time. Where to put Jimmy Kimmel on this spectrum? The late-night personality, named Monday as the 2017 host, was foremost a business-driven choice. ABC, having recently paid a lot of cash for a long-term Oscars renewal, wanted its network star in the prime-time spotlight\u00a0and pushed Kimmel for the gig; producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd and the Motion Picture Academy acquiesced. But Kimmel\u2019s hiring also is of a piece with a national moment. The emcee, 49, is the first straight white \u200eman to preside over the telecast in the last four ceremonies \u2014\u00a0and, save for the last-minute addition of Billy Crystal in 2012, the first white man over the age of 45 to host in the past seven ceremonies. If this was the year of the older white male voter\u200e \u2014 or at least the year when said group swung a presidential election \u2014 Kimmel\u2019s presence on the country\u2019s most-watched non-sports telecast seems fitting. It is also a year when the \u200eacademy could, not to put too fine a point on it, afford to choose a host like Kimmel. The Oscars this season will \u2014 mercifully, finally \u2014 feature a bevy of minority nominees. \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cFences\u201d\u00a0and \u201cLoving\u201d are sure to be cited early and often on the telecast. They\u2019ll come along with the potential presence of documentaries such as \u200e\u201dO.J.: Made in America\u201d\u00a0and Ava DuVernay\u2019s prison movie \u201c13th,\u201d\u00a0each shortlisted on Tuesday, and the animation muscle of Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana.\u201d\u00a0The chilling prospect of a lily-white show that made Rock\u2019s selection so urgent last year has been fortunately absent this year. Ah, but if it\u2019s a year of so many worthy people-of-color nominees, wouldn\u2019t that give greater impetus for a person-of-color as emcee? And if it\u2019s a moment of ballot-box revolt for older whites, isn\u2019t it also a time of anxiety for many minorities? Kimmel also can be seen, in this light, as a worrying return to a politics of old. He is the first person to host the Emmys and Oscars in the same cycle, and a year in which he dominates awards podiums while much of the country worries about the status of Latino immigrants, Muslim Americans and other minorities can easily seem tin-eared. Already that point has been raised. The website Refinery29 offered a post shortly after the Kimmel announcement strongly questioning the producers\u2019 decision. \u201cThis will be near the 80th time a white man has hosted the highly esteemed awards show. \u2026 It\u2019s embarrassing on behalf of those involved in any aspect of the billion-dollar entertainment industry. It\u2019s a lazy decision that, in turn, negates the avid work of directors, actors, and producers who, year after year, have tried to make the Oscars less white,\u201d wrote site contributor Morgan Baila.\u00a0\u201c[C]ouldn\u2019t a woman, man of color, or (gasp) a woman of color, do the same exact job [as Kimmel]? Why are we, or rather, The Academy, falling into the same #OscarsSoWhite narrative that we have succumbed to again, and again?\u201d The article went on to call the move a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d It\u2019s a legitimate criticism, and one that nobody \u2014 least of all another white man writing a blog post \u2014 should or could ever discount. But it is worth noting that Kimmel has proved himself adept at poking under the hypocrisies of Hollywood\u2019s attempt to diversity \u2014 if not with the flamethrowing ardor of a Rock or the toothy satire of a Tina Fey \u00a0(a Golden Globes veteran and Oscar host-in-waiting), then in his own quietly subversive way. \u201cHere in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity,\u201d Kimmel quipped at the Emmys. Perhaps \u200ehis most memorable moment at that show came when he had to take the stage after an intense call-to-action moment. \u201cTransparent\u201d creator Jill Soloway had just finished her acceptance speech by calling for the room, and Hollywood, to \u201ctopple the patriarchy.\u201d Kimmel returned to the podium, and with the wry smile that is his trademark, ad-libbed, \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out if \u2018topple the patriarchy\u2019 is a good thing for me or not. I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d It was a perfect joke, both acknowledging a changed sensibility while also gently reminding that a percentage of the people who make and consume entertainment in the U.S. were still here too \u2014\u00a0and that perhaps, in this new age, there will have to be some co-existence. Revolts can happen, it suggested, but they need to take into account and integrate current realities. In his subtly comedic way, he was making his own plea to get along. In this context, Kimmel\u2019s presence at the 2017 Oscars can be seen as a representative moment in a different way \u2014 not because he\u2019s an older white male in the time of Trump but because he stands for something else the country could use right now: some good-spirited unity.

USA TODAY Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in May 2014 in New York. (Photo: Evan Agostini, AP) Brad Pitt sought to seal details about child custody arrangements in his pending divorce from Angelina Jolie but a judge rejected his bid at an emergency hearing Wednesday in Los Angeles. Superior Court Richard Burdge Jr. denied Pitt's request in a brief written order that said Pitt's filing did not meet the requirements for sealing details at this time. Pitt sought an emergency hearing to keep documents covering his dispute with Jolie over the custody of their six children under wraps,\u00a0but Burdge declined to hear the petition on an expedited basis. Pitt's motion came after Jolie's lawyers filed documents Friday laying out in writing the temporary, voluntary custody agreement the two\u00a0had signed in October. Under the agreement, Jolie has physical custody of the children at a rented house in Malibu and Pitt visits periodically under the guidance of a therapist. Brangelina divorce: Temporary custody agreement worked out Peter Walzer, a Los Angeles divorce attorney who has handled celeb divorces, said the\u00a0purpose of such a filing would be to get a court order in case either party wants to change the custody agreement. \"If it's just an agreement it\u2019s not enforceable without a court order,\" Walzer says. \"Monitored visitation is a super-serious deal and it needs to be part of the court record and (under) court supervision and enforcement in case there is a violation (of the agreement).\" But the move also served to put the children in the spotlight again. A source familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that Jolie's filing would lead to more unnecessary exposure for the children. Pitt intends to seek temporary custody orders soon, and his filing states that he wanted custody-related documents sealed to protect the children. \"I am extremely concerned that if court records regarding custody are not sealed, information contained therein will cause irreparable damage to our children's privacy rights,\" Pitt wrote in a sworn declaration filed Wednesday. Pitt's attorney Gary Fishbein declined comment after the hearing. Jolie's\u00a0attorney Laura Wasser told the Associated Press the actress does not oppose sealing details of the pair's custody arrangements, but Pitt's attorneys did not consult with them before filing the motion Wednesday. Brangelina split, Day 2: What we know now In a shock to Hollywood, Jolie filed for divorce \u00a0\u2014 citing \"the health of the family\" in a statement \u2014 in September, setting off a nasty legal and public-relations battle in which anonymous sources on both sides traded disparaging details about the other. In the latest rumor , Jolie's team denied reports that she planned to move to London with the children to take a job with the United Nations. A representative for Jolie who was not authorized to speak publicly said Jolie is looking for another house in Los Angeles so the children can continue their joint therapy with Pitt. Jolie filed her divorce petition after an encounter on a private plane ferrying the family from France to the USA in September. Pitt was accused of being abusive toward his 15-year-old son Maddox during the flight, but investigations by child welfare officials and the FBI were closed with no charges filed against the actor. Brangelina split, Day 2: What we know now California law favors joint custody in the absence of any evidence of abuse, although details about custody arrangements are rarely made public in celebrity divorce cases. Pitt and Jolie were married for two years and together for 12 years after becoming close while filming 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

Former Glenview patrol Officer James Horn was found not guilty of perjury Dec. 7, 2016. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Patrick M. O'Connell Chicago Tribune One of three police officers facing perjury charges was found not guilty by a judge Wednesday. Former Glenview patrol officer James Horn was discharged after defense lawyers argued for a directed verdict in the bench trial at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse. The arguments came after the prosecution rested its case. Horn shook the hand of his lawyer, Dan Herbert, after the judge's decision. Outside the courtroom, he said he was relieved. Two Chicago police officers, Sgt. James Padar and Officer William Pruente, continue to stand trial on perjury, official misconduct and obstruction of justice charges. Judge Matthew Coghlan said there is enough evidence on those charges for the trial to proceed against the Chicago officers. The case centers on testimony the officers made during a 2014 court hearing regarding the arrest of a suspected drug dealer in Glenview. Video of the arrest shown after the officers testified did not line up with the way the men described the incident. But Coghlan said Horn was mostly a bystander during the arrest, and it appeared his testimony was based on a review of one of the Chicago officer's reports. His statements in court that day were vague and showed he did not clearly remember the sequence of what happened, the judge said. Horn was terminated from the Glenview Police Department last year following administrative proceedings, he said. After the verdict, Horn said he hopes the judge's decision restores his reputation. Horn said he was not sure about the next steps in his career. ",

The gunman escaped and was considered extremely dangerous. Minguell Kennedy Lembrick in a photo from a previous arrest. Albany, Georgia, Police Department A $20,000 reward was offered and a massive manhunt involving scores of state and local officers was under way early Wednesday evening for Minguell Kennedy Lembrick, 32. He was described as being 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighing 170 pounds. Authorities say Lembrick fatally shot Americus police Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr and wounded university police Officer Jodi Smith at an apartment complex at about 9:40 a.m. ET near the campus in Americus, which is in Sumter County about halfway between Columbus and Albany. Smarr, 25, was responding to a call for a domestic disturbance when he was shot, police said. Smith, who was providing backup, was flown by medical helicopter to a trauma center in Macon, where he was in critical condition, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Americus police Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr and Georgia Southwestern State University police Officer Jodi Smith. Georgia Bureau of Investigation The university, where students had been streaming out after final exams concluded Tuesday, remained on lockdown Wednesday as officers made a painstaking building-by-building safety check. No students were injured, the university said. Americus Police Chief Mark Scott said it wasn't known whether the gunman was wounded in the exchange of gunfire. He said Lembrick, who has an active warrant on kidnapping and other charges in connection with a previous domestic dispute, is armed and shouldn't be approached. Scott refused to comment on media reports that, shortly after the shooting, a Facebook account was created under the name \"Minguell Gstreet Lembrick,\" which posted a video of a man saying, \"I'm gonna miss y'all folks, man,\" accompanying posts saying he didn't plan to be taken alive. The account, whose authenticity NBC News hasn't verified, was quickly deleted. Thank you to everyone for their thoughts and prayers for our @GaSouthwestern and #Americus police officers. \u2014 Charles Patterson (@GSWPres) December 7, 2016 \"Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families,\" Scott said. \"This is a devastating loss to our family here in Americus. It's just unbelievable.\" State prison records show that Lembrick has several previous convictions, including one in 2003 for false imprisonment. Details of the case, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison, weren't immediately available. State investigators at the scene of a fatal shooting Wednesday morning in Americus, Georgia.

Hobos gang leader Paris Poe's back tattoo that states \"The Earth Is Our Turf\" with \"Hobo\" in the center. (Provided by U.S. attorney) Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Gregory \"Bowlegs\" Chester took the witness stand in a federal courtroom Wednesday and denied he is the leader of a street gang that prosecutors have alleged was responsible for a slew of murders, kidnappings, robberies and other violent crimes in its rise to the top of the city's drug trade. Dressed in a gray suit and maroon tie, Chester, 39, who had a bone disease as a child and still walks with a severe limp, hobbled past the jury box before beginning his testimony in the ongoing racketeering conspiracy trial involving six alleged leaders of the Hobos gang. Chester told his lawyer, Beau Brindley, at the outset of questioning that he sold drugs to survive his upbringing in the Robert Taylor Homes on Chicago's South Side. But he denied ever shooting or robbing anyone or ordering anyone else to do so. \"Are you the leader of a gang they call the Hobos?\" Brindley asked. (Jason Meisner) Chester leaned forward, glanced at the jury and said directly into the microphone, \"No, I am not.\" Later, Chester scoffed at the notion that anyone with a severe disability could be the head of such an allegedly violent enterprise. \"A crippled gang leader?\" he said, with a slight chuckle. \"I mean, no sir.\" Chester's decision to testify in his own defense is a rare and potentially risky move for a criminal defendant in Chicago's federal court, particularly in a racketeering case in which he faces the potential of life in prison without parole if convicted. He's likely to face a grueling cross-examination  Thursday by prosecutors who spent 12 weeks putting on more than 100 witnesses against Chester and his co-defendants and playing dozens of undercover recordings. (Jason Meisner) Prosecutors have alleged the Hobos were responsible for nine killings, including two informants who were cooperating with law enforcement against the gang at the time they were slain. Among other casualties were two gang rivals who had just attended a funeral, a semipro basketball player who was slain in a case of mistaken identity, an innocent bystander from Los Angeles visiting relatives and an elderly woman killed in a car crash as police chased a fleeing Hobo member, according to the charges. In his testimony Wednesday, Chester detailed his life growing up with his mother in the public housing complex, where the Gangster Disciples and other gangs ruled every aspect of life. Chester, who had several unsuccessful surgeries to fix his legs, said his disability precluded him from getting a job, so he was forced to join the Gangster Disciples at age 12 and \"started hustling\" \u2014 or selling drugs \u2014 to get by. \"Only the strong survive in the projects, as people know,\" said Chester, swiveling in his chair at times as he testified. \"They basically prey on the weak.\" (Jason Meisner) He told jurors that while he was in prison for drug offenses in the early 2000s, he met a source for pure heroin who promised to make him a millionaire when he was released \u2014 a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that drug dealers like him \"consider a blessing.\" Chester's chance meeting wound up earning him a fortune, some of which he later reinvested in concert promotions, nightclubs and high-end clothing stores, he said. With so much money coming in, he had no motive to rob drug dealers or commit any of the violence alleged in the indictment, he testified. Chester acknowledged he associated with co-defendants Paris Poe and Arnold Council, who had been friends of his since growing up together at Robert Taylor. But he denied being in a gang with them, saying they kept any criminal activities to themselves. \"It's none of their business what I got going on,\" Chester said. He also testified about his relationship with Keith Daniels, a drug dealer-turned government informant who had helped Chicago police and federal authorities build a drug conspiracy case against Chester, resulting in his arrest in April 2013 at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond. A few days after Chester's arrest, Daniels was fatally shot in an ambush in front of his fiancee and two young children \u2014 a crime prosecutors have linked to Poe. Earlier this week, jurors heard \"beyond-the-grave testimony\" from Daniels \u2014 his testimony to a grand jury \u2014 in which he alleged Chester was the clear leader of the gang who had taken him under his wing to teach him the drug trade. On the witness stand, Chester scrunched up his face and said, \"Never\" when Brindley asked him if what Daniels had alleged was true. Brindley also asked Chester to explain the tattoos on his body, which include the word \"HOBO\" and the phrase \"The Earth is Our Turf.\" Prosecutors have offered the tattoos as evidence of Chester's leadership role in the gang, which they say considered every part of the city its drug \"turf.\" But Chester said the markings are just a tribute to a slain Black Disciples leader who went by the nickname \"Hobo.\" \"That's his name,\" Chester said. \"It's not a gang.\" jmeisner@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Aleppo Rebels, Caught on the Back Foot, Propose Hail Mary Truce in Syria By Lena Masri Dec 7, 2016, 7:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Aleppo Rebels, Caught on the Back Foot, Propose Hail Mary Truce in Syria 0 Shares Email Bodies lie lifeless in the streets of Aleppo\u2019s old city. Rescue workers are unable to pull out the dead fast enough under the unrelenting shelling and bombing by pro-Assad forces on the march. Two weeks into their renewed offensive on eastern Aleppo, Syria, forces backing President Bashar al-Assad have captured close to 75 percent of the territory controlled by opposition armed factions, including the old city. The fall of eastern Aleppo would grant Assad a strategic victory, returning all urban centers in the country to his control. Suffering successive defeats, the rebels today proposed a five-day ceasefire in what many see as their Hail Mary, while a defiant Assad said the United States was \u201cbegging for a truce\u201d seeing the dire straits the opposition factions were now in. \"Forgive me, I am not capable of saying anything. We will lose Aleppo soon,\" Ibrahim Hilal, leader of the White Helmets in the city, a volunteer group of rescue workers, told ABC News. Images of death and devastation abound from eastern Aleppo. While thousands have fled the besieged part of the city over the past two weeks, many remain and continue to endure deafening explosions as well as shortages of the most basic human needs such as food, water, health care and fuel for heating. One photo shows an older man pushing his sick wife in a worn-out wheelchair in a destroyed neighborhood. \u201cHe was looking for a hospital because his wife was very malnourished and there was no food or medicine for her to take,\u201d Yehya Alrejjo, the photographer who took the picture, told ABC News. The only hospital open would take the man five to six hours to reach on foot, the photographer said. So, the man waited, hoping that a car would drive by and pick them up, Alrejjo said. \u201cHe waited and waited for a car. He waited and waited until God took his wife,\u201d Alrejjo said, adding that the man told him that he has seven children and doesn\u2019t know where they are. Yahya Al-Rejo/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Sabah Muhammed, whose 7 children were killed during a bombardment of Assad Regime forces, has died waiting for a doctor on a wheel chair with her husband Ebu Muhammed Halebi in Aleppo, Syria, Dec. 3, 2016. Today, armed Syrian opposition factions proposed an immediate truce to evacuate to the northern countryside some 500 wounded and those civilians who wish to leave eastern Aleppo. \u201cWe are just focusing on securing safe passage for these people now,\u201d said Colonel Abu Bakr of the Jaysh al Mujahideen Islamist rebel group. \u201cWe are not discussing any withdrawal by fighters.\u201d Over the past few weeks, Russia had several meetings in Turkey with representatives of the major armed factions in eastern Aleppo, except for Jabhat Fateh al Sham (JFS) -- formerly the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra -- to negotiate a settlement. The talks were based on what is known as the U.N. four-point plan that suggested an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid deliveries, evacuation of civilians and wounded, as well as the withdrawal of JFS fighters. \u201cThe opposition factions had initially been opposed to the U.N. plan, but they came around to it once the wind turned on the battlefield in recent weeks,\u201d said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who defected. The lack of safety guarantees and concrete support from the international community in the face of the Russian onslaught was also to blame for the dramatic deterioration of the situation in eastern Aleppo, according to Barabandi. The Syrian government rejected the U.N. proposal early on, maintaining that any truce would only be used by the armed factions, which it considers to be terrorists, to regroup. Negotiations in Turkey petered out when Russia suddenly demanded the withdrawal of all armed factions, not just JFS. \u201cThe Russians are not trustworthy. They are just stalling to finish the job militarily on the ground,\u201d Abu Bakr said in Arabic. \u201cThey keep moving the goal post. Their demands never end.\u201d Six Western nations -- the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom -- have also called for an immediate ceasefire and denounced the actions in Aleppo of the Syrian government and its Russian backers. \u201cA humanitarian disaster is taking place before our very eyes,\u201d a joint statement read. \u201cHospitals and schools have not been spared. Rather, they appear to be the targets of attack in an attempt to wear people down. The images of dying children are heartbreaking. We condemn the actions of the Syrian regime and its foreign backers, especially Russia, for their obstruction of humanitarian aid, and strongly condemn the Syrian regime's attacks that have devastated civilians and medical facilities and use of barrel bombs and chemical weapons.\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry met tonight in Hamburg, Germany, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov . They discussed ongoing multilateral efforts to achieve a cessation of hostilities in Aleppo, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid to the tens of thousands of Syrian civilians in desperate need there, according to Assistant Secretary and State Department spokesman John Kirby. Russian officials have been meeting with representatives of the Syrian rebel factions in Ankara to discuss a solution, two sources close to the negotiations told ABC News. The parties are discussing a deal based on a U.N. proposal that would grant rebel fighters a safe passage out of east Aleppo and leave in place an opposition local council to run the eastern side of the city, effectively keeping it under opposition control. There have been at least 10 meetings between Russia and rebels so far, the sources said. At this stage, the different armed factions are still weighing whether to take the deal. It remains unclear how Russia would convince its partners, Iran, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, to agree to the deal. When the Syrian government started its latest offensive on east Aleppo it was the largest remaining opposition stronghold -- retaking it in its entirety is a strategic goal for President Assad. Among the rebels that Russia has been meeting with are the Free Syrian Army and the Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham, Noureddine Zenki and Jaysh al Mujahideen. A commander of the latter group told ABC News that the rebels have rejected the Russian proposal to withdraw completely from eastern Aleppo. A diplomat told ABC News that the Russian strategy is to empty east Aleppo of civilians to be free to bomb the rebel forces. This last-minute proposal might open the opposition factions up to slaughter, according to a Western diplomat who is involved in the Syrian negotiations who said he was surprised by the move. \u201cThe Russian tactic has, since August, been to empty eastern Aleppo from its civilians and hence have carte blanche to carpet bomb the opposition armed factions whom they consider to all be terrorists,\" the diplomat, who didn\u2019t want to be named because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the press, told ABC News. Russia\u2019s foreign minister has already said that rebels who stay in the area will be considered terrorists. \"We will treat them as such, as terrorists, as extremists, and will support a Syrian army operation against those criminal squads,\" Lavrov said during a news conference on Monday. Some 200,000 civilians are estimated to still be trapped in east Aleppo. According to the U.N.\u2019s latest estimates, around 31,500 have been displaced in Aleppo in recent days, about half of them children -- The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that as many as 80,000 have fled their homes. \u201cThis is what\u2019s happening in my city, in Aleppo,\u201d said resident Yasser Hmeish, via voice recording. \u201cI\u2019m in a hospital. ... I left my family and my wife in my neighborhood this morning. Now I can\u2019t go there because this neighborhood was taken by the regime. I don\u2019t know anything about them -- if they are alive or killed. There is no internet service there.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Jessica Hill/AP hide caption toggle caption Jessica Hill/AP Linda McMahon, who twice ran for U.S. Senate in Connecticut, is Donald Trump's nominee to head the Small Business Administration. Jessica Hill/AP This post was updated at 5:12 p.m. ET Linda McMahon, the co-founder of the pro-wrestling enterprise World Wrestling Entertainment, was selected Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump to head the Small Business Administration. In a statement released by the Trump transition team, Trump called McMahon \"one of the country's top female executives\" and said she would help push his \"America First\" agenda forward. He added: \"She helped grow WWE from a modest 13-person operation to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees in offices worldwide. Linda is going to be a phenomenal leader and champion for small businesses and unleash America's entrepreneurial spirit all across the country.\" McMahon never has held elective office; the Connecticut Republican ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010 and 2012, but lost in the general election both times. McMahon spent about $100 million of her own fortune on the campaigns \u2014 about double what Trump spent on his presidential run. As The Washington Post reported in October, McMahon was one of Trump's \"biggest outside benefactors\" \u2014 though she has not held back from slamming him on his derogatory comments toward women. In an interview with Yahoo News , McMahon said she had faith in Trump's ability to run the country, but that his past comments were \"objectionable.\" \" 'Those [comments] were just over the top; they were deplorable, objectionable absolutely,' McMahon said. 'He's not helping, certainly, to put women in the best light. Maybe he regrets them, maybe he doesn't. I realize he punches hard when he punches back, but that's just over the top. I wish that no candidate would make those comments.' \" Article continues after sponsorship McMahon now would run Trump's SBA, which helps with training and financial backing for small firms. The Small Business Administration is a Cabinet-level position, which means McMahon will have to be confirmed by the Senate. ",

Federal laws and rules requiring mental health parity have been adopted with bipartisan support over the last 20 years, but a White House task force found recently that compliance was lagging. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get everything we needed,\u2019\u201d said Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the architect of provisions to improve the treatment of mental illness, \u201cbut we needed everything we got.\u201d Major provisions of the bill push the Food and Drug Administration to speed the review and approval of drugs and medical devices. Kim Monk of Capital Alpha Partners, a policy research firm for investors, described the bill as \u201ca holiday win for much of the health sector.\u201d Scott Whitaker, president and chief executive of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group for device makers, hailed the bill for creating \u201can expedited pathway for breakthrough medical technologies \u2013 those that offer the best hope for patients with life-threatening diseases\u201d and few treatment options. In reviewing new devices, the bill says, the F.D.A. shall consider the \u201cleast burdensome\u201d means of showing their safety. In considering whether to approve new drugs or new uses for medications, the bill says, the F.D.A. shall pay more attention to \u201cpatient experience data\u201d showing the impact of a disease or treatment on patients\u2019 lives, and their treatment preferences. The legislation does not include provisions to to rein in prescription drug prices, a significant victory for the pharmaceutical industry. Consultants to the industry said that drug makers had kept a low profile in their lobbying on the legislation, knowing that any conversations on Capitol Hill could turn quickly to drug prices. \u201cWhen the cost of our prescription drugs is skyrocketing, this bill does nothing to combat excessive prices,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on health and human services. She who voted against the measure. \u201cWhile the bill authorizes $4.8 billion to the N.I.H. over the next 10 years \u2014 on average, a mere $480 million a year \u2014 this is barely a quarter per year of what the House passed last year,\u201d Ms. DeLauro said. \u201cThere is also no guarantee that the appropriators will follow through and provide funding each year.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, who voted for the bill, said she too wished that more of the money had been guaranteed. \u201cMedical research in America today should not be subject to the whims of congressional budget battles or political fights,\u201d she said.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 7, 2016 6:20 PM EST WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is adding former wrestling executive Linda McMahon to his cabinet as leader of the Small Business Administration. McMahon and her husband, Vince, founded and built World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ), now a publicly traded sports entertainment company. She stepped down as the WWE chief executive officer in 2009 and in recent years began a start-up to encourage more women business owners. She also poured $100 million of her fortune into two unsuccessful bids for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut and has become an influential Republican donor. \u201cLinda is going to be a phenomenal leader and champion for small businesses and unleash America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit all across the country,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement Wednesday. Mr. Trump said she shares his vision of decreasing \u201cburdensome regulations that are hurting our middle-class workers and small businesses.\u201d \u201cAs an entrepreneur myself, I have shared the experiences of our nation\u2019s small business owners and will do my best to advocate on their behalf,\u201d McMahon said in a statement. \u201cMy husband and I built our business from scratch, building it to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees.\u201d McMahon has known Mr. Trump for three decades and contributed $5 million to his family charity, almost all of it in 2007. Mr. Trump has participated in WWE events, including a 2007 \u201cBattle of the Billionaires,\u201d during which he shaved Vince McMahon\u2019s head. Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t Linda McMahon\u2019s first choice for president. She first backed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. But McMahon told the Associated Press in September that she was confident Mr. Trump would be a good president and said the two were on good terms. \u201cOnce you\u2019re his friend, he is loyal to the end,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredibly loyal, loyal friend.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: T-Mobile) T-Mobile wants to \"free\" the phone number, and on Wednesday it came out with a new way to do so. As part of a new feature called Digits, T-Mobile will allow customers to make calls or texts anywhere you have a device with an Internet connection, allowing you to make phone calls with an iPad or send texts from a laptop. Recipients of the calls and texts will see your normal phone number, and when they call or text that number it will be available on any of your devices. T-Mobile's effort is similar to apps like Google Voice, Skype and Viber, which allow you to create phone numbers that work across devices. The most notable difference here is that T-Mobile\u00a0uses your actual cell phone number as opposed to a secondary number. For an extra cost,\u00a0T-Mobile will allow you to get extra lines if you want additional phone numbers. The feature is\u00a0available Wednesday to testers as a free beta before a more widespread launch early next yea. An app will be available for iOS and Android devices while those on a computer can access it through their web browsers. The carrier is working to make it available on Internet-connected wearables such as Samsung's Gear S3 smartwatch as well as\u00a0older, non-smartphone devices like a flip phone. Users can select which devices\u00a0they want to push calls and texts to through the company's website or the T-Mobile app. And since the feature only requires an Internet connection, even if the app is installed on a Verizon or AT&T phone you'll be able to make phone calls as if you were on your T-Mobile-connected phone. T-Mobile says the service will also work internationally, allowing you to make free calls while abroad over data using your phone number (you can switch this feature off if you don't want to\u00a0use the data network). T-Mobile already offers free data and texting while traveling to over 140 countries, but until now calls using your T-Mobile phone number cost extra. The goal of the program\u00a0is to allow you to access your phone even when it's not with you. \"A lot of people wonder, 'it's 2016, why is my phone number limited to one phone, when something like email I can access from any device? My social media I can access from any device,'\" Mike Seivert, T-Mobile's chief operating officer, tells USA TODAY. \"What Digits does\u00a0is it really breaks down this century-long limitation of one phone number per device and one device per phone number.\" The company is also hoping to appeal to businesses. As opposed to issuing separate work and personal phones, with Digits companies can now allow employees to store multiple phone numbers on one device. A single phone number can also be set to ring multiple phone numbers at once, letting a company create a central line that could be answered by multiple users. No pricing or firm timing for the widespread launch was given. To take part in the beta, interested users will\u00a0need an iOS device with iOS 9.0 (or later) or an Android device with Android 5.0 (or later), plus a postpaid T-Mobile account. iPhone users, however, should take note: right now the feature won't work with iMessage, and if you're going to want to take part in the beta you'll have to turn it off. T-Mobile says it hopes to work with iMessage in the future.

    "text": "Photos by Erin Hull Published on December 7, 2016 The boys in the YouTube videos always land their bottles perfectly upright. Max Cole has spent hours studying their routine, and now, his own viewers are waiting: Empty half the blue juice. Hold the Powerade bottle by its cap. Flip it into the air and\u2013 \u201cDude!\u201d Max shouts. \u201cIt landed!\u201d Max, who is 6, waves his arms. He knows just how to overreact to get his audience excited, what makes them click \u201cthumbs up\u201d and comment and subscribe. He jumps. He wiggles his hips. He does the dab, a dance move that looks like he\u2019s sneezing into his elbow. \u201cOh, my gosh!\u201d he yells. \u201cThat is insane!\u201d But no one is watching. Max\u2019s family is used to hearing him pretend that strangers on the Internet can see him. In the six years he\u2019s been growing up, YouTube has become the largest platform for children\u2019s entertainment on Earth. Today\u2019s kids have little interest in the well-groomed child actors that past generations saw on TV. They want to watch each other. Videos of kids simply acting like kids attract millions of viewers, sometimes billions. Every moment of childhood \u2014 getting new toys, tagging along to the grocery store, making up games in their back yards \u2014 is material that can be recorded and uploaded. So is it any wonder that the children who watch these videos begin to act as if their entire lives are being recorded, too? Max Cole, 6, flips bottles in the backyard of his Texas home. On YouTube, trends like bottle-flipping spread quickly among kids of all ages and locations and attract millions of views. For the youngest members of the next generation, sometimes called Generation Z , the distinction\u00a0between the online world and real life is fading. Parents are having to explain to their toddlers that the children whose whole lives they see on the screen aren\u2019t actually their friends. They\u2019re finding their kids methodically \u201cunboxing\u201d their toys, as if they\u2019ve been paid to review them for an audience. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d a parent will ask. \u201cThe viewers,\u201d their children reply. \u201cFor them it\u2019s just normal,\u201d Max\u2019s mom, Shona Cole, says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t even make sense to him not to film.\u201d Because cameras are all around Max and children of his age. The Coles have six kids, two dogs, three cats and 18 screens, nearly all with \u201crecord\u201d buttons. Max\u2019s little brother Mark Adam, who is 3, knows how to start recording on an iPad. Their 10-year-old sister Annie films herself having sleepovers, shopping at Target and going to Chick-fil-A. \u201cHey guys!\u201d Annie says, holding out the lens to face herself. \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock, it\u2019s dinner time so, yeah, I\u2019m so excited, I love Chick-fil-A.\u201d She posts the videos, with her mother\u2019s supervision, to her YouTube channel, \u201cAnnie\u2019s Vlogs.\u201d They appear alongside videos from hundreds of other girls who vlog their lives, too. More than 36,000 people will watch Annie in the back seat of her mother\u2019s SUV, going through the Chick-fil-A drive-through near her house north of Houston. In the world of YouTube, that\u2019s not very many. Annie and her younger brothers never knew the time before the Internet, when kids were taught not to talk to strangers. Now, they want to share their lives with as many strangers as they can. Annie turns the camera toward Max and Mark Adam. \u201cSay hi,\u201d she instructs. \u201cHiiiii,\u201d they say, waving their little hands at people they\u2019ll never meet. Annie Cole (left) shows her family a YouTube video. The Coles don\u2019t have cable; all of their children prefer to watch YouTube, which has become the world\u2019s largest platform for children\u2019s entertainment. The first video on YouTube was uploaded in 2005, four years before Max Cole was born. The site\u2019s co-founder stands in front of two elephants at the zoo, telling the camera how they have \u201creally, really, really long trunks, and that\u2019s cool.\u201d It was a completely unremarkable 18 seconds \u2013 and a foreshadowing of the cultural force to come. Mark Adam adores watching other little boys who do nothing but open eggs with plastic toys inside. Max would rather watch another kid play Minecraft than play it himself. Annie doesn\u2019t aspire to meet celebrities but the girls who get millions of views for braiding hair. Kids have always learned by mimicking their peers. Now, the children watching YouTube are seeing role models who don\u2019t just play \u2014 they perform. They\u2019re not just experiencing childhood, but constantly considering how their experiences will be perceived by an audience. [ Instagram, Wattpad and YouNow aren\u2019t just apps \u2014 for many teens, they\u2019re more than that. ] Which is why, on Halloween, Annie is skipping down the sidewalk of a suburban neighborhood, being filmed by her mother, aware that thousands of children will soon be watching her trick-or-treat. Her pink fairy wings bob as she looks back at the camera with a candy-filled pillowcase swinging at her side. \u201cGet us walking toward you,\u201d she tells her mom, pausing near a streetlight so she can be captured next to her best friend, Hope Nixon, as they stride toward the camera. \u201cI got it,\u201d Shona assures the girls as she tries to balance a Sony A5000 camera on a broken tripod and keep track of 3-year-old Mark Adam, who keeps running to follow the older kids. He\u2019s wearing a padded Wolverine costume that makes his skinny arms look like ripped biceps. Max is Captain America and his best friend, Noah Nixon, is a zombie. The Coles and the Nixons, who have seven kids, have been inseparable since they met 12 years ago at a small Baptist church. \u201cI\u2019m already almost to the top with candy!\u201d Hope says to her own camera, which has a flip screen so she can see herself while she films. She and Annie have spent the evening trying to angle their lenses just right, so their costumes can still be seen in the darkness. Annie presses record and sets the camera at the bottom of her pillowcase. She closes it, opens it, and drops a piece of candy in. \u201cHey, guys!\u201d she says to the audience inside the bag. A moment later, she squeals and points to a front door in the distance. \u201cOoh, Mom, there!\u201d she says. Her excitement isn\u2019t for the prospect of more sour Warhead candies. The house has a porch lamp that floods the driveway with light. This time, it won\u2019t be too dark for her entire walk to the door to be captured on film. Hope Nixon and Annie Cole take an online personality quiz. The 10-year-old best friends are the stars of 'JazzyGirlStuff,' a YouTube channel they started last year. It was Hope who first showed Annie the videos of \u201cchallenges\u201d and DIY activities girls their age were doing on YouTube. Could they put five Warheads in their mouths? Could they make their own green slime? Annie and Hope couldn\u2019t just try the activities, they explained to their moms, they needed to film them. Shona and Nikki Nixon, Hope\u2019s mother, were wary. Both had home-schooled their children in an effort to have more control over how they were brought up. Putting their daughters on the Internet would expose them to commenters, and could provoke anxieties about how many page views they were getting and how they looked on camera. [ 13 right now: This is what it\u2019s like to grow up in the age of likes, lols and longing ] But they were \u201csay yes\u201d parents, who filled their houses with books and art supplies and opportunities to try new things. They always encouraged their kids to follow their whims, especially the creative ones. \u201cWhen Matthew wanted to do competitive juggling, we took him to juggling,\u201d Shona explains. \u201cThe girls want to do dance, I drive them to dance. What Annie wants is to do YouTube, and we had to support that.\u201d They could use YouTube as a chance for their kids to learn how to stick to a schedule. Their childhood memories would be captured forever. And if Shona and Nikki followed the plans they found in online courses about \u201cthe business of YouTube,\u201d their daughters could even make money from the advertisements that played before the videos. Top: Shona Cole, left, films Annie and Hope doing a 'challenge' video for their shared YouTube channel. The plan, shoot and edit a video each week, on top of creating videos for their individual vlogs. Bottom left: Annie films for her YouTube channels, where she is watched by tens of thousands of girls. Bottom right: Mark Adam does 'the dab' while his brother dances behind him. YouTube has accelerated the pace at which trends like the dab spread from hip-hop culture to something even toddlers know. The positives seemed to outweigh the negatives, though they couldn\u2019t be sure exactly what the negatives might be. The phenomenon hadn\u2019t been around for long enough to know how it affects children long term. So Shona and her husband Mark taped a sign on the family fridge that read, Before Screens: ",

Wildfires That Killed 14 0 Shares Email Authorities on Wednesday charged two juveniles in an East Tennessee wildfire that killed 14 people and destroyed or damaged more than 1,700 buildings in an iconic tourism spot at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains. Officials offered few other specifics about how they think the two started a fire that leveled buildings into charred scraps, carving a deadly path through the Gatlinburg area. People scrambled in terror to try to flee on foot or drive out of the inferno that often cloaked them from all sides, shooting hot embers through the winds. Some spent days hoping for good news about their missing loved ones. Many learned they would soon be planning funerals. The juveniles face aggravated arson charges in the fire in the Chimney Tops area of Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Nov. 23. That fire grew amid drought conditions and ultimately rode winds exceeding 87 miles per hour into the Gatlinburg area early last week. Authorities have not yet announced a dollar amount on the damaged caused by the wildfire. The two are being held in the Sevier County juvenile detention center. \"Our promise is that we will do every effort to help bring closure to those who have lost so much,\" said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn. The juveniles are from Tennessee, but not Sevier County, where the fires spread. Otherwise, officials said state law prevents releasing more information about them. Karyssa Dalton, a 19-year-old whose grandmother Pamela Johnson remains missing in the blaze, said the two should be held accountable, even though they're young. \"I mean, what if somebody came through their town, and set their town on fire, and lost their loved ones, and lost all their homes?\" Dalton said. \"It's not fair.\" Great Smoky Mountains National Park Chief Ranger Steve Kloster said the public was \"critical\" in offering investigators information through a tip line. Previously, the National Park Service said it believed the fire was human caused, and set up a tip line for people to call if they hiked that trail on Nov. 23, or knew anyone who did. The investigation is ongoing and more charges could come. It's also possible that the case could be transferred to an adult criminal court, Dunn said. The juveniles are entitled to a detention hearing within 72 hours in which a juvenile court judge will decide to hold them without bond, hold them with bond, or release them, Dunn said. Dunn constantly said everything was \"part of the investigation\" when asked for details. Asked if others could be charged in the fire, Dunn repeated that \"everything's on the table.\" \"We don't know,\" he said. On Wednesday, Gatlinburg residents and business owners were allowed to move back into homes and establishments permanently. They had been allowed to visit during daytime hours since last Friday. The city is slated to open to the public on Friday morning. Though swaths of the city were decimated, the main downtown strip appears to have been spared. 0 Shares ",

The inferno started on the ground floor and sent smoke pouring up two staircases, trapping the party-goers, who were overcome before they could get out, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms said at a briefing on the massive investigation. Because neither staircase led to an exit, they had no escape route. Authorities also said there were no fire alarms or sprinklers in the building, which was zoned as a warehouse but was being used as living space. An exact cause of the inferno that killed 36 people has not been determined. Investigators are looking at a refrigerator, but also other possible culprits. \"We are looking for every possible source of ignition,\" said Jill Snyder, special agent in charge of the ATF's San Francisco Field Division. She said there is no evidence of arson. A crane is used to lift wreckage as part of search efforts in a fire-ravaged warehouse on December 05, 2016 in Oakland, California. JOSH EDELSON / AFP - Getty Images The 10,000-square-foot building did not have a permit for residential use, but the owners leased it to the founder of an artists' collective who lived there with his family and rented out space to other people. Former residents and visitors describe the structure as a warren of studios and living areas. One staircase was fashioned out of wooden pallets, and electrical and heating systems were improvised. City records show complaints about an illegal structure on the site were lodged just two weeks before the fire but inspectors wrote in their report that a chain-link fence around the property stopped them from gaining access. Video obtained by NBC News shows police inside the building in October, raising questions about whether the city knew people were living in the warehouse and were aware of safety issues.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Donald J. Trump toured the Carrier plant in Indianapolis last week after announcing a deal that will retain some jobs that Carrier had planned to move to Mexico. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump made many sweeping promises on his way to victory on Election Day. After he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, here are five of the most difficult and five of the easiest promises to keep: THE DIFFICULT ONES Prevent American companies from moving jobs to other countries. Companies move to other countries to pursue higher profits, and Mr. Trump cannot force them to stay. The question is whether he can make it profitable to do so. It is difficult because labor is much cheaper in other countries. Carrier pays workers at its Indiana factory an average hourly wage of $23 \u2014 roughly four times what it plans to pay workers with the same jobs in Mexico. Mr. Trump has promised tax cuts and regulatory relief, but those are minor expenses for most companies, particularly in comparison to their payrolls. Mr. Trump also has threatened to impose new taxes on imports, but he cannot target particular companies. Any such tariffs would have to be broad \u2014 and therefore broadly painful. ___ Revive American steel-making and coal-mining industries. The productivity of the American coal industry has increased roughly tenfold since the end of World War II. The work that once required 10 miners now requires just one. Steel making has undergone a similar transformation. That is by far the most important reason employment in both industries has declined precipitously. Most of those jobs are never coming back. Demand for coal has also declined thanks to a revolution in the production of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, other alternative energy sources. This, too, is a development that Mr. Trump lacks the power to reverse. ___ Increase American economic growth to more than 4 percent a year. There are only two ways to increase economic growth: Increase the number of workers, or increase productivity, the amount the average worker produces. The news is not good on either front. The growth of the American work force is slowing as baby boomers retire and families have fewer children. And Mr. Trump has promised new restrictions on immigration, limiting another source of workers. At the same time, productivity has increased over the last decade at an average annual pace of just 1.3 percent \u2014 and there is little evidence that faster growth is in the offing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The result is that annual economic growth has averaged 2.1 percent in the six full years since the last recession, and is on a similar trajectory this year. There are few obvious means for Mr. Trump to deliver on his promise. ___ Invest in infrastructure to create jobs. Mr. Trump will find bipartisan support in Congress for his proposal to create jobs and stimulate the economy by building and repairing highways, bridges, water systems and other public works. But many Republicans may balk at a big spending program that adds to the federal budget deficit. Some Democrats will resist Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to offer tax breaks to private companies in return for infrastructure investments, notably because the federal government is able to borrow money at exceptionally low rates. Democrats are also likely to resist efforts to waive environmental rules or prevailing-wage protections for construction projects. ___ Build a border wall. Mr. Trump promised to \u201cbuild a great, great wall on our southern border\u201d and \u201chave Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d Fulfilling this promise would be difficult, though perhaps not impossible if Mr. Trump stretches the definition of \u201cwall.\u201d Fences already exist along hundreds of miles of the border. Mexico has said it will not pay for a wall. And even if it did, Mr. Trump would probably need approval from Congress to spend money. Mr. Trump could do much to beef up border security on his own. Congress would support increased border security and the installation of more fencing, but construction of a wall would meet resistance from both parties. ___ THE EASIER ONES Withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Trump pledged that on his first day in office he would give notice that the United States intends to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a trade agreement the Obama administration negotiated with other Pacific Rim nations that is awaiting ratification. Though Mr. Trump has the authority to carry out this promise, other participants, including Japan and Australia, have expressed hope that he will reconsider. If not, they may pursue regional trade deals that exclude the United States. ___ End the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The program, which President Obama announced to protect undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors, was created by presidential fiat and it can be ended just as easily. Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to do so. He has not said whether he will deprive current participants of protection, or simply prevent new enrollments. Advertisement ___ Allow the Keystone XL pipeline to move forward. Pipelines that run between the United States and Canada must obtain presidential approval. In November 2015, President Obama refused to grant permission to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from the tar sands of Canada to the southern edge of Nebraska, where it would connect to existing pipelines. Mr. Trump has encouraged the company behind the project, TransCanada, to submit a new application once he takes office. He also has suggested, however, that TransCanada should share its profits with taxpayers. ___ Nominate a Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump says that in his first 100 days , he will begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from his list of 21 judges \u201cwho will uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution.\u201d This promise will be easy to keep. Just winnowing the names of court candidates could qualify as beginning the process of replacing Justice Antonin Scalia , who died in February. ___ Reduce federal business and personal taxes. Mr. Trump has promised to reduce federal taxation of businesses and households. Congressional Republicans have expressed support for a broadly similar approach. The details have derailed past efforts to overhaul the tax code, but Republican control of both Congress and the White House increases the chances that Mr. Trump will succeed. ",

    "text": "North Carolina Governor Signs Executive Order in Response to Criticism of 'Anti-LGBT' House Bill 2 Cooper\u2019s Hands May Be Tied Republicans still hold a majority in the state's General Assembly after this November\u2019s election, and they are unlikely to introduce legislation to repeal it, said Bill Marshall, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. \"I think the voters sent a pretty clear message in North Carolina that they were dissatisfied with HB2, but we have yet to see if the legislature will understand what the votes of this past election mean,\" Marshall told ABC News in an interview last month. \u201cThey certainly haven\u2019t shown any sign that they are willing to do this thus far,\u201d University of North Carolina law professor Maxine Eichner said in an interview with ABC News. Shannon Gilreath, a professor of law at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed. \"Even though Cooper has been a vocal opponent of this law, its repeal still requires the Republican-dominated legislature to acquiesce,\" Gilreath told ABC News in an interview last month. The governor, he added, \u201cdoes not have the power to override the legislative process.\" Cooper\u2019s Options A repeal proposal seems unlikely unless \"Cooper is able to put enough pressure on the legislature,\" according to Gilreath. Cooper \"could try to appeal to the public by talking about how much HB2 has cost the state,\" he said. \"We've lost millions of dollars in potential revenue because of business we've lost over the bill.\" Before McCrory took office, the city of Wilmington had a $170 million film industry, The Associated Press reported. But the elimination of state tax incentives for film projects and the entertainment industry's backlash against HB2 have cut that to about $60 million this year, Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission, told the AP. \u201cI expect there are ways that Governor-elect Cooper could use political appointments and other executive orders to send a message more welcoming to the LGBT community, but he can\u2019t do that in a way that violates HB2,\u201d Eichner said. Where Does Trump Stand? On Election Day, North Carolina voted for Donald Trump. When Trump was campaigning for president, he initially voiced his opposition to the \u201cbathroom\u201d bill in an interview with NBC , pointing to the \u201ceconomic punishment\u201d the state has faced for implementing the bill. McCrory signed the bill in March. \"Leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go. They use the bathroom they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble,\u201d Trump said on NBC's \"Today\" show in April. But in an interview with The News & Observer in July, Trump said he spoke with McCrory and he was \u201cgoing with the state.\u201d \u201cThe state, they know what\u2019s going on, they see what\u2019s happening, and generally speaking I\u2019m with the state on things like this. I\u2019ve spoken with your governor, I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of different people, and I\u2019m going with the state,\u201d Trump said at the time. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "In diverse California, a young white supremacist seeks to convert fellow college students A voice from the alt-right at Cal State Stanislaus Nathan Damigo, a former Marine corporal and the founder of a white nationalist organization,\u00a0is an increasingly sought-after voice in the so-called alt-right movement. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Nathan Damigo, a former Marine corporal and the founder of a white nationalist organization,\u00a0is an increasingly sought-after voice in the so-called alt-right movement. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Hailey Branson-Potts Contact Reporter Nathan Damigo brought his message of white separatism to an unusual place: an ethnic studies class at Cal State Stanislaus called Searching for America. Speaking to a crowd filled with black and Latino students, he wove a country song tale of whites\u00a0becoming an endangered minority in America and compared their plight to Native Americans \u2014\u00a0before describing\u00a0his fantasy for a utopian homeland for whites not unlike Indian reservations. \u201cEven though horrible things did happen to the indigenous people \u2026\u00a0there was land set aside where they could be who they were and express themselves how they wanted to, and they could have a form of government that reflected them,\u201d Damigo said. \u201cAnd I think that is something that we want.\u201d The comparison elicited aghast stares from the crowd late last month. It was a reminder that Damigo, a 30-year-old Cal State Stanislaus student, was far from\u00a0the like-minded white men he had just spent the weekend with in Washington\u00a0during a gathering where some stretched out their arms in Nazi salutes. Damigo, a former Marine corporal and the founder of a white nationalist organization,\u00a0is an increasingly sought-after voice in the so-called alt-right movement. Some experts who study extremism say he is emblematic of the young, web-savvy racists who are trying to intellectualize and mainstream bigotry. Damigo and others like him\u00a0have set their sights in particular on college campuses, eager to take on hostile audience in hopes of getting their\u00a0message across.\u00a0 Nathan Damigo In the ethnic studies class,\u00a0Damigo told students\u00a0that immigration and diversity were\u00a0destroying the country and that no place heralded the decline of whites' fortunes in America like his home state of California. \u201cCalifornia was never white,\u201d Jonathan Grammatico, a white 25-year-old social work student, shot back at Damigo at one point.\u00a0\u201cIt belonged to indigenous people and then to Mexicans.\u201d\u00a0 Damigo\u2019s address\u00a0came courtesy of Fela Uhuru, an ethnic studies instructor who identifies as Asian, black and Native American and has the African continent tattooed on his arm. He said he wanted his students to have a frank dialogue about race and identity with someone whose presence on campus has stirred controversy. Damigo has been on an emotional high since Donald Trump won the presidency.\u00a0 The day after the billionaire\u2019s victory, Damigo propped his cellphone up in his car, turned on the Periscope app and started talking. \u201cWe as the alt-right are the reason why Trump won,\u201d he said, laughing.\u00a0He then held up a bullhorn and described how, as he drove home from celebrating with friends in Folsom, he had shouted at people who were presumably not white: \u201cYou have to go back!\u201d The loosely defined\u00a0alt-right, a white nationalist movement,\u00a0has been emboldened by Trump\u00a0and his rhetoric about Mexicans and Muslims, his sharing of white supremacists\u2019 tweets and his appointment of Stephen K. Bannon \u2014\u00a0the outgoing executive chairman of Breitbart News, a\u00a0purveyor\u00a0of alt-right ideology \u2014\u00a0as his chief strategist. Despite California\u2019s contemporary liberal politics and\u00a0celebrated diversity, California has a well-established history of racism and racially polarizing efforts. For decades, the Golden State has been\u00a0home to the largest racist skinhead population in the country, primarily concentrated in diverse Southern California, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The state\u2019s history books are filled with cruel treatment of ethnic minority groups, ranging from the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II to exploitative treatment of laborers from Latin America and elsewhere. Just two decades ago, California voters approved a proposition\u00a0that would have stripped people in the country illegally of many public benefits. California today is considered one of the most liberal and diverse states in the union, adopting strong protections and services for those here illegally. Still, earlier this year, a Ku Klux Klan rally in Anaheim and a neo-Nazi event outside the state Capitol erupted in violence. Bakersfield last year was the site of Camp Comradery,\u00a0a national gathering that featured a unique collaboration between so-called \u201cintellectual racists\u201d and racist skinheads, said Joanna Mendelson, an investigative researcher with the California branch of the Anti-Defamation League. \u00a0 The state has just radically changed. If you\u2019re white and you live here, it\u2019s like being in a foreign country. \u2014 Nathan Damigo \u201cOften, in areas that have undergone enormous demographic shifts, some of these racist and bigoted voices emerge as people feel threatened,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cThey feel that they are fighting against a rising tide of color that\u2019s threatening their future existence.\u201d In a Periscope video the week of Trump\u2019s election, Damigo fantasized about \u201cCalexit,\u201d the proposed secession of California.\u00a0 \u201cThe remaining few of us who are white would white-flight ourselves out of here and join you guys in the rest of the country, and we could do our own thing and California could just pretty much devolve into cannibalism,\u201d he said, snickering.\u00a0 He mentioned his hometown of San Jose, which, he said, looked much\u00a0different than when his grandparents moved there decades ago. \u201cThe state has just radically changed,\u201d Damigo said. \u201cIf you\u2019re white and you live here, it\u2019s like being in a foreign country.\u201d He grew up in the Silicon Valley and attended a private Baptist\u00a0school that, he said, was racially diverse. He never had any bad experiences with his nonwhite classmates. Still, he said, even as a child he believed there were \u201cdouble standards\u201d about race and who was allowed to talk about and celebrate it. He\u2019d go to his Filipino friends\u2019 birthday parties, only to long for the kind of shared culture they had. Damigo joined the Marines in 2004, at age 18, and did\u00a0two tours in Iraq. There, he said, he saw firsthand the conflicts between the country\u2019s ethnic and religious groups.\u00a0 \u201cI said, \u2018This is dumb. Why don\u2019t \u2026\u00a0each one of them have their own country and they can all express themselves and .. they\u2019re not, you know, fighting with each other,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Damigo lost a few friends to the war, and came back in bad shape. After his first tour, he tried to commit suicide, but a friend intervened, according to San Diego County court records. In November 2007, he had been home for a month after his second tour of duty\u00a0and was suffering from\u00a0severe post-traumatic stress disorder, drug and alcohol abuse, paranoia and flashbacks, court records show. A few days after the anniversary of a friend\u2019s combat death, he spent a night drinking and went for a walk with a gun he\u2019d gotten two days before as a gift. He came across a La Mesa cab driver who he thought was Iraqi, put a gun to his head and robbed the man of $43, records show.\u00a0 ",

The Majority have spoken \u2013 by nearly 2.7 million votes &counting! Silence is not an option,\u201d Moore tweeted Wednesday. The liberal filmmaker shared a link to the website for DisruptJ20, a campaign for \"a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017.\" Disrupt the Inauguration. The Majority have spoken - by nearly 2.7 million votes &counting! Silence is not an option https://t.co/HSmP3pREvy \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) December 7, 2016 The website states, \"We call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupting the ceremonies. If Trump is to be inaugurated at all, let it happen behind closed doors, showing the true face of the security state Trump will preside over. It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule.\" DisruptJ20 is planning D.C.-based protests on the day of Trump's inauguration, but also asks people to protest on \"the streets wherever you are.\" The social justice organization also calls for worldwide action. \"If you are living outside the US, you can take action at US embassies, borders, or other symbols of neocolonial power. Our allegiance is not to 'making America great again,' but to all of humanity and the planet. #DisruptJ20.\" Advertisement ",

It was a rare demonstration of unity in a Congress badly split by politics and usually determined to thwart any initiatives coming out the White House. But the $6.3 billion legislation easily passed the Senate in a vote of 94-5. The measure pays for some of Obama's pet projects, including the Cancer Moonshot that Vice President Joe Biden leads. \"This bill will make a big difference, and I look forward to signing it as soon as it reaches my desk,\" Obama said in a statement. The 21st Century Cures Act has been two years in the making and it was one of the most heavily lobbied pieces of legislation in recent history. It pays for cancer research, pays to fight the epidemic of opioid abuse, funds mental health treatment, helps the Food and Drug Administration to speed up drug approvals and pushes better use of technology in medicine. Related: Some Win, Some Lose From Medical Funding Bill \"We are now one step closer to ending cancer as we know it, unlocking cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, and helping people seeking treatment for opioid addiction finally get the help they need,\" Obama said. \"We are now one step closer to ending cancer as we know it, unlocking cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, and helping people seeking treatment for opioid addiction finally get the help they need.\" \"Third, it invests nearly $3 billion to build upon the major biomedical research initiatives we have launched in my administration - known as the BRAIN and Precision Medicine Initiatives - which are tackling diseases like Alzheimer's and creating new research models to find cures and better target treatments,\" Obama said. The praise came pouring quickly from industry and medical societies more accustomed to seeing funding bills stall for months or even years in the very badly divided Congress. Related: House Passes Cures Bill \"The remarkable bipartisan, bicameral support for the 21st Century Cures Act proves that congressional lawmakers are serious about the need for scientific research, effective care-delivery, and the removal of barriers to scientific progress,\" said Dr. Daniel Hayes, president of theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology. It includes $500 million a year to help states prevent opioid misuse and get better treatment for addicts. \"These additional resources are particularly critical in rural areas, where rates of opioid misuse and overdose are high, access to treatment is limited, and patients who seek treatment are often met with waitlists that can mean the difference between life and death,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Related: Lobbyists Had A Big Say in Cures Bill The bill provides especially detailed instructions to states for boosting mental health care, which most advocates agree is badly neglected across the country. \"This legislation will improve the lives and health of countless Americans,\" said American Psychological Association President Susan McDaniel. \"It will increase access to effective, evidence-based care, particularly for those with serious mental illness.\" \"It is sorely disappointing that Congress gave Big Pharma and the medical device industry an early Christmas present by passing the 21st Century Cures Act.\" Not everyone loves the act. For one thing, it takes cash from a public health initiative meant to help people prevent America's biggest killers: chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes. \"The Trust for America's Health is deeply disappointed Congress will utilize the Prevention and Public Health Fund as an offset for the legislative package known as 21st Century Cures,\" said Rich Hamburg, interim president and CEO of the group. \"Cutting the Prevention Fund will limit the nation's ability to improve health and quality of life and prevent disease. This is the nation's first and only substantial investment in moving from our current 'sick care' system to a true preventive health system.\" Related: This Bill Funds Health. So Why Doesn't Everyone Love it? Public Citizen openly battled the legislation. \"It is sorely disappointing that Congress gave Big Pharma and the medical device industry an early Christmas present by passing the 21st Century Cures Act,\" said Dr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group . \"This gift \u2014 which 1,300 lobbyists, mostly from pharmaceutical companies, helped sell \u2014 comes at the expense of patient safety by undermining requirements for ensuring safe and effective medications and medical devices.\" Maggie Fox ",

Ebrahim Noroozi/AP hide caption toggle caption Ebrahim Noroozi/AP A natural gas refinery is shown here in the South Pars gas field in Asalouyeh, Iran, on the north coast of the Persian Gulf. Ebrahim Noroozi/AP Royal Dutch Shell has signed a provisional agreement to develop oil and gas fields in Iran, a move that could signal energy companies will not be deterred from doing business with the Islamic Republic despite uncertainty whether a Trump administration will scrap a nuclear deal agreed to by world powers. A spokesman for Shell said a memorandum of agreement was signed Wednesday with the National Iranian Oil Co. \"to further explore areas of potential cooperation.\" The agreement is nonbinding and involves the development of Iran's oil fields in South Azadegan and Yadavaran and the Kish gas field, according to Reuters. The South Azadegan and Yadavaran fields straddle the border with Iraq. Royal Dutch Shell is based in the Netherlands but has operations in the U.S. It is the largest energy company to venture back into Iran since sanctions were lifted after a nuclear deal was implemented in January. It's a move that could signal the controversial deal will remain intact despite threats to renegotiate or scrap it by President-elect Donald Trump, who has called the deal, signed by six world powers in late 2015, a \"disaster\" and the \"worst deal ever negotiated.\" Article continues after sponsorship French energy company Total also signed a deal last month to develop a large gas field in Iran and is now negotiating an oil deal. Despite the nuclear agreement, doing business in Iran is a challenge for Western companies. This is in large part due to residual U.S. sanctions that don't allow American banks to be involved in any transactions. Iran has the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world and is now producing more than 3.5 million barrels a day despite its aging infrastructure. As NPR has reported , Iran's oil production has bounced back faster than most analysts expected. ",

Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Nelly Miles says the two officers were shot Wednesday in Americus, about 130 miles south of Atlanta. The suspected shooter, who police identified as Minguell Kennedy Lembrick, remains at large.\u00a0 Americus police Chief Scott Mark says one of his officers died and a Georgia Southwestern College officer was critically wounded, WMAZ reports. They were at an apartment complex near the campus at the time of the shooting, reportedly responding to a domestic disturbance call.\u00a0 The campus officer reportedly responded as backup. Neither officer has been named. Lembrick is wanted on felony warrants, and he is considered armed and dangerous, Mark said. Investigators believe he may still be in the area. The university, which is in Americus, issued an alert on its website saying the shooting occurred off campus but that the campus was on lockdown. Dianne Brown, an administrative assistant with the Sumter County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said the shooter is not a student at the university.\u00a0 The wounded officer was airlifted to a hospital for treatment. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic At the heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change are a collection of E.P.A. regulations aimed at forcing power plants to significantly reduce their emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution. Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally cancel the rules, which were released under the 1970 Clean Air Act . But a legally experienced E.P.A. chief could substantially weaken, delay or slowly take them apart. Beyond climate change, the E.P.A. itself may be endangered. Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to greatly shrink \u2014 or even dismantle \u2014 it. \u201cWe are going to get rid of it in almost every form,\u201d he once pledged. Mr. Pruitt may be the right man to do that. As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt created a \u201cfederalism unit\u201d in his office, explicitly designed to fight President Obama\u2019s health care law and environmental regulations. \u201cYou could see from him an increasing effort to delegate environmental regulations away from the federal government and towards the states,\u201d said Ronald Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. Although Mr. Obama\u2019s climate rules were not completed until 2015, Mr. Pruitt and a handful of other attorneys general began planning as early as 2014 for a coordinated legal effort to fight them. That resulted in a 28-state lawsuit against the administration\u2019s rules. A decision on the case is pending in a federal court, but it is widely expected to advance to the Supreme Court. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As Mr. Pruitt has sought to use legal tools to fight environmental regulations on the oil and gas companies that are a major part of his state\u2019s economy, he has also worked with those companies. A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E.P.A., the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and even President Obama, outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. The close ties have paid off for Mr. Pruitt politically: Harold G. Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Energy, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s 2013 re-election campaign. Mr. Pruitt, who grew up in Kentucky, moved to Oklahoma to go to law school. An avid baseball fan, for eight years he co-owned and managed the Oklahoma City Redhawks, a minor-league team. He won a seat in the Oklahoma Legislature and opened a small legal office, which he called Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights. As he ran for attorney general of Oklahoma in 2010, he made clear that he intended to use his power as the state\u2019s top law enforcement official to attempt to force the E.P.A. to back down, convinced that it was wrongly stepping on state government powers.

Up until now, those grades have been kept private. USA TODAY's Donovan Slack shares what she learned while uncovering them. USA TODAY NETWORK The Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, D.C. (Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has for years assigned star ratings for each of its medical centers based on the quality of care and service they provide, but the agency has repeatedly refused to make them public, saying they are meant for internal use only. USA TODAY has obtained internal documents detailing the ratings, and they show the lowest-performing medical centers are clustered in Texas and Tennessee. VA hospitals in Dallas, El Paso, Nashville, Memphis\u00a0and Murfreesboro all received one star out of five for performance as of June 30, the most recent ratings period available. Many of highest-rated facilities are in the Northeast\u00a0\u2014 in Massachusetts and New York \u2014 and the upper Midwest, including in South Dakota and Minnesota. Those medical centers scored five out of five stars. The VA determines the ratings for 146 of its medical centers each quarter and bases them\u00a0on dozens of factors, including death and infection rates, instances of avoidable complications and wait times. USA TODAY Network is publishing the ratings in full for the first time so that members of the public \u2014 including patients and their families\u00a0\u2014 can see how their local VA medical centers stack up against others across the country. Has the VA improved? Internal data show it's a mixed bag Some lower-ranking medical centers have remained poor performers despite high-profile crises and years of attention and resources from Washington. For instance, the Phoenix VA was a one-star medical center in 2014 when news broke that veterans had died awaiting care there while schedulers kept secret wait lists masking how long veterans were waiting for appointments. The revelations triggered a national scandal, hearings on Capitol Hill and the replacement of the VA secretary. Phoenix remained a one-star facility in the most recent ratings. This April 28, 2014, file photo shows the Phoenix VA Health Care Center. \u00a0(Photo: Ross D. Franklin, AP) VA Undersecretary for Health David Shulkin cautioned against using the star ratings as a \u201cranking tool\u201d and said they are considered an \u201cinternal improvement tool.\u201d \u201cIt is essentially a system within VA to see who\u2019s improving, who\u2019s getting worse, so we can identify both,\u201d Shulkin said. The documents obtained by USA TODAY list star ratings for every facility for the fourth quarter of 2015. The VA subsequently agreed to provide a list of one- and five-star facilities for the quarter that ended June 30, the most recent ratings available,\u00a0but declined to identify those with two to four stars. Shulkin said he was apprehensive about any ratings becoming public.\u00a0\u201cMy concern is that veterans are going to see that their hospital is a 'one'\u00a0in our star system, assume that\u2019s bad quality and veterans that need care are not going to get care,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to stay away from hospitals and that\u2019s going to hurt people.\u201d David Shulkin, undersecretary of Health for the Department of Veterans Affairs, speaks with USA TODAY in April 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY) But without the star ratings, members of the public \u2014 including patients, members of Congress and others outside the agency who could hold it accountable \u2014\u00a0have no way of knowing whether\u00a0VA medical centers are improving or declining, except to plow\u00a0through a dizzying array of hundreds of spreadsheets on the agency\u2019s website. \u201cThe data\u2019s there, but you\u2019d have to be an expert to get through it,\u201d Shulkin conceded. He said 120 of the 146 medical centers that the VA rates on the star scale have shown improvement since he began overseeing the Veterans Health Administration in July 2015. He said all of the one-star facilities have shown improvement except for the VA medical center in Detroit, which has declined. Pamela Reeves,\u00a0director of the Dingell VA Center in Detroit, said that officials\u00a0there are \"working closely with our performance improvement teams in the development and oversight of action plans to address the opportunities identified by the \u2026 data.\u201d\u00a0In Phoenix, VA officials appointed a new director in October and are pumping millions into the effort\u00a0to improve the medical center. Shulkin said that\u00a0nationwide, medical centers where\u00a0performance has\u00a0declined are getting extra scrutiny and help from national VA officials. If they still don\u2019t show sufficient progress, hospital management could be replaced. Exclusive: VA shuffles managers, declares \u2018new leadership\u2019 That\u2019s what happened in Wilmington, Del., where the VA ousted the medical center\u2019s director in October after months of deteriorating quality.\u00a0Wilmington was among several hospitals placed on a \u201chigh-risk\u201d watch list earlier this year because of declining performance, according to the internal VA documents. Also on the list were hospitals in Tomah, Wis., and Oklahoma City, Okla. The Tomah VA Medical Center made national headlines nearly two years ago after a veteran died there when he was prescribed a fatal cocktail of narcotics. A USA TODAY investigation published last December revealed gaping lapses in care at the\u00a0Oklahoma City VA. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veteran's Affairs Committee, said the VA should immediately release all the ratings and quality data and do so on a continuing basis. He argued that the status quo \u2014 \u201cin which VA officials often attempt to downplay and sometimes mislead the public about serious problems until it's too late\u201d \u2013 is unacceptable. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee \u00a0(Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) \"The secrecy with which VA treats these quality ratings is alarming,\u201d Miller told USA TODAY. \u201cVeterans seeking care at VA hospitals deserve to know exactly what they are walking into. Additionally, Congress, taxpayers and other stakeholders need to have a quick and efficient means of comparing the performance of various VA medical centers in order to identify facilities in need of improvement.\u201d Alex Howard, senior analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan transparency advocate in Washington, said there\u2019s \u201cno rationale that I see for withholding that from veterans, much less the general public.\u201d \u201cI would think the only entity that wouldn\u2019t want that data public would be the facilities themselves, which is not sufficient cause,\u201d he said. The VA also rarely releases nationwide averages showing overall improvements or declines in agency performance measures, so it can be hard to determine exactly what\u2019s changed since the scandal in 2014, when President Obama tapped Bob McDonald, a former Procter & Gamble CEO, to take over as secretary and overhaul the agency. The documents obtained by USA TODAY detail those averages, and when asked about them, VA officials agreed to provide updated statistics. Overall, the data show\u00a0something of a mixed bag, with improvements in some areas and declines in others. On average, veterans are dying at lower rates and contracting fewer staph and urinary tract infections from catheters in VA medical centers\u00a0since 2014. Veterans are not staying as long in VA hospitals and they are being readmitted within 30 days at lower rates. VA hasn't fixed wait-time problems, GAO finds At the same time, veterans are experiencing higher rates of preventable complications during hospital stays, on average, than they did in 2014. Those on ventilators suffered more problems, such as catching pneumonia, and the rate of turnover for nurses has increased. The VA has also seen increases in the percentage of veterans who have to wait longer than 30 days for appointments when they are new patients.\u00a0Overall, more than 500,000 veterans were still waiting longer than 30 days to be seen as of Nov. 15. More than 125,000 of them were waiting longer than two months, and 46,000 were waiting more than six months. Shulkin said half of the 500,000 appointments are for more minor needs such as dental, hearing, vision and diet consultations.\u00a0\u201cI can sleep at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones I worry about are the ones who can\u2019t wait or shouldn\u2019t be waiting, so that\u2019s where our entire focus of our system is right now. I don\u2019t care about you waiting for eyeglasses, I mean that\u2019s poor customer service, I understand, but I do care if you have a lung nodule. I mean, that matters.\u201d Shulkin said the number of veterans waiting longer than a month for urgent care has decreased from 57,000 to 600 since he took over last year. And he says he is working to ensure that veterans get same-day care \u2014 if they have urgent needs \u2014 at VA medical facilities across the country by the end of the year. \u201cIf you have an urgent care problem, your wait should be zero,\u201d he said.

    "text": "Email ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A missing teenager from Palmer, Alaska, was pistol-whipped by an acquaintance, driven to a remote location, walked 200 feet into the woods and fatally shot once in the head, a suspect told Alaska State Troopers in an account outlined in newly-released court documents. Erick Almandinger, 16, is charged as an adult with first-degree murder and kidnapping in the\u00a0 death of David Grunwald, 16, whose body was found Friday by troopers acting on a tip by another teen. Almandinger, however, denied pulling the trigger and said another teen shot Grunwald, who had begged for his life, reports CBS affiliate KTVA. Grunwald, a student at Mat-Su Career and Technical High School, failed to return home after dropping off his girlfriend Nov. 13. His father called troopers\u00a0just before midnight that night and said the boy, driving a 22-year-old Ford Bronco, was three hours overdue. The father described that as \u201ctotally unlike\u201d the teen, KTVA reports. Grunwald\u2019s father reported his son may have met Almandinger to give him a ride to Anchorage. A passer-by on Nov. 14 found David Grunwald\u2019s burned Bronco west of Wasilla. There was no sign of the driver. Troopers could not immediately find Almandinger, but they caught up with him Nov. 16. He denied seeing Grunwald the night he disappeared and said he had taken a cab to Anchorage. Troopers determined he was lying, said Sgt. Tony Wegrzyn in the criminal complaint. Cellular data from Almandinger\u2019s mobile tablet indicated it had been near Grunwald\u2019s SUV the night it burned. Troopers also found a cab driver who had picked up Almandinger and another teen near the SUV. Wegrzyn on Nov. 29 obtained a search warrant for Almandinger\u2019s home and found a camper trailer with the \u201coverwhelming odor of bleach.\u201d Investigators found blood inside on the floor, walls and toilet. On Friday, Wegrzyn interviewed an acquaintance of Almandinger who said the youth and another 16-year-old, \u201cD.J.,\u201d showed up at his door Nov. 13. Almandinger said he had killed Grunwald and needed advice, the acquaintance told police. The acquaintance sent them away. Wegrzyn later that day interviewed \u201cD.J.\u201d The youth consulted with an attorney and provided directions to Grunwald\u2019s body. The remains were found 200 feet off Knik River Road southeast of Palmer. An investigator found one shell casing nearby. Wegrzyn then interviewed Almandinger with his father and grandmother present. At first, Wegrzyn said, he again said he knew nothing of Grunwald\u2019s death. When confronted, however, Almandinger said Grunwald had come to his house to drink and smoke pot in the camper. While doing so, he told the investigator, \u201cD.J\u201d texted him to bring a gun to the trailer. He said he handed a .40-caliber handgun to the other youth, who used it to bludgeon Grunwald. \u201cAlmandinger admitted he stood by as this happened and did nothing to stop it,\u201d the complaint says, according to KTVA. Almandinger said he accompanied \u201cD.J.\u201d as the other youth loaded Grunwald into the Bronco, drove him to Knik River Road, picked out the spot to stop, walked Grunwald into the woods and shot him.\u00a0 In a second recounting of the incident, Wegrzyn said, Almandinger blamed the shooting on another 16-year-old, \u201cA.B.\u201d Almandinger acknowledged burning the Bronco miles away, catching a cab ride home, cleaning the trailer and burning a rug from the trailer that was covered in blood. The only motive Wegrzyn could detect from Almandinger, the investigator said, was that Grunwald \u201chad smoked all of his weed.\u201d Almandinger showed little remorse for his actions, Wegrzyn said, but cried when told his friends had talked to police. Almandinger was arraigned Saturday. He remained jailed Monday at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility. Assistant public defender Windy Hannaman said she could not comment on an open case. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Johnson, the founder of the television network BET, in Bedminster, N.J., last month. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 When former Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia stepped off the elevator on the 26th floor of Trump Tower last week for his interview with Donald J. Trump , he expected a grilling by the president-elect and a phalanx of associates, something along the lines of the confrontational boardroom scenes at the sleek conference table in the television show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d What he found instead was Mr. Trump, calm and solicitous behind a desk cluttered with papers and periodicals, in a large corner office with a hodgepodge of memorabilia and d\u00e9cor that appeared little changed from the 1980s. Nick Ayers, an aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and Stephen K. Bannon, who will serve as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, listened from the sidelines. Mr. Trump, who offered Mr. Perdue a seat across from his desk, was in charge. \u201cHe was approaching this from a deal standpoint, and he wanted to know if he was on the right track,\u201d said Mr. Perdue, who is being considered for secretary of agriculture and wore a tie adorned with tractors to the meeting. \u201cHe believes that we in the United States have been sort of patsies over the years in the way we\u2019ve dealt with our foreign competitors and international trade \u2014 and I agree with him \u2014 and he wanted to know what I would do about it.\u201d Photo Former Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia spoke to reporters last week in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan after meeting with Mr. Trump. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times For more than a decade, millions of Americans tuned in to watch Mr. Trump interrogate prospective employees on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with a mix of arrogance and disdain. But in private over the past few weeks, a less theatrical spinoff of the spectacle has unfolded in Mr. Trump\u2019s office in Manhattan, and occasionally at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., or at Mar-a-Lago, his getaway in Palm Beach, Fla. Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s interview style in the real world is direct but conversational, according to people who have sat opposite him. He did not take notes or appear to refer to a set list of questions, but he did have dossiers on his visitors and often displayed intricate knowledge of their backgrounds and experience. He rarely drank or ate. He kept his suit jacket on. In New York, he liked to show off the sweeping views of Central Park visible over his shoulder. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Job seekers, who must parade before the news media in the marble and bronze lobby of Trump Tower \u2014 \u201cIt was almost like walking the red carpet in Hollywood,\u201d said Representative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has offered himself up as a secretary of transportation or labor \u2014 said that the president-elect often asked open-ended questions and had little patience for meandering answers. \u201cIf you filibuster , he\u2019ll cut you off,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was initially in the running to be Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state but has since said he is not interested in a cabinet post. \u201cHe wants to know what you can do for him.\u2019\u2019 OPEN Graphic Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to putting together his administration was the same one he has used with his multibillion-dollar business. \u201cHe\u2019s used to defining jobs, measuring capability and making a judgment: \u2018Do I think you can run my golf course? Do I think you can run my hotel? Do I want your restaurant in my building?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. Mr. Trump has been more hands-on in the interviews than his predecessors were. George W. Bush rarely spoke in person to more than one finalist for each cabinet post, said Clay Johnson III, who directed his transition effort in 2000. President Obama also interviewed a single finalist for each post in most cases, usually in a one-on-one discussion meant to confirm an already well-established conclusion that the candidate would be right for the job, said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior transition official in 2008. \u201cIn some cases, he knew who he wanted and it was a question of convincing them to do it,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said, citing examples like Hillary Clinton, who became Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, and Robert M. Gates, whom he persuaded to stay on as defense secretary. Mr. Obama was also adamant that the deliberations not spill out into the open, but that has not been the case with Mr. Trump. Photo Representative Lou Barletta, Republican of Pennsylvania, who met with the president-elect last week at Trump Tower. \u201cIt was almost like walking the red carpet in Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Barletta said. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Members of Congress, generals, business executives and others mingle outside his office, waiting for an audience with the president-elect. Mr. Barletta waited more than 45 minutes for his meeting, passing the time chatting with his Republican colleague Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, who was waiting for his turn to audition for secretary of homeland security. \u201cIt was like a green room, a waiting room of people you know or you know of, all waiting their turn,\u201d said Robert L. Johnson, the founder of the television network BET, who visited Mr. Trump at Bedminster to discuss ways the incoming president could reach out to African-Americans. As Mr. Johnson was coming in, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York whom Mr. Trump is considering for secretary of state, was going out. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump wants a gut sense for a potential hire, people close to him said, prizing personal chemistry and an entrepreneurial spirit. But he also leans on the judgment of trusted advisers \u2014 particularly Mr. Pence and his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump \u2014 when assessing a candidate. It was Ms. Trump who reached out to Mr. Johnson, the businessman and BET founder, after she saw a statement he issued the week after her father\u2019s victory. In it, Mr. Johnson urged black voters to participate in elections and insist that both political parties address their concerns in order to earn their support.

He's still haunted by what he saw which is why he was in no rush to return. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"I have bad dreams.\" But encouraged by his family, Wilborn finally returned to Hawaii along with dozens of other veterans who served during the Pearl Harbor attacks.

John Kelly as DHS Secretary 0 Shares A month after the election, the nation remains divided over President-elect Donald Trump , a new poll shows. His favorability rating sits at 50 percent, according to a national Bloomberg poll out today. Just 37 percent of Americans polled believe the country is heading in the right direction, while 49 percent feel that the country is heading in the wrong direction. The poll, conducted Dec. 2 through 5, also shows that 55 percent are more optimistic about a Trump presidency from his actions and statements since Election Day , while 35 percent are more pessimistic about the prospect of Trump in the White House. Trump Says He's Leaving Businesses to Avoid Conflicts And according to the Bloomberg poll, 51 percent of those surveyed are very or mostly confident that Trump will put America's interests ahead of his business's as he meets with foreign leaders. Last week he tweeted that he'll cut ties to his business \"in total\" to focus on running the country. \"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" he wrote on Twitter. He also tweeted that he will hold a \"major news conference\" with his children, who are involved with his businesses, on Dec. 15. In addition, the Bloomberg poll shows that a majority of respondents \u2014 67 percent \u2014 believe Trump needs to choose between being president or a businessman, yet 69 percent believe it \"goes too far\" if Trump sells off his businesses in order to avoid conflicts of interest. Seventy-nine percent hope Trump drops the combative tone he displayed on the campaign trail once he's in office, the poll shows. An overwhelming 73 percent are fine with his adjusting a few of his campaign promises \u2014 including appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server , barring foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, or \" Obamacare ,\" according to the poll. Just 20 percent view his reconsideration of these issues as broken promises. Sixty-nine percent of those polled believe Trump will deliver on his campaign promise to repeal and replace \"Obamacare.\" He recently said he'd like to keep parts of the ACA in place, such as protecting patients with existing conditions and allowing children to remain on their parents' plans until they're 26. But when it comes to two of his key campaign promises related to immigration, more than half of those surveyed don't think he'll keep his word: 57 percent don't expect millions of undocumented immigrants to be deported, and 65 percent don't expect a wall to be built on the U.S.-Mexico border. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percentage points. 0 Shares ",

Leer en espa\u00f1ol Basahin sa Filipino \u70b9\u51fb\u67e5\u770b\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\u6587\u7248 Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times You hear a murder scene before you see it: The desperate cries of a new widow. The piercing sirens of approaching police cars. The thud, thud, thud of the rain drumming on the pavement of a Manila alleyway \u2014 and on the back of Romeo Torres Fontanilla. Tigas, as Mr. Fontanilla was known, was lying facedown in the street when I pulled up after 1 a.m. He was 37. Gunned down, witnesses said, by two unknown men on a motorbike. The downpour had washed his blood into the gutter. The rain-soaked alley in the Pasay district of Manila was my 17th crime scene, on my 11th day in the Philippines capital. I had come to document the bloody and chaotic campaign against drugs that President Rodrigo Duterte began when he took office on June 30: since then, about 2,000 people had been slain at the hands of the police alone. Valenzuela Airport 5 miles Over my 35 days in the country, I photographed 57 murder victims at 41 sites, each represented by a yellow dot on this map. I witnessed bloody scenes just about everywhere imaginable \u2014 on the sidewalk, on train tracks, in front of a girls\u2019 school, outside 7-Eleven stores and a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, across bedroom mattresses and living-room sofas. I watched as a woman in red peeked at one of those grisly sites through fingers held over her eyes, at once trying to protect herself and permit herself one last glance at a man killed in the middle of a busy road. Not far from where Tigas was killed, I found Michael Araja, shown in the first photo below, dead in front of a \u201csari sari,\u201d what locals call the kiosks that sell basics in the slums. Neighbors told me that Mr. Araja, 29, had gone out to buy cigarettes and a drink for his wife, only to be shot dead by two men on a motorcycle, a tactic common enough to have earned its own nickname: riding in tandem. In another neighborhood, Riverside, a bloodied Barbie doll lay next to the body of a 17-year-old girl who had been killed alongside her 21-year-old boyfriend. \u201cThey are slaughtering us like animals,\u201d said a bystander who was afraid to give his name. Many of the following images depict graphic violence. \u2018Riding in tandem\u2019 Neighbors said Michael Araja, 29, was killed by two men riding by on a motorbike, like so many of the other victims.

Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Back-alley killing Crime scene investigators hunched over the body of Romeo Torres Fontanilla, known as Tigas. His killers: two men on a motorbike. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times I have worked in 60 countries, covered wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and spent much of 2014 living inside West Africa\u2019s Ebola zone, a place gripped by fear and death. What I experienced in the Philippines felt like a new level of ruthlessness: police officers\u2019 summarily shooting anyone suspected of dealing or even using drugs, vigilantes\u2019 taking seriously Mr. Duterte\u2019s call to \u201cslaughter them all.\u201d He said in October, \u201cYou can expect 20,000 or 30,000 more.\u201d On Saturday, Mr. Duterte said that, in a telephone call the day before, President-elect Donald J. Trump had endorsed the brutal antidrug campaign and invited him to visit New York and Washington. \u201cHe said that, well, we are doing it as a sovereign nation, the right way,\u201d Mr. Duterte said in a summary of the call released by his office. Beyond those killed in official drug operations, the Philippine National Police have counted more than 3,500 unsolved homicides since July 1, turning much of the country into a macabre house of mourning. A father\u2019s funeral Jimji, 6, cried out in anguish, saying \u201cPapa\u201d as workers moved the body of her father, Jimboy Bolasa, 25, for burial. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Some bodies were found on the streets with their heads wrapped in packing tape. Others were left with crude cardboard signs labeling victims as dealers or addicts. That is what happened with the two men in the video below, which was captured by a security camera outside Santa Catalina College, a private religious school for girls. More than 35,600 people have been arrested in antidrug operations the government calls Project Tokhang. The name is derived from a phrase meaning \u201cknock and plead\u201d in Cebuano, Mr. Duterte\u2019s first language. In affluent neighborhoods of gated communities and estates, there is, indeed, sometimes a polite knock on the door, an officer handing a pamphlet detailing the repercussions of drug use to the housekeeper who answers. In poorer districts, the police grab teenage boys and men off the street, run background checks, make arrests and sometimes shoot to kill. Government forces have gone door to door to more than 3.57 million residences, according to the police. More than 727,600 drug users and 56,500 pushers have surrendered so far, the police say, overcrowding prisons. At the Quezon City Jail, shown in the middle photo below, inmates take turns sleeping in any available space, including a basketball court. Mass arrests Inmates at a Manila police station watched as more drug suspects were processed after their arrests.

Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Hiding their shame Four men arrested for possession of drugs covered their faces from my camera. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times My nights in Manila would begin at 9 p.m. at the police district press office, where I joined a group of local reporters waiting for word of the latest killings. We would set off in convoys, like a train on rails, hazard lights flashing as we sped through red traffic lights. I kept daily diaries and audio recordings of these overnight operations, working with Rica Concepcion, a Filipino reporter with 30 years of experience. We joined the police on numerous stings. We also went on our own to the places where people were killed or bodies were found. The relatives and neighbors we met in those places often told a very different story from what was recorded in official police accounts. \u201cNanlaban\u201d is what the police call a case when a suspect resists arrest and ends up dead. It means \u201che fought it out.\u201d That is what they said about Florjohn Cruz, 34, whose body was being carted away by a funeral home when I arrived at his home in the poor Caloocan neighborhood just before 11 p.m. one night. His niece said they found a cardboard sign saying \u201cPusher at Adik Wag Tularan\u201d \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t be a pusher and an addict like him\u201d \u2014 as they were cleaning Mr. Cruz\u2019s blood from the floor near the family\u2019s altar, shown in the middle photo below. Late-night execution Funeral parlor workers carried away Edwin Mendoza Alon-Alon, 36, who was shot in the head outside a 7-Eleven store.

Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Discarded Erika Angel Fernandez, 17, was one of three women among the 57 victims I photographed. She was killed alongside her boyfriend, Jericho Camitan, 23. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times The police report said, \u201cSuspect Cruz ran inside the house then pulled a firearm and successively shot the lawmen, prompting the same to return fire in order to prevent and repel Cruz\u2019s unlawful aggression.\u201d His wife, Rita, told me, between pained cries, that Mr. Cruz had been fixing a transistor radio for his 71-year-old mother in the living room when armed men barged in and shot him dead. The family said Mr. Cruz was not a drug dealer, only a user of shabu, as Filipinos call methamphetamine. He had surrendered months earlier, responding to Mr. Duterte\u2019s call, for what was supposed to be a drug-treatment program. The police came for him anyway. As my time in the Philippines wore on, the killings seemed to become more brazen. Police officers appeared to do little to hide their involvement in what were essentially extrajudicial executions. Nanlaban had become a dark joke. \u201cThere is a new way of dying in the Philippines,\u201d said Redentor C. Ulsano, the police superintendent in the Tondo district. He smiled and held his wrists together in front of him, pretending to be handcuffed. \u2018Buy-bust operation\u2019 Open Location Officers at the scene of Ronald Kalau\u2019s death. The police report said Mr. Kalau drew a .38-caliber handgun when officers tried to arrest him as he bought methamphetamine.

Witnesses said they heard a woman shout \u201cNanlaban,\u201d which means \u201cfighting it out,\u201d before they heard the gunshots. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Mr. Cruz\u2019s 16-year-old nephew, Eliam, and 18-year-old niece, Princess, said they had watched from a second-story porch as the plainclothes officers who had killed their uncle emerged from the house. Eliam and Princess said they heard the beep of a text message and watched as one of the men read it from his phone. \u201cGinebra\u2019s won,\u201d he announced to the others, referring to Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, the nation\u2019s most popular basketball team, which had been battling for the championship across town. The teenagers said the men celebrated the team\u2019s victory as their uncle was carried out in a body bag. Roel Scott, 13, is one of the boys in the photo above, at the spot where his uncle, Joselito Jumaquio, was slain by a mob of masked men. Mourners often place candles in the blood of the victim to honor them. Roel said he was playing video games with Mr. Jumaquio, a pedicab driver who had also surrendered himself to the authorities, when 15 of the masked men descended quickly and silently over the shantytown called Pandacan. Witnesses told us the men dragged Mr. Jumaquio down an alley and shouted at gathering neighbors to go back into their homes and turn the lights off. They heard a woman shout, \u201cNanlaban!\u201d He\u2019s fighting it out. Two shots rang out. Then four more. When it was quiet, the neighbors found the pedicab driver\u2019s bloodied body \u2014 a gun and a plastic bag of shabu next to his handcuffed hands. The police report called it a \u201cbuy-bust operation.\u201d I also photographed wakes and funerals, a growing part of daily life under Mr. Duterte. Relatives and priests rarely mentioned the brutal causes of death. A painful farewell Family and friends attending the funeral of Mr. Jumaquio, who witnesses said was killed by a gang of masked men. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Stacked like firewood Bodies were stacked up at a funeral parlor as the families of victims like Danilo Deparine, whose body lay on a metal stretcher on the floor, struggle to pay for burial. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times From joy to sadness Benjamin Visda, 43, had left a family birthday celebration to get something from a convenience store when he was snatched off the street and killed, according to relatives. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Maria Mesa Deparine lost two sons in a single week in September. Both had turned themselves in to the police. Both were found dead under bridges. Ms. Deparine said it took her three weeks to collect loans and donations totaling 50,000 pesos, about $1,030, to pay for the burial of her baby, Aljon, who was 23. We went with her to the funeral home where she pleaded with the owners to reduce the fees for his brother, Danilo, 36. Danilo\u2019s body, on the floor in the middle photo above, had already spent two weeks in the morgue, where the dead are stacked like firewood, with nothing separating them. The funeral directors agreed to a cut rate of 12,000 pesos, about $240, for a one-day wake instead of the usual week. Ms. Deparine left, unsure whether she could come up with the sum, or whether Danilo would end up in a mass grave with other victims of the president\u2019s drug war. The killing disrupts every aspect of life. Family members told me that Benjamin Visda, in the coffin in the above photo, had stepped out of a family birthday party to grab something at a sari sari and was eating cake when eight men grabbed him. Within 20 minutes, his body had been dumped outside a police station. The police called this, too, a buy-bust operation, and said that Mr. Visda, while handcuffed, tried to grab an officer\u2019s gun \u2014 Nanlaban \u2014 so they shot him. The video below, also taken from a security camera, shows him being loaded alive onto a motorcycle, sandwiched between two masked men. The same night Florjohn Cruz was killed, we found ourselves a few streets away an hour and a half later, at another home where a man had been murdered. It was raining that night, too. We heard the wrenching screams of Nellie Diaz, the new widow, before we saw her \u2014 shown in the middle photo below \u2014 crumpled over the body of her husband, Crisostomo, who was 51. A threatening message This unidentified body, like many others, was found with his head wrapped in packing tape, his hands tied behind his back and a cardboard sign that read, \u201cA pusher who won\u2019t stop will have his life ended.\u201d Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times A widow\u2019s grief Nellie Diaz hunched over the body of her husband, Crisostomo, a drug user who had surrendered but still ended up dead. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Visiting the dead On Nov. 1, All Saints\u2019 Day, the Barangka cemetery in Manila was busy as relatives visited graves. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Mr. Diaz grew up in the neighborhood, and worked intermittently, doing odd jobs. His wife said he was a user, not a dealer, and had turned himself in soon after Mr. Duterte\u2019s election. She still thought it unsafe for him to sleep at home, and told him to stay with relatives. But he missed his nine children, and had returned days before. Mr. Diaz\u2019s eldest son, J.R., 19, said a man in a motorcycle helmet kicked in the front door, followed by two others. The man in the helmet pointed a gun at Mr. Diaz, J.R. said; the second man pointed a gun at his 15-year-old brother, Jhon Rex. The third man held a piece of paper. J.R. said the man in the helmet said, \u201cGoodbye, my friend,\u201d before shooting his father in the chest. His body sank, but the man shot him twice more, in the head and cheeks. The children said the three men were laughing as they left. Too many tears Relatives overcome with grief at the site where the bodies of Frederick Mafe and Arjay Lumbago lay sprawled in the middle of a street.

    "text": "advertisement A barely visible fog hangs in the air in a California laboratory, illuminated by a laser. And through it flies a parrot, outfitted with a pair of tiny, red-tinted goggles to protect its eyes. As the bird flaps its way through the water particles, its wings generate disruptive waves, tracing patterns that help scientists understand how animals fly. In a new study, a team of scientists measured and analyzed the particle trails that were produced by the goggle-wearing parrot's test flights, and showed that previous computer models of wing movement aren't as accurate as they once thought. This new perspective on flight dynamics could inform future wing designs in autonomous flying robots, according to the study authors. Related: Biomimicry: 7 Clever Technologies Inspired by Nature When animals fly, they create an invisible \"footprint\" in the air, similar to the wake that a swimmer leaves behind in water. Computer models can interpret these air disturbances to calculate the forces that are required to keep a flyer aloft and propel it forward. A team of scientists had recently developed a new system that tracked the airflow generated by flight at an unprecedented level of detail. They wanted to compare their improved observations to several commonly used computer models that use wake measurements to estimate flying animals' lift, to see if their predictions would be on track. Flight of the Parrotlet For the study, the researchers enlisted the help of a Pacific parrotlet \u2014 a type of small parrot \u2014 named Obi. Obi was trained to fly between two perches that are positioned about 3 feet (1 meter) apart, through a very fine mist of water droplets, which are illuminated by a laser sheet. The water particles that seeded the air were exceptionally small, \"only 1 micron in diameter,\" said study author David Lentink, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University in California. (In comparison, the average strand of human hair is about 100 microns thick.) Obi's eyes were protected from the laser's light with custom goggles: a 3D-printed frame that is fitted with lenses cut from human safety glasses \u2014 the same type of glasses worn by Lentink and his team. When the laser flashed on and off \u2014 at a rate of 1,000 times per second \u2014 the water droplets scattered the laser's light, and high-speed cameras shooting 1,000 frames per second captured the trails of disturbed particles as Obi fluttered from perch to perch. LentinkLab, Stanford University Patterns traced in airborne particles allow scientists to track the wing's precise movements during flight.Patterns traced in airborne particles allow scientists to track the wing's precise movements during flight. The tests showed something unexpected. Computer models predicted that once the whirling air patterns \u2014 also known as vortices \u2014 were created by a bird's wings, they would remain relatively stable in the air. But the patterns Obi traced began to disintegrate after the bird flapped its wings just a few times. Related: Drones Take Flight in Antarctica and the Arctic \"We were surprised to find the vortices that are usually drawn in papers and text books as beautiful donut rings turned out to break up dramatically after two to three wing beats,\" Lentink told Live Science in an email. He explained that this meant the models, which are widely used in animal flight studies to calculate an animal's lift based on the wake it produced, were likely inaccurate. \"Thanks to the high-speed recording, we were able to capture this and play it back in slow motion, so we could see with our eyes how the vortices break up and make it hard for the models to predict lift well,\" Lentink said. Testing the Flight Models The researchers performed their own calculations about how much lift Obi generated from his wing beats by using a device that Lentink's team developed in 2015 \u2014 an enclosed box that's equipped with force sensors so sensitive that they were able to detect vibrations produced by the lab's ventilation system, Lentink said in a statement. They then tested three different models, plugging in the measurements of the air patterns from Obi's flights, and comparing the models' lift estimates to their own. The models produced a range of results \u2014 none of which matched the scientists' calculations. Understanding how birds stay aloft could help engineers improve designs for flying robots.Understanding how birds stay aloft could help engineers improve designs for flying robots. Creating better models will be an important next step for studying animal flight, Lentink told Live Science. Video of a be-goggled Obi showed that even a slow-flying parrotlet's wing movements are more complex than scientists had anticipated. Even more variations are likely to exist across species and in animals using different flying techniques, which suggests that the current models are greatly oversimplified, the study authors wrote. Updating them will enable researchers to better understand how animals fly, and could help engineers improve flying robots \u2014 many of which mimic animals' powered flight. Related: Deep Learning: Teaching Computers to Predict the Future \"Many people look at the results in the animal flight literature for understanding how robotic wings could be designed better,\" Lentink said in a statement. \"Now, we've shown that the equations that people have used are not as reliable as the community hoped they were. We need new studies, new methods to really inform this design process much more reliably.\" The findings were published online Dec. 5 in the journal Bioinspiration and Biomimetics. ",

The 95-year-old former Marine suffered a stroke two years ago after having heart valve replacement surgery, but it was not clear what caused him to be taken to the James Cancer Hospital at Ohio State. Glenn was admitted to the hospital more than a week ago, a spokesman for the John Glenn College of Public Affairs said in a statement. The spokesman said he did not know Glenn's \"condition or illness or prognosis\" and cautioned that Glenn did not necessarily have cancer. Although he served as a Democratic senator for 25 years and was a decorated combat pilot in World War II and the Korean War, Glenn will always be known primarily for his 1962 ride in a space capsule dubbed Friendship 7 that circled the Earth, an accomplishment that put the United States on equal footing with Russia in the space race. Glenn had joined the Mercury 7, America's first class of astronauts, after setting the transcontinental speed record as a test pilot. He aimed to be the first man in space, but was relegated to a backup role behind Alan Shepard. A Russian cosmonaut beat them to it, and Glenn got the Americans' lead role on February 20, 1962, riding a Mercury-Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral. Glenn's response from seeing the earth from more than 100 miles above became famous: \"Oh, that view is tremendous!.\" He landed to a hero's welcome, including a ticker tape parade, and decided to enter politics. Glenn, who'd become friends with John F. Kennedy, failed in his first two attempts at the Senate. In 1974 he finally won a seat representing Ohio. A liberal Democrat, he served four terms and retired in 1999. He briefly ran for president in 1984. Before he left politics, however, Glenn returned to space on the shuttle Discovery, becoming, at 77, the oldest person to make such a voyage. In 2011 Glen received the Congressional Gold Medal, America's highest civilian honor. Jon Schuppe ",

    "text": "Email MIAMI -- A Florida woman has been charged with making death threats against the parent of a child who died in the Sandy Hook school shooting massacre because she thought the attack was a hoax, federal authorities announced Wednesday. Lucy Richards, 57, of Tampa was arrested Monday after a grand jury indictment on four felony counts of transmitting threats, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement. The threats were made in January 2016 - according to authorities - and included messages that said, \u201cyou gonna die, death is coming to you real soon,\u201d and \u201cLOOK BEHIND YOU IT IS DEATH.\u201d Court documents added that another threat said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d CBS Miami station WFOR-TV reports the parent, Len Pozner, now lives in South Florida, and the indictment said the threats were made in Palm Beach County. \u201cWe are comforted to know that the system is working to protect the victims of violent crime from re-victimization by potentially violent hoaxers,\u201d Pozner said in a statement. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Schall wouldn\u2019t say how the threats were delivered or provide more details, but the indictment indicates all four were sent on the same day. The indictment comes nearly four years after the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings in which a gunman with a rifle killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The man also killed himself and his mother. Richards awaits an initial court appearance Dec. 19 in Fort Lauderdale. Department of Justice documents didn\u2019t list an attorney for the woman. Each felony charge of transmitting threats is punishable by up to five years in prison in event of a conviction. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Dec 7 2016, 3:09 pm ET Scientists Develop Robotic Hand for People with Quadriplegia by Associated Press advertisement BERLIN \u2014 Scientists have developed a mind-controlled robotic hand that allows people with certain types of spinal injuries to perform everyday tasks such as using a fork or drinking from a cup. The low-cost device was tested in Spain on six people with quadriplegia affecting their ability to grasp or manipulate objects. By wearing a cap that measures electric brain activity and eye movement the users were able to send signals to a tablet computer that controlled the glove-like device attached to their hand. Participants in the small-scale study were able to perform daily activities better with the robotic hand than without, according to results published Tuesday in the journal Science Robotics . The principle of using brain-controlled robotic aids to assist people with quadriplegia isn't new. But many existing systems require implants, which can cause health problems, or use wet gel to transmit signals from the scalp to the electrodes. The gel needs to be washed out of the user's hair afterward, making it impractical in daily life. \"The participants, who had previously expressed difficulty in performing everyday tasks without assistance, rated the system as reliable and practical, and did not indicate any discomfort during or after use,\" the researchers said.

According to Surjo R. Soekadar, a neuroscientist at the University Hospital Tuebingen in Germany and lead author of the study, participants represented typical people with high spinal cord injuries, meaning they were able to move their shoulders but not their fingers. There were some limitations to the system, though. Users had to have sufficient function in their shoulder and arm to reach out with the robotic hand. And mounting the system required another person's help. Jan Schwab, an expert on spinal cord injury at Berlin's Charite hospital who wasn't involved in the research, called it an interesting pilot study that needs to be followed up with further clinical tests. \"Bigger studies will be very important to find out which patients respond well, less well or not at all,\" Schwab said. Soekadar said the system could be brought to market within two years at a cost of between 5,000 and 10,000 euros ($5,370 to $10,740), depending on functionality. He said the device could also be used to help re-train the brain of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation. ",

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \u00a0(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) President-elect Donald Trump is planning to nominate Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt \u2013 an outspoken critic of the EPA \u2013 to lead the environmental agency, a senior transition source confirmed to Fox News. Word of Trump\u2019s choice for the Environmental Protection Agency came as the president-elect also named Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as his pick for ambassador to China and asked retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Pruitt may be the most controversial pick of the three. Pruitt, 48, has been a reliable booster of the fossil fuel industry and a critic of what he derides as the EPA's \"activist agenda.\" Representing his state as attorney general since 2011, Pruitt has repeatedly sued the EPA to roll back environmental regulations and other health protections. He joined with other Republican attorneys general in opposing the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt has argued that curbing carbon emissions would trample the sovereignty of state governments, drive up electricity rates, threaten the reliability of the nation's power grid and \"create economic havoc.\" His installment, if confirmed, would mark a significant break with the current EPA approach toward global warming. In an opinion article published earlier this year by National Review, Pruitt suggested the debate over global warming \"is far from settled\" and claimed \"scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\" He also filed court briefs in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline project blocked by the Obama administration, which would have run through his state. And Pruitt sued the EPA over the agency's recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the federal Clean Water Act.\u00a0 \"Respect for private property rights have allowed our nation to thrive, but with the recently finalized rule, farmers, ranchers, developers, industry and individual property owners will now be subject to the unpredictable, unsound and often byzantine regulatory regime of the EPA,\" Pruitt said last year. As word of Pruitt's nomination spread Wednesday, environmental and liberal groups quickly responded with condemnation.\u00a0 Public Citizen called him a \"terrible choice,\" saying in a statement: \"Pruitt is cozy with the oil and gas industry and treats the EPA like an enemy.\" Business leaders in his home state, however, lauded Pruitt's selection, especially those in the oil and gas industry. \"Scott Pruitt is a businessman and public servant and understands the impact regulation and legislation have in the business world,\" said Jeffrey McDougall, chairman of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. \"His appointment will put rational and reasonable regulation at the forefront.\" Fox News\u2019 John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) Three reverse mortgage companies were collectively fined $790,000 for using deceptive advertising that claimed consumers\u00a0could not lose their homes, a federal regulator said Wednesday. The nation's largest reverse mortgage lender, American Advisors Group, Reverse Mortgage Solutions and Aegean Financial reached consent agreements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the regulator's investigation found they used ads whose scripts featured similarly misleading though reassuring claims: \"Can I lose my home? \"No you cannot lose your home.\" \"I can show you how to use a government-insured program that allows you to save money, get cash and live payment-free as long as you live in your home.\" Consumers with reverse mortgages can \"live in your home for the rest of your life\" \"stay in your home forever\" and \"never\u00a0ever\u00a0be forced from your home.\" Separately, American Advisors Group touted\u00a0the financial advantages of reverse mortgages in ads that featured Fred Thompson, a former Law and Order TV drama actor and former U.S. senator who characterized\u00a0the product as a \"safe, effective financial tool.\" Reverse mortgages are special home loans\u00a0that enable homeowners aged 62 or older to draw on the equity they've built up in the dwellings and receive\u00a0money through lump-sum payments, monthly payments or lines of credit. However, consumers who get reverse mortgages typically must pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. They can default and lose their homes if they fail\u00a0to comply with the loan terms, the CFPB said. \"These companies tricked consumers into believing the could not lose their homes,\" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement issued with the consent orders. \"All mortgage brokers and lenders need to abide by\u00a0federal advertising disclosure requirements in promoting their products.\" 3 reverse mortgage misunderstandings that could cost you American Advisors Group said the company is \"deeply committed to helping older Americans achieve stability in retirement.\" \"We are dedicated to raising awareness about reverse mortgage loans and educating consumers so they can determine if this is the right solution for their financial situation,\" AAG CEO\u00a0Reza Jahangiri said in a formal statement. \"We take our regulatory responsibilities seriously and have made a significant investment in our compliance and legal infrastructure to ensure we fully conform to all marketing laws and rules \u2014\u00a0and better understand how they are interpreted\" Reverse Mortgage Solutions said it was pleased with the settlement and \"will continue to focus our efforts on improving our procedures for the future.\" Representatives Aegean Financial did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the investigation findings and consent order. Along with paying the financial penalties, the companies are required to make clear and prominent disclosures in their reverse mortgage ads and use internal oversight systems to ensure they are obeying all laws. The findings follow a June 2015 CFPB study that found many consumers were confused about reverse mortgages and warned those who consider the products should determine \"how long their loan proceeds will last them given the loan\u2019s interest rate, their living expenses, home equity balance, and age.\" Follow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc ",

    "text": "Dec 7 2016, 5:41 pm ET Donald Trump Picks GOP Oil Industry Ally, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, to Lead EPA by Emma Margolin advertisement Donald Trump intends to select Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a senior transition official confirmed to NBC News Wednesday \u2014 the clearest sign yet the president-elect will pursue an agenda that could undo President Obama's climate change legacy. An ally to the fossil fuel industry, Pruitt has aggressively fought against environmental regulations, becoming one of a number of attorneys general to craft a 28-state lawsuit against the Obama administration's rules to curb carbon emissions. The case is currently awaiting a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which heard oral arguments in September. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 7, 2016. President-elect Donald Trump is holding meetings at Trump Tower as he continues to fill in key positions in his new administration. JOHN TAGGART / Pool via EPA Pruitt, who questions the impact of climate change, along with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, penned an op-ed in the Tulsa World earlier this year that called criticism they've received \"un-American.\" \"Healthy debate is the lifeblood of American democracy, and global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time,\" states the op-ed. \"That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind\u2026 Dissent is not a crime.\" On the campaign trail, Trump called climate change a hoax \u2014 a sentiment he has echoed over the years. In a 2012 tweet he blamed the Chinese government for perpetuating what he sees as a myth. Trump's campaign has since said the tweet was a joke. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 Trump has also vowed to \"cancel\" the Paris climate deal \u2014 an agreement between more than 100 nations to ensure the planet warms no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. While Trump could help end U.S. involvement in the Paris accord, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency had confidence the global community would move forward. The State Department has \"confidence that as this new administration transitions into power they will also see the merits of the direction we are moving, the world is moving,\" said Toner Wednesday. \"In a way that shift has already taken place. That train left the station.\" Former Vice President Al Gore on Monday met with both the president-elect and Ivanka Trump, who reportedly wants to make climate change one of her signature issues. Gore told reporters after the meeting that he \"found it an extremely interesting conversation\" and a \"sincere search for areas of common ground.\" But news of Pruitt's selection Wednesday was met with swift disapproval from environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers who have vowed to oppose his nomination \"Attorney General Pruitt's reluctance to accept the facts or science on climate change couldn't make him any more out of touch with the American people - and with reality,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer in a statement. \"Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing our country and the world today, and we must take it seriously and take action to address it. President-elect Trump promised to break the special interests' grip on Washington, but his nomination of Mr. Pruitt \u2014 who has a troubling history of advocating on behalf of big oil at the expense of public health \u2014only tightens it.\" Schumer added \"I expect he will have to answer many tough questions throughout the nomination process to address these significant concerns.\" Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement that if confirmed, \"Pruitt seems destined for the environmental hall of shame.\" \"The mission of the EPA and its administrator requires an absolute commitment to safeguard public health and protect our air, land, water and planet. That's the litmus test. By naming Pruitt, President-elect Trump has flunked,\" Suh said. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, meanwhile, said in a statement he \"cannot support Scott Pruitt, a denier of climate science, to lead the EPA.\" \"The EPA has the enormous responsibility of protecting our environment and keeping Americans safe and healthy. Its administrator should share those goals, but Scott Pruitt's record has shown us that he does not,\" Schatz said. \"While the EPA is tasked with protecting our people and our environment from the impacts of climate change, he denies the science behind it. And while the agency has worked to keep our air and water clean and safe, Scott Pruitt has worked to undermine the very rules that protect those resources.\" Emma Margolin ",

Flanked by his attorneys, former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca leaves federal court in Los Angeles earlier this year after being arraigned on charges of conspiracy, obstructing justice and lying to the federal government. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Victoria Kim and Joel Rubin Contact Reporters For 15 years, Lee Baca helmed one of the largest police forces in the nation, entrusted with the safety of a population larger than that of many states and a budget in the billions of dollars. As the elected sheriff of Los Angeles County, he commanded 18,000 sworn and civilian employees and oversaw\u00a0 as many inmates in the county\u2019s seven jails. On Wednesday, though, his defense to federal criminal allegations of obstruction of justice came down to this: He didn\u2019t know what was going on in his own department.\u00a0 Baca, his attorney told jurors in opening statements of his public corruption trial,\u00a0didn\u2019t know his deputies were hiding an inmate from federal authorities by changing his name and\u00a0moving\u00a0him from jail to jail. He didn\u2019t know a\u00a0federal grand jury had requested testimony from the\u00a0inmate,\u00a0who had been helping an FBI investigation into abuse and corruption in the lockups. He didn\u2019t know about a new internal policy preventing\u00a0FBI interviews of inmates, orders for deputies not to cooperate\u00a0with federal investigators, or a surveillance operation his deputies were conducting on the home of an FBI agent, attorney Nathan Hochman said.\u00a0 \u201cSheriff Baca didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, telling the jury there was no evidence of the former sheriff\u00a0\u201cagreeing, condoning, authorizing or knowing\u201d of the conspiracy to obstruct the federal investigation.\u00a0 Baca\u2019s defense was in direct\u00a0contrast with a prosecutor\u2019s contention that the ex-sheriff was, in fact, the \u201cheartbeat,\u201d the \u201cleader\u201d and the \u201cdriving force\u201d of a conspiracy that took place over six weeks in the summer of 2011.\u00a0Baca\u2019s second-in-command and eight other sheriff\u2019s officials\u00a0have already been convicted of charges related to what prosecutors say was a plot to stop federal investigators from investigating corruption, beatings and other civil rights abuses in the jails run by the Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cMr. Baca was at the top of this conspiracy,\u201d\u00a0Assistant U.S. Atty. Brandon Fox told jurors. Fox said emails sent\u00a0by then-Undersheriff Paul Tanaka at the time\u00a0were\u00a0evidence of just how involved Baca was in the steps taken by his subordinates once they had found out about the federal investigation.\u00a0 \u201dSheriff popped in looking for an update. This case is consuming his entire thought process,\u201d Tanaka wrote in August 2011, Fox told the jury. The prosecutor also told jurors that they would hear testimony that after a meeting with Baca, Tanaka told his subordinates: \u201cNever seen the Sheriff this mad. We\u2019re going to do whatever he wants done.\u201d Hochman, however, said that it was Tanaka\u00a0who ran the show. \u201cHe operated his own agenda. He had people who were loyal to him, not Sheriff Baca,\u201d the lawyer said.\u00a0 ",

Bruce Rauner's office has put off a scheduled Thursday morning meeting with legislative leaders. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's office has put off a scheduled Thursday morning meeting with legislative leaders, leaving it unclear when the two sides will reconvene talks on a spending plan for state government. Following a Tuesday huddle in which the two sides emerged with differing ideas about the way forward in negotiations, Rep. Greg Harris , a Chicago Democrat who has been attending the meetings, said Rauner had asked Democrats to provide a budget proposal of their own. Democrats, led by House Speaker Michael Madigan , \"did not agree to that,\" Harris said. Harris said he reiterated that position Wednesday when the governor's office called and asked if the Democrats were prepared to present a budget proposal Thursday at the meeting. \"I just said that is not the case and we have not even discussed the outcome of these meetings with our caucus yet,\" Harris said. Later in the day, Rauner's office postponed the Thursday meeting, saying in a statement that \"Democratic leaders continue to discuss internally whether they are prepared to present a budget proposal, so we will schedule the next Four Leaders meeting when we receive confirmation that they are ready.\" The request for a budget framework from Democrats is a change of tune from Rauner, who has resisted spelling out how he would like to deal with the state's budget problems and has rejected Democratic proposals in the past. The governor has vetoed Democrats' budgets because those plans did not provide enough money to pay for the spending \u2014 something both sides realize will require a bipartisan deal to achieve. In his February budget speech \u2014 an annual tradition in which the governor is expected to lay out his vision for a state budget \u2014 Rauner failed to present a fully baked plan, instead asking the opposition party to work with him on his broader legislative goals or allow him to cut roughly $3.5 billion in state spending on his own.

    "text": "Search for Victims in Oakland Warehouse Fire Concludes; Death Toll Stands at 36 By Morgan Winsor Dec 7, 2016, 12:51 PM ET 0 Shares JIM WILSON/The New York Times/Redux WATCH Search for Victims in Oakland Fire Concludes 0 Shares Email The rigorous search for bodies in the rubble of a fatal warehouse fire in Oakland, California, concluded today, with the death toll remaining at 36, police said. Authorities will begin reopening the street on which the charred structure is located around 3:30 p.m. local time, according to the Oakland Police Department. Officials found 36 victims inside the large warehouse and most were in their 20s and 30s. So far, 35 of them have been identified and 30 families have been notified. A 17-year-old's name will not be released, according to the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office Coroner\u2019s Bureau. Although crews have finished their search for victims, investigators are still working to find the cause of the horrific blaze that broke out on Dec. 2. An official briefed on the investigation told ABC News that a refrigerator is being eyed as the \"possible\" point of origin. Investigators are also working to determine if there was criminal liability for the fire and, if so, who was responsible, according to Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley. As many as 100 people were at the warehouse for a concert party when what authorities described as an \"electrical fire\" broke out just before midnight on Nov. 2. The venue, known as the \"Ghost Ship,\" ultimately became a grave for dozens of the young party-goers. The Oakland Fire Department first responded to reports of a structure fire at the 4,000-square-foot warehouse on 31st Avenue in the East Bay area at around 11:32 p.m. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said the warehouse appeared to function as a residential building that hosted a makeshift artists' studio, as well as parties like the one that took place that night. Most of the bodies were found on the second floor, which was accessible by a makeshift stairwell assembled with various materials, according to Reed. Darin Ranelletti, the interim director of the city's planning and building department, told reporters that the party at the Ghost Ship required a permit, which he said was not obtained. The property is under investigation to determine whether it was used to house people illegally, Ranelletti said. Some Victims of the Oakland Warehouse Fire Texted Family Members Before Dying The power went out inside the building when the fire started and the flames blocked the building's only exit, making it difficult for people inside to escape, an official briefed on the ongoing investigation told ABC News. Alameda County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly said some of those trapped upstairs had just enough time to send final text messages to loved ones. Some of these messages read \"I'm going to die\" and \"I love you,\" Kelly said. Survivors of the inferno who spoke to ABC News recalled waking up to \"smoke and an entire wall of fire\" that was so powerful it opened a window, letting in oxygen that apparently intensified the flames. The Ghost Ship is purportedly run by a married couple, Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison, but the building is owned by Chor Nar Siu Ng, a woman who appeared to have little involvement with its use for artists' studios and as a performance space for musicians. \"They're my children. They're my friends. They're my family. They're my loves. They're my future. What else do I have to say?\" Almena told ABC affiliate KGO on Sunday. Almena also appeared to address the fire in a Facebook post early Saturday morning by saying that what he worked for was destroyed, but he failed to elaborate on what work he put into the warehouse prior to the tragedy. \"Confirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound ... it's as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope ... to be standing now in poverty of self worth,\" Almena wrote. On Tuesday night, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf declared a local state of emergency to facilitate state and federal aid. City officials also released records on the building's reported complaints. The most recent city record on the property is dated just days before the deadly fire. The Nov. 14 notice shows an \"investigation pending\" for \"illegal interior building structure,\" an apparent reference to the illegal living spaces constructed inside the warehouse. A day prior to that, the building's owner was notified of a code violation. The records say \"a ton of garbage [is] piling up on the property,\" including \"hazardous\" trash. Oakland police said that they have responded to numerous calls about the warehouse in the past, but it is unclear how many. It is also unknown whether authorities will hold Almena, Allison or Ng accountable for the deaths in the fire. The last permitted use of the building was as a warehouse, according to a press release from the City of Oakland. The city said it received complaints of blight and unpermitted interior construction at the building this year on Nov. 13. Days later, a city building inspector visited the property on Nov. 17 and verified the blight complaint, but could not gain access to the building to confirm the other complaint regarding unpermitted construction. The investigation is ongoing, the city said. ABC News' J.J. Gallagher, Jonah Lustig, Josh Magolin, Michael Murray, Scott Schulman, Alex Stone and Kayna Whitworth contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

With the death toll at 36, officials earlier announced that recovery efforts at the site have ended.\u00a0 The news comes a day after Oakland officials declared a local state of emergency due to the fire. The Oakland City Council is slated to ratify the state of emergency on Thursday. This will begin the process for state and federal aid. A refrigerator was a potential source of the fire, but it was too soon to say for sure, said Jill Snyder, special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u201cWe have no indication that this was intentionally set,\u201d she said. Oakland\u2019s mayor confirms there were multiple complaints filed against the structure. She\u2019s promising complete transparency, including the release overnight of years of city records connected with the property. According to one document, inspectors came just two weeks before the fire but were unable to gain access. Video obtained by CBS News shows police officers inside the structure, purportedly less than two months ago. 28 Photos Victims of the Oakland warehouse fire Officials have begun releasing victims\u2019 identities , and all but one of the 36 have been identified so far. Tearful family members visited the scene Tuesday and exchanged hugs hours after the founder of the arts collective that used the warehouse stood near the gutted building and said he was \u201cincredibly sorry.\u201d Derick Ion Almena said he was at the site to put his face and his body in front of the scene, but he deflected blame for the blaze, saying he signed a lease for the building that \u201cwas to city standards supposedly.\u201d \u201cEverything that I did was to make this a stronger and more beautiful community and to bring people together,\u201d Almena told NBC. The fire broke out during a dance party Friday night in the cluttered warehouse. It had been converted to artists\u2019 studios and illegal living spaces, and former denizens said it was a death trap of piled wood, furniture, snaking electrical cords and only two exits. Almena did not respond to emails or calls to phone numbers associated with him by The Associated Press. He told San Jose television station KNTV that he didn\u2019t attend the event Friday night and that he and his wife had decided to stay at a hotel because he was exhausted. City and state officials fielded years of complaints about dangerous conditions, drugs, neglected children, trash, thefts and squabbles at the warehouse, raising questions about why it wasn\u2019t shut down. The district attorney warned of possible murder charges as she determines whether there were any crimes linked to the blaze. A building inspector who went to an Oakland warehouse on Nov. 17 after receiving a complaint of illegal interior construction left after being unable to get inside. View Gallery Emergency crew workers and vehicles are shown in front of the site of a warehouse fire in Oakland, Calif., Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. AP Photo/Jeff Chiu Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said late Tuesday the inspector followed procedure and later sent a request to the owner to gain entry. She did not reveal the outcome of that request. Under the Oakland city code, building officials and fire marshals need court permission to enter commercial lodgings if the owner or manager refuses access. Building inspectors typically cannot force entry to a property unless there are pressing circumstances, Schaaf said. Fire officials have started knocking down parts of the building, known as the \u201cGhost Ship,\u201d that they said were structurally unsound. Alameda County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. J.D. Nelson said that of the 36 victims found, 35 have been identified and 20 of their families have been notified. Officials are still lacking any type of identity for one person. Stories of the victims\u2019 last minutes, meanwhile, emerged. Alameda County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly said that some of the victims texted relatives , \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d and \u201cI love you.\u201d Rescue crews found bodies of people \u201cprotecting each other, holding each other,\u201d Kelly said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

President-elect Donald Trump, basking in the glow from Carrier workers whose jobs will stay in Indianapolis; but more company employees will lose their jobs than keep them. (Darron Cummings / Associated Press) Michael Hiltzik Contact Reporter I was taking some time off last week, when Donald Trump announced his big rescue of jobs at a Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis, so I\u2019ve needed a few days to catch up. One thing was clear even on Dec. 1, when Trump made his announcement on the scene, and has become even clearer with every day that passes: This deal is a scam. It isn\u2019t saving nearly as many jobs as the 1,100 Trump claimed, it\u2019s costing taxpayers a bundle, and it\u2019s no template for any job-preservation policy that Trump might consider. Nothing about this deal challenges the longstanding elite consensus in America that capital is free to move...with workers and their communities left behind. \u2014 Greg LeRoy, Good Jobs First In the most recent development, Chuck Jones, the president of the Carrier workers\u2019 union, told the Washington Post Tuesday about his reaction when Trump failed to disclose something his local already had been told \u2014 that the saved jobs numbered not 1,100, but only 730. \u201cHe got up there,\u201d Jones said, \u201cand, for whatever reason, lied his ass\u00a0off.\u201d Get used to it, Mr. Jones. Carrier\u2019s decision to close its Indianapolis plant and move 1,400 jobs to Mexico wasn\u2019t much different from thousands of corporate decisions taken every day across the country. What made it special was a recording of the Feb. 10 announcement and the reaction among the thunderstruck workers, which was promptly posted to YouTube and went viral. (The video can be seen below; beware of the occasional profane outburst.) SNAP Video Carrier workers react to the announcement in February that their plant will be shutting down. (YouTube) Carrier workers react to the announcement in February that their plant will be shutting down. (YouTube) See more videos That made the event emblematic of the impact of corporate-suite economic policies on rank-and-file employees, not least because the manager delivering the news seemed put out at the employees\u2019 unkind response to what he said was \u201cstrictly a business decision\u201d that would \u201callow us to maintain high levels of product quality [and]\u00a0competitive prices.\u201d The\u00a0video provided Trump with an irresistible opportunity to paint Carrier\u2019s flight as the product of ineffective Democratic economic policies. Never mind that the job-retention program in Indianapolis was entirely under the control of the Republican statehouse \u2014 to wit, Trump\u2019s own eventual running mate, Gov. Mike Pence . Trump promised that his administration wouldn\u2019t tolerate such corporate behavior \u2014 indeed, that companies fleeing the U.S. for Mexico would face punitive consequences. Things haven\u2019t worked out quite that way. To begin with, rather than facing punishment from President\u00a0Trump, Carrier will garner a $7-million state tax break from Indiana over 10 years to keep 730 jobs in town, with no guarantee the jobs will even last that long. That\u2019s a minuscule benefit for a company with a profit of $7.6 billion on sales of $56 billion last year. It\u2019s more telling that Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technology, gets 10% of its revenue from U.S. government contracts, so it knows it pays to keep on the good side of an incoming president. Donald... Has John Maynard Keynes just won a ticket back to the White House? Keynes was the British economist who advocated government deficit spending to stimulate moribund economies. And that seems to be the principle undergirding the $1-trillion infrastructure construction plan that President-elect Donald... (Michael Hiltzik) Yet for all that, it seems that Trump got rooked by United Technologies . Even though the company is\u00a0giving in on plans to move 730 jobs to Mexico \u2014 at least for now \u2014 it\u2019s sticking to its plan to move 553 other Carrier\u00a0union and management jobs south of the border. Nor is UT abandoning plans to shut down\u00a0a plant manufacturing electronic controls in Huntington, Ind., just 100 miles from the Carrier factory, at the cost of another 700 jobs . And that still doesn\u2019t end the story of the manufacturing exodus from the Indianapolis metro area: Just before election day, Rexnord Corp. said it will shut down a bearings plant in Indianapolis, sending 350 jobs to its plant in Monterrey, Mexico, where Carrier will be a neighbor. Neither the Huntington nor the Rexnord announcements were accompanied by videos, so they didn\u2019t capture the nation\u2019s attention \u2014 or Trump\u2019s or Pence\u2019s. \u201cNothing about this deal challenges the longstanding elite consensus in America that capital is free to move: offshore, across town\u00a0or across a state line, with workers and their communities left behind to suffer declining living standards,\u201d says Greg LeRoy , the head of Good Jobs First, an organization that tracks corporate subsidies. Much of the press attention after the Trump announcement focused on the good fortune of the workers whose jobs were saved, but it should be obvious that economic development policy can\u2019t be conducted on a case-by-case basis, a few hundred jobs at a time; only political photo-ops can be managed that way, and only for the near term. At the very least, these \u201cshort-term, isolated, and subsidy-driven transactions,\u201d as Amy Liu of the Brookings Institution described the Carrier deal, suck up resources that can be better used in other ways, such as making regions broadly attractive to whole industries, not individual firms. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to recognize that one-off tax incentives are mercilessly gamed by manufacturers. His running mate Gov. Pence could school him in the technique, because his administration has been victimized by it over and over again. As the Indianapolis Star reported this summer, since Pence became governor in 2013, his state has shoveled out $24 million in job-retention benefits to companies that shipped 3,800 jobs overseas despite their promises. A common scam was to accept benefits for a single factory, but close others \u2014 just as United Technologies is doing. Often these deals resulted in a net outflow\u00a0of jobs by the employer overall. Even as a would-be jobs preserver, it appears that Trump may have his eyes on the wrong ball. In his speech at Carrier last week, Trump made a distinction between domestic job transfers and international outsourcing. Companies, he said, \u201ccan leave from state to state and they can negotiate good deals with the different states and all of that. But leaving the country is going to be very, very difficult.\u201d But as LeRoy observes , interstate job piracy is incredibly costly to taxpayers and the economy in general.\u00a0\"It appears that the president-elect is endorsing the ruinous, corrosive economic war among the states,\u201d observed LeRoy, whose group reported\u00a0 in a 2013 study \u00a0that local politicians are so fixated on job growth at any cost that \u201csometimes companies move very short distances\u00a0within the same metro area\u00a0and receive eight-figure subsidy packages.\u201d \u00a0 So for the sake of a photo-op and a PR blitz, Trump got two things wrong about job development. By showing himself to be a paper tiger on international job transfers, he gave all\u00a0employers a template for extracting tax benefits by threatening to move across the border. And he offered carte blanche for firms to play states off against one another in a quest for local incentives. If this is supposed to be a triumph for job-creation policy, the economy will be in trouble.

(Photo: Craig A. Hacker, for USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch is launching a new, for-profit communications agency to push his free-market agenda as his political empire gears up to shape policy in a Republican-controlled Washington and wage battles in state legislatures next month on issues from collective bargaining to occupational licensing. The new firm, In Pursuit Of, will handle marketing and communications for the network of conservative advocacy groups funded Koch and hundreds of like-minded donors. The agency also may take on paying clients, in the mold of another Koch venture, a data giant called i360, which has amassed hundreds of bits of information about every American voter in an effort to shape elections. The new agency will be run by James Davis, who also is a top official in the Koch\u2019s umbrella organization, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. In an interview, Davis said the firm will help \u201cdrive ideas and shape debate in pursuit of a free and open society.\u201d The firm is part of the major Koch reorganization that began earlier this fall with the merging of several Koch conservative advocacy organizations under the network\u2019s largest grassroots group, Americans for Prosperity (AFP). Under that change, three groups that aim to spread Koch\u2019s message to millennials, veterans and Latinos, have become part of AFP. David said Wednesday that 81 positions, out of 1,700 across the network, will be eliminated as a result of the consolidation. Davis and other network leaders have cast the changes as helping the organization to run more efficiently, rather than a retreat from Koch\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at how we can do things better,\u201d Davis said. The Koch advocacy groups have chapters in 36 states, and Davis said the network is considering expanding into North Dakota, a Republican stronghold\u00a0where Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is up for re-election in 2018. Although Koch refused to back President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, his network is poised to have big sway in his administration and with the Republican-controlled Congress. Vice President-elect Mike Pence forged close ties with the Kochs and people who have attended Koch gatherings or donated to Koch groups are helping to raise money for Trump\u2019s inauguration or serving in his transition. Marc Short, a longtime Pence aide who oversaw Freedom Partners, is among the transition staff. A\u00a0consultant to a veteran-focused Koch group also has provided advice to the Trump transition. ",

Nicholas Kamm /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Nicholas Kamm /AFP/Getty Images A gunman's appearance at a Washington, D.C., pizzeria that was falsely reported to house a pedophilia ring has elevated worries over the unrelenting rise of fake news on the Internet. Nicholas Kamm /AFP/Getty Images Fake news played a bigger role in this past presidential election than ever seen before. And sometimes it has had serious repercussions for real people and businesses. That's what happened to a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., recently, when an armed man claiming to be \"self-investigating\" a fake news story entered the restaurant and fired off several rounds. But once a fake news story is out there, and the harm has been done, what can a person do about it? Radio Conspiracy Theorist Claims Ear Of Trump, Pushes 'Pizzagate' Fictions Derigan Silver, a professor of media, First Amendment and Internet law at the University of Denver, tells NPR's Audie Cornish that victims of fake news stories have legal recourse under defamation law. \"Fake news sites are clearly a situation where they're engaging in a defamatory statement, a false statement about another that damages that person's reputation,\" Silver says. \"In that situation, that is certainly actionable.\" Interview Highlights On the legal recourse for victims of fake news stories So in most of these situations, the person that has been harmed is going to bring a lawsuit that we call a tort. Now a tort is a noncontractual harm between two private individuals. It's a civil lawsuit, where you're alleging that one person harmed another. ... So anytime one private individual harms another private individual, you can bring a lawsuit for a tort. So one of those torts that people can have advantage of is called defamation. Defamation is a tort that alleges that a communication damaged your reputation. Article continues after sponsorship Man Fires Rifle Inside D.C. Pizzeria, Cites Fictitious Conspiracy Theories On who's accountable for fake news stories They can hold accountable anybody who has communicated the defamatory statement to anybody else. That includes the person who originated the defamatory statement, but under something called the republication rule, it also includes anybody who repeated the defamatory statement. Now simply retweeting a defamatory statement is probably not going to be enough to qualify for republication, but passing on information that you heard from somebody else certainly is republication. So you have some cases coming out of Texas, for example, where hundreds and hundreds of people were adding to a posting that had more and more and more defamatory contents. And if you can track those people down, if you can find out those identities, then yes, you can sue every single person who sort of adds to that defamatory statement or repeats that defamatory statement.

By Chris Mooney , Brady Dennis and Steven Mufson December 7 at 2:51 PM Follow chriscmooney Follow @brady_dennis Follow @StevenMufson President-elect Donald Trump is nominating Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik,Danielle Kunitz,Deirdra O'Regan,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of the oil and gas-intensive state of Oklahoma, to head the Environmental Protection Agency,\u00a0a move signaling an assault on President Obama\u2019s climate change and environmental legacy. Pruitt has spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead. He is the third of Trump\u2019s appointees who have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run. Ben Carson, named to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has expressed a deep aversion to the social safety net programs and fair housing initiatives that have been central to that agency\u2019s activities. Betsy DeVos, named education secretary, has a passion for private school vouchers that critics say undercut the public school systems at the core of the government\u2019s mission. The news about the choice of Pruitt was confirmed by a transition official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement. Pruitt, who has written that the debate on climate change is \u201cfar from settled,\u201d joined a coalition of state attorneys general in suing the agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan, the principal Obama-era policy aimed at reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. He has also sued , with fellow state attorneys general, over the EPA\u2019s recently announced regulations seeking to curtail the emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the oil and gas sector. On his Linked In page, Pruitt boasts of being \u201ca leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.\u201d [ Trump has vowed to kill the Clean Power Plan. Here\u2019s how he might \u2014 and might not \u2014 succeed ] After he was elected attorney general in 2010, Pruitt established a \u201cFederalism Unit\u201d to \u201cmore effectively combat unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach by federal agencies, boards and offices,\u201d according to his online biography. And he has gone on to challenge the administration not just over the environment but over a host of other areas. He joined other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit over Obama\u2019s immigration policies. He has also sued the administration over the Affordable Care Act, saying the health-care mandate on religious employers to provide coverage including contraception was unconstitutional. He has sued over the Dodd-Frank financial reform. An ally of the energy industry, Pruitt, along with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, came to the defense of ExxonMobil when it fell under investigation by attorneys general from more liberal states seeking information about whether the oil giant failed to disclose material information about climate change. \u201cWe do not doubt the sincerity of the beliefs of our fellow attorneys general about climate change and the role human activity plays in it,\u201d they wrote at the conservative publication National Review. \u201cBut we call upon them to press those beliefs through debate, not through governmental intimidation of those who disagree with them.\u201d In an interview with The Post in September, as a D.C. federal appeals\u00a0court was preparing to hear arguments over the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt detailed why he has remained a leading opponent of the EPA\u2019s efforts to curb carbon emissions by regulating power plants. \u201cWhat concerns the states is the process, the procedures, the authority that the EPA is exerting that we think is entirely inconsistent with its constitutional and statutory authority,\u201d he said at the time. Agencies such as the EPA, he said, should not be trying to \u201cpinch hit\u201d for Congress. \u201cThis is a unique approach by EPA, whether they want to acknowledge it or not,\u201d he said of the provisions of the Clean Air Act that the agency had relied upon to write new regulations. \u201cThe overreach is the statutes do not permit [EPA officials] to act in the way they are. They tend to have this approach that the end justifies the means . . . They tend to justify it by saying this big issue, this is an important issue.\u201d But he added that\u2019s where Congress should have authority, not EPA. \u201cThis is something from a constitutional and statutory perspective that causes great concern.\u201d Environmental groups reacted with alarm Wednesday at the nomination. And New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to \u201cuse the full power\u201d of his office to wage a legal battle to \u201ccompel\u201d enforcement of environmental laws under Trump. \u201cScott Pruitt has a record of attacking the environmental protections that EPA is charged with enforcing. He has built his political career by trying to undermine EPA\u2019s mission of environmental protection,\u201d said Fred Krupp,\u00a0 president of the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cOur country needs \u2014\u00a0and deserves \u2014\u00a0an EPA administrator who is guided by science, who respects America\u2019s environmental laws, and who values protecting the health and safety of all Americans ahead of the lobbying agenda of special interests.\u201d [ Scientists and environmentalists are bracing for a clash with Trump ] Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that \u201cover the past five years, Pruitt has used his position as Oklahoma\u2019s top prosecutor to sue the EPA in a series of attempts to deny Americans the benefits of reducing mercury, arsenic, and other toxins from the air we breathe; cutting smog that can cause asthma attacks; and protecting our wetlands and streams.\u201d Pruitt has also fought to limit the scope of the federal government in regulating pollution of rivers under the Waters of the United States rule. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who has been active on environmental issues, said, \u201cScott Pruitt would have EPA stand for Every Polluter\u2019s Ally.\u201d In 2014, the New York Times reported that a letter ostensibly written by Pruitt alleging that the agency overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of the state\u2019s largest oil and gas companies. Industry representatives expressed satisfaction with the choice Wednesday. \u201cThe office he headed was present and accounted for in the battle to keep EPA faithful to its statutory authority and respectful of the role of the states in our system of cooperative federalism,\u201d said Scott Segal, head of the policy group at the lobbying and legal firm Bracewell. \u201cGiven that we are almost two decades overdue for an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, there is interest on both sides of the aisle to look at that statute.\u201d David Rivkin, a\u00a0constitutional litigator who represented\u00a0Pruitt and Oklahoma\u00a0in challenging\u00a0the Clean Power Plan, said he believed Pruitt would be able to make sure the EPA lives up to its mission of protecting air and water while avoiding federal overreach. [ Obama administration will keep tough fuel standards in place ] \u201cGeneral Pruitt has been the leader among the AGs in defending federalism, the key feature of our constitutional architecture,\u201d said Rivkin, a partner at Baker Hostetler, adding that he believed Pruitt would \u201censure both environmental protection and constitutional fidelity.\u201d Pruitt\u2019s outlook reflects his home state: Oklahoma ranked fifth in the nation in onshore crude oil output in 2014, has five oil refineries, and is home to the giant Cushing oil storage and trading hub, where the price for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate grade is set every day. Although oil and natural gas production sagged in the 1990s and early 2000s, the surge in horizontal fracturing, or fracking, has boosted output. The state\u2019s natural gas output accounts for 10 percent of the nation\u2019s overall total. For the week ended Oct. 28, there were 73 drilling rigs in operation in Oklahoma. Pruitt has served as head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, a group that has relied heavily on funds from ultraconservative groups and the oil industry. The biggest contributors this year included the Judicial Crisis Network, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Institute of Legal Reform, Sheldon Adelson, oil conglomerate Koch Industries and Murray Energy, a leading coal mining company. Pruitt, a Kentucky native who moved to Oklahoma to attend the University of Tulsa law school, has also been active in religious groups. He serves as deacon of the First Baptist Church of Broken Arrow. In 2012, Pruitt was named a trustee of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Before serving as attorney general, he was a member of the state legislature. Dallas investor Doug Deason, a friend of Pruitt, said he expects the Oklahoma attorney general to immediately get to work rolling back the EPA\u2019s \u201csilly overreach\u201d and to let states handle environmental oversight. [ Scientists have long feared this \u2018feedback\u2019 to the climate system. Now they say it\u2019s happening ] \u201cJust like most Republican attorney generals, especially in energy-producing states, he has been really frustrated with the government and the EPA\u2019s overreach into everything,\u201d Deason said. But Deason said liberals will be happily surprised by Pruitt\u2019s \u201copen-minded\u201d attitude, adding that he is \u201cwilling to look at things.\u201d \u201cHe will bring a more balanced, logical look\u201d at environmental regulation,\u201d he said. Pruitt\u2019s selection was strongly supported by Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm. The nomination suggests an extraordinarily tough road ahead for the Clean Power Plan, president Obama\u2019s signature climate policy. However, the precise fate of the regulation most immediately turns on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which has not yet ruled in the lawsuit brought by Pruitt and his fellow attorneys general against the agency Pruitt is now named to lead. \u201cSome have suggested that Pruitt\u2019s hands might be tied because he participated in litigation against the agency,\u201d Segal said in an email. \u201cThis is a silly position. There is no conflict in representing your state on litigation dealing with rules of general applicability and then serving your nation as a federal official.\u201d Dismantling the regulation if it survives the courts would not be simple, because the agency has already finalized it \u2014\u00a0meaning that to undo and replace it would require a public notice and comment process . Environmental groups would likely sue the agency over such a move. However, some of the Clean Power Plan\u2019s objectives appear to have been already realized long before it came into effect. The United States is already burning less coal and more natural gas, meaning fewer carbon dioxide emissions. In 2030, the EPA projected in its final Clean Power Plan rule , coal would be reduced to providing 27 percent of U.S. electricity, with natural gas at 33 percent. Yet this very year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas will provide 34 percent of U.S. electricity, and coal 30 percent. Matea Gold contributed to this report.

And the university\u2019s president, Janet Napolitano , urged Mr. Trump to keep the program that grants temporary reprieve to young undocumented immigrants brought here as children. And on Monday, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Senate president pro tem, introduced a package of bills intended to help undocumented immigrants by helping to provide legal representation, further limit local law enforcement cooperation and train public defenders on immigration law.

Passengers begin to board a Megabus heading south to Ohio, at their station at Polk and Canal in Chicago, Nov. 10, 2016. Megabus has notified the state of its plans to lay off 108 employees as it downsizes its Chicago operations. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Ally Marotti Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A restaurant on Michigan Avenue, Megabus and a truck company are among six companies that warned of about 650 looming layoffs in Illinois, according to notices filed with the state. Megabus, the discount interstate bus carrier, is planning to lay off 108 employees as it downsizes its Chicago operations from a hub into a bus stop on the way to other destinations, according to the notice. The Tribune first reported on the impending layoffs last month. Demand is down, Megabus spokesman Sean Hughes said then. About 30 bus drivers will remain based in Chicago. The timing is bad, right before the holidays, Stephen Sombrotto, president of United Workers of America, said Wednesday. The UAW union represents the bus drivers. Sombrotto said he hopes other Megabus hubs can pick up some of the lost jobs. (Robert Channick) \"As far as Megabus in this country, ... Chicago was the first hub,\" he said. \"It's basically reshuffling the deck and trying to optimize how their business runs.\" Also planning layoffs is The Grill on the Alley, a steakhouse in the Westin Michigan Avenue Hotel. It's preparing to lay off 44 employees Dec. 31, according to the notice. The Grill is part of a chain owned by Los Angeles-based Grill Concepts, and the Michigan Avenue location opened in 2000. Restaurant representatives were not immediately available to comment. Other companies that reported upcoming layoffs include: \u2022Ryder, a trucking company headquartered in Miami, which plans to lay off 142 employees from its Minooka location Feb. 4. \u2022Alabama Metal Industries Corp., a raw material processor, plans to lay off 86 workers in Kankakee County starting Jan. 31. \u2022PrimeSource Health Care Systems in Buffalo Grove, which reported it's closing and will start to lay off 159 employees Dec. 31. \u2022Shippers Warehouse of Illinois, which operates Ferrara Candy's warehouse in Bolingbrook, is scheduled to lay off 111 workers as a result of a lost contract, according to the notice. Ferrara, which makes candies such as Lemonheads and Atomic Fireballs, is transitioning to a new third-party provider for the warehouse, a spokesman said. The Shippers Warehouse layoffs are scheduled to begin on Jan. 30. The Illinois Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires employers with at least 75 employees to notify the state 60 days in advance of plant closures or layoffs. ",

The city saw its first infant case in July, when a child was born with Zika-related microcephaly , characterized by an abnormally small head or brain, often leading to significant developmental problems. In the four most recent cases, the infants were reported to have \"congenital Zika virus syndrome,\" which encompasses variety of issues \u2014 including microcephaly, brain and eye abnormalities, shortened or hardened muscles and tendons and neurologic impairment \u2014 according to the health department. Fighting Zika With GMO Mosquitoes Could Be the Future of Mosquito Control Eight other New York City infants tested positive for the virus but have shown no symptoms of related impairment or birth defects, department officials said, adding that all children in the city born to women infected by Zika will be monitored for symptoms for at least a year. More than 200 infants have been born to women with a Zika virus infection in New York City, according to the health department. \"Today's news is a reminder that Zika continues to be a threat to pregnant women and their babies,\" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement today. \"As we enter the holiday season, we urge all pregnant women in New York City, those who might become pregnant and their male sexual partners not to visit places where there is active Zika virus transmission,\" she added. \"We are closely following all babies born to mothers who test positive for Zika infection and will connect parents to available services to improve their child's quality of life.\" According to the health department, as of Dec. 2, at least 8,000 people in New York City have been tested for the Zika virus, with 962 people testing positive \u2014 325 of them pregnant women. All the Zika infections reported in the city were acquired while traveling to areas where the virus was more prevalent, except for six cases that were due to sexual contact, the agency said. Zika infection in adults often has mild symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 1 in 5 people infected with the virus shows symptoms. Severe complications from Zika that require hospitalization are rare, and most people are over the worst of the symptoms after a week, according to the CDC. 0 Shares ",

(Independent Police Review Authority) Terrence Clarke is suing a Chicago police officer over a June altercation at a River North Portillo\u2019s, alleging the off-duty officer instigated a fight, arrested him and conspired with other officers to cover it up. (Independent Police Review Authority) Elyssa Cherney Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A 61-year-old Canadian man is suing a Chicago police officer over a June 2015 altercation at a River North Portillo's, alleging that the off-duty officer instigated a fight, arrested him and conspired with other officers to cover it up. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Cook County Circuit Court by Terrence Clarke of Ontario, accuses Officer Khaled Shaar of excessive force and alleges that he, four other officers and the restaurant manager made false statements. The city released videos of the incident in June as part of a data dump of cases the Independent Police Review Authority has investigated. A restaurant surveillance video and a bystander cellphone video capture the beginning of the one-minute incident and Shaar punching Clarke at least seven times. On June 16, 2015, Shaar was walking around the business and stopped at Clarke's table, where he was eating with his wife and son, all wearing hockey sweaters after seeing a Blackhawks game. Shaar leans in to talk to them and removes an item from the table, the video shows. Before the encounter got physical, Clarke allegedly tossed a cup of cheese at the officer, the police report says. Clarke appears to throw something in the Portillo's surveillance video, which doesn't have audio. In a cellphone video taken by Clarke's son, Logan, Clarke tells Shaar, \"You took my food away from me\" as he is getting handcuffed and arrested on aggravated battery charges. \"After you cursed at me!\" Shaar shouts back. Logan Clarke yells, \"Is that reason to punch someone in the face?\" Shaar then says, \"Yeah.\" \"He battered me!\" Shaar responds.

Shaar was working security for the restaurant and began verbally and physically attacking Clarke according to Clarke's attorney. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Terrence Clarke was beaten by off duty Chicago Police Officer Khaled Shaar at a Portillo\u2019s Hot Dogs June 15, 2016, in River North. Shaar was working security for the restaurant and began verbally and physically attacking Clarke according to Clarke's attorney. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) A manager ushers the son away from the scene. Shaar has at least 15 police misconduct complaints since June 2007, records show. Michael Mintzer, an attorney for Terrence Clarke, said Shaar singled his client out and began antagonizing him before the encounter turned physical. \"Shaar repeatedly punched Mr. Clarke in the face while using his handcuffs as 'brass knuckles' resulting in severe lacerations and head injuries to Mr. Clarke,\" Mintzer said in a news release. \"This was all while Mr. Clarke's family watched in horror.\" Please check back for updates.

    "text": "By Ann Hornaday December 7 at 3:18 PM Follow @AnnHornaday Natalie Portman in \u201cJackie.\u201d (Stephanie Branchu/Fox Searchlight) In \u201cJackie,\u201d Natalie Portman portrays first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in the days immediately following John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. It is a period of glazed grief, profound anxiety and keen-eyed concern about her late husband\u2019s legacy, which she is shown cementing by choreographing a funeral procession modeled on Abraham Lincoln\u2019s and conducting an interview during which she very deliberately compares the Kennedy era to Camelot. Throughout the film, which opens this week in Washington, writer Noah Oppenheim and director Pablo Larra\u00edn simultaneously pay tribute to Jacqueline Kennedy\u2019s iconic persona and challenge it head-on. They portray her as the figure of superb grace, taste and strength that endeared her to millions of Americans but also as a woman with a shrewd sense of history and symbolism who was far more knowing, even calculating, than her demure public persona suggested. With its combination of rigorously detailed historical re-creation, real-life archival footage and purely speculative fantasy \u2014 not to mention Portman\u2019s searing physical and psychological performance \u2014 \u201cJackie\u201d creates an unsettling, almost hallucinatory mix of fact and fiction. No sooner has Larra\u00edn seamlessly transported Portman into Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s 1962 \u201cTour of the White House\u201d television special than he confects a fantastical montage in which she staggers in a druggy haze through the East Wing, sipping vodka and trying on couture gowns from a life that is rapidly receding into a dim and idealized past. \u201cJackie,\u201d in other words, is not a comfort-blanket biopic. Rather than reproduce the reassuring image of gentility and glamour we\u2019ve come to associate with Jacqueline Kennedy, it continually undermines that consensus version of one of the 20th century\u2019s most private public figures. Already, some viewers \u2014 especially baby boomers who came of age during the Kennedy era \u2014 have announced that they\u2019re not interested in having their view of Jacqueline Kennedy ruined by Larra\u00edn\u2019s countermyth. At a recent preview screening at the Avalon Theatre \u2014 named, appropriately enough, for another Arthurian enclave \u2014 a handful of viewers could be overheard expressing shock and dismay at being confronted with the fact that Mrs. Kennedy secretly smoked. As unsettling as \u201cJackie\u201d often is, it\u2019s also a consoling portrait of a time that, especially in this political season, in some ways seems worthy of halcyon legend after all. A week after her husband\u2019s murder, angered by historians and writers who are already challenging his accomplishments, Mrs. Kennedy summons a writer from Life magazine to the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port to advance her own version of the official narrative. Based on real-life journalist Theodore White, Billy Crudup\u2019s unnamed author dutifully records Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s dictation, ceding her full editorial control, including revealing erasures (\u201cI don\u2019t smoke,\u201d she insists icily) and the Camelot comparison. As contentious as their conversation is at times, it now seems quaint that there was once as trusted and far-reaching a journalistic institution as Life for Mrs. Kennedy to use to connect with her public. Even the political transition to Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration, while certainly fraught, proceeds apace with admirable decorum and gravitas. (Stephanie Branchu/Fox Searchlight) (Stephanie Branchu/Fox Searchlight) But planted within that fond look back are also the seeds of what was to come, seeds that the Kennedys themselves helped sow, wittingly or not, and that have now come into florid bloom. As figures who occupied the liminal space between politics and pop culture, they arguably presaged a time, 50 years later, when a reality-TV star could not just credibly run for president, but win. Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s invention and adroit deployment of the Camelot myth \u2014 which took firm hold despite some skeptical howls \u2014 looks relatively benign when juxtaposed with the fake news and outright falsehoods promulgated by the incoming administration, from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that 3\u00a0million people voted illegally in November to a virulent hoax involving the Washington pizzeria Comet Ping Pong that resulted in an armed gunman entering the restaurant this past weekend. [ Pizzagate: From rumor, to hashtag, to gunfire in D.C. ] Alarmists might suggest that our willingness to indulge artistic liberties on the big screen has inured us to the far more consequential distortions that now plague a \u201cpost-fact\u201d culture. But there\u2019s a crucial difference between creative license and lying. In \u201cJackie,\u201d Larra\u00edn announces his intention to depart from literal truth from the very beginning of the film when we hear the eerie, disorienting chords of Mica Levi\u2019s boldly abstract score. Throughout the movie, through sound, image and Portman\u2019s uncanny performance \u2014 often captured in claustrophobic, hyper-real close-ups \u2014 the filmmakers make clear that their goal isn\u2019t to deceive viewers with pseudo-documentary \u201cauthenticity\u201d but to provoke and challenge our most dearly held assumptions about what counts as authentic at all. Similarly, even the most contested fact-based movies in recent history \u2014 \u201c JFK ,\u201d \u201c Zero Dark Thirty \u201d and \u201c Selma \u201d among them \u2014 were obviously their authors\u2019 impressions of events rather than raw feeds of the events themselves, if only because they were so clearly and explicitly framed. Everything about the filmgoing experience, from the smell of the popcorn to the size of the screen, conditions us to process what we\u2019re seeing as entertainment \u2014 and, sometimes, art. We\u2019ve now entered a mass-media space in which the most crucial frames have disappeared. The facts that filmmakers use as fodder for leaps of interpretive imagination are now being routinely warped (or, more commonly, disregarded) in service to the dark arts of demagoguery, with grave life-and-death stakes. When Washington Post reporters interviewed purveyors of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory this week, one of them lightheartedly compared it to the same kind of hobbyism practiced by assassination buffs who take \u201cJFK\u201d as gospel; another called his amateur Pizzagate investigation \u201ca work of art.\u201d Of course, to really appreciate a work of art, one needs critical thinking skills \u2014 a value embodied in \u201cJackie\u201d by the title character but one that has been cast aside over years of politicians and pundits fulminating against \u201chistorically inaccurate\u201d films while willfully ignoring the growing importance of media literacy, especially in public schools. As \u201cJackie\u201d reminds us, there might have been a time when Americans relied on consensus history, agreed-upon facts and shared notions of objective reality to acquit our participatory duties as informed citizens. Today, we\u2019re more apt to pick and choose which narratives to accept, as if we\u2019re deciding which movie we want to see at the multiplex on Friday night. In both equations, what we crave isn\u2019t accuracy as much as fealty to our own self-selected viewpoints, a trade-off easily accommodated by an increasingly balkanized media culture. We\u2019re all on the verge of becoming those ladies at the Avalon, reluctant to allow anyone to mess with our myths. The question is whether the islands we\u2019ve built for ourselves can thrive simply by cultivating our most cherished fictions, while facts as we used to know them wither and die on the vine.

A \u201cJeopardy!\u201d episode airing next week has taken an emotional turn after one of its contestants, Cindy Stowell, died of cancer at the age of 41 on Monday. Stowell, a science-content developer from Austin, Texas, taped the quiz show back in August, and the episode is set to premiere on Dec. 13, a \u201cJeopardy!\u201d spokesperson confirmed. This marks the first posthumous airing of a contestant\u2019s appearance. \u201cWhen Cindy Stowell taped her appearance on \u2018Jeopardy!,\u2019 she had Stage IV cancer. Competing on \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and we\u2019re glad she was able to do so,\u201d said host Alex Trebek in a statement provided to The Post. \u201cSadly, Cindy died on Dec. 5. All of us at \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 offer our condolences and best wishes to her family and friends.\u201d Her death and forthcoming \u201cJeopardy!\u201d appearance\u00a0was first announced on Twitter\u00a0by her longtime boyfriend Jason Hess, who posted that \u201cShe was fighting a high-grade fever (which turned out to be a blood infection) and was on painkillers while taping.\u201d Stowell competed with the goal of donating her prize winnings to cancer-related organizations. \u201cCindy came on \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 to play the game she loved and in doing so, she was able to make a contribution to cancer research in the hopes that no one else would have to go through what she did,\u201d said Hess and her parents, Greg and Carole Stowell, in a joint statement. Only Trebek and a select group of staffers knew that she was sick. Stowell, who had a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, first passed the online audition test in early 2016, and received an invitation to an in-person audition in Oklahoma City this past summer. She was able to tape three weeks after qualifying, when she informed a show producer that she had recently been told by her doctor that she had about six months to live. ",

    "text": "WATCH Health Care: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Repealing President Barack Obama's health care law without a replacement risks making nearly 30 million people uninsured, according to a study released Wednesday. Separately, a professional group representing benefit advisers warned congressional leaders of the risk of \"significant market disruption\" that could cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance. Republicans dismiss such dire scenarios, saying that they are working on replacement legislation for a President Donald Trump to sign. Nonetheless, the complex two-stage strategy the GOP Congress is contemplating has raised concerns not only among supporters of the law, but also industries like hospitals and insurers. The plan is for Congress to first use a special budget-related procedure to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act , or ACA, next year. The effective date of that repeal would be delayed by months or even years to give lawmakers time to write replacement legislation. The replacement law would presumably do many of the same things that \"Obamacare\" does, such as subsidizing coverage and protecting people with health problems. But it would not involve as much federal regulation, and it would eliminate a highly unpopular requirement that most Americans get health insurance or face fines. The new study from the nonpartisan Urban Institute looks at a scenario where \"repeal\" goes through, but \"replace\" stalls. It predicts heavy collateral damage for people buying individual health insurance policies independent of government markets like HealthCare.gov. Though nonpartisan, the Urban Institute generally supports the goal of extending coverage to all Americans. Previously it has criticized some of the subsidies provided under Obama's law as insufficient. The new analysis warns that repealing major parts of the health law without a clear replacement could upend the health insurance market for people buying their coverage directly, outside of the workplace. That group has grown substantially under the health care law, but also includes millions of other customers. The study found that 22.5 million people would lose coverage directly due to repeal of the law's subsidies, Medicaid expansion , and its individual requirement to carry health insurance. Another 7.3 million would become uninsured because of the ripple effects of market upheavals. That could happen if insurers lose confidence in the Republican promise of a replacement and abandon the individual market. A key industry worry is that a repeal law would get rid of subsidies and mandates but still leave insurers on the hook for covering people with health problems. The number of uninsured people would rise to nearly 59 million in 2019, since the ACA did not completely eliminate the problem of people without coverage. As a result, the nation would have a higher uninsured rate than when the ACA passed in 2010, the study found. Federal and state governments would save billions, but the potential price would be social dislocation and a political backlash. \"This scenario does not just move the country back to the situation before the ACA,\" the study concluded. \"It moves the country to a situation with higher uninsurance rates than was the case before the ACA's reforms. The concerns raised by the Urban Institute study were underscored Wednesday in a letter to congressional leaders from the American Academy of Actuaries. The group represents professionals who advise corporations and government on how to design and maintain benefit programs like pension and health care plans. The actuaries said even if Congress delays the date of repeal, the uncertainty could prompt insurers to stop offering individual plans for people not covered by employers. \"Delaying the effective date of repeal while a replacement is worked out likely won't be enough to assure the stability and sustainability of the individual market,\" wrote Shari Westerfield, the group's vice president for health care practice. Earlier, hospitals warned that they would suffer heavy financial losses if Congress repeals coverage for millions of new paying customers. Those would be magnified if lawmakers leave in place cuts that hospitals accepted as part of the deal to pass the Obama health law. Insurers are also uneasy, even if the ACA hasn't turned out to be as profitable as expected. Republicans say they won't allow chaos to happen. \"We are not going to rip health care out of the hands of Americans,\" House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said in a recent interview with Associated Press reporters and editors. \"Republicans are going to give Americans choices and an appropriate transition.\" 0 Shares ",

He is the third retired general and second Marine picked by Trump for top-level administration positions. USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump talks to the media as he stands with retired Marine general John Kelly, right, at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., on Nov. 20, 2016. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to head Homeland Security\u00a0is a blunt-talking retired Marine general who would become part of a small but influential team\u00a0of former military officers with powerful influence over security policy in the next administration. John Kelly\u00a0is a widely\u00a0respected combat leader who served as an enlisted Marine before becoming an officer and retiring this year after more than 40 years in the service. \u201cThere could be no better choice,\u201d said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a Marine who served in Iraq.\u00a0\u201cMarines get stuff done.\u201d Kelly, 66, is the third retired general and second Marine picked by Trump for top-level administration positions. Trump also chose Jim Mattis, a retired Marine four-star general, to be Defense secretary and retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser. During the campaign, Trump suggested that President Obama had suppressed advice from top military commanders.\u00a0Now the president-elect appears to be drawing on some of those\u00a0overlooked leaders. Trump adds DHS secretary, China ambassador and EPA chief to team Trump has said he wanted to overhaul the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State and has spoken favorably of iconic World War II commanders George Patton and Douglas MacArthur. Kelly and Mattis, along with Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, currently chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, served together in the 2003 Iraq invasion, an experience that drew the men close and helped shaped their views as they rose to top military positions. Trump appears to be seeking men with combat experience who understand the resolve needed to defeat an enemy on the battlefield. Kelly would replace Jeh Johnson, a lawyer who has served in top government positions, as secretary of Homeland Security. Those who know Mattis and Kelly say they are thoughtful strategists aware of the limits of military power. \u201cWords like \u2018won\u2019 or \u2018victory\u2019 really do not apply when speaking of counterinsurgency operations,\u201d Kelly wrote in an official Marine Corps history. \u201cInsurgencies grow from problems and discontent within a given society.\u201d Returning to Iraq in 2008, Kelly developed close bonds with tribal sheiks in western Iraq where Marines were based, helping win support for coalition efforts there. \u201cHe left a lasting impression\u201d on the sheiks, said Sterling Jensen, a civilian who worked on the staff of the I Marine Expeditionary Force there. As head of U.S. Southern Command for three\u00a0years until he retired, Kelly developed relationships throughout Latin America. \"He is a strategist,\" said\u00a0 Juan Carlos Pinz\u00f3n , the Colombian ambassador to the United States and his\u00a0country's former defense minister. Pinzon said Kelly built partnerships\u00a0with countries in the region but never\u00a0dictated the terms of relationships. \"He was very helpful to us,\" Pinzon said. Mattis and Kelly have reputations for their blunt talk. Hunter said Kelly \u201ccrossed\u201d the Obama administration over closing Guantanamo Bay, the military detention center in Cuba, and opening\u00a0the Marine Corps infantry to women.\u00a0The Obama administration wants to transfer the detainees in Guantanamo and close the facility. While at Southern Command, which oversees the base, Kelly defended conditions at the facility, saying detainees received excellent medical care and were treated humanely. He also argued that the remaining detainees at the facility were dangerous. \"Every one has real, no-kidding intelligence on them that brought them there,\u201d he told Military Times in an interview.\u00a0\"There are no innocent men down there.\" Kelly, a\u00a0longtime infantryman or \u201cgrunt,\u201d expressed worries about opening the infantry to women. The Marine Corps\u00a0requested a waiver last year to the administration's policy, citing a study that showed the inclusion of women\u00a0could reduce combat effectiveness. Defense Secretary Ash Carter denied the waiver. \u201cDoes it make us more lethal? If the answer to that is \u2026 yes, then do it,\u201d Kelly told reporters earlier this year. \u201cIf the answer to that is no, clearly don't do it.\u201d On Memorial Day answering the question: Was sacrifice worth it? The Boston native has a strong affinity for the Marines in his charge. Kelly is \u201cheartfelt and emotional,\u201d said Jim Howcroft, a retired Marine intelligence officer who served with him. Kelly knows firsthand\u00a0the cost of sending Americans into battle.\u00a0In 2010, Kelly\u2019s son, 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, 29, was killed in action while leading a platoon of Marines in Afghanistan's Helmand province. In a Memorial Day speech in New York last year, he spoke about the impact of his son\u2019s death, saying he struggled with the question of whether the sacrifice was worth it.\u00a0He said the answer came to him at Arlington National Cemetery when burying his son. \"It didn't matter what I thought,\" Kelly said. \"It doesn't matter what the living think.\" \"He had decided it was ... important to be where he was that morning in the Sangin River Valley, Afghanistan, to be doing what he was doing that morning with his Marines and his Navy docs that he loved so much and led so well,\" Kelly said. \"Was it worth his life?\" Kelly asked. \"It's not for me to say.\" 7692 CONNECT TWEET 19 LINKEDIN 61 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gWcnNB ",

Here are the names of people who have been confirmed dead by the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office Coroner\u2019s Bureau or immediate family members. Did you know one... (Los Angeles Times Staff) The searchers worked 12-hour\u00a0shifts. They tried to operate around the clock but had to stop periodically because of structural concerns about the building. Officials said it was important that the search be done both methodically and respectfully, to preserve evidence for investigators while\u00a0keeping in mind the grief of the families waiting for answers. All the while, there was concern that some searchers could be hurt by falling debris and collapsing structures. Some workers collected evidence in the warehouse that\u00a0was examined\u00a0outside.\u00a0 \u201cIt was quiet. It was heartbreaking,\u201d\u00a0Melinda Drayton, an Oakland Fire Department battalion\u00a0chief, told reporters during one of the news\u00a0conferences in front of the warehouse.\u00a0 As the recovery effort continued, deputies sat down with victims\u2019 family members, many of whom shared mementos, photos and memories. \u201cThey wanted us to know who we were dealing with,\u201d Alameda County\u00a0Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly said. Others showed text messages they had received from those trapped by the flames. Many were simple:\u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d\u00a0Some, harrowing:\u00a0\u201cI am going to die,\u201d one victim wrote to her mother. At least 36 people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) With recovery efforts now over, authorities have focused on the cause of the devastation. Officials have said they are examining possible electrical problems with a refrigerator and other appliances, although they stressed they have not made any final determinations and that it could take several weeks to find an answer. A small area along a back wall of the building is believed to be the fire\u2019s point of origin. Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories The blaze appears to have started on the first floor, said Jill A. Snyder, special agent in charge\u00a0of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in San Francisco. The victims were trapped and overtaken by smoke that traveled up internal stairwells. \u201cThe fire was well-developed by the time second-floor occupants realized there was a fire going on the first floor,\u201d she said. The building had two internal staircases connecting the top and bottom floors, but no fire exits to the outside from the second floor. Investigators determined the warehouse was not equipped with fire alarms or a fire suppression system, Snyder said. They also still need to determine the layout of the gutted building. Former residents of the warehouse have described it as a serious fire danger, littered with trash and old furniture and lacking fire sprinklers. Photos from inside the building taken before the fire show a maze of electrical wires as well as a heating system that appeared to be hooked up to portable propane generators. The Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship lies in ruins Monday after a weekend fire that killed 36 people. Jay L.

The Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship lies in ruins Monday after a weekend fire that killed 36 people. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) City officials said it was zoned for use as a warehouse, not for housing or as a concert venue. Jean\u00a0M. Daly, a former arson prosecutor in Los Angeles and San Francisco who specializes in fire cases, said fire investigators study a flame\u2019s burn patterns and intensity. \u201cThe heavier the damage, the longer the burn, the more likely it is the area of origin,\u201d Daly said. She added that wiring and appliances believed to be involved would undergo microscopic lab examinations. The age of the warehouse\u2019s wiring will also be an issue, said Robert Rowe, a former Downey Fire Department marshal. \u201cBack when this was a warehouse, its electrical system was designed for a particular purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cBut modern equipment, laptops, chargers, sound systems, air conditioners and fridges place a very different burden on the system.\u201d The fire has raised concerns about nonpermitted dwellings throughout the city. Oakland officials have begun releasing administrative records concerning the building known as the\u00a0Ghost Ship, which was the focus of nearly\u00a0two dozen building code complaints or other city actions over the past 30 years. At least three of the complaints appeared to assert that structures had been built\u00a0inside the warehouse without permits or that the property was\u00a0being used as a residence. Others\u00a0cited illegal parking\u00a0and mounds of debris piled up on the sidewalk and in an adjoining vacant lot. An inspector who visited the warehouse 15 days before the fire to investigate a possible \u201cillegal interior building structure\u201d\u00a0was unable to get inside. According to Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, the city followed up by sending\u00a0a request to the warehouse owner to gain entry. City Planning and Building Department reports released Wednesday, however, indicate\u00a0only that the city sent\u00a0a violation notice demanding\u00a0debris outside the building be cleaned up. Schaaf said the city eventually would release records of all violations and other actions related to the warehouse, documents requested by numerous news outlets under California\u2019s public records laws. By Wednesday afternoon, the Ghost Ship had nearly emptied.\u00a0 Fire crews folded up ladders and placed\u00a0shovels on the back of a vehicle. Tents stationed in front of the building for days were disassembled. TV news cameras disappeared.\u00a0Oakland fire trucks backed out of the site and drove away.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , California\u2019s new legislative session began in dramatic fashion , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , and former L.A.

Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Here is some background information on Pruitt. (Dec. 7, 2016) President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Here is some background information on Pruitt. (Dec. 7, 2016) Chris Mooney, Brady Dennis, Steven MufsonThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Scott Pruitt , the attorney general of the oil and gas intensive state of Oklahoma, to head the Environmental Protection Agency , a move signaling an assault on President Barack Obama 's climate change and environmental legacy. Pruitt has spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead. He is the third of Trump appointees who have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run. Ben Carson , named to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has expressed a deep aversion to the social safety net programs and fair housing initiatives that have been central to that agency's activities. Betsy DeVos , named Education secretary, has a passion for private school vouchers that critics say undercut the public school systems at the core of the government's mission. The news about the choice of Pruitt was confirmed by a transition official, who would not speak for attribution before the official announcement. Pruitt, who has written that the debate on climate change is \"far from settled,\" joined a coalition of state attorneys general in suing the agency's Clean Power Plan, the principal Obama-era policy aimed at reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. He also has sued, with fellow state attorneys general, over the EPA's recently announced regulations seeking to curtail the emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the oil and gas sector. On his Linked In page, Pruitt boasts of being \"a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.\" As Donald Trump continues to indicate that he might be willing to change his position on climate change, which he has long called a \"hoax,\" the president-elect met Monday with former vice president Al Gore, who has become a prominent activist in the fight against global warming. Gore was originally... As Donald Trump continues to indicate that he might be willing to change his position on climate change, which he has long called a \"hoax,\" the president-elect met Monday with former vice president Al Gore, who has become a prominent activist in the fight against global warming. Gore was originally... (Jenna Johnson, Juliet Eilperin) After he was elected attorney general in 2010, Pruitt established a \"Federalism Unit\" to \"more effectively combat unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach by federal agencies, boards and offices,\" according to his online bio. And he has gone on to challenge the administration not just over the environment but over a host of other areas. He joined other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit over Obama's immigration policies. He has also sued the administration over the Affordable Care Act, saying the health care mandate on religious employers to provide coverage including contraception was unconstitutional. He has sued over the Dodd-Frank financial reform. An ally of the energy industry, Pruitt, along with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, came to the defense ExxonMobil when it fell under investigation by attorneys general from more liberal states seeking information about whether the oil giant failed to disclose material information about climate change. An adviser to Donald Trump says NASA should no longer conduct climate research, a proposal that has been swiftly condemned by leaders in the Earth science and climate communities. Bob Walker, who advised the Trump campaign on space policy,\u00a0 told the Guardian that NASA should focus on space and leave...

(Jason Samenow) \"We do not doubt the sincerity of the beliefs of our fellow attorneys general about climate change and the role human activity plays in it,\" they wrote at the conservative publication National Review. \"But we call upon them to press those beliefs through debate, not through governmental intimidation of those who disagree with them.\" In an interview with The Washington Post in September, as a Washington, D.C., federal appeals court was preparing to hear arguments over the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt detailed why he has remained a leading opponent of the EPA's efforts to curb carbon emissions by regulating power plants. \"What concerns the states is the process, the procedures, the authority that the EPA is exerting that we think is entirely inconsistent with its constitutional and statutory authority,\" he said at the time. Agencies such as the EPA, he said, should not be trying to \"pinch hit\" for Congress. \"This is a unique approach by EPA, whether they want to acknowledge it or not,\" he said of the provisions of the Clean Air Act that the agency had relied upon to write new regulations. \"The overreach is the statutes do not permit [EPA officials] to act in the way they are. They tend to have this approach that the end justifies the means . . . They tend to justify it by saying this big issue, this is an important issue.\" But he added that's where Congress should have authority, not EPA. \"This is something from a constitutional and statutory perspective that causes great concern.\" Environmental groups reacted with alarm Wednesday at the nomination. And New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman vowed to \"use the full power\" of his office to wage a legal battle to \"compel\" enforcement of environmental laws under Trump. \"Scott Pruitt has a record of attacking the environmental protections that EPA is charged with enforcing. He has built his political career by trying to undermine EPA's mission of environmental protection,\" said Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund . \"Our country needs - and deserves - an EPA administrator who is guided by science, who respects America's environmental laws, and who values protecting the health and safety of all Americans ahead of the lobbying agenda of special interests.\" Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that \"over the past five years, Pruitt has used his position as Oklahoma's top prosecutor to sue the EPA in a series of attempts to deny Americans the benefits of reducing mercury, arsenic, and other toxins from the air we breathe; cutting smog that can cause asthma attacks; and protecting our wetlands and streams.\" Pruitt has also fought to limit the scope of the federal government in regulating pollution of rivers under the Waters of the United States rule. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who has been active on environmental issues, said, \"Scott Pruitt would have EPA stand for Every Polluter's Ally.\" In 2014, the New York Times reported that a letter ostensibly written by Pruitt alleging that the agency overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of the state's largest oil and gas companies. Industry representatives expressed satisfaction with the choice Wednesday. \"The office he headed was present and accounted for in the battle to keep EPA faithful to its statutory authority and respectful of the role of the states in our system of cooperative federalism,\" said Scott Segal, head of the policy group at the lobbying and legal firm Bracewell. \"Given that we are almost two decades overdue for an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, there is interest on both sides of the aisle to look at that statute.\" David Rivkin, a constitutional litigator who represented Pruitt and Oklahoma in challenging the Clean Power Plan, said he believed Pruitt would be able to make sure the EPA lives up to its mission of protecting air and water while avoiding federal overreach. \"General Pruitt has been the leader among the AGs in defending federalism, the key feature of our constitutional architecture,\" said Rivkin, a partner at Baker Hosteler, adding that he believed Pruitt would \"ensure both environmental protection and constitutional fidelity.\" Pruitt's outlook reflects his home state: Oklahoma ranked fifth in the nation in onshore crude oil output in 2014, has five oil refineries, and is home to the giant Cushing oil storage and trading hub, where the price for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate grade is set every day. Although oil and natural gas production sagged in the 1990s and early 2000s, the surge in horizontal fracturing, or fracking, has boosted output. The state's natural gas output accounts for 10 percent of the nation's overall total. For the week ended Oct. 28, there were 73 drilling rigs in operation in Oklahoma. Pruitt has served as head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, a group that has relied heavily on funds from ultraconservative groups and the oil industry. The biggest contributors this year included the Judicial Crisis Network, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute of Legal Reform, Sheldon Adelson , oil conglomerate Koch Industries and Murray Energy, a leading coal mining company. Pruitt, a Kentucky native who moved to Oklahoma to attend the University of Tulsa law school, has also been active in religious groups. He serves as deacon of the First Baptist Church of Broken Arrow. In 2012, Pruitt was named a trustee of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Before serving as attorney general, he was a member of the state legislature. Dallas investor Doug Deason, a friend of Pruitt, said he expects the Oklahoma attorney general to immediately get to work rolling back the EPA's \"silly overreach\" and to let states handle environmental oversight. \"Just like most Republican attorney generals, especially in energy-producing states, he has been really frustrated with the government and the EPA's overreach into everything,\" Deason said. But Deason said liberals will be happily surprised by Pruitt's \"open-minded\" attitude, adding that he is \"willing to look at things.\" \"He will bring a more balanced, logical look\" at environmental regulation,\" he said. Pruitt's selection was strongly supported by Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm. The nomination suggests an extraordinarily tough road ahead for the Clean Power Plan, president Obama's signature climate policy. However, the precise fate of the regulation most immediately turns on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which has not yet ruled in the lawsuit brought by Pruitt and his fellow attorneys general against the agency Pruitt is now named to lead. \"Some have suggested that Pruitt's hands might be tied because he participated in litigation against the agency,\" Segal said in an email. \"This is a silly position. There is no conflict in representing your state on litigation dealing with rules of general applicability and then serving your nation as a federal official.\" Dismantling the regulation if it survives the courts would not be simple, because the agency has already finalized it - meaning that to undo and replace it would require a public notice and comment process. Environmental groups would likely sue the agency over such a move. However, some of the Clean Power Plan's objectives appear to have been already realized long before it came into effect. The United States is already burning less coal and more natural gas, meaning fewer carbon dioxide emissions. In 2030, the EPA projected in its final Clean Power Plan rule, coal would be reduced to providing 27 percent of U.S. electricity, with natural gas at 33 percent. Yet this very year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas will provide 34 percent of U.S. electricity, and coal 30 percent.

Prospect ranking: No. 1 in baseball by Baseball America and MLB.com last year. Highest level achieved:... The White Sox acquired four Red Sox prospects in exchange for five-time All-Star Chris Sale on Tuesday. Here's a look at who they are. Yoan Moncada Positions: Second base, third base. Prospect ranking: No. 1 in baseball by Baseball America and MLB.com last year. Highest level achieved:... (Colleen Kane) \"Yeah, we traded Chris Sale \u2014 that's not something you feel great about,\" Hahn said. \"That's not a feather in your cap, so to speak. But this is where we are. \u2026 This is a necessary step in the process, and there are going to be some painful spots along the way like when we have to say goodbye to important players like Chris and Adam. \"(We hope the fans) are starting to see some of the long-term benefit and what the goal of the plan is.\" Trades of this nature \u2014 solid major-league players for well-regarded prospects \u2014 can't truly be judged until a few years down the road. But the Eaton deal was perhaps more surprising in its return than the Sale trade that brought back top overall prospect Yoan Moncada and 30th-ranked Michael Kopech, along with two others. MLB.com ranks Giolito the No. 3 prospect nationally \u2014 and the top pitching prospect \u2014 while Lopez is rated No. 38. Dunning was the 29th overall draft pick this summer. Eaton is a valuable player \u2014 a two-time Gold Glove finalist and a .290 hitter valued at 15.4 WAR during his three years with the Sox. But he's not a five-time All-Star like Sale, so the acquisition of three solid arms looks pretty good on paper. \"We view all three of them, actually, as having the potential to become front-end of the rotation fixtures for us over an extended period of time,\" Hahn said. Giolito and Lopez both made their major-league debuts midway through the 2016 season and they could have a chance to compete at the major-league level in 2017. But Hahn said they also might need more seasoning at Triple A. Giolito, 22, posted a 2.97 ERA with three minor-league teams in 2016. In six appearances with the Nationals, he had a 6.75 ERA with 11 strikeouts and 12 walks in 21 1/3 innings. Lopez, 22, had a 3.21 ERA and 126 strikeouts over 19 starts last season at Double A and Triple A and a 4.91 ERA with 42 strikeouts and 22 walks in 44 innings in 11 major-league games. \"These are guys who came quick and got to the highest level at a young age,\" Hahn said. \"They're not finished products. We are very optimistic about their ceilings and their ability to force the issue and get themselves to Chicago quickly, but we're going to do that on the timeline that their performance dictates as opposed to potentially a need in Chicago immediately.\" The two-day return is a partial credit to the affordable contracts the Sox negotiated with Sale and Eaton. Sale had three years, $38 million left on his deal, while Eaton has five years, $38.4 million left on his contract. General manager Mike Rizzo said the contract was one of several factors that drove the Nationals to acquire Eaton. His ability to make contact and hit for some power as well as his energy and hustle were among the things Rizzo listed that also made him a key player for the Sox since he was acquired from the Diamondbacks in a three-team trade before the 2014 season. Eaton is a career .284 hitter with a .771 OPS, 96 doubles, 34 triples and 34 home runs in parts of five major-league seasons. The Nationals also had been in discussions for Sale. Rizzo said the Eaton deal gained momentum after the Sox opted to send Sale to the Red Sox. \"Adam fit our club perfectly \u2014 left-handed bat, balanced our line-up, high-energy guy, edge to him, plays the game the right way, good hitter, good defensive player both in center field and outstanding in the corner,\" Rizzo said. \"A productive player throughout his career. We see the arrow still going up with him.\" Given Eaton's control through 2021, the Sox could have chosen to keep him in the rebuilding process, but they added instead to a younger core that has everyone from manager Rick Renteria and the players themselves buzzing. And that might only grow bigger as rumors continue about left-hander Jose Quintana, third baseman Todd Frazier and closer David Robertson. On an introductory conference call, Moncada and Kopech said Wednesday they were excited to be a part of the rebuilding process. \"I'm extremely honored to be a part of this,\" Kopech said. \"Chris Sale is obviously one of the top pitchers in baseball, and to kind of be on the back end of this trade, I feel incredible about it. It really makes me want to, if nothing else, prove the White Sox right. I'm excited to get after it.'' ",

Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., called for Senate passage of the 21st Century Cures Act on Monday. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., Sen. Chris Murphy D-Conn., Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., called for Senate passage of the 21st Century Cures Act on Monday. Alex Wong/Getty Images The 21st Century Cures Act that gained congressional approval on Wednesday has been championed as a way to speed up drug development, but it's also the most significant piece of mental health legislation since the 2008 law requiring equal insurance coverage for mental and physical health. The bill includes provisions aimed at fighting the opioid epidemic, strengthens laws mandating parity for mental and physical health care and includes grants to increase the number of psychologists and psychiatrists, who are in short supply across the country. It also would push states to provide early intervention for psychosis, a treatment program that has been hailed as one of the most promising mental health developments in decades. \"It is time to fix our broken mental health care system,\" says Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician whose mental health bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who worked with Cassidy on the bill, says he hopes to alleviate the suffering of people with serious mental illness. \"I'd heard too many devastating stories of people struggling with serious mental illness and addiction whose lives were forever changed because they couldn't get the care they need,\" Murphy says. \"I'd seen up close the heartbreak and frustration that families suffered trying to find care for a loved one \u2014 care that seemed impossible to find and even harder to pay for.\" Article continues after sponsorship But Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., says he's concerned that proposed Republican changes to the health care system could undercut any progress made by the bill. Millions of Americans with mental illness could lose coverage if Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act or cuts spending on Medicaid, which pays for about 25 percent of all mental health care, he says. Many mental health advocates celebrated the bill's passage. Ronald Honberg, national director of policy and legal affairs at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, called the bill's mental health provisions \"necessary and promising.\" He says he appreciates the bill's focus on \"preventing the most horrific consequences of untreated mental illness,\" including homelessness, incarceration and suicide. The bill generally requires states to use at least 10 percent of their mental health block grants on early intervention for psychosis, using a model called coordinated specialty care, which provides a team of specialists to provide psychotherapy, medication, education and support for patients' families, as well as services to help young people stay in school or their jobs. Research from the National Institutes of Health shows that people who receive this kind of care stay in treatment longer; have greater improvement in their symptoms, personal relationships and quality of life; and are more involved in work or school compared to people who receive standard care. The bill also sets up a $5 million grant program to provide assertive community treatment , one of the most successful strategies for helping people with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Like the early intervention program, assertive community treatment is designed to provide a team of professionals that is on call 24 hours a day. The bill also expands a grant program for assisted outpatient treatment, which provides court-ordered care for people with serious mental illness who might otherwise not seek help. Although the bill authorizes these grants, a future Congress would have to approve funding for the programs. \"The fact that a program has been authorized is no guarantee that it will be funded,\" Honberg says. \"It's a necessary first step.\" Mental health advocates will lobby for Congress to approve funding for the most critical programs, Honberg says. Winners And Losers With The 21st Century Cures Bill While funding treatments for mental illness is expensive, \"it's more expensive to ignore it,\" says Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, who co-sponsored mental health legislation in the House that folded into the 21st Century Cures Act. Other sections of the bill, based on legislation introduced by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, give communities more flexibility in how they use federal grants. For example, communities could use community policing grants to train law enforcement officers to deal with patients in the midst of a psychiatric crisis. Another provision would require the U.S. attorney general to create at least one drug and mental health court pilot program, which would aim to help people with mental illness or drug addiction receive treatment, rather than jail time, after committing minor offenses.

Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc. The legislation will help \"those suffering from mental illness in the criminal justice system can begin to recover and get the help they need instead of just getting sicker and sicker,\" Cornyn says. \"This bill also encourages the creation of crisis intervention teams, so that our law enforcement officers and first responders can know how to de-escalate dangerous confrontations. This is about finding ways to help the mentally ill individual get help while keeping the community safe at the same time.\" The mental health provisions have been scaled back significantly since they were first introduced. An earlier version of a bill introduced in the House of Representatives would have changed a federal privacy law to allow doctors, under certain circumstances, to share mentally ill adults' medical information with their family caregivers. Doctors today often shut families out of their loved one's care , refusing to share even basic information, such as appointment times, for fear of violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. Many health professionals misunderstand HIPAA, refusing to listen to the families of patients who are too disabled by psychosis to provide key details of their medical history, says Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., who first introduced the House bill in 2013 in response to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Some advocates for the disabled objected to that change, however, arguing that patient privacy is essential, and that people might avoid care if they believe their doctors might disclose confidential information. The legislation instructs the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to clarify when doctors can share patients' medical information with family caregivers, as well as educate health care providers about what the law actually says. \"It's a step in the right direction,\" Honberg says. \"There is so much misinformation about HIPAA. It's one of the most mischaracterized laws out there.\" The bill also aims to better coordinate mental health care. Although eight federal agencies today fund 112 programs that provide mental health care, these agencies rarely coordinate their efforts to make sure patients get the help they need and to avoid duplicating services, says Tim Murphy. The bill would make structural changes to the way federal agencies provide mental health services: A new committee would link leaders of key agencies involved in mental health care, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Justice and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. A new position \u2014 the assistant secretary for mental health and substance use \u2014 would oversee SAMHSA and promote the most successful approaches to treating mental illness. An advisory board, the National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory, would analyze treatments and services to help decide which ones should be expanded. Chris Murphy said he wishes the final bill had included more resources for outpatient mental health care, as well as for inpatient hospital bills for people in psychiatric crisis. He also said the current bill provides a starting point but that he hopes Congress will continue working to improve mental health care in its next session. \"This doesn't solve all the problems in the mental health system,\" says Chris Murphy, noting that Congress may still need to change the HIPAA law to allow families to better care for people with mental illness. \"We may still have to look at this down the line.\" ",

Freedom du Lac December 7 at 4:03 PM Follow @jfdulac A structure and vehicle damaged from the wildfires around Gatlinburg, Tenn. (Michael Patrick/Knoxville News Sentinel via AP) Two juveniles have been charged with aggravated arson in connection with the East Tennessee wildfires that killed 14 people last week and left nearly 150 others injured, authorities said Wednesday. During an investigation, \u201cinformation was developed that two juveniles allegedly started the fire,\u201d the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. A petition was filed Wednesday in juvenile court charging the juveniles with aggravated arson, the TBI said. Both were taken into custody Wednesday morning and are being held at the Sevier County Juvenile Detention Center. Additional charges \u201care being considered,\u201d District Attorney General Jimmy B. Dunn said at a news conference in Sevierville, Tenn. \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d The suspects are Tennessee residents, Dunn said. No additional information about the youths was made available, including their age and gender. \u201cI understand that you have a lot of questions,\u201d Dunn told reporters. \u201cHowever, the law does not allow for the disclosure of additional information at this time.\u201d The \u201cChimney Tops 2\u201d fire was first reported Nov. 23 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Gatlinburg, according to the National Park Service. The wildfire exploded on Nov. 28, as massive walls of flames spread down the mountains into Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge with shocking speed, according to those who fled with little more than the clothes on their backs. Lt. Steve Coker of the Sevierville Fire Dept. captured video of the wildfires burning in eastern Tennessee as his fire crew moved through the town of Gatlinburg on Nov. 28. (Twitter @alliecoker7) The fires that engulfed the two tourist towns outside the park and shut down one of the country\u2019s most popular natural attractions left more than\u00a01,750 structures damaged or destroyed, most of them single-family residences. Additionally, thousands of wooded acres burned in the most-visited national park in the United States. \u201cTo the residents of Sevier County: We stand with you and are committed to making sure justice is served in this case,\u201d TBI Director Mark Gwyn said at the news conference Wednesday. He added : \u201cOur promise is that we will do every effort to help bring closure to those who have lost so much.\u201d The investigation, Gwyn said, is ongoing.

By Philip Rucker and Mike DeBonis December 7 at 6:43 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @mikedebonis President-elect Donald Trump has selected retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security, officials familiar with the decision said Wednesday, recruiting a third former member of the military\u2019s brass to serve at the highest levels of his administration. Trump\u2019s choice of Kelly \u2014 and his continued deliberations about tapping as many as two more military figures for other posts \u2014 has intensified worries among some members of Congress and national security experts that the new administration\u2019s policies may be shaped disproportionately by military commanders. \u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cEach of these individuals may have great merit in their own right, but what we\u2019ve learned over the past 15\u00a0years is that when we view problems in the world through a military lens, we make big mistakes.\u201d Despite making regular remarks on the campaign trail disparaging the nation\u2019s generals, Trump has long shown an affinity for them. In shaping his administration, Trump has prioritized what one adviser described as \u201ccan-do, no-bull types,\u201d which the president-elect sees as a deliberate contrast from the personnel choices President Obama has made. If confirmed, Kelly and defense secretary nominee James Mattis, a retired Marine general with the nickname \u201cMad Dog,\u201d would join retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for White House national security adviser. Meanwhile, retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus is under consideration for secretary of state, and Navy Adm. Michael S. Rogers is a contender for director of national intelligence. Retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Other figures with military backgrounds are populating the administration as well, including Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who graduated from West Point and served in the Army in the Gulf War, is Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, while Stephen K. Bannon, a former naval officer, will serve the president in the West Wing as chief strategist and senior counselor. [ What Trump may not know about the generals he\u2019s eyeing for top positions ] Trump, who received multiple draft deferments and who has no military experience beyond his years at a military boarding school, is said to be drawn to generals by their swagger and dazzled by their tales from the battlefield. Many of those he has been interviewing and consulting have spent much of the past decade and a half at war, intimately involved in the U.S. fight against global terrorism. Trump\u2019s choices also are striking considering his noninterventionist posture in the campaign and sharp criticism of the war in Iraq and other military adventures. As Trump formally introduced Mattis as his pick to run the Pentagon, he relished in recalling the general\u2019s exploits, and he has likened him to George S. Patton, the legendary World War II Army general. \u201c \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 plays no games, right?\u201d Trump told a roaring crowd Tuesday night in Fayetteville, N.C. \u201cLed the forces that went after the Taliban and commanded the First Marine Division in Iraq. He is one of the most effective generals that we\u2019ve had in many, many decades.\u201d To be confirmed, Mattis would have to receive a waiver from Congress because the law requires the defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking office. Mattis retired in 2013. 1 of 18 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Caption President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Environmental Protection Agency nominee Scott Pruitt Pruitt, the attorney general of the oil and gas intensive state of Oklahoma, has spent much of his energy in office fighting the federal agency he has been nominated to lead. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said of Trump, \u201cFor a guy who got four or five deferments from the draft, he seems pretty impressed with the military.\u201d Trump\u2019s heavy reliance on military leaders marks a departure from the previous three presidents, who tapped a few generals for the highest jobs with mixed success and relied mostly on people who had spent decades in civilian service, as politicians or academics or lawyers. \u201cTrump is clearly operating out of a particular model,\u201d said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAlmost all of his Cabinet will be made up of people from the military or people from a corporate background, and what they have in common is strong leadership and executive \u00addecision-making.\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) quipped: \u201cIt\u2019s the G&G cabinet. It does seem to be fairly limited to Goldman Sachs and generals.\u201d On Capitol Hill, the two generals Trump has nominated for Senate-confirmed positions \u2014 Mattis and Kelly \u2014 have been relatively well-received. \u201cCan you have a Cabinet full of generals? No \u2014 [not] any more than you can have a Cabinet full of lawyers or a Cabinet full of business people or whatever,\u201d said Rep. Mac Thornberry \u00ad(R-Tex.). But, he said: \u201cI\u2019m thinking of the individuals. They\u2019re people I have incredible respect for.\u201d [ Retired Marine general John F. Kelly picked to head Department of Homeland Security ] Kelly especially is likely to benefit from the relationships he cultivated among lawmakers during his years in uniform, including his role in 2014 as commander of the U.S. Southern Command, managing an influx of migrant children at the border with Mexico. Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), the former chairman of the Homeland Security panel, said Kelly has \u201cgenuine compassion\u201d for immigrants and understands the root causes of the nation\u2019s immigration challenges in such Central American countries as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. \u201cI will reserve judgment on many of the president-elect\u2019s other nominees,\u201d Carper said, \u201cbut with General Kelly, he\u2019s hit a home run with runners on base.\u201d There does not yet appear to be a Democratic strategy to derail either nomination because of the preponderance of military figures. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with the Democrats, summed up the approach: \u201cTake \u2019em one at a time.\u201d That posture could change if Trump nominates another general to a top post, such as Petraeus at the State Department. Daniel Benjamin, the former senior counterterrorism official at the State Department in the Obama administration and now a professor at Dartmouth College, said having too many generals in what are traditionally civilian positions is \u201ca matter of deep concern.\u201d \u201cGenerals as a rule believe in hierarchies and taking orders, and if the president gives them an order you have to wonder how likely they are to push back against it,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cGenerals have one set of skills, and diplomacy is not in the top drawer of that tool kit.\u201d On social media Wednesday, there was some snarky commentary about Trump\u2019s emerging Cabinet resembling \u201ca military junta.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump transition team official, defended Trump\u2019s selections on Twitter: \u201cDecorated American Generals aren\u2019t warmongers \u2014 they\u2019re among the most intelligent, disciplined & patriotic people our country has to offer!\u201d Most military officers have spent their entire careers within structured organizations with large staffs and clear chains of command. Sometimes they struggle in the more freewheeling world of politics and policy \u2014 to say nothing of what is expected to be the Trump White House\u2019s unpredictable environment. \u201cGreat generals don\u2019t always make great Cabinet officials,\u201d said Phil Carter, an Iraq War veteran and senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security. Obama tapped as his first national security adviser retired Marine Gen. James L. Jones Jr., who had a highly successful military career but struggled with the politics of serving and was replaced relatively early in Obama\u2019s first term. Similarly, retired Army Gen. Eric K. Shinseki served as Obama\u2019s first secretary of veterans affairs, presiding over a bureaucracy that was overwhelmed by returning service members from Iraq and Afghanistan and scandals over forged records. Other retired military officers had far smoother transitions to civilian administrations, including Brent Scowcroft, a former Air Force general who served as national security adviser to former president George H.W. Bush. Scowcroft is widely hailed as one of the most successful national security advisers in the history of the job. \u201cThe United States military is the finest training organization in the world,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who will chair confirmation hearings for Kelly. \u201cIt produces real leaders, people who know how to solve problems and take a very structured approach to doing so.\u201d Galston, a Democrat who served as a White House policy adviser to former president Bill Clinton, said the concerns about generals \u201ccharging ahead\u201d with no regard for legal or constitutional constraints \u2014 or without a willingness to challenge the president\u2019s decisions \u2014 are misplaced. Galston said modern-day generals are trained to navigate a minefield of potential conflicts and legal concerns. \u201cThey\u2019re schooled to believe that if they or any subordinates receive an unlawful order, it\u2019s not to be obeyed,\u201d Galston said. \u201cIf you asked me, would I prefer a government of generals or a government of lawyers, that\u2019s not an easy choice. We\u2019ve experimented with a government of lawyers, and that hasn\u2019t been so fantastic, has it? Maybe it\u2019s time to give the generals a chance.\u201d Karoun Demirjian, Greg Jaffe and Greg Miller contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Emergency workers respond to Naperville North High School, where students said they felt sick after eating gummy bears on Dec. 6, 2016, Naperville District 203 officials said. (Suzanne Baker / Naperville Sun) Privacy Policy The hospital emergency room physician who coordinated Tuesday's treatment of 14 sick Naperville North High School students said the gummy bear candy the students ate contained marijuana. Jennifer E. McNulty is the medical director for the Pediatric Emergency Department and Pediatrics at Edward Hospital in Naperville, where the students underwent treatment. McNulty said Wednesday that, based on her observations of and conversations with the students, as well as her medical expertise and other factors, she is convinced the candy was either manufactured or laced with marijuana or marijuana oil, as opposed to alcohol or another foreign substance. Local residents in recent years have had to deal with a rise in the use of heroin and other narcotics, McNulty said. \"I think this is just another sign that kids are using drugs,\" she said. Naperville police Cmdr. Jason Arres said Wednesday night investigators \"cannot confirm what the gummies were laced with, if anything, until we receive the results (of analysis) from the crime lab.\" Arres, during a Tuesday news conference, said it was possible the candy might have contained a marijuana-oil-type substance. Arres said a 17-year-old boy on Tuesday was placed under arrest \"for his involvement\" in the incident, and that criminal charges against him \"could, potentially, come at a later date. But we have other people to interview, and our investigation is continuing.\" Naperville students sickened by tainted gummies 14 students from Naperville North treated at Edward Hospital related to gummy bears incident. 14 students from Naperville North treated at Edward Hospital related to gummy bears incident. See more videos Twelve students who reportedly ate some of the candy were allowed to go home Tuesday after undergoing treatment in Edward Hospital's pediatric emergency room. Two others who reported feeling ill, and who might or might not have ingested some of the candy, were released later that day after undergoing observation and treatment at the hospital. The students complained of suffering from accelerated heartbeats, dry mouths and dizziness shortly after eating the candy. McNulty said some also reported feeling \"agitation, kind of like a panic attack.\" Naperville School District 203 Superintendent Dan Bridges said school officials are assisting Naperville police in their investigation. It was not known whether police would file criminal charges or the district would handle the matter internally, in the event the tainted candy's provider is identified. The district has done away with its zero-tolerance rules and now handles student discipline on a case-by-case basis. It also had considered random drug testing several years ago but opted not to pursue it. ",

Kirkpatrick / Getty Images The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Director Richard Cordray, has fined reverse-mortgage firms over deceptive advertising. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Director Richard Cordray, has fined reverse-mortgage firms over deceptive advertising. (T.J. Kirkpatrick / Getty Images) James Rufus Koren Contact Reporter The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday that it has fined two Southern California reverse-mortgage firms for deceptive advertising practices, saying the companies wrongly told borrowers they could not lose their homes. American Advisors Group in Orange agreed to pay a civil penalty of $400,000, and Aegean Financial, an El Segundo firm that also does business as Jubilados Financial and Reverse Mortgage Professionals, will pay $65,000. Both companies agreed to change their loan disclosures, though neither admitted wrongdoing. Reverse mortgages, which are aimed at homeowners who are retired or approaching retirement, give homeowners cash in exchange for equity in their homes. Borrowers typically are able to remain in their homes until they die or choose to sell. But the CFPB alleges that advertisements from Aegean, American Advisors and another firm \u2014 Reverse Mortgage Solutions in Houston \u2014\u00a0falsely implied that borrowers could stay in their homes under any conditions. Borrowers can default on a reverse mortgage, and possibly lose their homes, if they fail to meet certain loan terms, including paying property taxes, having homeowners insurance\u00a0and\u00a0maintaining their homes. That sometimes happens when borrowers take a lump-sum payout and\u00a0later run out of money to pay taxes, insurance and upkeep. A growing number of such reverse-mortgage defaults over the last few years has prompted the government to require more underwriting of borrowers to make sure that they can pay ongoing obligations and to tighten procedures governing foreclosures prompted by delinquencies involving Federal Housing Administration -insured mortgages.\u00a0 \u201cThese companies tricked consumers into believing they could not lose their homes with a reverse mortgage,\u201d CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a news\u00a0release announcing the fines.\u00a0\u00a0 The bureau also said Aegean, in its Spanish-language advertising, falsely implied that its reverse mortgages came from a federal agency.  Although some reverse mortgages are federally insured, they are not a government benefit, the CFPB said Wednesday. A spokesman for Aegean declined to comment on the CFPB\u2019s action. In an emailed statement, Reza Jahangiri, chief executive of American Advisors Group, said the company takes its regulatory\u00a0responsibilities seriously and has made \u201ca significant investment in our compliance and legal infrastructure to ensure we fully conform to all marketing laws and rules \u2014 and better understand how they are interpreted.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , California\u2019s new legislative session began in dramatic fashion , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , and former L.A.

    "text": "<p>In this Dec. 10, 1994, file photo, Colorado\u2019s Rashaan Salaam poses with his 1994 Heisman Trophy at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York.&nbsp;</p> Close ADAM NADEL, AP DENVER - \u00a0A gun and a note was recovered near the body of Rashaan Salaam , whose was found dead in a Boulder, Colorado, park on Monday evening, CBS Denver reports . The Boulder County Coroner\u2019s office has confirmed Salaam\u2019s death, saying it occurred at the Eben G. Fine Park, just a short trip from University of Colorado\u2019s Folsom Field, where his football legend began. An exact cause of death and the contents of the note have not been released. \u00a0 Friends told CBS Denver that he had been distant lately. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t return text messages, calls\u2026 I think, obviously he was going through some stuff,\u201d said Salaam\u2019s friend Joe Devereaux. \u201cI wish he would have reached out to anybody, you know, because this is just awful.\u201d Salaam played running back for the University of Colorado from 1992 to 1994, winning the Heisman Trophy in his junior season. Salaam rushed for 2,055 yards and 24 touchdowns as a junior in 1994, leading the Buffaloes to an 11-1 record, a win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl and a No. 3 finish in the final polls. \u201cHe was so defined, I think too often by winning the Heisman Trophy and not by other things that made him a whole person, things that he loved and cared about and I think he, in fact I know he had challenges at times making that transition,\u201d said former CU Buffs player Charles Johnson. While no official cause of death has been given, if it was suicide, Salaam would be one of several longtime football players to prematurely take their own lives in recent years. While many have linked the high occurrence of brain disease in football players to suicide , the science on the brain disease-suicide link generally says it\u2019s not necessarily true. Crazy: Rashaan Salaam is the first Heisman winner of last 55 years to die. Until today, every winner since Ernie Davis (1961) was alive. \u2014 Kevin Kaduk (@KevinKaduk) December 6, 2016 Salaam was one of the nation\u2019s most prized high-school recruits coming out of eight-man football at La Jolla Country Day, a private school in San Diego. His father played freshman football at CU in 1963 before transferring to San Diego State to be closer to home. \u201cWhen we recruited him and got him to commit, it was huge,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cWe knew that he was going to distinguish himself. He was very highly recruited. I can remember how happy we were. He lived up to all our expectations.\u201d The Chicago Bears made Salaam a first-round draft pick in 1995, and he rushed for 1,074 yards and 10 touchdowns in winning NFC Rookie of the Year honors. Injuries cut short his career. He rushed for only three TDs over the next two years in Chicago and played his last NFL game with the Cleveland Browns in 1999. Salaam played for the Memphis Maniax of the defunct XFL and attempted one last comeback with the NFL before retiring. \u201cHe was the only Heisman Trophy winner in the state of Colorado,\u201d said Dave Plati, associate athletic director at Colorado and a close friend of Salaam\u2019s. \u201cThat could have been a burden in later years because he kind of felt he didn\u2019t have the great professional career that should have followed that. But that doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s what you did to win the Heisman, and he\u2019s an icon in college football.\u201d Former teammate Matt Russell, now the Denver Broncos\u2019 director of player personnel, said Salaam was a \u201cfiercely loyal friend,\u201d the \u201cultimate teammate\u201d and the very \u201cdefinition of a winner.\u201d Rick Neuheisel, an assistant coach in Boulder when Salaam won the Heisman, said the play that epitomizes Salaam was the \u201cMiracle at Michigan,\u201d when Stewart\u2019s 64-yard Hail Mary pass to Michael Westbrook on the final play beat the Wolverines 27-26 on Sept. 24, 1994. \u201cAll he did was create time for Kordell Stewart to get that play off,\u201d Neuheisel said. \u201cAnd if you ever see that play, Rashaan Salaam had one blocking assignment and then came back and got another blocking assignment, which allowed Kordell to kind of crow-hop up in the pocket and make the throw that we\u2019ll all remember for a lifetime. \u201cBut there was the Heisman Trophy winner. He wasn\u2019t just about getting the ball or catching the ball. He was about, what do I need to do for my guys so that we can have the best possible chance for success? And whether he had the ball or didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t matter, he was going to go all-out,\u201d Neuheisel said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a very tough time because he\u2019s too young. ... I think all of us that had that special time with him all wish we would have known what was going on in his life. And I\u2019m not sure we ever will. But we will know that the time we spent with Salaam was really cool.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

By Philip Rucker and Simon Denyer December 7 at 11:37 AM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @simondenyer President-elect Donald Trump has selected Gov. Terry Branstad (R-Iowa), to serve as ambassador to China. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump has selected Terry Branstad, the long-serving Republican governor of Iowa, as ambassador to China, a transition official confirmed Wednesday. Branstad has extensive ties to China and a personal friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping that dates back decades. If his nomination goes through, the move could help reassure China\u2019s leadership that Trump understands the importance of healthy relations with Beijing. The Chinese reacted with concern to Trump\u2019s protocol-busting phone call Friday with Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of Taiwan, an island that China considers a rogue province. Trump attacked China repeatedly on the campaign trail, and in a pair of tweets Sunday, over its trade and currency policies, and has criticized\u00a0the way it has staked its territorial claims in the South China Sea. He has threatened to slap tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese goods if Beijing doesn\u2019t \u201cbehave.\u201d The selection of Branstad was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed Wednesday by a transition official who requested anonymity because the nomination had not yet been formally announced. Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters later Wednesday that Branstad has accepted the president-elect\u2019s offer. \u201cGovernor Branstad obviously is Iowa\u2019s longest-serving governor, someone who has considerable public policy experience but also someone who has a lot of experience and great grasp of trade issues, agriculture issues, has a tremendous understanding of China and Chinese people [and] is someone who very much impressed the president-elect,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Governor Branstad is someone who will represent our country well on the world stage, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of this selection.\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not confirm the report but reacted warmly. \u201cFirst of all, I would like to say that Mr. Branstad is an old friend of the Chinese people and we welcome him to play a greater role in promoting Sino-U.S. relations,\u201d spokesman Lu Kang said at\u00a0a regular news conference. \u201cThe U.S. ambassador to China serves as an important bridge linking the governments of the U.S. and China. We are willing to work with whomever takes this position to strive for the continued, sound and steady development of bilateral ties.\u201d Branstad met with Trump in New York on Tuesday and issued a written statement saying that he had enjoyed a \u201cvery cordial conversation\u201d with the president-elect and that they had spoken about the transition and the next administration. Branstad was among the most active Republican establishment figures backing\u00a0Trump, campaigning regularly with him in Iowa. The governor\u2019s son, Eric Branstad, managed Trump\u2019s general-election campaign in Iowa, one of the contested battleground states. Although Trump finished second in the state\u2019s Republican caucuses, he carried the state in the general election with 51 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 42 percent. At a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, Nov. 6, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump thanked Iowa leaders, including Gov. Terry Branstad, who Trump said would be \"a prime candidate to take care of China.\" (The Washington Post) Branstad\u2019s move to Beijing, should he be confirmed, would elevate Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) to the governorship. Reynolds, who has long been considered Branstad\u2019s favored successor, would become Iowa\u2019s first female governor. Under the Obama administration, experts say, the post of ambassador to Beijing had declined somewhat in importance. China policy was largely run out of the White House, with the president tending to immerse himself in many of the details. [ Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far ] Under Trump, the role could be more significant \u2014 and not only because the next president is likely to leave many of the policy details to his advisers. By taking a phone call from Taiwan\u2019s democratically elected leader and continuing to tweet critical comments about China after his election win, the president-elect has shown he will not be bound by diplomatic convention and wants to show he is standing up to China. Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King\u2019s College London, said it would be important to have someone in the job who has the president\u2019s ear and can call him up directly. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be problems in the first few months, so you need someone who\u2019s going to get direct access to the president and get the president\u2019s attention,\u201d Brown\u00a0said. \u201cI get the feeling he\u2019s not going to want piles and piles of briefings. He\u2019s not going to wade through that. In a sense, that makes the personal system, where you can have people speak to him directly, very important.\u201d Branstad, if he is formally nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate, could have his work cut out for him trying to smooth over some of the ripples in the relationship \u2014 notably by reassuring the Chinese that the United States does not want confrontation and conflict\u00a0andstill sees areas for cooperation. Jie Dalei, an associate professor at the School of International Studies of Peking University, reacted cautiously, saying the appointment could help communication \u201cbut is unlikely have too much impact at the decision-making level.\u201d \u201cAt this point, his tweets and remarks certainly have attracted the most attention,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to that, the appointment of an ambassador to China, though very thoughtful, is unlikely to fix the damage caused by the uncertainty of his tweets and Taiwan call.\u201d Last month, less than week after Trump\u2019s victory, Branstad paid his seventh visit to China, meeting the country\u2019s agriculture minister as well as officials from Iowa\u2019s sister province, Hebei. He has described Xi as an \u201cold friend\u201d and, during a 2015 interview with state news agency Xinhua, proudly displayed photographs of two meetings with the Chinese leader. The first dated to 1985, when Xi made his first trip to the United States as a young agriculture officer from Hebei. The other was from 2012, when Branstad hosted a dinner at the Iowa Capitol for the then-vice president of China. Branstad also met Xi on a visit to China in 2011. He said the pair spoke for 45 minutes as Xi reminisced about the hospitality he had received when he was in Iowa. The six-term governor is the longest-serving in American history, and his state voted for Trump by the largest margin for a Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1980. Iowa has strong economic ties to China; the state is the largest producer of corn and among the largest soybean producers in the United States. China has been a fast-growing market for Iowa\u2019s agriculture and processed food, with exports from the state up by a factor of 13 between 2000 and 2010 to $6.3 billion, according to Chinese state media. That fact alone may reassure some people that Trump will not start a trade war with China, since retaliation from Beijing in the shape of reduced soybean and corn imports would hurt not only Iowa but also other Republican-controlled agricultural states. Branstad was a vocal backer of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal championed by the Obama administration that Trump has pledged to rip up on his first day in office. Branstad said his state\u2019s large agricultural industry would benefit from the accord, boosting exports of pork, corn and poultry and creating jobs. The Obama administration said the TPP, which does not include China, was an important strategic initiative to more firmly link the U.S. economy to the Asia-Pacific region as a hedge against China\u2019s growing clout. But Trump denounced the TPP as a threat to American manufacturing workers, and Beijing has touted a rival Asia trade pact that does not include the United States. Branstad, 70, served as governor of Iowa from 1983 to 1999 and again starting in\u00a02011. Trump will visit the state Thursday on his post-election victory tour. Two days before the Nov. 8 presidential election, during a rally in Sioux City, Trump called the governor to the stage, calling him \u201cour prime candidate to take care of China.\u201d Denyer reported from Beijing. David Nakamura and Elise Viebeck in Washington and Luna Lin in Beijing contributed to this report.\u00a0 1 of 17 ",

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, local District Attorney General James Dunn and Great Smoky Mountains National Park announced charges at a news conference Wednesday. Victims displaced by a deadly wildfire in eastern Tennessee this week are finally being allowed to return to their homes and businesses to assess... Dunn said the juveniles face aggravated arson charges for the fire in the Chimney Tops area of Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Nov. 23. The fire spread to the Gatlinburg area , causing widespread damage. They\u2019re being held in the Sevier County juvenile detention center. They said the juveniles are from Tennessee, but not Sevier County. Officials said state law prevents releasing more information about them. The investigation is ongoing and more charges could come. They said it\u2019s possible they would move the case into adult courts. The trouble began when the arson-induced wildfire spread from the national park into the Gatlinburg area as  hurricane-force winds toppled trees and power lines, blowing embers in  all directions. \u00a0 More than 14,000 residents and visitors in Gatlinburg were forced to  evacuate, and the typically bustling tourist city was shuttered. Deputy  Park Superintendent Jordan Clayton said the initial fire on an area  called Chimney Tops, a double peaked ridge line about 4 miles away from  Gatlinburg, was caused by a person or people. It started near the end of  a popular hiking trail on Nov. 23. ",
