Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. State Department issued travel warnings for Egypt and Jordan on Friday, citing terrorist threats in both countries. The State Department recommends that U.S. citizens traveling in Egypt avoid the Western Desert and the Sinai Peninsula beyond the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh. In the case of Jordan, the State Department warned against traveling to and throughout the entire country. At Least 10 Die In Shootout At Crusader Castle In Jordan As NPR's Nate Rott reports, \"Earlier this month, a bombing near St. Mark's Coptic Cathedral in Cairo killed at least 25 people. And just earlier this week, an attack at a popular tourist destination in Karak, Jordan, killed 10\" \u2014 including a Canadian tourist. Those attacks were the biggest in Egypt and Jordan in the last month, but far from the only ones. The Islamic State has claimed credit for both. The State Department reminded U.S. citizens that terrorist organizations in Jordan often target Westerners. \"Within the last year, Jordanian authorities have notified the U.S. Embassy of several disrupted terrorist plots targeting U.S. citizens and Westerners. In addition, terrorist entities continue to express interest in attacking malls, hotels, restaurants, and other soft targets in country.\" The State Department warnings note that, despite heavy security around major tourist sites, terrorist attacks can happen anywhere. The tourism industry in Egypt has suffered in recent years due to political instability, threats of terrorism and accusations of human rights violations by the state. NPR's Malaka Gharib recently wrote about the decline in tourism and its impact on Sharm El-Sheikh, where she spent childhood summers while her father managed the Hilton Fayrouz.

Just prior to arrival, a pilot told the control tower that passengers who were nurses were attending to an \u201cunresponsive\u201d passenger. \u201cThey\u2019re working on her right now,\u201d the pilot said in a public recording of the conversation on liveatc.net .

The Rockettes' union announced late Friday that no dancer would be obligated to perform at the president-elect's inauguration last month. Scott Gries/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Scott Gries/Getty Images The Radio City Rockettes deal in precision, but the story of the group agreeing to perform at Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony next month is a bit of a mess. At least some of the dance group didn't want to perform for the incoming president's celebration, but a string of messages between dancers, their union and the troupe's ownership group over the latter part of the week caused confusion for many. Ultimately, dancers will now be able to individually choose whether or not to perform on Inauguration Day. Let's break it down: The latest Late Friday, following negotiations with the Rockettes owner, the Madison Square Garden Co., and the performers' union, The American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA), announced on Facebook that no Rockettes would be obligated to perform. \"Fortunately, the Company has agreed that ALL participation in this particular event will be voluntary. We are greatly relieved and hope to work with our Members to inform them and alleviate the anxiety and fears that this has caused.\" How we got here: Thursday Donald Trump's transition-team and the Madison Square Garden Co. confirmed that the Rockettes would perform at the president-elect's inauguration next month. Article continues after sponsorship Almost immediately, the Rockettes were coming under criticism on social media \u2014 including from one Rockette herself . In a since deleted post on Instagram, dancer Phoebe Pearl said she was \"embarrassed and disappointed\" to learn of the decision. \"The women I work with are intelligent and are full of love,\" Pearl wrote. \"The decision of performing for a man that stands for everything we're against is appalling.\" She added, \"We have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts,\" with the hashtag #notmypresident. Thursday night Any talk of boycotting the performance seemed to be quashed by the Rockettes' union \u2014 the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). In an email obtained and published by Broadwayworld.com , a union representative wrote that \"Everyone is entitled to her own political beliefs, but there is no room for this in the workplace.\" The letter noted that dancers who are not full time did not have to sign up to perform, but \"if you are fulltime, you are obligated.\" The story was widely circulated by news outlets, including CNBC , Rolling Stone , the BBC, and NPR. Friday The Madison Square Garden Co. released a statement stating that all performances were voluntary: \"The Radio City Rockettes are proud to participate in the 58th Presidential Inaugural. For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural. It is always their choice. In fact, for the coming inauguration, we had more Rockettes request to participate than we have slots available. We eagerly await the inaugural celebrations.\" In a post on the AGVA's Facebook page, the union stated that following a meeting, the Madison Square Garden Co. had agreed that all participation would be voluntary (though the MSG Co. seems to be saying that was the case all along.) The AGVA also clarified the language of their Thursday email, stating: The Union never \"demanded\" that the Rockettes perform at the inauguration. A message was sent to the Rockettes last evening that stated the terms of their contract. There is a small group of year round Rockettes who are contractually obligated to perform at scheduled events throughout the year. We are pleased that Radio City has agreed that for those Rockettes with year-round employment, participation in this event will be voluntary as well. College dance team faces similar backlash So, it seems that Rockettes who don't want to participate are off the hook. But the dance troupe is not the only group coming under fire for being involved in the inauguration celebrations. The Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday that Texas State University's dance team, The Strutters, had shut down its Twitter account following harsh criticism for agreeing to participate. It remained deleted as of midday Saturday. Thoughts were mixed on the group's announcement on Facebook. Several major acts, including Elton John, Garth Brooks, Celine Dion and Idina Menzel, have reportedly refused to participate in the inauguration celebrations. In response to a question from Vanity Fair about Trump's difficulty locking down performers , Menzel said, \"It's karma, baby.\" ",

The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for most of North Dakota, western South Dakota and a small section of eastern Montana through Monday, with expected snow totals of 8 to 15 inches and winds up to 55 mph. The weather service says that will make travel \"very dangerous if not impossible.\" An ice storm warning is in effect through late Sunday for central South Dakota, southwest North Dakota and much of central Minnesota, with up to a \u00bd inch of ice expected. Forecasters said anyone who \"must travel\" should have an extra flashlight, food and water. Elsewhere, dense fog had built up Sunday morning in parts of Kansas, the Ozarks, Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf Coast states. Advertisement ",

The plan may quickly run into a snag, however. \"The Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\" New York Attorney General spokesperson Amy Spitalnick said in a statement released Saturday. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office ordered the Donald J. Trump Foundation to \"immediately cease soliciting contributions\" in October , after a report that the charity lacked the proper authorization to seek public donations. Trump has not donated to the foundation since 2008 but it has received tens of millions of dollars over the past 10 years. \"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" Trump said in a statement. \"However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways.\" The statement did not clarify the means in which he planned to continue his charitable interests. Trump's foundation came under scrutiny during the election over how its funds were used, with money going toward settling legal disputes among Trump's business empire. Some charity experts consider this act unethical and it could violate federal tax law . A Trump campaign spokesman has called the New York investigation \"partisan.\" Schneiderman is a Democrat and endorsed Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Trump appeared to dispute any conflicts or misuse of funds in his statement Saturday. \"I am very proud of the money that has been raised for many organizations in need, and I am also very proud of the fact that the Foundation has operated at essentially no cost for decades, with 100% of the money going to charity, but because I will be devoting so much time and energy to the Presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world, I don't want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,\" Trump said. However, documents first reported by the Washington Post and later reviewed by NBC News showed that Trump had used $258,000 to settle two separate lawsuits . One such lawsuit was with the town of Palm Beach over the height of Trump's Mar-a-Lago flagpole. The Post also reported that the foundation had purchased a $20,000 six-foot portrait of Trump, which may also violate federal tax law. The Democratic National Committee criticized Trump's move in a sharply worded statement. \"Trump's announcement today is a wilted fig leaf to cover up his remaining conflicts of interest and his pitiful record of charitable giving,\" DNC spokesman Eric Walker said in the statement. \"Shuttering a charity is no substitute for divesting from his for-profit business and putting the assets in a blind trust \u2014 the only way to guarantee separation between the Trump administration and the Trump business,\" he added. The Trump Foundation became embroiled in an additional controversy and was fined by the IRS for donating $25,000 to a political organization connected to Florida's attorney general, Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general is now a member of Trump's transition, but at the time her office was considering investigating Trump University for fraud, which raised another instance for the president-elect about a potential conflict of interest. Bondi's office did not open an investigation. A Bondi spokeswoman has said due diligence was done in the case and similar litigation in New York would provide relief to consumers nationwide. Trump has denied that the donation had anything to do with Bondi's office mulling an investigation, and a spokesperson called it a \"minor issue.\" The IRS fine was levied after an ethics group complained that the donation had not been disclosed to tax officials. Since their father won the election, his children have tried to raise money for their own foundation by putting their name and access up for sale. Play ",

Alessandra Tarantino/AP hide caption toggle caption Alessandra Tarantino/AP Pope Francis delivered his Christmas day blessing from the main balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican Sunday, before a crowd of some 40,000 people. Alessandra Tarantino/AP Pope Francis gave the traditional Christmas Day blessing on Sunday, calling for peace in Syria and other countries \"scarred by war.\" An estimated 40,000 tourists and Romans gathered in St. Peter's Square to hear the message, which was delivered from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, \"Urbi et Orbi\": to the city and the world. The pope offered his message of peace to the \"war-torn land of Syria, where far too much blood has been spilled.\" He said it is time that weapons \"be still forever,\" so that \"civil coexistence\" might be restored to the country. Pope Francis also addressed the people of the Holy Land, saying, \"May Israelis and Palestinians have the courage and determination to write a new page of history, where hate and revenge give way to the will to build together a future of mutual understanding and harmony.\" He appealed for peace and dialogue in places ranging from South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Colombia, and the Korean Peninsula. This message comes at the end of what Pope Francis proclaimed the Holy Year of Mercy. Pope Francis, who turned 80 earlier this month, made six foreign trips this year, and oversaw many events and ceremonies with millions of pilgrims to the Vatican. Article continues after sponsorship NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports that the year was marked by the pope's efforts to heal divisions within the Christian world, and dissension in the Catholic Church. For Pope Francis, A Year Of Reconciliation Abroad Amid Opposition At Home His efforts have not gone without criticism \u2014 four cardinals expressed public outrage after the pope's meditation on marriage and family seemed to open a crack in the door, allowing some divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive sacraments. As Poggioli notes, when asked about the accusation that he is \"Protestantizing\" the Catholic Church, the pope replied, \"I don't lose sleep over it.\" Despite the opposition, Pope Francis enjoys overwhelming support among the faithful, she writes. Recently, the pope's Twitter following grew to more than 32 million followers across his nine accounts. ",

The cause of the crash is under investigation, although initial Russian news media reports indicated it was a technical failure rather than terrorism. The Russian military has had only minor casualties throughout its deployment in Syria, but the country has experienced a series of setbacks in recent days. On Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at an art exhibit in Ankara, with the killer yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo, don\u2019t forget Syria !\u201d That came not long after forces from the Islamic State recaptured the storied Syrian city of Palmyra , forcing the Russian garrison that had been stationed there since helping to take the city last spring to flee. RUSSIA DEC. 25, 2016 By The New York Times The military plane, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154, disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from the resort town of Sochi. Russia\u2019s official weather forecast agency said that conditions near the airport were \u201cnormal, easy,\u201d the Interfax news agency reported. The airplane was technically fit, the Defense Ministry said. Wreckage of the plane, which was carrying 84 passengers and eight crew members, was found in the sea, most of it about one mile from shore, the Russian Defense Ministry said. No survivors have been found at the crash site, Russian officials said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Passengers on the flight, which originated in Moscow and stopped in Sochi to refuel, included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, the Russian military choir, who were traveling to Russia\u2019s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. The band planned to serenade Russian personnel in Syria on New Year\u2019s Eve. President Vladimir V. Putin deployed Russian armed forces in Syria in September 2015, ostensibly to fight terrorism but primarily to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, the leader of the lone remaining Russian ally in the region, whose forces have been fighting an insurgency for nearly six years. Photo In Moscow, flowers were placed in front of portraits of Russian television journalists who were aboard the crashed military plane. Credit Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press Russian forces have been instrumental in helping the Damascus government regain the initiative, with the final rebels expelled from the besieged city of Aleppo on Thursday. Three journalists from Channel One, Russia\u2019s main television station, were on the plane, as were journalists from the Zvezda and NTV television networks, news reports said. Yelizaveta P. Glinka, a prominent Russian philanthropist and a member of the presidential council on human rights and civil society, was also on the list of people on board. Mr. Putin recently honored Mrs. Glinka with a state award for her human rights and charity work . Valery V. Khalilov, the ensemble\u2019s artistic director, was also on the plane, according to the list of passengers. Mr. Putin expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims, and he declared Monday a national day of mourning. (Christmas is not celebrated as an official holiday in Russia on Dec. 25, because the Russian Orthodox Church observes it on Jan. 7.) \u201cFirst of all, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families of our citizens, who died today, as a result of an aviation catastrophe over the Black Sea this morning,\u201d Mr. Putin said in St. Petersburg, according to remarks published on the Kremlin\u2019s website. He also ordered Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev to establish a state commission, headed by the transportation minister, Maxim Sokolov, to investigate the crash. The Defense Ministry said that 11 bodies had been recovered as search efforts continued, Russian news agencies reported. Advertisement A memorial was installed inside the Sochi airport, and people brought candles and flowers. Relatives of the victims were whisked away by the authorities to a specially designated zone where they were treated by psychiatrists. Mr. Sokolov told journalists inside the terminal building that the rescue effort would not stop at night. \u201cIt is premature to say anything about the causes of this tragedy,\u201d he told reporters. More than 30 vessels were deployed in the recovery operation, Mr. Sokolov said, and the Defense Ministry said that more than 100 divers had been sent to the crash site. Photo Boats searching for the wreckage of the plane. Credit Yevgeny Reutov/European Pressphoto Agency Founded in the Soviet era, the Alexandrov Ensemble, which had performed in Syria earlier this year, is the official band of the Russian armed forces. It consists of an orchestra, a choir and a dance ensemble, and is one of the two Russian orchestras allowed to use the title Red Army Choir. The ensemble was founded by Aleksandr V. Aleksandrov, a prominent Soviet composer and the author of the music of the Russian anthem. His grandson Yevgeny told Meduza, a Russian news website, that \u201cthe best members of the ensemble died.\u201d \u201cAll the best soloists, the whole choir,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything will collapse now. The best ones are gone.\u201d Several independent news outlets in Russia reported that the Alexandrov Ensemble had planned to give a concert in Aleppo. In May, the Russian military had flown a symphony orchestra led by one of its best -known conductors , Valery Gergiev , to mark the reclaiming of Palmyra. Until recently, the Tu-154, which was designed in the 1960s, was one of the most widely used civilian aircraft in Russian aviation. The plane that crashed on Sunday was made in 1983, underwent planned maintenance work in the fall, and was operated by an experienced pilot, the Defense Ministry said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Russian airlines have mostly replaced outdated Soviet planes with new ones in recent years and have vastly improved the overall safety record. Many government agencies continue to fly the Tu-154 and other old Soviet aircraft, however. The age and reputation of the Tu-154, as well as the fact that the aircraft had flown out of secure military airfields, meant that most senior officials speaking publicly ruled out the possibility that an attack had caused the crash. But there was speculation by a few aviation experts, echoed by some officials, that terrorism could not be ruled out given the suddenness with which the plane disappeared and the size of the debris field. \u201cFor us the worst version is an act of terrorism, because if this is the case, this will mean that we have paid another bill for Aleppo,\u201d Vadim Lukashevich, an aviation expert, told Dozhd, an independent television station. In one of Russia\u2019s most recent air disasters, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for planting a bomb onboard a Russian civilian Airbus that crashed in Egypt in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board in a flight from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik to St. Petersburg. Another Russian-made military plane crashed in eastern Siberia on Monday , seriously injuring 16 of the 39 people on board, and the aviation authorities recently grounded the country\u2019s newest civilian airliner , the Sukhoi Superjet 100, because of concerns about metal fatigue.

(Photo: Dan Balilty, AP) Israeli\u00a0Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro and 10 other ambassadors to Jerusalem on Sunday to protest a\u00a0U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli\u00a0settlement activity in the West Bank. The United States had\u00a0abstained from the vote on Friday\u00a0rather than issue a veto, as it has in previous anti-Israel votes before the Security Council. Netanyahu accused the Obama administration of playing a major part in the measure's conception and passage. U.S. abstains on U.N. vote condemning Israeli settlements \"From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"This is, of course, in complete contradiction of the traditional American policy that was committed to not trying to dictate terms for a permanent agreement, like any issue related to them in the Security Council, and, of course, the explicit commitment of President Obama himself, in 2011, to refrain from such steps.\" US Defends UN Vote On Israeli Settlements Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security advisor for strategic communications, denied on Friday that the U.S. played any role in drafting the resolution.\u00a0\"The notion that we were somehow involved in drafting this is just not true,\" Rhodes told reporters\u00a0in a conference call. President-elect Donald Trump had urged Obama to veto the resolution, and later condemned the U.N. and Obama\u00a0for allowing the measure to pass. The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....cont: https://t.co/s8rXKKZNF1 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 The U.N. resolution passed against a backdrop of a stalled peace process, a Middle East facing a widespread terrorist threat, accelerated expansion and development of Jewish settlements on land Palestinians want for a future state, and terrorist incitement among Palestinian leaders. The Obama administration has repeatedly exhorted Israel to refrain from continued settlement construction or to block planned projects. Last week, the Israeli government agreed that Amona,\u00a0an outpost that Israel's supreme court said was illegal and must be dismantled, would be moved to another location on the same West Bank\u00a0hilltop. The solution averted\u00a0a likely confrontation Sunday\u00a0with Jewish extremists, but is considered by settlement opponents to be just as illegal. Netanyahu summoned ambassadors from 10 of the 14 countries that voted in favor of the resolution and have embassies in Israel: Britain, China, Russia, France, Egypt, Japan, Uruguay, Spain, Ukraine and New Zealand, according to Reuters. The U.S. action was widely panned by U.S. lawmakers. Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was \"very disappointed\u00a0by the United States\u2019 acquiescence to a one-sided, biased resolution at the United Nations Security Council.\" \u201cThis resolution places the blame for the current impasse in negotiations entirely on Israel, asking nothing of the Palestinians,\" Engel added. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, vowed to cut U.S. funding to the United Nations until the vote is reversed. \"No US $ for UN until reversed,\" he wrote on his Twitter account Saturday. Spoke w/ Israeli PM @netanyahu tonight to wish him Happy Chanukah & assure him of strong support in Congress. No US $ for UN until reversed. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 24, 2016 Netanyahu said Sunday\u00a0he was \"encouraged by the statements of our friends in the U.S.\" \"They understand how reckless and destructive this U.N. resolution was, they understand that the Western Wall (in East Jerusalem) isn't occupied territory,\" he said. The resolution condemned \"all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem.\" It listed among those measures \"the construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolutions.\" Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. allowed the measure to pass because it would \"preserve the possibility of the two state solution,\" which he called \"the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state\u00a0living in peace and security with its neighbors\u00a0and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.\" \"That future is now in jeopardy, with terrorism, violence and incitement continuing and unprecedented steps to expand settlements being advanced by avowed opponents of the two state solution,\" Kerry said. Critics, such as Jack Rosen, president of the American Jewish Congress, said the measure \"prematurely and unfairly determined a core final issue of the conflict,\"\u00a0undermining\u00a0Israel\u2019s position at a future\u00a0negotiating table. It also opens the door for boycotts\u00a0and other commercial attacks against Israel, Rosen wrote. Netanyahu said the U.S. and Israel have disagreed for decades about settlements. \"But we agreed that the Security Council was not the place to resolve this issue,\" he said. \"We knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace further away. And, as I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council.\" 4651 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 182 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hlk0Ni NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

By Philip Rucker and Robert Barnes December 25 at 7:06 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @scotusreporter Donald Trump is set to inherit an uncommon number of vacancies in the federal courts in addition to the open Supreme Court seat, giving the president-elect a monumental opportunity to reshape the judiciary after taking office. The estimated 103 judicial vacancies that President Obama is expected to hand over to Trump in the Jan. 20 transition of power is nearly double the 54 openings Obama found eight years ago following George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Confirmation of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees slowed to a crawl after Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015. Obama White House officials blame Senate Republicans for what they characterize as an unprecedented level of obstruction in blocking the Democratic president\u2019s court picks. The result is a multitude of openings throughout the federal circuit and district courts that will allow the new Republican president to quickly make a wide array of lifetime appointments. State gun control laws, abortion restrictions, voter laws, anti-discrimination measures and immigrant issues are all matters that are increasingly heard by federal judges and will be influenced by the new composition of the courts. Trump has vowed to choose ideologues in the mold of the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon \u2014 a prospect that has activists on the right giddy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), left, walks through the Capitol with Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Nov. 30. (Bill O\u2019Leary/Washington Post) \u201cI\u2019m optimistic he\u2019ll come at this right out of the gate,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that has opposed many of Obama\u2019s court choices. \u201cEvery president can expect to make a huge impact,\u201d Severino added. \u201c[Trump] is unique in having campaigned really hard on this issue \u2014 the significance of the courts, and of the Supreme Court in particular.\u201d The Supreme Court vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s death in February was a motivating issue for many conservative voters, especially evangelical Christians, to turn out for Trump. Senate Republicans refused to hold even a hearing on Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, for the Scalia seat. [ Trump\u2019s victory has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court ] Democrats accuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, of intentionally denying Obama\u2019s nominees a fair hearing and running out the clock in hopes that a Republican would succeed him, as Trump has. Twenty-five of Obama\u2019s court nominees were pending on the Senate floor, after having been approved out of the committee with bipartisan support, but did not get a vote before the Senate ended its two-year term before the holidays, according to White House spokesman Eric Schultz. \u201cRepublican tactics have been shameful and will forever leave a stain on the United States Senate,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cRepublican congressional dysfunction has now metastasized to the third branch of government, and that is not a legacy to be proud of.\u201d Merrick Garland, right, President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, meets with Sen. Patrick D. Leahy (D-Vt.) on Capitol Hill on March 17. (J. Lawler Duggan for The Washington Post) Trump spoke frequently about his intentions to put forward a more conservative Supreme Court nominee as a way to galvanize the right. \u201cThe replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies,\u201d Trump said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. \u201cVery important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.\u201d Although Trump spoke little on the campaign trail about the many vacancies on lower courts, remaking the federal judiciary overall has been a priority of his and of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, aides said. Trump\u2019s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry , is a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. First appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan, Barry was later elevated to the circuit court by President Bill Clinton and is known for her relative moderation. She has spoken out against women\u2019s claims of sexual harassment yet also struck down a New Jersey law banning late-term abortions as unconstitutional. Trump transition officials declined to comment on the process of selecting nominees, but incoming White House Counsel Don McGahn is expected to play a key role. Such groups as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation have been working with the Trump team to suggest possible candidates. The judiciary also is a top priority for McConnell, who stands ready to help the Trump White House identify candidates and grease the sometimes-laborious Senate confirmation process. The Trump administration and the Senate will be under pressure to quickly install judges in courts around the country where cases are severely backlogged because of long-vacant seats. There are 38 so-called judicial emergencies, according to the nonpartisan Judicial Conference, including in Texas, where seven seats have sat empty for more than one year. The Obama administration and the state\u2019s two conservative Republican senators could not come to an agreement on nominees for the many openings. \u201cThere is a real impact on real people,\u201d said W. Neil Eggleston, Obama\u2019s White House counsel. \u201cThere are people and companies who are not having their cases heard because there are no judges around.\u201d The politics surrounding judicial vacancies are more poisonous than at any time in recent memory, as the Garland episode has shown, with Democrats and Republicans at loggerheads for much of the two years since McConnell took leadership of the Senate. [ Supreme Court to begin new term short-handed as its ideological balance hinges on fall vote ] Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, issued a 4,200-word statement this month saying that by blocking Garland, Republicans had committed \u201cthe most outrageous act of obstruction and irresponsibility\u201d that he had seen in his 42 years in the Senate. Speaking more generally about circuit and district court vacancies, Leahy added: \u201cDespite the fact that there are dozens of qualified, consensus nominees pending on the Senate floor right now, we will finish this Congress having confirmed just 22 judicial nominees in two years. That is the lowest number since Harry Truman was president.\u201d As with many subjects, judicial nomination data can be subject to interpretation. Judicial vacancies ebb and flow somewhat randomly, considering judges serve lifetime appointments until they choose to retire or die. \u201cIt is a challenge to make apples-to-apples comparisons at the end of a term because vacancies don\u2019t happen in the same regular basis as they do in the Senate or the White House,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. \u201cTo make an apples-to-apples comparison on a snapshot in time doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Despite Obama\u2019s difficulty winning confirmation for his nominees, the Senate has confirmed more of his nominees during his eight years as president, 329, than it did Bush\u2019s during his eight years in office, 326. Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for Grassley, said, \u201cThe White House has very little to complain about because no matter how they spin it, the fact is that President Obama had more judicial nominees confirmed than President Bush.\u201d Obama has used his nominations to systematically diversify the federal courts to look more like the fast-changing country. He appointed far more female and minority judges than any other president in history, and he has paid particular attention to sexual orientation. When Obama took office, there was only one openly gay or lesbian judge, and he appointed 11 more. \u201cThe president, my predecessors and I spent a significant amount of time looking for all different kinds of diversity \u2014 racial, sexual orientation, gender and professional background,\u201d Eggleston said. [ Obama pushing to diversity federal judiciary amid GOP delays ] When Obama took office, only one of the 13 regional circuit courts had a majority of Democratic-nominated judges, and as he leaves, nine do. While the Supreme Court hears roughly 75 cases a year, tens of thousands are decided at the circuit court level, affecting all who live in the states within those circuits. Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominations at the Brookings Institution, said Trump has a great opportunity to change the partisan split in the federal courts. He predicted that by mid-2020, Republican appointees would hold about half of the 673 district judgeships, as opposed to the current 34 percent. And among the 179 circuit court judgeships, Democratic appointees now hold a slim majority, 51 percent, but that could fall to about 43 percent. But Wheeler warned that there are important limitations to Trump\u2019s power. For one thing, many of the judges most likely to leave their appointments in the coming years were appointed by Republican presidents, meaning there will be fewer opportunities to shift the partisan makeup. And perhaps more importantly, 28 of the 50 states will be represented by at least one Democratic senator, including large ones such as California, Florida and New York. Senate leaders have a tradition of considering nominees only if they are supported by both senators representing their state \u2014 and Democratic senators are expected to bargain hard with the Trump administration, just as Republican senators did with Obama\u2019s. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t always get exactly who he wants,\u201d Wheeler said. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

He has since moved into a more rural community, gotten married and purchased his first home after getting sober. With little fanfare, he hands out clothes and other supplies to the homeless each Christmas Day and once each year in June. (Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas / Chicago Tribune) Jay-are Borowski, left, of Peru was homeless and living on the streets in Uptown for about 17 years, ending in 2010. He has since moved into a more rural community, gotten married and purchased his first home after getting sober. With little fanfare, he hands out clothes and other supplies to the homeless each Christmas Day and once each year in June. (Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas / Chicago Tribune) (Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas / Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporter On the religious holiday many Chicagoans spend cozied up indoors with family, on the chilly streets of Uptown Sunday the message was the same: \u201cGod is good.\u201d A crowd gathered outside the McDonald\u2019s restaurant at Wilson Avenue and Sheridan Road about noon as Jay-are Borowski, his wife and friends handed out plastic pouches filled with the kind of treasures those in need truly appreciate. The group gave out 160 jackets, 225 bags full of hygiene essentials, more than 200 pair of socks, 100 towels and face towels and 100 bag lunches made specifically for Uptown residents by members of the First Congregational Church of Peru. The congregation of the church two hours from Chicago learned of the plight of the homeless living in Uptown Borowski, a plumber, moved out of the city as part of his recovery and shared the story of his journey from junkie to humanitarian. \u201cI was out here with a needle in my arm and a pipe in my mouth,\u201d Borowski said. \u201cI was strung out, living here on the streets \u2013 I lived under that viaduct on Wilson Avenue \u2013\u00a0and in and out of prison. I just couldn\u2019t get right.\u201d One day he happened on the Family Empowerment Center on Davon. One of the pastors there, Scott Manke, ran a program using donated boats. Borowski found one and decided he\u2019d crash there. When the cops came to bust him for tresspassing, Manke said he wouldn\u2019t press charges, so long as Borowski went out to lunch with him. It wasn\u2019t an overnight fix, but with Manke's help and guidance eventually, Borowski got clean in 2010. He even purchased a home, something he never thought he'd be capable of. But years before saving up enough for a down payment, one of his first orders of business was to make sure the homeless in Uptown had comfortable footwear. \u201cI just started handing out socks, because I can\u2019t tell you how bad my feet were from walking on and on, from chasing that demon,\u201d he said. His annual trip to give back\u00a0graduated to its current magnitude as word of mouth brought him donations from Montana, from Florida. And the generosity of the donors is not lost on recipients. \u201cOne man gave me a hug and said he loved me three times,\u201d Borowski said. \u201cWe gave him a brand new pair of pants with the tag still on it. People are just really grateful for this.\u201d Chivala Thompson, who lives in a nearby senior center, was smiling from ear to ear as she walked away with her donated goods. \u201cThis is God\u2019s children who come and bless the needy,\u201d she said. Her cousin, Robert Thompson, was the one who saw Borowski and his wife Amanda and their friend Marse Visnavac handing out bags of goods out of the back of an SUV and told Chivala to go get in line. \u201cThey gave us coats, blankets, shirts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they gave us a Merry Christmas,\u201d Robert Thompson added.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Grant might not seem so different from any number of accessible and devoted professors on any number of campuses, and yet when you witness over time the sheer volume of Grant\u2019s commitments, and the way in which he is able to follow through on all of them, you start to sense that something profoundly different is at work. Helpfulness is Grant\u2019s credo. He is the colleague who is always nominating another for an award or taking the time to offer a thoughtful critique or writing a lengthy letter of recommendation for a student \u2014 something he does approximately 100 times a year. His largess extends to people he doesn\u2019t even know. A student at Warwick Business School in England recently wrote to express his admiration and to ask Grant how he manages to publish so often, and in such top-tier journals. Grant did not think, upon reading that e-mail, I cannot possibly answer in full every such query and still publish so often, and in such top-tier journals. Instead, Grant, who often returns home after a day of teaching to an in-box of 200 e-mails, responded, \u201cI\u2019m happy to set up a phone call if you want to discuss!\u201d He attached handouts and slides from the presentation on productivity he gave to the Academy of Management annual conference a few years earlier. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Grant, helping is not the enemy of productivity, a time-sapping diversion from the actual work at hand; it is the mother lode, the motivator that spurs increased productivity and creativity. In some sense, he has built a career in professional motivation by trying to unpack the puzzle of his own success. He has always helped; he has always been productive. How, he has wondered for most of his professional life, does the interplay of those two factors work for everyone else? Organizational psychology has long concerned itself with how to design work so that people will enjoy it and want to keep doing it. Traditionally the thinking has been that employers should appeal to workers\u2019 more obvious forms of self-interest: financial incentives, yes, but also work that is inherently interesting or offers the possibility for career advancement. Grant\u2019s research, which has generated broad interest in the study of relationships at work and will be published for the first time for a popular audience in his new book, \u201cGive and Take,\u201d starts with a premise that turns the thinking behind those theories on its head. The greatest untapped source of motivation, he argues, is a sense of service to others; focusing on the contribution of our work to other people\u2019s lives has the potential to make us more productive than thinking about helping ourselves. \u201cGive and Take\u201d incorporates scores of studies and personal case histories that suggest the benefits of an attitude of extreme giving at work. Many of the examples \u2014 the selfless C.E.O.\u2019s, the consultants who mentor ceaselessly \u2014 are inspiring and humbling, even if they are a bit intimidating in their natural expansiveness. These generous professionals look at the world the way Grant does: an in-box filled with requests is not a task to be dispensed with perfunctorily (or worse, avoided); it\u2019s an opportunity to help people, and therefore it\u2019s an opportunity to feel good about yourself and your work. \u201cI never get much done when I frame the 300 e-mails as \u2018answering e-mails,\u2019 \u201d Grant told me. \u201cI have to look at it as, How is this task going to benefit the recipient?\u201d Where other people see hassle, he sees bargains, a little work for a lot of gain, including his own. The message sounds terrific: Feel good about your work, and get more of it done, and bask in the appreciation of all the people you help along the way. Nice guys can finish first! (Now there\u2019s research to prove it.) But I couldn\u2019t help wondering, as I watched Grant race through his marathon day (even one of his mentors admitted, \u201cHe can be exhausting\u201d), about the cost of all this other-directedness. If you are devoted to being available to everyone, all the time, how do you relax? How can you access the kind of creativity that comes from not being on task every waking moment? How do you make time for the more important relationships in your life? As Grant\u2019s office hours came to an end four and a half hours later, he patiently continued offering help until he finally had to close the door and tell a student to try him by phone; he would squeeze him in on his commute or by e-mail. But he would not say no. The study of job design in the middle- and late-20th century focused on how to improve the drudge work of manufacturing: Grant is credited with reviving the field, shifting the thinking toward the more modern conditions of a service and knowledge economy. He first realized that his ideas about giving at work might actually yield quantifiable results when he was a 22-year-old graduate student at the University of Michigan, and he proposed a study set in a university fund-raising call center. Call centers, even on college campuses, are notoriously unsatisfying places to work. The job is repetitive and can be emotionally taxing, as callers absorb verbal abuse while also facing rejection (the rejection rate at that call center was about 93 percent). Photo Credit Photograph by Art Streiber for The New York Times. Set design: Fi Campbell and Tam Reid/Stillsets. Clothing stylist: Vanessa Shokrian. The manager, Howard Heevner, did not have a lot of faith that Grant would be able to motivate his student-employees. He had already tried, in a previous job at a call center, the usual incentives \u2014 cash prizes, competitive games \u2014 and was generally unimpressed with the results. But Grant had a different idea. When he was an undergraduate at Harvard, he took a job selling advertisements for the travel guide series \u201cLet\u2019s Go,\u201d but he was terrible at it. \u201cI was a pushover,\u201d he says in \u201cGive and Take,\u201d \u201closing revenues for the company and sacrificing my own commission.\u201d Then he met another undergraduate whose job at \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d was helping her pay her way through college. Suddenly the impact of his role became clear to him: without advertising revenues, the company could not make money, which in turn meant it couldn\u2019t provide jobs to students who needed them. With that in mind, he was willing to make a harder sell, to take a tougher line on negotiations. \u201cWhen I was representing the interests of students, I was willing to fight to protect them,\u201d he writes. It would not be a mass-market psychology book if every anecdote did not have a dramatic ending: Grant eventually sold the largest advertising package in company history and less than a year later, at 19, was promoted to director of advertising sales, overseeing a budget of $1 million. As a psychology major, Grant always hoped to do a study on the \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d staff, in which the books\u2019 editors and writers would meet with or read letters by people whose travels had been enhanced by their work. Would knowing how the books benefited others inspire them to work harder? Now, at the call center, Grant proposed a simple, low-cost experiment: given that one of the center\u2019s primary purposes was funding scholarships, Grant brought in a student who had benefited from that fund-raising. The callers took a 10-minute break as the young man told them how much the scholarship had changed his life and how excited he now was to work as a teacher with Teach for America. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The results were surprising even to Grant. A month after the testimonial, the workers were spending 142 percent more time on the phone and bringing in 171 percent more revenue, even though they were using the same script. In a subsequent study, the revenues soared by more than 400 percent. Even simply showing the callers letters from grateful recipients was found to increase their fund-raising draws. When Grant went back and talked to the callers about their improvement, many actively discounted the possibility that the brief encounter with a scholarship student helped. \u201cSeveral of them were stunned,\u201d Grant said. \u201cTheir response was, \u2018Yeah, I knew I was more effective, but that was because I had more practice,\u2019 or, \u2018That was because I had a better alumni pool in that period \u2014 I got lucky.\u2019 \u201d Eventually, having replicated the test five times, Grant was confident that he had eliminated other explanations. It was almost as if the good feelings had bypassed the callers\u2019 conscious cognitive processes and gone straight to a more subconscious source of motivation. They were more driven to succeed, even if they could not pinpoint the trigger for that drive. The study quickly raised Grant\u2019s profile in his field, partly because it relied on hard data: dollars, as opposed to manager assessments or self-reports. \u201cI don\u2019t know the last time there was a study in our field that had such striking results,\u201d says Stuart Bunderson, a professor of organizational behavior at Washington University. \u201cIn terms of an intervention that has practical significance and moves the needle on employee behavior \u2014 you don\u2019t see them that often.\u201d The intervention was also a manager\u2019s dream: fast and practically free. Over the years, Grant has followed up that study with other experiments testing his theories about prosocial motivation \u2014 the desire to help others, independent of easily foreseeable payback. In one study, Grant put up two different signs at hand-washing stations in a hospital. One reminded doctors and nurses, \u201cHand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases\u201d; another read, \u201cHand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\u201d Grant measured the amount of soap used at each station. Doctors and nurses at the station where the sign referred to their patients used 45 percent more soap or hand sanitizer. These studies, two of Grant\u2019s best known, focus on typically worthy beneficiaries: needy students and vulnerable patients. But some of his other research makes the case that prosocial behavior is as applicable in corporate America as it is in a hospital or a university. \u201cThink of it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cIn corporate America, people do sometimes feel that the work they do isn\u2019t meaningful. And contributing to co-workers can be a substitute for that.\u201d Take, for example, Grant\u2019s study of workers at Borders who contributed to an employee-beneficiary fund managed by the staff, with Borders matching donated funds. The money was set aside for employees in need \u2014 someone facing a pregnancy that would put a strain on their finances, for example, or the funeral of a loved one. Interestingly, Grant found that it was not the beneficiaries who showed the most significant increase in their commitment to Borders; it was the donors, even those who gave just a few dollars a week. Through interviews and questionnaires, Grant determined that \u201cas a result of gratitude to the company for the opportunity to affirm a valued aspect of their identities, they developed stronger affective commitment to the company.\u201d The study is uplifting and troubling at the same time: even Grant acknowledges the possibility of corporations playing off their employees\u2019 generous impulses, as a sop to compensate for other failings \u2014 poor pay or demeaning work. (After all, if the employees at Borders had better benefits and pay, they might not have needed the emergency fund.) Jerry Davis, a management professor who taught Grant at the University of Michigan and is generally a fan of his former student\u2019s work, couldn\u2019t help making a pointed critique about its inherent limits when they were on a panel together: \u201cSo you think those workers at the Apple factory in China would stop committing suicide if only we showed them someone who was incredibly happy with their iPhone?\u201d Grant\u2019s answer to these questions is academic: he tries to understand how these mechanisms function but does not necessarily advocate implementation. \u201cI am also skeptical about the motivations of corporations,\u201d he said. \u201cMy concern is ultimately for the success and well-being of people in organizations. To the extent that individual and group accomplishments and quality of work life contribute to profits, I\u2019m happy, but that\u2019s not my primary goal.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story For all his general interest in psychology, Grant doesn\u2019t seem interested in digging too deeply into the origins of his own psyche. About his all-consuming desire to help, he says simply: \u201cMy mother has what she calls the fix-it gene. Maybe I just inherited it.\u201d He grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, raised by a lawyer, his father, and a teacher, his mother. He was an upbeat boy, though socially awkward and burdened by numerous food allergies and strong aversions \u2014 to haircuts, to bluejeans, to chocolate. He felt things deeply; those aversions were matched by equally consuming passions. An aspiring basketball player, he would not allow himself to go inside until he made 23 consecutive free throws, even if it meant missing dinner. (That he never made the high-school team is the one failure that still pains him.) On weekends, he played video games for so many consecutive hours \u2014 10 was not unusual \u2014 that his mother called the local paper to complain about what the paper called, in the subsequent article, \u201cThe Dark Side of Nintendo.\u201d Photo Credit Photograph by Art Streiber for The New York Times.

Grant started significantly losing his hair in his 20s, as if his head were trying to keep pace with his overall precociousness. Now almost entirely bald, he has a striking, monklike look. Though he comes across as charming and agreeable, there are still traces of the awkward boy he says he once was, a hint of discomfort in the smile he gives a student he runs into unexpectedly, a longstanding dread of parties (\u201cunless they like psychology or magic tricks, in which case I\u2019d come alive,\u201d he said). He is aware of his own introverted tendencies, and some of his research involves the strengths of introverts at work. For the most part, Grant has more than compensated for the shyness he felt growing up. Once phobic about speaking in public, he forced himself to lecture as much as he could as a graduate student, handing out feedback forms so he could methodically learn from his weaknesses. He developed strategies for socializing comfortably, even though, he said, \u201cI feel uncomfortable when I\u2019m in a situation and I don\u2019t know what people want or expect of me.\u201d Giving, he eventually realized, was a reliable way of mediating social interactions. On the day I followed Grant as he hurried to his office hours at Wharton, I read something on his face that registered as more than just busyness; he seemed anxious. I wondered whether Grant was driven by the desire to help or a deep fear of disappointing someone. \u201cThat is one astute observation!\u201d Grant said when I asked him about that by e-mail. (With Grant, every observation is an astute one.) Grant often starts his research with observations about himself \u2014 \u201cme-search,\u201d they call it in the field \u2014 and he had conducted a study trying to determine which of those two impulses was more motivating. The answer turned out to be a combination of the two. \u201cGivers motivate themselves to avoid complacency by focusing on the benefits to others if they succeed and worrying about disappointing them if they fail,\u201d Grant wrote. One of Grant\u2019s roommates, he went on, once joked that he had a productive form of O.C.D. \u201cHe noticed that when I was anxious about something, I had a habit of throwing myself single-mindedly into tasks in which I felt responsible to others,\u201d he said. \u201cA few days later, my mentor, Brian Little, sent me an article by Ian McGregor, one of his doctoral students, who studied \u2018compensatory conviction\u2019: anxiety in one domain motivates people to dive into passionate pursuit in another. It was one of those crystallizing moments that triggered a \u2018Yes, I want to be a psychologist!\u2019 reaction \u2014 I was fascinated by how closely his theory and findings mapped onto my own experience.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to imagine a pop-psych interpretation of Adam Grant: that his generosity might have its roots in some kind of need \u2014 maybe a need he feels, even more than the rest of us, to be liked. Or perhaps that he is channeling his extreme ambition into a feel-good form of achievement. Productive and happy, Grant could even be seen as a paradigm of Freud\u2019s definition of mental health: aggression sublimated into work. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he has never put much stock in psychoanalysis \u2014 if the work is not data-driven, he\u2019s skeptical. \u201cI think a lot of it is baggage that goes back to Freud, and Freud would always say that whatever is going on with you can be traced back to something that happened early in childhood with your mother,\u201d he told me, by phone, as he was driving to work one day. \u201cYou can either accept that or be in denial. You can\u2019t win!\u201d He would rather simply understand himself as someone who gets a lot out of giving, then harness that feeling, study it and see how the mechanisms involved can inspire others to succeed. One night Grant forwarded me a grateful e-mail from a student whose life, the student said, changed because of some advice Grant gave her. I commented that most people would be thrilled to receive one note like that in a lifetime. \u201cI get several dozen a week,\u201d Grant said. He agreed to send some my way. That evening, at around 8:30, the e-mails started coming \u2014 Thank you for our conversation the other day and for your genius. . . . I couldn\u2019t have done this without you. . . . I cannot thank you enough for your time and insight. . . . I\u2019m thrilled. And I have you to thank. . . . After the first 10, I was impressed; when they kept arriving, I was surprised. On and on, until almost 11, my e-mail kept pinging; when I awoke the next morning, I saw that he had forwarded me 41 e-mails from the preceding week, each one of them numbered for my convenience. Was this compulsive behavior? \u201cNot really,\u201d Grant said. \u201cI would see it as goal-oriented and focused.\u201d He said the question had generated a new research idea for him: \u201cHow Prosocial Behavior Can Mitigate O.C.D. Tendencies.\u201d Grant\u2019s book, incorporating several decades of social-science research on reciprocity, divides the world into three categories: givers, matchers and takers. Givers give without expectation of immediate gain; they never seem too busy to help, share credit actively and mentor generously. Matchers go through life with a master chit list in mind, giving when they can see how they will get something of equal value back and to people who they think can help them. And takers seek to come out ahead in every exchange; they manage up and are defensive about their turf. Most people surveyed fall into the matcher category \u2014 but givers, Grant says, are overrepresented at both ends of the spectrum of success: they are the doormats who go nowhere or burn out, and they are the stars whose giving motivates them or distinguishes them as leaders. Much of Grant\u2019s book sets out to establish the difference between the givers who are exploited and those who end up as models of achievement. The most successful givers, Grant explains, are those who rate high in concern for others but also in self-interest. And they are strategic in their giving \u2014 they give to other givers and matchers, so that their work has the maximum desired effect; they are cautious about giving to takers; they give in ways that reinforce their social ties; and they consolidate their giving into chunks, so that the impact is intense enough to be gratifying. (Grant incorporates his field\u2019s findings into his own life with methodical rigor: one reason he meets with students four and a half hours in one day rather than spreading it out over the week is that a study found that consolidating giving yields more happiness.) The studies are elaborate, the findings nuanced \u2014 but it is easy to walk away from the book forgetting the cautionary tales about people who give too much and remembering only the wash of stories about boundless generosity resulting in surprising rewards: a computer programmer who built a Web site at no cost for music fans (one of whom turns out to be an influential figure in Silicon Valley); a financial adviser who travels to take on a client thought to be impoverished (only to find that person sitting on a significant fortune); the writers who start out working free on a project for a friend (and somehow end up among the most successful in Hollywood). I had assumed that Grant, and the other examples of extreme givers in his book, were simply superhuman in one way or another \u2014 not only in the acute empathy that makes giving so rewarding for them but also in their unusual focus and stamina and mental-processing speed, traits that allow them to bend time and squeeze in more generosity than the rest of us. Grant, clearly, has some advantages beyond his propensity to help: more than one of his colleagues told me, for example, that when they cannot find the citation for a particular paper, they simply e-mail Grant directly, who is more reliable than Google and almost as fast (his childhood friends called him Mr. Facts).

But Grant believes that in terms of giving, we all have the same muscle; it\u2019s just that he and the other givers in his book have exercised it more. In \u201cGive and Take,\u201d he cites a study that found that most people lose physical strength after enduring a test of will, like resisting chocolate-chip cookies when they are hungry. Typically, the study\u2019s subjects could squeeze a handgrip for only 25 seconds after an exercise in willpower. But one group distinguished itself, squeezing the grip for 35 seconds after the test of will. They were people who were on the giving end of the other-directedness scale. \u201cBy consistently overriding their selfish impulses in order to help others, they had strengthened their psychological muscles, to the point where using willpower for painful tasks was no longer exhausting,\u201d writes Grant of the study, conducted by researchers at Northwestern University. It seems too simple to assume that Grant just happens to be capable of great discipline across all facets of his life; all those exercises in will, he would argue, feed each other, with one making the others possible. I like to think I am a typically helpful person, but after reading Grant\u2019s book, I found myself experimenting with being more proactive about it. I started ending e-mails by encouraging people to let me know if I could help them in one way or another. I put more effort into answering random entreaties from students trying to place articles. I encouraged contacts seeking work or connections to see me as a resource. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And I did notice that simply avoiding the mental lag of deciding whether to help or not was helpful. At a minimum, Grant\u2019s example presents a bright-line rule: Unless the person on the other end is a proven taker, just do it \u2014 collaborate, offer up, grant the favor. The first time I exchanged those e-mails, I usually felt good; after the second exchange on a given topic, I thought perhaps I had done my duty. But I noticed that every offer of help I initiated or granted engendered four or five e-mails, at the end of which I sometimes felt surly and behind on my work \u2014 and then guilty for feeling that way. Worse, those exchanges often even ended with the person on the other end wanting to meet for coffee. Coffee! Now I struggled to find a way to say, gracefully, that there was no way I could meet for coffee \u2014 not this week or next or the week after that, because there are only so many hours in the day, and if I do not get home in time to make dinner, my children will dine on Pirate\u2019s Booty and Smarties, which would not make me feel helpful or productive or good. Children. It must be said that in the middle of a national debate about flexible hours and telecommuting, there is precious little in Grant\u2019s book about work and family balance. The division of labor in Grant\u2019s own marriage is very traditional; his wife, who has a degree in psychiatric nursing, does not work outside the home, devoting her time to the care of their two young daughters and their home. Grant would be an extraordinary giver under any circumstances; but it can only help that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about running to the grocery store or renewing the car registration. \u201cSometimes I tell him, \u2018Adam \u2014 just say no,\u2019 \u201d his wife, Allison, told me, referring to the hundreds of requests he gets every day. \u201cBut he can\u2019t say no. That\u2019s what he is. That\u2019s his way.\u201d Grant is devoted to his family \u2014 he has dinner most nights at home and takes his daughter to a preschool activity on many afternoons. But he also works at least one full day on the weekend, as well as six evenings a week, often well past 11. Once, when Grant was asked to give a talk on productivity, he confessed to a mentor that for all his research, he was still not sure what he did that was any different from anyone else. It wasn\u2019t exactly a mystery, his mentor told him: He worked more. \u201cI made a commitment to talk about that more,\u201d Grant said. He did not mean to suggest that everyone should work on weekends; he wanted them to be aware that they were making a choice, maybe even one they felt good about. \u201cThe way I see it, I have several different roles,\u201d he told me: teacher, scholar, adviser, friend, to name a few. \u201cI\u2019d be concerned if any of those roles took more of my time than my family.\u201d Grant, of course, has conducted a study investigating whether giving behaviors at work translate into happiness at home. He found that people who felt they had contributed to others\u2019 well-being at work did not always feel great at the end of the workday; but they usually did by bedtime, especially if they had reflected about their contribution in the intervening hours. It turns out that bringing your work home with you can be beneficial after all \u2014 if you\u2019re thinking about it the right way. A skeptic might read Grant\u2019s book and conclude that extreme givers are just matchers who are in it, maybe even subconsciously, for the long run. Eventually, in ways that are predictable and unpredictable, the bounty returns to them. Grant\u2019s giving instincts might be reflexive, but they do clearly contribute to his success. \u201cThe entire world feels like it owes him a favor \u2014 including me,\u201d says Justin Berg, a doctoral candidate who studies creativity at Wharton and who has collaborated with Grant. \u201cPeople rush at the opportunity to work with him.\u201d And one round of giving enables another: when Grant calls on a work contact and asks her to meet with an undergraduate seeking work, chances are that contact is more than happy to enable Grant\u2019s favor, because she has already been the beneficiary of more than one from him herself. The path to success is filled with people helping to clear the way. From the point of creativity, Grant\u2019s undiscriminating helpfulness also reaps professional benefits, Berg says. \u201cThe best ideas occur to people who are touching multiple worlds and domains. And in our field, he\u2019s at the nexus of a lot of them.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because one study found that old friends and connections can be even more valuable as resources than current ones \u2014 because they intersect with different worlds and therefore have more fresh ideas \u2014 Grant has a tickler built into his calendar reminding him, once a month, to get in touch with a contact he likes but with whom he has temporarily lost touch. And he is highly efficient about his giving: he virtually never says no to the five-minute favor, something that will help someone out \u2014 an introduction, a quick suggestion \u2014 but cost him very little, relative to impact. We were sitting in Grant\u2019s office one afternoon talking about efficiency, when he said: \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t care how many articles I publish or how many words I write. Productivity is an imperfect way of indexing how much I\u2019m contributing, how I\u2019m using my limited time to make the most difference.\u201d Video Are You a Giver or a Taker? The Times\u2019s Susan Dominus talks to the organizational psychologist Adam Grant about givers, takers and succeeding in the workplace. By Ben Werschkul on Publish Date March 27, 2013. . Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed It wasn\u2019t until I was transcribing the conversation a few days later that I realized that when he referred to his limited time, he wasn\u2019t just talking about a busy schedule; there was a more existential tug in the phrase. I brought it up with him by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing I almost never talk about,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBut my responsibility is to be open.\u201d Mortality, he said, was the one subject that gave him something like panic attacks. He had always felt that way, since he was a brainy, sensitive kid playing basketball in his driveway, staring at the sun, suddenly terrified of what would happen when it burned out. That was why he first wanted to be a scientist \u2014 before he realized biology bored him and he would never reinvent physics \u2014 so he could help figure out how to extend life, or at least design the spacecrafts that he is sure, even now, will take us to safer planets if this one runs dry. Mortality, he said, is \u201csomething I can\u2019t fix. I can\u2019t do anything with or about it.\u201d He can\u2019t let himself think about it too much; he has lost days at a time to his anxiety, \u201cto the point that it\u2019s the equivalent of extreme physical pain.\u201d It struck Grant as odd that no one had ever tried to figure how the awareness of death motivates people\u2019s behavior at work, and in 2009, he published a paper trying to understand the link between mortality and productivity: \u201cThe Hot and Cool of Death Awareness at Work: Mortality Cues, Aging and Self-Protective and Prosocial Motivations.\u201d The study walks the reader through the fascinating field of death awareness, which measures how people respond to reminders of death, like a news clip about a deadly car crash. When and how, he asked, does the prospect of death become relevant to employees at work? Grant argued that when people\u2019s reactions to reminders of death are \u201chot\u201d \u2014 anxious and panicked \u2014 those workers tend to withdraw. But when they are \u201ccool\u201d \u2014 more reflective, as in response to chronic reminders, the kinds, for example, firefighters face \u2014 those workers would be more likely to \u201creflect on the meaning of life and their potential contributions.\u201d Grant wrote the paper, in part, to try to sort out his own hot and cool feelings on the subject. Contemplating the meaning of life doesn\u2019t make him want to relax and work less. \u201cI always go back to William James,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.\u2019 A big part of it is being remembered.\u201d Besides, relaxing stresses him out. \u201cFor me, in my moments of idleness, I experience the most existential anxiety, so I like that every moment is scheduled, even when it\u2019s having on my calendar that I\u2019m going to watch a television show with my wife. It means my brain is engaged in other things, and it\u2019s not going to be a terrifying evening.\u201d Grant would be the first to say that he is not purely altruistic \u2014 that pure altruism, giving without regard for one\u2019s self-interest, perhaps does not even exist. When he writes those 100 student recommendations, he says, he gets the satisfaction of helping them succeed. But there are other happy byproducts of that work as well: he might end up the beneficiary of those students\u2019 good will later on and possibly inspire them to try to do right by those who will eventually ask them for help. He will also have kept himself busy enough that he won\u2019t have much time to spend agonizing over what happens when he can\u2019t give anymore. As he left the office after one of our meetings, Grant headed for his car, carrying another gift of gratitude: a twiggy box filled with organic jellies and dried fruit from the Environmental Defense Fund, to which he had recently spoken about how to motivate their fund-raisers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the way to the garage, Grant told me the story of a time that someone asked quite a lot from him. \u201cSo I got an e-mail out of the blue from a recent Ph.D. who wanted career advice,\u201d Grant said. \u201cAnd I spoke to him for a while on the phone \u2014 twice. But then, after that, he asks me if I could give him comments on his dissertation, and he sends me this thing that was like 300 pages long. It was one of those moments \u2014 yikes!\u201d Grant did not know this academic and was not an expert on the subject. This, I thought, was the long-awaited last straw, an occasion when Grant not only said no but also perhaps found the request itself galling. Surely he did not shun his family, his students, his ultimate Frisbee game, his research and his never-ending list of e-mail requests for the hours that it would have taken him to analyze a 300-page dissertation. Even Adam Grant must say no sometimes. Grant said that he rarely feels resentful of such requests. \u201cIt\u2019s on me if I want to say no,\u201d he said. \u201cI own my guilt.\u201d He did decide that in this case, the time it would take to read the paper would be excessive \u2014 and that indulging the impulse to read it all would be tantamount, in the logic of Grant\u2019s thinking, to letting himself down, flouting his own rules of efficient giving. \u201cSo I just skimmed it for the most important parts,\u201d he said, and gave general feedback on those points. The author then reworked the paper completely and sent it back to Grant to read again. Grant, of course, complied. \u201cAnd guess what?\u201d Grant said, breaking out in a smile. \u201cThe paper was great!\u201d Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.

    "text": "Spree of Obama actions revives GOP concerns over \u2018midnight\u2019 regs, agenda By Fred Lucas Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A flurry of big decisions out of the Obama administration just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office has rekindled Republican concerns about President Obama\u2019s plans for jamming through so-called \u201cmidnight regulations\u201d and other leftover items from his wish-list on his way out the door. In the last week alone, the Obama administration blocked future oil and gas leases in swaths of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans; granted a record number of pardons and commutations for a single day; and scrapped a dormant registry for male immigrants from a list of largely Muslim countries.\u00a0 Defense officials told Fox News there is an effort underway to transfer up to 22 additional detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. And Obama\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations stunned Israel on Friday by abstaining on a Security Council measure condemning settlement activity, allowing it to pass. And Obama still has a month left in office. The most recent announcements were made while the first family was on vacation in Hawaii \u2013 leaving unclear what Obama has in store for when he gets back to Washington.\u00a0 GINGRICH: OBAMA IN 'DESPERATE FRENZY' Hanging over any final actions is the likelihood that Trump, once in office, will roll back many of them. \u201cThe things he\u2019s done this week will be turned around,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said of Obama on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in this desperate frenzy.\u201d But Democrats are urging the outgoing president to pursue further actions, as the administration weighs its next steps. Among the possibilities: Sixty-four House Democrats recently asked Obama to use his pardon power to preserve his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which spared millions of illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation. Led by Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, D-Ill. , the lawmakers asked Obama in a letter to \u201cexercise your Constitutional authority to provide pardons to young people who are American in every way but on paper.\u201d\u00a0The goal is to make it more difficult for Trump to potentially deport them. The White House already has teed up the strong possibility of more clemency for nonviolent drug offenders and others. After Obama pardoned 78 people and granted another 153 commutations on Monday, White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said he expects \u201cmore grants of both commutations and pardons before [Obama] leaves office.\u201d Former President Jimmy Carter has called on Obama to go further in the Middle East and recognize a Palestinian state before leaving office. In a New York Times op-ed , he wrote: \u201cThe simple but vital step this administration must take before its term expires on Jan. 20 is to grant American diplomatic recognition to the state of Palestine.\u201d The White House has expressed reluctance to take some of these steps. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said \u201cthere is a process at the Department of Justice to review pardon applications\u201d and \u201cthe president has said he is not going to do anything to circumvent that process.\u201d As for Carter\u2019s appeal, Schultz said, \u201cI don't think [Carter\u2019s] views are new today, so I don't have any new positions or views from us on that.\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also said recently that any executive actions the president takes at this stage likely were in the works before the November election. \u201cWhat I can rule out are any sort of hastily added executive actions that weren\u2019t previously considered that would just be tacked on at the end,\u201d Earnest said. Regulation \u2018Finish Line\u2019 While Obama weighs his last batch of policy decisions, many regulations already are coming through the pipeline. The final plans reportedly include as many as 98 regulations classified as \u201ceconomically significant,\u201d meaning each would cost the economy $100 million through compliance and consumer impact. According to an analysis by the conservative American Action Forum, based on the Federal Register agenda , the administration is eyeing $44.1 billion in \u201cmidnight regulations\u201d \u2013 or rules pushed in the final two months of an outgoing administration. \u201cThis has been the most active December ever for regulations,\u201d Sam Batkins, AAF\u2019s director of regulatory affairs. Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, didn\u2019t conceal her eagerness in a staff memo sent after the election. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to you before, we\u2019re running\u2014not walking\u2014through the finish line of President Obama\u2019s presidency,\u201d McCarthy wrote. By late November, the EPA announced stronger greenhouse gas emission standards, pushing 54.1 miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2022-2025. In mid-November, the Interior Department finalized a rule to cut methane emissions during oil and natural gas production on federal lands. Among regulations expected to take effect: the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services plans to make it easier for employers to sponsor highly skilled immigrants in the country; the Education Department is working on student debt relief at for-profit colleges; and on the financial services side, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission are working on matters such as executive pay and mutual fund management. According to an administration official, the number of active rules at the end of this administration still is 15 percent lower than at the end of the George W. Bush administration. The administration also notes that some economically significant regulations help the economy. Republican Roll-Back Congressional Republicans are bent on stopping or reversing the onslaught of new rules. In a Dec. 5 letter , 20 Republican senators asked Obama to \u201chonor the will of the American people and refrain from working on or issuing any new, non-emergency regulations while carrying out your remaining term in office.\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in a Nov. 15 letter to federal agency heads signed by other House committee chairmen, asserted, \u201cwe will work with our colleagues to ensure that Congress scrutinizes your actions\u2014and, if appropriate, overturns them.\u201d The Congressional Review Act of 1996 allows Congress, with the president\u2019s signature, to rescind regulations and prohibit agencies from imposing rules that are substantively the same. That, however, would have limits even when Trump takes office, Batkins said. \u201cCongress can rescind regulations when it gets back, using the CRA, but the House and Senate will be working on health care, the economy and infrastructure,\u201d Batkins told FoxNews.com. \u201cCongress has a lot on its plate. Of the 100 or more midnight regulations that could fly through, there probably won\u2019t be more than a dozen they would be interested in repealing.\u201d Asked at a November press conference about GOP calls to hold off on finalizing rules in his final weeks in office, Obama defended their rulemaking pace: \u201cThe regulations that we have issued are ones that we've been working on for a very long time. \u2026 These aren't things that we've been surprising people with.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Lucas Tomlinson and Jennifer Bowman contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

(Photo: Apple) So you\u2019ve scored a new iPhone over the holidays. Lucky you. These new devices are Apple\u2019s best yet. Hopefully you\u2019ve spent a few days playing around with its many features, downloaded a few apps, and used the iPhone\u2019s stellar camera to capture holiday memories with friends and family. Because it\u2019s estimated we only use about 10% of what our consumer electronics are capable of \u2014\u00a0sort of like our brains, perhaps? \u2014\u00a0we\u2019ve got a few lesser-known suggestions on getting the most out of your new device. If you have any of your own tips and tricks to share, be sure to share them in the Comments section. Get reminders by location You probably know Siri, your voice-activated personal assistant, can be used to set a time-based reminder, like saying \u201cSiri, remind me to call my brother at 4 p.m.\u201d But did you know you can set location-based reminders, too? You can say \u201cRemind me to call mom when I get home,\u201d and you won\u2019t be notified until you step up to your door. If you haven\u2019t done so already, for this to work you\u2019ll need to create a Contact card with your info on it, including your name, address, and relationships (who your brother is), and so on. Similarly, you can say something like this before you walk into the mall: \u201cRemind me to get gas when I leave here later,\u201d and you\u2019ll be notified when you drive away. Can\u2019t remember where you parked? No worries, as Apple Maps now can help. \u00a0(Photo: Apple) Turn ebooks into audio books Like most smartphones, the iPhone has a number of Accessibility options. One feature is called Speak Screen and it can read aloud any text on the screen at your command. While designed primarily for the seeing impaired, anyone can take advantage of this feature if they want to turn an e-book into an audiobook. Now you can listen while commuting to and from work, while closing your eyes in bed, or when jogging down the street. To activate it, go to Settings, then General, followed by Accessibility, and finally, Speech. Now, activate Speak Screen. Then, any app you\u2019re in, swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen to hear the contents of the screen read to you, such as an ebook, email, article, or notes. You can tweak the voice (gender, language), speaking speed, and more. Take advantage of 3D Touch Those new to iPhone \u2014 mom, I\u2019m looking at you \u2014 might not know about 3D Touch available in 2015 and 2016 models of iPhone. In short, this feature can help you get more done in less time. Simply press down on app icons or notifications, and you\u2019ll likely see a list of shortcuts you can take advantage of. For example, press and hold on the Camera icon from your home screen and you can choose to take a selfie, record video, shoot a slow-mo video, and so on. Or, even from your locked iPhone, press and hold on a notification and you will see some convenient options, such as replying to an iMessage without having to unlock your device. Have fun experimenting with 3D Touch on various apps. Press down on app icons and messages to pull up a number of convenient options. \u00a0(Photo: Apple) There\u2019s a hidden trackpad Stop me if this sounds familiar: you\u2019re composing a message, email, or note, and you need to change something you typed before sending or saving. With your new iPhone, simply press and hold on the keyboard and the cursor will automatically become a mouse-like trackpad. Now keep your finger or thumb on the screen and drag around the cursor to reach the part of text that you want to tweak \u2013 or to highlight text, just press a little harder while continuing to slide your finger \u2014 and then let go for the keyboard to return. It\u2019s a flatbed scanner A number of apps, such as Microsoft\u2019s free Office Lens, turn\u00a0your smartphone into a flatbed scanner. Simply snap a pic of a document, whiteboard or blackboard, receipt or business card, and it\u2019ll be immediately digitized onto your device. Not only can you trim each document once imported, but printed and handwritten text can be automatically recognized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, so you can then search for text by keyword, as well as copy, edit and share digitized text. If desired, you can also import what you\u2019ve scanned into Office apps (Word, PowerPoint, OneNote), save to OneDrive or other cloud storage, or convert\u00a0into a PDF. Your iPhone is also a flatbed scanner.Use the free Office Len s app to \u201cscan\u201d documents, businesses cards, whiteboards, and more. \u00a0(Photo: Microsoft) Use the free Office Lens app to \u201cscan\u201d documents, businesses cards, whiteboards, and more. \u00a0(Photo: Microsoft) Record phone calls While it\u2019s not easy to do this without the help of an app, many people like the idea of recording a phone call. Available for $7.99/year, TapeACall \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 is an app that lets you easily record phone calls, whether it\u2019s calls you're already on, or calls you're about to make. Once you\u2019re done, the recordings show up instantly, and ready for you to save or share. Simply open the app and press the big red record button, then tap to add call (merge), dial a number or select a name from your contacts, hang up when you\u2019re done the conference call, and a recording of it will immediately download from TapeACall\u2019s secure servers to your phone (and time-stamped). Tap the recording to hear or share via text, email, cloud account, social media sight, and so on. In case you want or need to record a phone call, the handy TapeACall app can assist you. \u00a0(Photo: TapeACall. All Rights Reserved. Made by TelTech.) And a few more\u2026 The fastest way to take a picture when iPhone is locked? Simply swipe left to access the camera. When iPhone is connected to your car via Bluetooth or by plugging in (CarPlay), Apple\u2019s Maps app automatically marks where you park. Tap Parked Car to find your way back to it! You can change the feel of the circular Home button. Go to Settings, then General, and finally Home Button, to pick the option you like. iPhone has a hidden bubble leveler in case you want to hang a picture frame in your home. Launch the compass, swipe right to reveal the leveler, and it\u2019ll use your iPhone\u2019s built-in gyroscope sensor to see if something is an object is perfectly level (horizontal or vertical).

(Don Campbell/The Herald-Palladium via AP) 0 Shares Email It's been a white \u2014 but slick and messy \u2014 Christmas for the northern Plains and some Western states. Most of the Dakotas and southwest Minnesota had turned into a slippery mess due to freezing rain Sunday morning before snow arrived later in the day as temperatures fell. The storm also brought on widespread power outages in the Dakotas and Nebraska. As of 11:15 p.m., the South Dakota Rural Electric Association was reporting 11,079 \"member-consumer-owners\" were without power. In Nebraska, high winds were cited for hundreds of power outages in central and eastern portions of the state. \"Between the ice and snow, and winds howling like crazy, there will be nothing moving\" until late afternoon Monday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Gust in Grand Forks, North Dakota. \"Then it's dig-out time.\" Gust's advice to holiday travelers: \"Stay put.\" A blizzard warning was in effect for most of North Dakota, western South Dakota and a small section of eastern Montana through Monday, with expected snow totals of 8 to 15 inches and winds up to 55 mph. The South Dakota Department of Transportation announced the closing Sunday night of Interstate 90 from the Wyoming border to Chamberlain \u2014 a stretch of about 260 miles. \"The freezing rain from earlier today and dropping temps have created icy and slushy roadways; falling snow and increasing winds are creating zero visibility conditions in the west,\" the department said in a statement. The North Dakota Transportation Department closed a 240-mile stretch of Interstate 94 Sunday night, from the Montana border to Jamestown. A 100-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 83 between Bismarck and Minot also was closed due to drifting snow and near-zero visibility. Up to a ? inch of ice could accumulate in central Minnesota, and the weather service has said anyone who \"must travel\" should have an extra flashlight, food and water. The NWS office in Aberdeen, South Dakota, issued a flash flood warning for Brown County Sunday night due to the combination of rain and melting snow. As of shortly after 6 p.m., flooding was reported at several major intersections in Aberdeen. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Tribune news services Contact Reporter Property owners can take comfort, but shouldn't lapse into negligence, now that the Illinois Supreme Court has clarified a 1979 state law protecting them from some slip-and-fall lawsuits. The high\u00a0court reaffirmed earlier this month that the Snow and Ice Removal Act shields property owners from liability if someone gets hurt because they didn't do a good enough job of shoveling, but only when the snow or ice was the result of natural conditions. The court ruled Dec. 1 that when lawmakers passed the law nearly four decades ago, they meant to protect property owners from injury claims resulting from inadequate shoveling. The law, the court said, was intended to encourage people to voluntarily clear their sidewalks. But property owners aren't free to ignore hazardous \"unnatural accumulations\" of ice and snow, the court said. The case stems from a suburban Chicago woman who fell on an icy sidewalk outside her Carol Stream condo building in 2011, breaking her leg, knee and hip. Pamela Murphy-Hylton claims that inadequate drainage and the placement of downspouts caused the icy patch. She's seeking damages from the condominium association and the property management company. Attorneys for Klein Creek Condominium Association and Lieberman Management Services had argued the law gave them immunity, winning a summary judgment in trial court that was reversed on appeal. The Illinois Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Mary Jane Theis, affirmed the appellate court's judgment and sent the case back to the trial court. ",

USA TODAY Kate McKinnon is USA TODAY's Entertainer of the Year. (Photo: Steve Granitz, WireImage) At the start of 2016, we didn\u2019t know how much we\u2019d need Kate McKinnon. This summer, as the Ghostbusters reboot became the latest big-budget female-led comedy to be\u00a0sucked into a misogynistic Twitter vortex, it was McKinnon\u2019s comic stylings that answered our call. What the movie lacked in critical love was made up for in her memorable take on Holtzmann, a profoundly and charmingly weird engineering whiz (whose science vibes gave zero cares about that\u00a0nearby hottie\u00a0Chris Hemsworth). Her film career has since taken off. Just in time for the holidays, she's\u00a0in theaters stealing scenes in the ensemble comedy\u00a0Office Christmas Party, playing it straight as the company's uniquely helpful\u00a0HR director. And it was just announced McKinnon is set to star in her own film as a scarily magical\u00a0school cafeteria worker\u00a0in The Lunch Witch. USA TODAY Author of the Year: Colson Whitehead But it was this fall on Saturday Night Live that the comedian truly harnessed her talents\u00a0before an anxiety-ridden nation. The SNL staple had long played Hillary Clinton on the show, but as Election Day came into focus, McKinnon translated the Democratic candidate\u00a0with new fervor, surpassing Amy Poehler's impersonation\u00a0and earning the icon status last awarded to Tina Fey\u00a0playing Sarah Palin\u00a0in 2008. Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) was the quirky highlight of the new 'Ghostbusters.' \u00a0(Photo: Hopper Stone, Hopper Stone) Week after week, dressed in a multitude of pantsuits, McKinnon satirized the election's\u00a0political jousting, often saying\u00a0what the real Clinton couldn't. \"I'm better than ever, let's do this,\" she said in the season opener, ducking and rolling before taking\u00a0a fighter's stance. The sketch was a play on\u00a0Clinton's bout of\u00a0pneumonia, though could just as easily have applied to McKinnon's\u00a0hand in returning the show to must-watch status. After the second debate, she mocked Trump's\u00a0attempts to divert attention\u00a0by giving front-row seats to Bill Clinton accusers. \"Wait, I'm sorry who's here? Mistresses? Bill, how could you? How could I go on with the debate? Oh no, I'll never be able to remember facts and figures now. Oh, Donald, no!\" she said sarcastically.\u00a0\"Get real, I'm made of steel, this is nothing. Hi girls!\" Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton on 'Saturday Night Live.' \u00a0(Photo: Will Heath, AP) Alec Baldwin, like the politician he played, may have dominated\u00a0headlines, but McKinnon's delivery and range of characters have anchored the new wave of SNL. In the waning\u00a0days of the election cycle, McKinnon bounced seamlessly\u00a0from the role of\u00a0Clinton to Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager and frequent surrogate on news talk shows. After winning an Emmy in September, McKinnon delivered\u00a0one of the best sketches of the year, bringing an exhausted Conway to life,\u00a0imagining the spokeswoman's hard-won\u00a0day off, Ferris Bueller-style, repeatedly cut short by calls to appear on CNN to explain\u00a0Trump's never-ending controversial tweets. And McKinnon's\u00a0still at it, this past weekend morphing from\u00a0Conway in the cold open prepping\u00a0Trump for office to\u00a0Clinton, in a pointed\u00a0Love\u00a0Actually-themed\u00a0sketch making her\u00a0last-gasp\u00a0case on a voting member of the Electoral College's doorstep. Yet no appearance was more effective than on Nov. 12, when McKinnon delivered one heck of an electoral\u00a0finale. Sitting at a piano in a white pantsuit,\u00a0the\u00a0glassy-eyed comedian sang Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah in SNL's cold open, a moving tribute to those who had hoped for a first female president, and to Cohen, who had died just days before. No jokes. No cue cards. Just one woman, offering catharsis to\u00a0a divided nation.

The audio, which was released on Saturday by LiveATC.net and obtained by the Reuters news agency, offered insight into events as they unfolded during Fisher\u2019s medical emergency on Friday. She was flying from London to Los Angeles. \u201cWe have some passengers, nurses assisting the passenger,\u201d the pilot of the plane told air traffic control. \u201cWe have an unresponsive passenger. They\u2019re working on her right now.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cIs there medical personnel at the gate?\u201d the air traffic control operator asked. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve coordinated medical personnel for the gate,\u201d the pilot responded. Carrie Fisher in critical condition after heart attack Tributes and well-wishes continued to pour in for the \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress on Saturday, as she spent Christmas Eve in a Los Angeles hospital. \u201cPrincess Leia can survive anything!\u201d one fan wrote on Twitter. \u201cHold on, Carrie Fisher. We\u2019re taking you into 2017 with us,\u201d wrote another.\u00a0 Her \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-star Harrison Ford said, \u201cI\u2019m shocked and saddened to hear the news about my dear friend. Our thoughts are with Carrie, her family and friends.\u201d Another co-star, Mark Hamill, said he was \u201csending all our love.\u201d\u00a0 as if 2016 couldn't get any worse... sending all our love to @carrieffisher \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 23, 2016 Todd Fisher, the actress\u2019 brother, said Friday night that his sister was receiving excellent care, but that he could not classify her condition. He had earlier told The Associated Press that she had been stabilized and was out of the emergency room. In a subsequent interview he said many details about her condition or what caused the medical emergency are unknown.\u00a0 Fans on Twitter hoped she would pull through. One wrote: \u201cCarrie Fisher survived alcoholism, addiction, depression, bipolar disorder & 60 years in Hollywood. If anyone can survive 2016, it\u2019s her.\u201d\u00a0 Carrie Fisher survived alcoholism, addiction, depression, bipolar disorder & 60 years in Hollywood. If anyone can survive 2016, it's her. \u2014 Ryan Sloane (@RyanFSloane) December 23, 2016 The actress\u2019 former co-star Peter Mayhew, who played \u201cStar Wars\u201d character Chewbacca, called her \u201ceveryone\u2019s favorite princess right now.\u201d\u00a0 A law enforcement official told CBS News Fisher went into cardiac arrest. Celebrity website TMZ, which first reported the incident, said anonymous sources told them the actress suffered a heart attack. She was treated by paramedics immediately after the plane she was taking from London landed in Los Angeles, according to reports citing unnamed sources.\u00a0 Todd Fisher said much of what had been reported about the incident was speculation.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to wait and be patient,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so little information ourselves.\u201d Fisher\u2019s publicists and representatives for her mother, Debbie Reynolds, and her daughter, Billie Lourd, did not return calls from the AP. Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott said paramedics administered advanced life-saving care to a patient at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday and transported the person to a nearby hospital. He did not identify the patient. A large gathering of media personnel was camped outside Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles hospital, where TMZ and the Los Angeles Times reported she had been taken. Fisher is considered by many to be a member of Hollywood royalty -- her parents are Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher. Catapulted to stardom as Princess Leia in 1977\u2019s \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Carrie Fisher reprised the role as the leader of a galactic rebellion in three sequels, including last year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d The author and actress may be best known for her portrayal of Leia, but she is also an accomplished writer known for no-holds-barred accounts of her struggles with addiction and mental illness. Most recently, Fisher has been promoting her latest book, \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d in which she reveals that she and co-star Harrison Ford had an affair on the set of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

In Britain, he was showered with awards, and in 2004, Britain\u2019s Radio Academy said he had been the most-played performer on British radio from 1984 to 2004. Photo Mr. Michael performing solo at Madison Square Garden in 1988. He later turned away from live shows. Credit Ebet Roberts In 1998, Mr. Michael came out as gay after being arrested on charges of lewd conduct in a men\u2019s room in Beverly Hills, Calif. He had long lent his name and music to support AIDS prevention and gay rights. During interviews in later years, he described himself as bisexual, and said that hiding his sexuality had made him feel \u201cfraudulent.\u201d He also described long struggles with depression. During the 2000s, Mr. Michael\u2019s output slowed; his last studio album of new songs was \u201cPatience\u201d in 2004. In later years he put out individual songs as free downloads, encouraging listeners to contribute to charity. But in 2006, 25 years into his career, he could still headline stadiums worldwide. George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in East Finchley, London, on June 25, 1963, the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur and an English dancer. In 1979, he and a schoolmate, Andrew Ridgeley, played together for the first time in a ska band called the Executive. That didn\u2019t last, but they continued to make music together \u2014 nearly all of it composed and sung by Mr. Michael \u2014 and began releasing singles as Wham!, cultivating the image of carefree teenage rebels in songs like \u201cYoung Guns (Go for It!).\u201d Their 1983 debut album, \u201cFantastic,\u201d reached No. 1 in Britain; in the United States, their 1984 single \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go\u201d became ubiquitous on MTV and reached No. 1. In 1985, the duo became the first major Western pop group to perform in China as part of its world tour, and Mr. Michael appeared at the Live Aid charity concert, telecast worldwide, joining Elton John to sing Mr. John\u2019s song \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me.\u201d Photo Mr. Michael became one of pop\u2019s reigning stars in the 1980s in Wham! Credit Ian Dickson/Redferns The worldwide 1984 hit \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d credited in Britain to George Michael solo and to Wham! featuring George Michael in the United States, signaled a turn away from perky teenage fare. Mr. Michael\u2019s status as a top British pop star was confirmed by his appearance on Band Aid\u2019s \u201cDo They Know It\u2019s Christmas?,\u201d the 1984 all-star benefit single for Ethiopian famine relief. In 1986, Wham! dissolved, with a farewell show at Wembley Stadium. Mr. Michael had a No. 1 hit with \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting (for Me)\u201d before releasing the album \u201cFaith\u201d in 1987. Its first single, \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d reached No. 2 in the United States, though it was seen as too risqu\u00e9 by some radio stations; Mr. Michael made an introduction to its video clip stating, \u201cThis song is not about casual sex.\u201d George Michael - I Want Your Sex (Stereo Version) Video by georgemichaelVEVO \u201cFaith,\u201d which hinted at both gospel and rockabilly, reached No. 1, and the album included three more No. 1 hits: \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cMonkey\u201d and \u201cOne More Try.\u201d It has sold more than 10 million copies in the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But for his next album, \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d released in 1990, Mr. Michael set out to jettison his pop persona. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure,\u201d he told an interviewer at the time. \u201cI think that\u2019s the ultimate tragedy of fame, people who are simply out of control, who are lost. I\u2019ve seen so many of them, and I don\u2019t want to be another clich\u00e9.\u201d Photo Aretha Franklin joined Mr. Michael in 1988 in Auburn Hills, Mich., on his tour for his Grammy-winning album \u201cFaith.\u201d Credit Robert Kozloff/Associated Press The autobiographical \u201cFreedom \u201990\u201d declared his independence from the pop machine; he wasn\u2019t in its video clip, which had supermodels lip-syncing the lyrics. The album also included a No. 1 single, the ballad \u201cPraying for Time,\u201d and has sold two million copies in the United States, but after the blockbuster of \u201cFaith\u201d it was considered a commercial letdown. George Michael - Freedom! '90 Video by georgemichaelVEVO Mr. Michael entered a protracted legal battle with Sony Music over his contract, and was unable to release another album until 1996. Its title, \u201cOlder,\u201d was an unmistakable signal that he was no longer directly courting the youth market; he was 32 years old. The album was an instant hit in England and Europe \u2014 it had six hit singles in England \u2014 though it was less popular in the United States. After his 1998 arrest, Mr. Michael released a greatest-hits album with two new songs; one, \u201cOutside,\u201d set its video clip in a men\u2019s restroom. He made a 1999 album of cover songs, \u201cSongs of the Last Century.\u201d In the early 2000s, Mr. Michael released songs protesting the invasion of Iraq, including the 2002 \u201cShoot the Dog.\u201d His last full studio album, \u201cPatience,\u201d was released in 2004, full of introspective ballads. Mr. Michael returned to performing; he joined Paul McCartney onstage during the 2005 Live 8 benefit concert. In 2006, he performed a world tour, paired with another collection of hits, \u201cTwenty Five,\u201d which included new duets with Mr. McCartney and Mary J. Blige. He continued to release individual songs sporadically, and in 2014, he released \u201cSymphonica,\u201d a collection of standards and his own songs recorded with an orchestra on a 2010-11 tour. During that tour, he collapsed with nearly fatal pneumonia and was hospitalized for five weeks; he wrote a single, \u201cWhite Light,\u201d about the experience. Mr. Michael had been planning an expanded reissue, due in 2017, of \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d paired with a documentary, \u201cFreedom,\u201d exploring his musical, personal and legal struggles. \u201cI never minded being thought of as a pop star,\u201d Mr. Michael told GQ in 2004. \u201cPeople have always thought I wanted to be seen as a serious musician, but I didn\u2019t, I just wanted people to know that I was absolutely serious about pop music.\u201d Correction: December 25, 2016 An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of Mr. Michael\u2019s Wham! bandmate. He is Andrew Ridgeley, not Ridgely. Niraj Chokshi contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on December 26, 2016, on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: George Michael, 53, Pop Superstar  Who Rose to Fame in Wham!, Dies.

President-elect Donald Trump looks on while speaking during a 'Thank You Tour 2016' rally in Orlando, Florida on Dec.\u00a016, 2016. (Jim Watson / AFP/Getty Images) Lisa LererAssociated Press Donald Trump spent the past two years attacking rival Hillary Clinton as crooked, corrupt, and weak. But some of those attacks seem to have already slipped into the history books. From installing Wall Street executives in his Cabinet to avoiding news conferences, the president-elect is adopting some of the same behavior for which he criticized Clinton during their fiery presidential campaign. Here's a look at what Trump said then \u2014 and what he's doing now: GOLDMAN SACHS Then: \"I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\" Trump said at a South Carolina rally in February, when he was locked in a fierce primary battle with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \"They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\" Now: A number of former employees of the Wall Street bank will pay a key role in crafting Trump's economic policy. He's tapped Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn to lead the White House National Economic Council. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, spent 17 years working at Goldman Sachs and Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor, started his career as an investment banker at the firm. Trump is following in a long political tradition, though one he derided on the campaign trail: If Cohn accepts the nomination, he'll be the third Goldman executive to run the NEC. BIG DONORS Then: \"Crooked Hillary. Look, can you imagine another four years of the Clintons? Seriously. It's time to move on. And she's totally controlled by Wall Street and all these people that gave her millions,\" Trump said at a May rally in Lynden, Washington. (Cathleen Decker) Now: Trump has stocked his Cabinet with six top donors \u2014 far more than any recent White House. \"I want people that made a fortune. Because now they're negotiating with you, OK?\" Trump said, in a December 9 speech in Des Moines. The biggest giver? Incoming small business administrator Linda McMahon gave $7.5 million to a super PAC backing Trump, more than a third of the money collected by the political action committee. NEWS CONFERENCES Then: \"She doesn't do news conferences, because she can't,\" Trump said at an August rally in Ashburn, Virginia. \"She's so dishonest she doesn't want people peppering her with questions.\" Now: Trump opened his last news conference on July 27, saying: \"You know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that it's fun.\" He hasn't held one since. Trump skipped the news conference a president-elect typically gives after winning the White House. Instead, he released a YouTube video of under three minutes. He also recently abruptly canceled plans to hold his first post-election news conference, opting instead to describe his plans for managing his businesses in tweets. \"I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!\" he tweeted in mid-December. FAMILY TIES Then: \"It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money,\" Trump said at an August rally in Austin. President-elect Donald Trump said he plans to shut down his charitable foundation, a decision that comes after repeated controversies over how it collected and disbursed funds. In a statement Saturday, Trump offered no timeline for when his foundation would close down, but said he had directed... President-elect Donald Trump said he plans to shut down his charitable foundation, a decision that comes after repeated controversies over how it collected and disbursed funds. In a statement Saturday, Trump offered no timeline for when his foundation would close down, but said he had directed... (Mark Berman, David A. Fahrenthold) Now: While Trump has promised to separate himself from his businesses, there is plenty of overlap between his enterprises and his immediate family. His companies will be run by his sons, Donald Jr and Eric. And his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have joined Trump at a number of meetings with world leaders of countries where the family has financial interests. In a financial disclosure he was required to file during the campaign, Trump listed stakes in about 500 companies in at least 25 countries. Ivanka, in particular, has been caught making early efforts to leverage her father's new position into profits. After an interview with the family appeared on \"60 Minutes,\" her jewelry company, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, blasted out an email promoting the $10,800 gold bangle bracelet that she had worn during the appearance. The company later said they were \"proactively discussing new policies and procedures.\" Ivanka is also auctioning off a private coffee meeting with her to benefit her brother's foundation. The meeting is valued at $50,000, with the current top bid coming in at $25,000. \"United States Secret Service will be Present for the Duration of the Experience,\" warns the auction site. Trump on Saturday said he would dissolve his charitable foundation amid efforts to eliminate any conflicts of interest before he takes office next month. CLINTON INVESTIGATIONS Then: \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor,\" Trump said in the October presidential debate. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Because of domestic political opposition, it has been all but impossible for Japanese leaders to visit Pearl Harbor until now. In 1994, when Emperor Akihito tried to visit the memorial , atop the remains of the U.S.S. Arizona, the American battleship on which the worst losses occurred, protests from Japan\u2019s nationalist right wing prompted him to alter his plans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But after Mr. Abe, who is a conservative politician with strong ties to nationalist groups, announced his plans this month, the reception in Japan was largely positive. Even the far-right Sankei newspaper \u2014 though grumbling that Mr. Abe should first revisit Yasukuni , a shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are enshrined \u2014 described Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to Hawaii as \u201can opportunity to refresh a commitment to deepen the U.S.-Japan friendship and contribute peace to the world through a tranquil ceremony.\u201d Some Japanese news media suggested that the Pearl Harbor trip could even lift Mr. Abe\u2019s approval ratings and give him the confidence to call an election in January. The Japanese public is also aware of the importance of a symbolic visit to Pearl Harbor at a time of uncertainty in its country\u2019s relationship with the United States. Although the premier\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor was in the planning stages even before the American presidential election, Donald J. Trump\u2019s win scared Japanese leaders because he had spent time on the campaign trail castigating Japan for not paying enough for its own defense. And when Mr. Obama made a visit to Hiroshima in May, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter : \u201cDoes President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\u2019s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost.\u201d Mr. Abe is not the first sitting prime minister to visit the Pearl Harbor memorial (Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida apparently visited the memorial during a stop in Hawaii in 1951), but he will be the first to participate in a public ceremony there. He is not expected to apologize for the attacks, much as Mr. Obama did not apologize for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Instead, Mr. Abe will most likely repeat the repentance and condolences he offered in April 2015 when he addressed Congress . Although it was 75 years in the making, Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to Pearl Harbor is in some ways the easiest gesture of reconciliation that Japan could make as it confronts its wartime past. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Asia has long been plagued by an inability among the war\u2019s combatants to move beyond its events and enmities. South Korea and China remain angered by what they see as Japanese efforts to ignore or sugarcoat atrocities. By contrast, the relationship between Japan and the United States long ago overcame such difficulties. \u201cI think that\u2019s because the United States was a good winner and Japan was a good loser,\u201d said Tamaki Tsukada, a spokesman at the Japanese Embassy in Washington. \u201cThe United States was magnanimous after defeating Japan. It did not impose harsh terms. If anything, the U.S. provided very generous support, humanitarian and economic.\u201d The Japanese accepted the American postwar occupation peacefully. Even in the United States, where \u201cRemember Pearl Harbor\u201d was once a rallying cry, the sense of outrage about what was viewed as a sneaky and disreputable attack has largely dissipated, said Daniel Martinez, the chief historian at the Pearl Harbor memorial. Part of that is time, and also sympathetic popular culture portrayals of Japanese attackers in movies like \u201cTora! Tora! Tora!\u201d and \u201cPearl Harbor,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cI never hated the Japanese, and I don\u2019t need an apology,\u201d said Stu Hedley, 95, who was a seaman on the battleship West Virginia, which settled to the bottom of the harbor after the attack. \u201cI welcome this visit.\u201d In Japan, Pearl Harbor is often defined as one bookend of a war that ended with the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which some Japanese see as morally absolving the country of its aggression. Guidelines from the Ministry of Education for teaching history stipulate that students learn that \u201cJapan caused tremendous damage to many countries, especially in Asia, and that Japan also suffered unprecedented damages in the Tokyo air raids, the Battle of Okinawa and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\u201d While most Japanese students visit Hiroshima or Nagasaki at least once during their school years, Pearl Harbor merits just one or two lines in most textbooks. \u201cThe younger generation knows the term Pearl Harbor, but they don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d said Katsutoshi Chujo, a middle school history teacher near Tokyo. \u201cMost young people don\u2019t know much about the war. They know about Japan as a victim in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Tokyo air raids.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Several textbooks used in public schools describe it as a surprise attack on the United States that followed a long campaign in China. But a textbook that takes a more nationalist view and that has been approved by the Education Ministry portrays the attacks as being forced by American demands and describes Japan as waging a war of \u201cself-defense.\u201d Some historians worry that Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor will forestall broader atonement for Japan\u2019s wartime aggression in Asia. \u201cBy commemorating Pearl Harbor, if the whole society marginalizes the whole process that led to Pearl Harbor, that commemoration becomes an act of forgetting as well,\u201d said Yujin Yaguchi , a professor of American studies at the University of Tokyo. In the complex and highly choreographed world of war memory, scholars say, Mr. Abe\u2019s trip to Pearl Harbor is an important, if early, step. \u201cThere is a chronology to public memory,\u201d said Carol Gluck , a professor of history at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University. \u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t remember what they ought to remember in some abstract moral calculus. It\u2019s very political, and the domestic political calculus comes first.\u201d With some on the left in Japan calling for Mr. Abe to visit important war memorials in South Korea or China, analysts say political leaders need to build trust and share broader strategic goals before such symbolic gestures can take place. While Japan has a strong alliance with the United States, it does not share that kind of trust with China, and its relationship with South Korea is still shaky. \u201cThese visits don\u2019t cause reconciliation,\u201d said Jennifer Lind , an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and the author of \u201cSorry States: Apologies in International Politics.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite. Reconciliation causes these visits.\u201d Correction: December 25, 2016 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo. It pays tribute to some war criminals from the World War II era, but it does not house their remains. Motoko Rich reported from Tokyo, and Gardiner Harris from Washington and Honolulu.

Wochit-All George Michael, pictured here in September 2010, died over the Christmas holiday, his publicist confirms. (Photo: Leon Neal, AFP/Getty Images) George Michael, the British singer, musician and founding member of Wham!, died over the\u00a0Christmas holiday, his publicist confirms to USA TODAY. \u00a0He was 53. \"It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully\u00a0at home over the Christmas period,\" read a statement sent to USA TODAY by Michael's London-based publicist,\u00a0Connie Filippello. \"The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\" The musician\u00a0died in Goring, England. The BBC was the first to report Michael's death. The cause of death was heart failure, according to Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter . The pop star's death stunned\u00a0the entertainment community.\u00a0His U.S. publicist, Cindi Berger, told the Associated Press he had not been ill. \"I am in deep shock,\" Elton John wrote on Instagram . \"I have lost a beloved friend \u2014 the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans.\" Michael\u00a0sold more than 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy Awards, and recorded duets with Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and John, among others. Stunned stars react to George Michael's death Few teen idols have made critics eat their words more handily than Michael did back in his late-\u201980s heyday, when the former Wham! frontman emerged as one of the most successful and admired singer/songwriters of that decade. But in the years that followed, Michael made news more frequently for his professional struggles and personal scandal, even as he continued to record and tour profitably and inspire\u00a0younger acts. Born Georgios Panayiotou in North London \u2014 his father was a Greek immigrant \u2014 Michael met another aspiring musician, Andrew Ridgeley, while both were attending secondary school in Hertfordshire. By 1982, they were recording together as the bubble-gum duo Wham!, and within two years they would be among the world\u2019s most popular acts, with bouncy hits such as Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go and Freedom becoming staples of the early MTV era. One song from Wham!\u2019s American breakthrough\u00a0album, Make It Big, was credited to Michael as a solo artist when it was released as a single: the lovelorn ballad Careless Whisper, which reached No. 1 in the U.K., the USA and various other countries. That feat, and subsequent well-received solo turns, including a duet with Aretha Franklin (1987\u2019s I Knew You Were Waiting for Me), led many to suspect that Wham!\u2019s frontman had abilities and ambitions beyond making little girls scream. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. George Michael went from the frontman of Wham! (he's pictured, right, with bandmate Andrew Ridgeley) to becoming a successful solo singer/songwriter.

You may also like these photo galleries: Replay Last Slide Next Slide Michael\u2019s first solo album, 1987\u2019s Faith, confirmed that. With six top-five singles \u2014 among them the title track, the then-controversial smash I Want Your Sex and the rhapsodic Father Figure \u2014 Faith dominated the charts for much of 1988, and has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide to date. But Michael\u2019s solo debut, which earned a Grammy Award in 1989 for album of the year, was more than a commercial milestone. Faith\u2019s artful blend of pop, funk and blue-eyed-soul textures made it the first album by a Caucasian artist to reach the top position on Billboard\u2019s R&B chart. Michael\u2019s intense creative involvement \u2014 he wrote all the songs, most independently, and also produced \u2014 helped reshape the template for pop acts. Even Michael Jackson hadn\u2019t been quite so autonomous, collaborating heavily with Quincy Jones and others on his \u201980s megahits. If Faith clearly demanded a new level of respect, some viewed Michael\u2019s behavior in its wake as self-defeating. He refused to actively promote his much-anticipated follow-up album, 1990\u2019s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1, and didn't\u00a0appear in its music videos; for the hit single Freedom! '90, he memorably tapped a bevy of supermodels, among them Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, to lip-sync the lyrics. Listen\u00a0yielded other hits, notably the chart-topping first single Praying for Time, but didn\u2019t approach the massive success of its predecessor. Michael wound up suing his label, Sony Music, for insufficiently supporting him, and a Vol. 2 was abandoned amid legal battles. He\u00a0continued to release albums \u2014 Michael's last studio effort, the aptly titled Patience, came out in 2004, and his\u00a0final album was 2014's live Symphonica\u00a0\u2014 but his music career would be overshadowed by\u00a0his tabloid exploits. Longstanding questions about Michael\u2019s sexual orientation came to the fore in 1998, when he was arrested for lewd behavior after revealing himself to another man, who turned out to be a police officer, in a public restroom in Beverly Hills. Michael would later make light of the incident, and became more open about his homosexuality. Having lost a partner, Brazilian designer Anselmo Feleppa, to a cerebral hemorrhage in 1993, Michael began a long-term relationship a few years later, with Texas-born businessman Kenny Goss; they split in 2009. The singer, whose charity work dates back to his participation in the 1984 Band Aid single Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, also raised money for AIDS research and terminally ill children. There would be other run-ins with the law for Michael, who between 2006 and 2010 was arrested several times in London for possession of drugs and driving under the influence.\u00a0Michael was hospitalized in November 2011 in Austria for pneumonia after postponing a series of concerts. In 2004, the Radio Academy declared that his music had been played on British radio more than that of any artist between 1984 and 2004. That year, Michael told USA TODAY that he \u201cwas kind of glad that my success level went down in America. I got more of a life, got to enjoy being in America, with less attention than I was used to in Europe. But now I\u2019m strong again. I feel ready to take on the world.\u201d Contributing: The Associated Press 29295 CONNECT TWEET 48 LINKEDIN 134 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iuBm8m NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

    "text": "By Ruth Eglash December 25 at 12:52 PM Follow @reglash JERUSALEM \u2014 The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, was requested Sunday to attend a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the United States\u2019 refusal to block a U.N. Security Council resolution that harshly criticized Israeli settlements, a senior official in the prime minister\u2019s office said. The meeting follows a series of summons Sunday, Christmas Day, of envoys from countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel and that voted in favor of the resolution. Passing by a vote of 14 to 0, the resolution declares that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have \u201cno legal validity\u201d and constitute a \u201cflagrant violation under international law.\u201d It also calls the settlements a major obstacle to achieving a two-state solution and peace with the Palestinians. Breaking with a long-standing policy of blocking resolutions dealing with Israel, the United States did not use its veto powers to stop its passage, opting to abstain instead. [ U.S. declines to veto U.N. Security Council resolution for Israel to stop Jewish settlement activity ] (Reuters) The summons were part of a series of diplomatic measures announced by Netanyahu, who is also Israel\u2019s foreign minister, since the resolution was adopted Friday. Israeli media reported Sunday that Netanyahu had instructed members of his cabinet to refrain from traveling to countries that voted for the resolution. Following the U.N. vote, Netanyahu recalled Israel\u2019s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal and canceled scheduled trips to Israel by the Senegalese foreign minister and Ukraine\u2019s prime minister. He also said that Israeli aid to Senegal will be canceled and that contributions Israel makes to five U.N. agencies will be halted. \u201cI share my ministers\u2019 feelings of anger and frustration vis-a-vis the unbalanced resolution,\u201d Netanyahu said at his weekly cabinet meeting Sunday. He laid blame for the resolution squarely on the shoulders of President Obama. \u201cFrom the information we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Netanyahu said. (Reuters) He said the move contradicted traditional American policy not to dictate terms of a permanent peace agreement on Israel. \u201cOver decades, American administrations and Israeli governments had disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the Security Council was not the place to resolve this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I told [U.S. Secretary of State] John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s anger was matched by more-militant voices in his right-wing coalition. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, held a news conference at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, one of Judaism\u2019s holiest sites, saying the city has been the capital of Jews for 3,000 years. He said that in response to the resolution, Israel should evaluate its approach to the 1994 Oslo Accords, which set out a plan for two states, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians. He said that Israel should instead impose sovereignty on land it captured after the 1967 war. He also urged the government to ramp up construction in Israeli settlements, built on land the Palestinians hope to use for a state. The Israeli human rights organization B\u2019Tselem estimates that there are close to 600,000 Israelis living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The figures are based on data from Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics and the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies. Palestinians say the figure is probably higher. Over the past six months, Israel has announced plans to add hundreds of units to existing settlements, each time drawing a rebuke from the White House. More recently, right-wing voices in Netanyahu\u2019s government have been pushing legislation to legalize settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land. The U.S. abstention Friday was a rare rebuke to Israel, reflecting mounting frustration in the Obama administration over settlement growth. With his time in office due to end in less than a month, Obama\u2019s decision not to veto was a last-minute symbolic statement of that displeasure and a sense of exasperation that the time has come for two states to be carved out of the contested land. Responding with a strongly worded statement, Netanyahu said the Obama administration had \u201cnot only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the U.N., it has colluded with it behind the scenes.\u201d He said he looked forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump \u201cto negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\u201d Media reports Sunday said Netanyahu had instructed Foreign Ministry officials to look into ways to overturn the resolution. Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and until recently the director general of the Foreign Ministry, said it was possible to bring another resolution to supersede the previous one. This happened, he said, with a 1975 U.N. decision stating that Zionism is racism. It took nearly 20 years and a unique set of political circumstances, including the support of former U.S. president George H.W. Bush, to change that decision, Gold said. \u201cI can\u2019t speculate about the Trump administration, but I think his instincts about how this resolution damages peacemaking and negotiations are absolutely correct,\u201d said Gold, who served as Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations from 1997 to 1999. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s self-righteousness that this resolution is going to be changed or reversed by Trump is totally unfounded,\u201d said Alon Pinkas, a former diplomat and adviser to Israeli prime ministers. \u201cIf he really thinks this can happen, then either he is panicking or plainly misleading.\u201d Pinkas said that while the resolution was unlikely to have any immediate consequences, in the long term it could set an international precedent on Israel and its settlements.

Security Council resolution demanding an end to settlement-building. Separately, the envoys of 10 other nations were called in to the Israeli Foreign Ministry to be reprimanded on Sunday, and Netanyahu had more harsh words for Washington over Friday's U.N. vote. An Israeli spokesman gave no details of when Netanyahu would meet U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro. The resolution was passed in the 15-member Security Council because the U.S. broke with its long-standing approach of diplomatically shielding Israel and did not wield its veto power, instead abstaining. Related: Vote on Israel Could Spur Further Action \u2014 or Trouble for U.N. Netanyahu put his personal imprint on Israel's show of anger by repeating at the weekly cabinet meeting what an unidentified Israeli government official contended on Friday \u2014 that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama had conspired with the Palestinians to push for the resolution's adoption. The White House has denied the allegation. \"According to our information, we have no doubt the Obama administration initiated it (the resolution), stood behind it, coordinated the wording and demanded it be passed,\" Netanyahu told the cabinet in public remarks. Another official said Netanyahu had ordered that for the coming three weeks, until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, cabinet ministers refrain from traveling to or meeting officials of countries that voted in favor of the resolution.

Sunday is a regular work day in Israel, but most embassies are closed, and calling in envoys on Christmas Day is highly unusual. At the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu described a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, when Israel and President-elect Donald Trump successfully pressed Egypt to drop the anti-settlement resolution it had put forward. It was resubmitted a day later by New Zealand, Senegal, Venezuela and Malaysia. \"Over decades American administrations and Israeli governments disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the security council was not the place to resolve this issue,\" Netanyahu said. \"We knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace farther away. As I told John Kerry on Thursday, 'Friends don't take friends to the Security Council',\" he said, switching from Hebrew to English.

Israel disagrees, citing biblical and historical connections to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as security interests. Reuters ",

    "text": "Russia Examines All Possible Reasons for Black Sea Jet Crash By vladimir isachenkov and veronika silchenko, associated press SOCHI, Russia \u0097 Dec 25, 2016, 3:15 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this photo taken on Thursday, March 31, 2016, the Alexandrov Ensemble choir performs during a concert in Moscow, Russia. A Russian plane with 92 people aboard, including the well-known military band, crashed into the Black Sea on its way to Syria on Sunday, Dec. 25, minutes after takeoff from the resort city of Sochi, the Defense Ministry said. The Tu-154, which belonged to the ministry, was taking the Alexandrov Ensemble to a concert at the Russian air base in Syria. (AP Photo) 0 Shares Email Backed by ships, helicopters and drones, Russian rescue teams searched Sunday for victims after a Russian plane carrying 92 people to Syria crashed into the Black Sea shortly after takeoff. Investigators said they were looking into every possible cause for the crash, including a terror attack. All 84 passengers and eight crew members on the Russian military's Tu-154 plane are believed to have died when it crashed two minutes after taking off at 5:25 a.m. in good weather from the southern Russian city of Sochi. The passengers included dozens of singers in Russia's world-famous military choir. More than 3,000 rescue workers on 32 ships \u2014 including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia \u2014 were searching the crash site at sea and along the shore, the Defense Ministry said. Helicopters, drones and submersibles were being used to help spot bodies and debris. Powerful spotlights were brought in so the operation could continue all night. Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) from shore. By Sunday evening, rescue teams had recovered 11 bodies and Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said fragments of other bodies were also found. Asked if a terror attack was a possibility, Sokolov said investigators were looking into every possible reason for the crash. Several experts noted factors that suggested a terror attack, such as the crew's failure to report any malfunction and the fact that plane debris was scattered over a wide area. The plane was taking the Defense Ministry's choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble, to perform at a New Year's concert at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. Those on board also included nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor famous for her work in war zones. Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television to declare Monday a nationwide day of mourning. \"We will conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons and will do everything to support the victims' families,\" Putin said. The Black Sea search area \u2014 which covered over 10 square kilometers (about 4 square miles) \u2014 was made more difficult by underwater currents that carried debris and body fragments into the open sea. Sokolov said the plane's flight recorders did not have radio beacons, so locating them on the seabed was going to be challenging. The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively in Russia and worldwide. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 and this year, according to the Defense Ministry. Magomed Tolboyev, a decorated Russian test pilot, said it was clear that all on board had died in the crash. \"There is no chance to survive in such situation,\" he said, according to the Interfax news agency. Before Sokolov spoke to reporters in Sochi, senior Russian lawmakers had ruled out a terror attack, arguing that the military plane was under reliable protection. Security is particularly tight in Sochi, the Black Sea city that hosted the 2014 Winter Games and is regularly visited by Putin, who often receives foreign leaders at his residence there. But some experts said the crew's failure to report a malfunction pointed at a possible terror attack. \"Possible malfunctions ... certainly wouldn't have prevented the crew from reporting them,\" Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti. Vadim Lukashevich, an independent aviation expert, told Dozhd TV that the crew's failure to communicate an equipment failure and the large area over which the plane's fragments were scattered raises the possibility of an attack. Alexander Gusak, a former chief of a SWAT team at the main domestic security agency, the FSB, told Dozhd that Russian airports are still vulnerable to terror threats despite security cordons. \"It's possible to penetrate them. It's a matter of skills,\" he said. Russian planes have been brought down previously by terror attacks. In October 2015, a Russian plane carrying mostly Russian tourists back from vacation in Egypt was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane's luggage compartment. The local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up in the skies over Russia on the same day by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility. In the last year, the Russian military has repeatedly flown Russian singers and artists to perform at Hemeimeem, the main hub for the Russian air campaign in Syria. The passenger list released by the Defense Ministry included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, including its leader, Valery Khalilov. The ensemble is the official choir of the Russian military and also includes a band and a dance company. The choir sang \"Get Lucky\" at the opening of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, becoming an online sensation. The damage to the choir was reported to be devastating. Viktor Yeliseyev, head of the rival choir for the Russian National Guard, said \"most singers of the choir have died.\" Also on board was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work, which has included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said Glinka was accompanying a medical shipment for a hospital in Syria. \"We never feel sure that we will come back alive,\" she said when Putin presented her with an award earlier this month. \"But we are sure that kindness, compassion and charity are stronger than any weapon.\" Syrian President Bashar Assad was among numerous foreign leaders who sent their condolences to Putin, saying he received news of the crash \"with deep grief and sadness.\" In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and other Russian government agencies have continued to use them. While noisy and fuel-guzzling, the plane is popular with crews that appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \"It's an excellent plane, which has proven its reliability during decades of service,\" veteran pilot Oleg Smirnov said. Still, since 1994, there's been 17 major plane crashes involving the Tu-154 that have killed over 1,760 people in all. Most resulted from human error. In the latest previous deadly crash of a Tu-154, a plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others crashed in April 2010 while trying to land at a military airport in Smolensk in western Russia, killing everyone on board. Investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather, but Polish authorities have launched a new probe. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Isachenkov reported from Moscow. Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Dec 24 2016, 4:41 pm ET To End Decades on Death Row, Inmate Makes an Agonizing Choice by Jon Schuppe advertisement After 25 years on death row for a killing he said he didn't do \u2014 and three years after a federal judge threw out his conviction \u2014 James Dennis was brought to a Philadelphia courtroom Thursday to make a harrowing choice: plead no contest to the crime and go home, or gamble on another trial. He didn't want to admit to the 1991 shooting of 17-year-old Chedell Williams. A federal judge had already ruled he'd been condemned \"for a crime in all probability he did not commit.\" But that didn't guarantee that another jury wouldn't find him guilty. So he took the only path he knew would keep him from execution. \"I need to do what I need to do for my family,\" Dennis told his brother, Greg, before entering the plea. As part of his agreement with prosecutors, Dennis was able to maintain that he hadn't killed Williams. Jimmy Dennis. Courtesy of Justice for Jimmy \"James Dennis entered a no-contest plea, not a guilty plea, because he maintains the same position that he has maintained for 25 years: that he is innocent of this crime,\" one of his lawyers, Karl Schwartz, told the judge. \"He and his family have made this incredibly difficult decision based on his and their strong desire to have him home and free, [in] lieu of potentially years of continuing litigation.\" The no-contest plea is not uncommon in claims of wrongful conviction. It allows prosecutors to keep a conviction without a new trial. The defendant, meanwhile, acknowledges there may be enough evidence for another guilty verdict but can still claim innocence. To some, no-contest can seem like a good deal. To others, it can feel like less than justice. Samuel Gross, a University of Michigan law professor who runs The National Registry of Exonerations, said the offer of a no-contest plea puts defendants in an agonizing bind. Related: Inmates Hope for Last-Ditch Shot at Obama's Clemency Program \"Typically, when someone has been on death row or general prison population for most of his adult life and is now offered an opportunity to leave prison right away, their family and friends and lawyers ... urge them to take the plea and not take a chance,\" Gross said. \"Quite a few refuse.\" The results are impossible to predict. Gross cited the case of Terry Harrington, who was convicted with a friend, Curtis McGhee, of the 1977 murder of a retired police captain in Iowa. Both were granted new trials. McGhee took a no-contest plea and was released. Harrington chose to go to trial, but prosecutors dismissed the case instead. The dismissal resulted in his release and exoneration. But only later, after a lawyer found evidence that the prosecutors had improperly handled McGhee's plea, was he exonerated as well. Lawyers also negotiated no-contest pleas in the case of the West Memphis 3 \u2014 men who were convicted of killing three Arkansas Cub Scouts in 1993. Not all of the three men wanted to enter the plea, but they agreed because one of them, Damien Echols, was suffering severely from 18 years on death row. Related: President Obama Commutes Another 79 Inmates' Prison Sentences Dennis was convicted in 1992 of shooting Williams during a robbery, primarily on the testimony of three eyewitnesses. Decades of appeals followed, in which his lawyers argued that investigators and prosecutors withheld evidence that undermined his innocence. It landed before U.S. District Judge Anita Brody, who in 2013 ripped into the prosecution and ordered a new trial. \"The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has committed a grave miscarriage of justice in convicting Dennis and sentencing him to die for this crime,\" Brody wrote. A photograph of Jimmy Dennis as used by the Justice for Jimmy campaign. Courtesy of Justice for Jimmy Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, who was not in office when Dennis was convicted, challenged the ruling. An appellate court sided with her in August. That forced Williams to decide whether to retry Dennis or drop the case. Unwilling to say Dennis was innocent, his office began negotiations with Dennis' lawyers. One of Dennis' lawyers, Stephen Cozen, said in an interview that he considered the state's witnesses as \"shaky\" and Dennis' alibi \u2014 that he was a on a bus miles away when the murder took place \u2014 as strong. Ultimately, Dennis agreed to the plea because it allowed him to continue to assert that he didn't kill Chedell Williams. \"Our main goal was to try to get Jimmy out of prison after having served 25 years,\" Cozen said. Prosecutors said they remained convinced of Dennis' guilt. \"In our system of justice, the defendant is always free to state otherwise. Under the law, however, he stands convicted of this murder,\" Williams' office said in a statement. \"We accepted this plea not because of doubts about guilt, but because of the inherent difficulties of retrying a complex case more than a quarter century after the crime.\" Jimmy Dennis poses while holding a photograph of his mother. Courtesy of Justice for Jimmy The remaining complication was an unrelated robbery conviction, according to Dennis' lawyers. Dennis didn't dispute that one. But that punishment remained on the books. The two sides worked out a deal where prosecutors would recommend that Dennis receive parole, possibly in time to be home by Easter, Cozen said. He praised Williams' office for negotiating the deal. Dennis' older brother, Greg, said the family is now planning a homecoming. But the reunion will be bittersweet. He criticized Williams for not dismissing the case. \"We're happy that we'll get to spend some time with Jimmy and be with him, but we also feel very disrespected,\" he said. Jon Schuppe ",

Related: Britain's Queen and Prince Philip Sick With 'Heavy Colds' \"The Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery,\" Buckingham Palace said. \"Her Majesty will participate in the royal family Christmas celebrations during the day.\" Those festivities usually include a gala lunch. In past years, the royal family would often go for extended walks in the countryside. Elizabeth has been in generally good health and has maintained an active schedule in the last year despite traveling less often than in the past.

He was also suffering from a heavy cold earlier in the week, the palace said. Philip did attend the Sunday morning Christmas service, waving to well-wishers on his way out of the church. As a concession to age and his cold, he drove to the church instead of walking. Prince Harry spent time talking to local residents after the church and stopped to pet a dog. There were no signs of other family members being ill. The flu season has hit many Britons hard in the last two weeks and colds and flus are spreading. A cold can be dangerous for people in their 90s, doctors warn. Britain's Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip, pictured in Malta in November 2015. TOBY MELVILLE / POOL / EPA Earlier this week, the royal couple delayed their departure from London to Sandringham because of their colds but traveled one day later than expected, using a helicopter instead of a train. The royal family received some sad news Saturday, when it was revealed that the queen's granddaughter, Zara Tindall, had suffered a miscarriage while expecting her second child with husband Mike Tindall. The queen plans to use her pre-recorded Christmas Day message to praise British Olympic and Paralympic athletes and others who inspired her. The message will be televised throughout Britain and much of the Commonwealth on Sunday afternoon. The Associated Press ",

    "text": "Former Wham singer George Michael dead at 53 Published               December 25, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print George Michael performs during the Closing Ceremony at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 12, 2012, in London. (AP Photo/Kristy Wigglesworth) \u00a0(AP2012) Singer George Michael, who sold more than 100 million albums over a pop music career spanning almost four decades, has died at the age of 53, his publicist said Sunday.\u00a0 Michael died at his home in Goring, England. His publicist, Cindi Berger, said he had not been ill. Michael's manager, Michael Lippman, says the cause of death was heart failure. His family issued a statement through Thames Valley Police saying that he \"passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period. \"The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\" Before Lippmann's announcement, police issued a statement calling the death \"unexplained but not suspicious\" and that \"a post mortem will be undertaken in due course.\" The loss of Michael continues a year of grief in the music industry, with David Bowie, Prince and Glenn Frey among those dying before age 70. One of the giants of `80s and `90s music, and an early idol for the MTV generation, Michael\u00a0enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\" \"Young Guns (Go For It)\" and \"Freedom.\" As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range. He earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards, and recorded duets with legends like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John. Throughout his career, his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law, most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles. Yet, he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior, and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans. Michael, with startling good looks and an easy stage manner, formed the boy band WHAM! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s. Helped by MTV, which was an emerging music industry force at the time, the cheerful duo easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael, as lead singer, usually the focal point. He started his solo career shortly before WHAM! split, with the release of the megahit single \"Careless Whisper,\" making a seamless transition. Critics generally viewed his WHAM! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks. His first solo album, 1987's \"Faith,\" sold more 20 million copies, and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy \"I Want Your Sex,\" which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV. The song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature, but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening. Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write \"Explore Monogamy\" on the leg and back of a model in the video. At the time, Michael had not disclosed his homosexuality, and much of his chart success was based on his sex appeal to young women. His look was raw and provocative, with tight jeans, tight T-shirts, black leather jackets and designer stubble, and his videos pushed the accepted limits with many lingerie-clad models vying for Michael's attentions on screen. But Michael's situation changed abruptly in 1998 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer. The arrest received international media attention, and seemed for a brief time to jeopardize Michael's stature as a top recording artist. But instead of making excuses for his behavior, he went on to release a single and video, \"Outside,\" that made light of the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police who had arrested him. Like all of his efforts at the time, it sold in prodigious numbers, helping him put the incident behind him. The arrest also prompted him to speak openly about his sexual orientation. These years represented the height of Michael's commercial success, which at times was marred by a protracted legal dispute with his record company Sony. He remained a strong musical force throughout his career, releasing dozens of records and touring to adoring crowds despite a growing number of run-ins with police, many of them stemming from a series of driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs incidents, including several crashes. Michael was an admitted user of marijuana and prescription sedatives and several times was found slumped over his car's steering wheel after using both at the same time. His driver's license was finally revoked for five years in 2010 after Michael drove his Land Rover into the side of a Snappy Snap photo shop with so much force that his vehicle dented the wall. A passer-by remembering Michael's early career wrote the word WHAM on the spot his SUV had hit. He was also arrested a second time in public toilets -- this time in North London in 2008 for drug use, an incident that prompted him to apologize to his fans and promise to get his life in order. He also offered an apology to \"everybody else, just for boring them.\" A year earlier, he had told a television interviewer that his problems stemmed from a self-destructive streak and his attention-seeking nature. He said at a press conference in 2011 that he felt he had let young people down with his misbehavior and had made it easier for others to denigrate homosexuals. Despite these personal setbacks, Michael's musical performances remained strong even as his material moved farther from the teen tunes that first brought him to stardom. The Telegraph newspaper in 2011 described a London concert appearance as an impressive event, calling his voice, \"A rich, soulful instrument, it's capable of serious emotional heft, expertly matching the confessional tone of his own material.\" Michael, with strong Greek-Cypriot roots, was born Georgios Panayiotou in England. He and schoolmate Ridgeley formed a ska band called the Executive when they were just 16 before moving on to form WHAM! \"I wanted to be loved,\" said Michael of his start in the music field. \"It was an ego satisfaction thing.\" Michael was active in a number of charities and helped raise money to combat AIDS, help needy children, and support gay rights. He had a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss, but announced onstage in August 2011 that the two had broken up. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Credit Still from a video by Joe Esposito In 2003, the State of New Jersey allowed a black-bear hunt for the first time in 33 years. The resulting controversy, still smoldering today, seemed irresolvable: Depending on whom you asked, the hunt was either sadistic blood sport or noble tradition. Two sociologists, Dave Harker and Diane C. Bates, scrutinized 10 years of clashing regional newspaper editorials and letters to the editor and concluded that the two sides did not even seem to be arguing about the same animal. Actual bears had been replaced by \u201ccompeting social constructions\u201d of bears. Those in favor of the hunt imagined the animals as \u201cmenacing threats\u201d that needed to be controlled; those against saw them as docile and benevolent creatures that just wanted to \u201clive in peace.\u201d What do we lose when the final survivor of a mass disaster dies?

By ROB HOERBURGER Natalie Cole, 1976 Credit David Redfern/Redferns, via Getty Images The song came gushing out like an open hydrant on a hot summer day, but for Natalie Cole, it was a complicated kind of high. Minutes before she heard her breakthrough hit, \u201cThis Will Be,\u201d on the radio for the first time in 1975, she had scored a heroin fix and was tripping down 113th Street in Harlem. Drugs were a recent mainstay; she started using heavily in college, during the substance-fueled psychedelic era (she still managed to get her degree, in psychology). Music, meanwhile, was her birthright \u2014 after all, she was the daughter of Nat King Cole, one of the most beloved singers of the 20th century. Growing up in the exclusive Hancock Park section of Los Angeles, she could wander into the living room and find the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra gathered round the family piano. Now that she had a big hit of her own, fame was proving to be a stronger stimulant. She kicked heroin, married one of her producers, had a son, had more hits, appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d A sports star is born in brawls.

Each was pioneered by J.L. Moreno, Zerka\u2019s husband and the founder of psychodrama, a form of therapy in which people act out their experiences and feelings in an effort to gain insight or achieve catharsis. He claimed objectivity when it came to originalism, but he was a skeptic about science.

Now Powerful storm brings road closures and record rainfall to Southern California Visitors to the Bolsa Chica Wetlands enjoy a chilly, blustery day beneath puffy clouds and a backdrop of the snow-covered San Gabriel Mountains. Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times Visitors to the Bolsa Chica Wetlands enjoy a chilly, blustery day beneath puffy clouds and a backdrop of the snow-covered San Gabriel Mountains. Visitors to the Bolsa Chica Wetlands enjoy a chilly, blustery day beneath puffy clouds and a backdrop of the snow-covered San Gabriel Mountains. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Matt Stevens Contact Reporter The storm moved out, but the traffic troubles remain. The heavy rainstorm that closed the Grapevine for a while Saturday continued to cause problems on some mountain roads. In the San Bernardino Mountains, Highway 38 was closed for several hours overnight due to snow that stranded about 100 cars, according to Caltrans. The cars managed to get out and the highway near Big Bear is now open. Highway 33 was closed north of Ojai early Sunday because of snow and ice. The storm, the second of two systems that dumped rain in the drought -plagued region, left an inch or more of precipitation in some areas. Together, the fronts\u00a0helped make December the wettest in Los Angeles\u00a0in six years, with 4.08 inches of rain \u2014 265% above normal, according to the\u00a0 National Weather Service . New rain records for the day were set at Los Angeles International Airport \u00a0(0.96 inches), Long Beach Airport (1.07) and\u00a0Camarillo (1.6), among other places. Overall, the region got between 0.75 and 2.5 inches of rain, weather service\u00a0meteorologist\u00a0Curt Kaplan said. The storm \u201cleft its mark,\u201d\u00a0Kaplan said. \u201cWe had quite a punch.\u201d Southern California has experienced several years of record dry conditions, so the pair of storms has provided a welcome relief to many. Some experts think the storms are a precursor of wetter weather later in the winter.

(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) The overnight front moved in with force, flooding streets and causing some power outages. Mudslides closed the California Incline in Santa Monica and jammed traffic on Interstate 15 through the Cajon Pass. Firefighters rescued a man\u00a0in a floating device in the Los Angeles River near Glassell Park, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. Modest mudflows also were reported in some hillside communities hit by wildfires earlier this year, but no major damage was immediately reported. Kaplan said mud and debris came down hills in Duarte early Saturday, temporarily prompting a flash-flood warning. Nicholson said CHP officers responded to two mudslides. One occurred late Friday near Soledad Canyon and Capra roads in Santa Clarita; the other forced a closure near Sloan Canyon and Hasley Canyon roads in Castaic\u00a0\u2014 about five miles from where CHP officers were escorting traffic through the Grapevine on Saturday. One local news reporter tweeted that some motorists who bypassed the Grapevine traffic were instead getting stuck in the mud. The snow level fell to 3,000 feet, forcing the temporary closure of the Grapevine as well as traffic alerts on some mountain roads. In Kern County, Frasier Park and Pine Mountain Club got between 4 and 6 inches of snow, the NWS said.\u00a0Mountain High got as much as 16 inches, while Big Bear Mountain Resort received between 12 and 18 inches of fresh powder, its website said. The most-recent storm moved south and east out of the area around 8 a.m. Saturday, bringing sunny skies with highs expected in the 60s. \u00a0Partly cloudy skies with highs around 60 in L.A. are expected Christmas Day. Despite the storms, Southern California remains under severe drought conditions, even as Northern California begins to rebound. Steady rain since the beginning of October has pulled 30% of the state \u2014 almost all areas of Northern California \u2014 out of\u00a0 drought conditions , according to National Weather Service \u00a0and U.S. Drought Monitor\u00a0reports. The rains have helped revive reservoirs that feed the two massive systems that move water from the northern Sierra into cities and farmlands.

(Photo: Getty Images) (NEWSER)\u00a0\u2013 A group of young Brits who broke into a Manchester warehouse over the summer to do a fashion shoot are now being decried not for the break-in, but for the dead body they worked around, the\u00a0 London Times \u00a0and\u00a0 Manchester Evening News \u00a0report. A Manchester coroner's court heard the details of the incident, which took place on July 15 starting at 7pm, when the group of eight, then ages 17 to 25, busted into the abandoned warehouse to take pictures for a clothing brand owned by brothers Andrew and Sean Geaney. Inside, the Geaneys, five models, and photographer Owen Birrell found the body of 27-year-old Declan Noonan, who had apparently hanged himself after disappearing four days earlier. The city's senior coroner questions the group's \"moral compass\" for what they did next: move around the building to take pics, then head to another site and stop for pizza. Someone finally called 911 around 1am, six hours after the body was found, when the girlfriend of one of the Geaney brothers insisted. \"At first we thought it was a mannequin,\" a model tells the\u00a0Times. But what happened after that? Birrell said they came to a \"collective group decision\" to keep working, with others in the group citing everything from fear of getting in trouble for the break-in to the fact that they were short on time. \"In all due respect, we only had that time on that day to get stuff done. \u2026 It [the body] wasn't going anywhere,\" one of the models says. Noonan's mother asked one of the models at the inquest, which ruled her son's death a suicide, how he felt knowing he was posing near a dead body. \"I'm not sure,\" he said, to which she replied, \"It wasn't that traumatic because you carried on taking pictures.\" (A\u00a0 rape-themed fashion shoot \u00a0outraged India.)

By Pamela Constable December 25 at 11:23 AM Follow @pamconstable1 KABUL \u2014 Three men slumped on their cots in a clean but cramped dormitory room. They looked glum and shellshocked, as if they had suddenly found themselves in a forbidding foreign place.\u00a0 In many ways, they had.\u00a0 Javed Hakimi, Mohsen Amiri and Navid Mohammedi were among 45 unhappy passengers who arrived here under guard on a charter\u00a0 flight from Frankfurt this month. It was the first of many such flights that are expected to return thousands of Afghan asylum seekers from Germany under a European Union agreement with President Ashraf Ghani.\u00a0 Across Western Europe , as many as 80,000 Afghans eventually may be repatriated after their asylum applications are rejected, under the agreement signed by Ghani and E.U. officials in October. After the flight from Frankfurt landed, some of the passengers headed for buses home. But these three had no one waiting for them. They said that their immediate families live in Germany, and that once their 10-day stay at a government rest house ended, they would have nowhere to go. \u201cI am completely alone here,\u201d said Amiri, 35, who added that he survived a capsizing off Greece in 2012 while trying to reach his mother and siblings in Germany. \u201cI was a law-abiding person there, and I was training to be a house painter, but they rejected my asylum case and said I had to go home. This is not my home. I don\u2019t even know where to start looking.\u201d [ Tunisian suspect in Berlin Christmas market attack faced past German terror probe, official says ] To German officials, these were the easiest foreigners to legally remove amid a chaotic surge of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other countries that has\u00a0 overwhelmed many\u00a0 nations and generated an angry backlash across Europe. All the Afghans had arrived illegally, some had committed crimes in Germany, and none were found to qualify for political asylum. To Afghan officials, these men will become a burden that the poor, insurgent-plagued country cannot afford. Hundreds of thousands of longtime war refugees are\u00a0pouring back from next-door Pakistan; \u00a0large numbers of rural families have been displaced by the Taliban and are living in camps.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a real crisis for us,\u201d said Rohullah Hashimi, an official at the Afghan ministry responsible for refugees. \u201cWe pleaded with the Europeans to only send those who wanted to come voluntarily, but there was a lot of pressure for us to take back more.\u201d Many Afghans sold everything before they left their country, and they have returned penniless. With no prospects, he said, they\u00a0may try to reach Europe again or even join the insurgents. Hakimi, 57, spent more than 20 years in Germany, where he married and raised two daughters, but his criminal record made him a high priority for the new return policy. He was once convicted of drug dealing there and was imprisoned for two years, then deported to Afghanistan.\u00a0 Last year, he sneaked back, paying smugglers to guide him across a half dozen countries. He was working in his brother\u2019s restaurant in Hamburg this month when he received a notice to report to the police. His lawyer said it was probably a routine matter. Instead he learned he was about to be put on a plane. \u201cYes, they accused me of selling drugs, but I served my time in prison, and I wanted to be with my family again,\u201d Hakimi said. He said one man slated for the same flight had killed someone but was allowed to stay at the last minute after a church said he had converted to Christianity and repented. Mohammedi, 21, has even fewer ties to Afghanistan, having grown up in Iran, where his family had fled to escape civil war. He said they faced harassment there and encouraged him to go to Germany to live with an uncle. In 2011, at age 16, he made the hazardous journey across mountain forests and open water, winding up at a train station in Paris late at night.\u00a0 \u201cI bought a ticket to Frankfurt and was so exhausted I fell asleep on the train,\u201d Mohammedi said. \u201cA policeman woke me up and asked where I was from. I told him Afghanistan, and he said to me in Dari, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re safe now. You\u2019re in Germany.\u2019\u00a0\u201d As a minor, Mohammedi said, he was sent to school and given a multiyear visa. But several weeks ago, he said, he was suddenly informed that his asylum claim had been rejected and was asked whether he wanted to go home. \u201cThree times I told them no, but they sent me anyway,\u201d he said. His family is still in Iran. Until recently, Germany was sending back only Afghans who would leave voluntarily, but after being flooded with nearly 900,000 migrants in 2015, the government decided to speed asylum processing for those fleeing civil wars, such as Syrians, and step up the deportation of others less likely to win asylum cases, including many Afghans.\u00a0 This year, Germany has deported a record 23,750 asylum seekers. More than 200,000 foreigners have pending deportation orders, including 12,500 Afghans. [ A humanitarian crisis looms in Afghanistan as the number of displaced climbs ] Under the E.U. agreement with Kabul, German officials said they will focus on individuals with criminal records and recent illegal entries, and avoid returning those from unsafe regions of Afghanistan. But the policy has aroused anger among Afghan expatriates, who protested at the Frankfurt airport when the first plane departed. Afghan officials said they had little to offer the new arrivals except food and shelter for a few days, subsidized by the nonprofit International Organization for Migration, which is also providing those without homes a one-time payment of about $600.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not much to start a new life,\u201d said Hashimi, the government official. \u201cWe can offer them some guidance and positive morale, but anything else is beyond our capacity.\u201d Amiri, who was happily reunited with his family in Germany four years ago, seemed the most undone by his abrupt deportation. He recounted in vivid detail his harrowing journey from Afghanistan, when an overloaded smuggler\u2019s boat from Turkey capsized near the shores of Greece. \u201cIt was the middle of the night. The boat was too crowded and the water was very turbulent. We all started swimming, and I finally reached the banks, but five people drowned, including three children,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was May 20, 2012. The date is engraved in my mind.\u201d The German government was welcoming at the time, Amiri said, but when he was being deported, it was a different story. \u201cThe police searched me many times and took all my money at the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the plane, there were more police than passengers, and they treated us like terrorists, even following us to the bathroom.\u201d After this first flight, Afghan officials said, the deportations were halted for the Christmas season. The second group will arrive in January. Read more ",

    "text": "George Michael dies at 53; pop singer was half of duo Wham! before successful solo career Pop singer George Michael over the years. Dennis McLellan George Michael , the English singer-songwriter who shot to stardom in the 1980s as half of the pop duo Wham! and went on to become one of the era\u2019s biggest pop solo artists with hits such as \u201cFaith\u201d and \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d died over the Christmas holiday. He was 53. Michael\u00a0died peacefully at his home in Goring, England, according to his publicist. She said\u00a0he had not been ill. In a statement , Thames Valley Police called Michael\u2019s death \u201cunexplained but not suspicious.\u201d Teamed with guitarist Andrew Ridgeley in Wham!, Michael soared to fame in the United Kingdom in the early \u201980s with hits such as \u201cYoung Guns (Go For It!)\u201d, \u201cWham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\u201d and \u201cBad Boys.\u201d The duo\u2019s \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go\u201d was an international million-selling single that put Wham! on the map in America, where it reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1984. Two other Wham! songs went to No. 1 on the Billboard chart in 1985: \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d (released in Britain as a solo single by Michael) and \u201cEverything She Wants.\u201d Singer-songwriter George Michael died Dec. 25, 2016, according to his publicist. He was 53. In a 1990 article, he talked about his effort to downplay his celebrity status. (Robert Hilburn) Their international popularity was further confirmed in 1985 when they became the first Western pop group to play in Communist China. The stylishly coiffed duo, who wore tight-fitting short-shorts in their \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go\u201d video and appeared shirtless in leather jackets in promotional stills, are described in \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Popular Music\u201d as \u201cthe most commercially successful teen-oriented group of the \u201980s.\u201d Michael was known as the creative half of the duo, whose stage appearances whipped young female fans into a frenzy with music that some critics dismissed as juvenile and exploitative. Yet Michael maintained that he was not writing songs specifically for teenage girls. \u201cPeople who accuse me of that just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he told The Times in 1984, while promoting the Wham! album \u201cMake It Big,\u201d which was produced, arranged and mostly written by Michael. \u201cI\u2019m writing for my own age group, but they\u2019re put off by all these screaming young girls who like us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame. That\u2019s not a good reason not to listen to our music.\u201d With Michael reportedly feeling restricted in Wham! and wanting to do other things musically, the duo split up in 1986; a crowd of 72,000 fans turned out at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium for their farewell concert. \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting (For Me),\u201d a duet Michael recorded with Aretha Franklin, was a No. 1 hit in the spring of 1987 and earned them a Grammy Award. Michael\u2019s debut solo album, \u201cFaith,\u201d was released later that year. The album, which won a Grammy for Album of the Year, spawned the No. 1 hit singles \u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cOne More Try\u201d and \u201cMonkey\u201d \u2014 as well as the controversial \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d which rose to No. 2 and was banned by many U.S. radio stations. Michael had another No. 1 hit with \u201cPraying for Time,\u201d a 1990 single off his \u201cListen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1\u201d album.

Singer-songwriter George Michael died Dec. 25, 2016, according to his publicist. He was 53. In a 2008 article, he recounted his career to a Times music critic. George Michael\u00a0is not a whiskey-swilling geezer like Keith Richards or a rebellious bohemian like Thom Yorke. He's a well-groomed, gracious... (Ann Powers) Despite Michael\u2019s commercial success, the \u201990s proved a difficult period for him, marked by a protracted legal battle with Sony Music Entertainment in an attempt to escape his longtime contract. There was also a series of\u00a0personal upheavals, including the 1993 death of his Brazilian lover, Anselmo Feleppa, whom he had met at a rock festival in Rio in 1991. In 1998, Michael was arrested for lewd conduct in a men\u2019s restroom at Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills. He pleaded no contest and completed 80 hours of community service with a youth leadership program, paid $910 in fines and underwent counseling. Though rather tame as celebrity scandals go, the incident amounted to a public outing of the singer and a possible threat to his career. In an interview with CNN the week after his arrest, he apologized to fans and acknowledged that he was gay. \u201cI have no problem with people knowing that I\u2019m in a relationship with a man right now,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI have not had a relationship with a woman for almost 10 years.\u201d Of his arrest, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel any shame. I feel stupid, and I feel reckless and weak for having allowed my sexuality to be exposed this way.\u201d Seven months after his arrest, Michael made fun of the high-profile incident with the satirical single \u201cOutside,\u201d which former Times pop music critic Ann Powers later described as \u201ca highly danceable paean to public sex.\u201d The accompanying music video included a sequence in which Michael, wearing shades and a police uniform, appears in a public restroom that morphs into a flashy disco dance palace. Years later, in an interview with the BBC , Michael said that\u00a0the manner of his unintentional outing had made his life more difficult. Yet he did not shy away from who he was;\u00a0he raised money to combat AIDS and supported gay rights. Michael\u2019s drug use \u2014 he admitted to using prescription sedatives and marijuana \u2014\u00a0led to several run-ins with law enforcement in the 2000s, after his career had reached its apex. In 2010, his\u00a0driver\u2019s license was revoked for five years after he drove his Land Rover into the side of a photography\u00a0shop with so much force that his vehicle dented the wall. A passer-by remembering Michael's early career wrote the word \u201cWHAM\u201d on the spot his SUV had hit. Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou on June 25, 1963, in North London, the son of a English mother and a Greek Cypriot immigrant father who ran a local restaurant. He was 7 when he began dreaming of musical stardom. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a remarkable voice as a child,\u201d he said in a 2004 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cI got thrown out of choir, but that didn\u2019t stop me from telling everyone I was going to be a famous pop star.\u201d Michael was 12 when he met Ridgeley, a fellow student. After leaving school, they spent more than a year in a ska band called the Executives and began writing songs together. A demo tape that included two of their songs, \u201cWham Rap\u201d and \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d led to their 1981 signing with a British independent label and the launch of Wham! \"Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend,\u201d\u00a0Ridgeley,\u00a053, said on Twitter. \"Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved.\u201d Michael\u2019s sudden death stunned the music world, given his young age and the fact he had been working on a documentary film called \u201cFreedom\u201d in recent months. He was also beginning work on a new album. Michael\u2019s longtime manager, Michael Lippman, told Billboard magazine\u00a0that the singer died \u201cpeacefully\u201d in his bed of apparent heart failure. In 2011, Michael suffered a severe case of pneumonia during a tour and later revealed he had come close to dying.\u00a0\"It was by far the worst month of my life, but I am incredibly, incredibly fortunate to be here,\u201d he told the Guardian.\u00a0 Friends and fellow performers offered tributes. \u201cI am in deep shock,\u201d\u00a0Elton John said on Instagram.\u00a0\u201cI have lost a beloved friend \u2014 the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist.\u201d \u00a0 ",

The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for most of North Dakota, western South Dakota and a small section of eastern Montana through Monday, with expected snow totals of 8 to 15 inches and winds up to 55 mph. The weather service warns that will make travel \u201cvery dangerous if not impossible.\u201d \u201cConditions will be dicey for any Christmas Day travelers\u201d in the region, meteorologist Molly Rosenblatt of CBS affiliate WCCO in Minneapolis told CBS News. \u201cWe\u2019ll see things really start to deteriorate for much of the western portion of the country \u2014 again, the Rockies, Plains states, as well as the Upper Midwest.\u201d An ice storm warning is in effect through late Sunday for central South Dakota, southwest North Dakota and much of central Minnesota, with up to half an inch of ice expected.\u00a0 Forecasters said anyone who \u201cmust travel\u201d should have an extra flashlight, food and water. AAA predicted a record 103 million Americans would be traveling over the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holiday period.

Kansas could see some rain and severe storms, Rosenblatt said. The eastern part of the country is in better shape, with relatively mild winter temperatures and no severe weather to interfere with holiday plans.\u00a0 Across the south, the unusually warm temperatures will hit highs in the mid to upper 70s. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Sunday Alamba/AP hide caption toggle caption Sunday Alamba/AP Women displaced by Islamist extremists wait for food to be handed out to them at the Bakassi camp in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Boko Haram's uprising has killed more than 20,000 people, and displaced some 2.3 million more. Sunday Alamba/AP In a victorious statement on Saturday, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced the \"long-awaited and most gratifying news of the final crushing of Boko Haram terrorists in their last enclave,\" declaring, \"the terrorists are on the run, and no longer have a place to hide.\" The president congratulated Nigerian troops for \"finally entering and crushing the remnants of the Boko Haram insurgents at Camp Zero,\" deep in the Sambisa Forest in northeast Nigeria. The Sambisa Forest is where it is thought Boko Haram was holding some of the more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April of 2014 from Chibok. The mass kidnapping brought international attention, and sparked the social media movement #BringBackOurGirls. A deal brokered by the Swiss government and the International Red Cross in October freed 21 girls, but some 197 remain missing as of late December, according to The Associated Press. President Buhari said \"further efforts should be intensified to locate and free our remaining Chibok girls still in captivity. May God be with them.\" Though the president's message was celebratory, there are already reports that insurgents are regrouping in Taraba and Bauchi states, south of their stronghold in Borno state. The AP reports that it is unlikely that Nigeria will soon see an end to the deadly suicide bombings and attacks that have plagued the country for years. Article continues after sponsorship Boko Haram's seven-year uprising has killed more than 20,000 people, and driven some 2.3 million people from their homes, creating a massive humanitarian crisis. The United Nations warned last month that 75,000 children were in danger of starving in communities inaccessible because of insecurity. ",

And it is the whole world. Is this what Zionism is about?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story For a second consecutive day on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu denounced the departing Obama administration, publicly accusing it of having orchestrated Friday\u2019s Security Council resolution, despite denials from Washington. The United States refrained from using its veto power , as it had done many times before to shield Israel, and abstained in the 14-to-0 vote. \u201cFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting. Referring to the American secretary of state, Mr. Netanyahu added, \u201cAs I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d and he said he was looking forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump's administration when it takes office next month. The Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors of countries that had voted in favor of the resolution for personal meetings with ministry officials in Jerusalem, despite the Christmas holiday, which some of those countries celebrate. In a highly unusual move, Mr. Netanyahu, who is also the foreign minister, summoned the American ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a meeting on Sunday night. Mr. Netanyahu also instructed his ministers to reduce their diplomatic activities and contacts with counterparts from the countries that had voted for the resolution for the next three weeks, until the American administration changes, and to minimize travel to those countries, according to Israeli news reports. In an additional step, the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, instructed Israel\u2019s agencies to suspend contact with Palestinian Authority representatives on some unspecified civil matters, though the measure was not supposed to affect security coordination or meetings about water, agriculture and the economy. With the Israeli occupation in its 50th year and the peace process frozen, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official and the Palestinians\u2019 veteran negotiator, called on Israel \u201cto seize the opportunity, to wake up, to stop the violence, to stop settlements and to resume negotiations.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu says he is ready for negotiations anytime, but with no preconditions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Security Council vote seemed to have caught Israel off guard. \u201cI hope for Netanyahu\u2019s sake (and also for ours) that he knows the truth at least deep in his heart \u2014 it was the chronicle of a failure foretold,\u201d Ben Caspit, a political commentator, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Sunday. Many commentators said the Security Council vote partly reflected a history of conflict between Mr. Netanyahu and President Obama over the settlements and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s anger over the Iranian nuclear deal. They also pointed to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s increasingly vocal backing of the settler cause. That includes his advancement of highly contentious legislation, known as the Regulation Bill , that would retroactively legalize settler outposts and homes built on privately owned Palestinian land and force the owners to accept compensation. Mr. Netanyahu and his attorney general had warned that the bill, which recently passed a first reading in Parliament, contravenes international law and could land Israeli officials in the defendant dock of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. \u201cAfter he said it, he rushed to vote in favor of the bill. Why?\u201d Mr. Caspit wrote. \u201cBecause of Bennett. The fear of the possibility that he would not be able to siphon seats from Bennett next time on Election Day caused him to act like a small-time grocery owner, instead of a national leader.\u201d Tzipi Livni, a former Israeli foreign minister and a leader of the center-left Zionist Union, wrote on Facebook after the Security Council vote, \u201cThe Security Council decision is bad for Israel and it is the result of Netanyahu\u2019s surrender to the extreme right.\u201d Even Haggai Segal, a prominent settler and the editor in chief of a right-wing newspaper, Makor Rishon, wrote in recent months that the Regulation Bill had \u201cno chance\u201d because it would be invalidated by Israel\u2019s Supreme Court and would be used by the International Criminal Court \u201cto incriminate Israel for war crimes.\u201d Mr. Segal, who served jail time as a member of the Jewish Underground that maimed and killed Palestinians in the 1980s, wrote this summer, \u201cThe wise thing now is to make do with what it is possible to do, and not lose it all by insisting on impossible goals.\u201d Mr. Bennett did not seem deterred. In a statement to reporters on Sunday at the Western Wall in the Old City in East Jerusalem, Mr. Bennett said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to decide between two alternatives: surrendering our land or sovereignty.\u201d He added that steps would be taken in the near future to try to apply Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, the biblical terms for the West Bank. But some Israelis were skeptical that Mr. Netanyahu, in his third consecutive term in office, and fourth over all, would choose one side over the other. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cBennett knows that Netanyahu is not going to make a decision,\u201d said Shmuel Sandler, a professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe may say he will go with both. So far, it worked. It is easier for Bennett because he is not the prime minister. Netanyahu wants to enjoy both of the worlds.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 26, 2016, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Israel Wonders if Netanyahu Will Have to Play His Hand.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 25, 2016 10:28 PM EST George Michael, who rocketed to stardom with Wham! and went on to enjoy a long and celebrated solo career lined with controversies, has died, his publicist said Sunday. He was 53. His publicist confirmed the news to CBS News in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cIt is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\u201d\u00a0 Michael\u2019s manager told CBS News that he died of heart failure. \u00a0 In 2011, the singer had a life-threatening\u00a0 bout of pneumonia . At the time, he thanked the staff at Vienna General Hospital for keeping him alive in the intensive care unit. \u00a0\u00a0 Stars react to death of George Michael: \u201cHe was an absolute inspiration\u201d Michael enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol, delivering a series of hits such as \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\u201d \u2018\u2019Young Guns (Go For It)\u201c and \u201cFreedom.\u201d As a solo artist, he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter, lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range. He sold well over 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards, and recorded duets with legends like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John.\u00a0 Throughout his career, his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law, most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles. Yet, he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior, and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans. In this file photo dated June 28, 1986, George Michael is on stage for Wham\u2019s last sell out concert at Wembley Stadium in London. \u00a0\u00a0 View Gallery In this file photo dated June 28, 1986, George Michael is on stage for Wham\u2019s last sell out concert at Wembley Stadium in London. \u00a0\u00a0 AP Michael, with startling good looks and an easy stage manner, formed the boy band Wham! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s. Helped by MTV, which was an emerging music industry force at the time, the cheerful duo easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael, as lead singer, usually the focal point. He started his solo career shortly before Wham! split, with the release of the megahit single \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d making a seamless transition. Critics generally viewed his Wham! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks. His first solo album, 1987\u2019s \u201cFaith,\u201d sold more 20 million copies, and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV. The song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature, but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening.  Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write \u201cExplore Monogamy\u201d on the leg and back of a model in the video. At the time, Michael had not disclosed his homosexuality, and much of his chart success was based on his sex appeal to young women. His look was raw and provocative, with tight jeans, tight T-shirts, black leather jackets and designer stubble, and his videos pushed the accepted limits with many lingerie-clad models vying for Michael\u2019s attentions on screen. But Michael\u2019s situation changed abruptly in 1998 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer.\u00a0 12 Photos British superstar George Michael dies The arrest received international media attention, and seemed for a brief time to jeopardize Michael\u2019s stature as a top recording artist. But instead of making excuses for his behavior, he went on to release a single and video, \u201cOutside,\u201d that made light of the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police who had arrested him. Like all of his efforts at the time, it sold in prodigious numbers, helping him put the incident behind him. The arrest also prompted him to speak openly about his sexual orientation. These years represented the height of Michael\u2019s commercial success, which at times was marred by a protracted legal dispute with his record company Sony. He remained a strong musical force throughout his career, releasing dozens of records and touring to adoring crowds despite a growing number of run-ins with police, many of them stemming from a series of driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs incidents, including several crashes. Michael was an admitted user of marijuana and prescription sedatives and several times was found slumped over his car\u2019s steering wheel after using both at the same time. His driver\u2019s license was finally revoked for five years in 2010 after Michael drove his Land Rover into the side of a Snappy Snap photo shop with so much force that his vehicle dented the wall. A passer-by remembering Michael\u2019s early career wrote the word Wham on the spot his SUV had hit. He was also arrested a second time in public toilets - this time in North London in 2008 for drug use, an incident that prompted him to apologize to his fans and promise to get his life in order. He also offered an apology to \u201ceverybody else, just for boring them.\u201d A year earlier, he had told a television interviewer that his problems stemmed from a self-destructive streak and his attention-seeking nature.\u00a0 View Gallery Pop stars George Michael (top) and Elton John leave Westminster Abbey after the funeral service of Diana Princess of Wales in 1996.\u00a0 JOHNNY EGGITT/AFP/Getty Images He said at a press conference in 2011 that he felt he had let young people down with his misbehavior and had made it easier for others to denigrate homosexuals. Despite these personal setbacks, Michael\u2019s musical performances remained strong even as his material moved farther from the teen tunes that first brought him to stardom. The Telegraph newspaper in 2011 described a London concert appearance as an impressive event, calling his voice, \u201cA rich, soulful instrument, it\u2019s capable of serious emotional heft, expertly matching the confessional tone of his own material.\u201d Michael, with strong Greek-Cypriot roots, was born Georgios Panayiotou in England. He and schoolmate Ridgeley formed a ska band called the Executive when they were just 16 before moving on to form Wham! \u201cI wanted to be loved,\u201d said Michael of his start in the music field. \u201cIt was an ego satisfaction thing.\u201d Michael was active in a number of charities and helped raise money to combat AIDS, help needy children, and support gay rights. He had a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss, but announced onstage in August 2011 that the two had broken up.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters) George Michael, the British singer who rocketed to fame in the 1980s duo Wham! before embarking on a phenomenally successful solo career, died at 53, his publicist confirmed. \u201cIt is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,\u201d the publicist said in a statement. \u201cThe family would ask their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.\u201d No cause of death was immediately known. The Thames Valley police said \u00a0that they were called to a property early in the afternoon on Sunday, where a 53-year-old man was confirmed deceased. \u201cAt this stage the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. A post mortem will be undertaken in due course. There will be no further updates from Thames Valley Police until the post mortem has taken place,\u201d the police said in a statement. 1 of 18 A look back at the career of George Michael View Photos The British singer who rocketed to fame in the 1980s duo Wham! before embarking on a solo career, died at 53. Caption The British singer who rocketed to fame in the 1980s duo Wham! before embarking on a solo career, died at 53. \u00a0April 7, 1985 The pop duo Wham! performs in Beijing before a capacity audience of Chinese and foreign fans. Neal Ulevich/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Michael was an international pop icon in the 1980s who then became an even more successful solo act. He first found stardom with Wham!, the group that he formed with Andrew Ridgeley and that was responsible for infectious hits such as \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go\u201d and \u201cCareless Whisper.\u201d The popularity of Wham! coincided with the beginnings of MTV, and Michael\u2019s easy stage manner and sex appeal earned him legions of fans far beyond the United Kingdom. The duo broke up in 1986, five years after they burst onto the scene, and Michael\u2019s solo work far surpassed the dominance of his pop group. The London-born singer sold more than 100 million albums, including his 1987 solo debut, titled \u201cFaith,\u201d which sold 20 million copies; the title track became a gigantic hit. In his solo years, he became known as a more serious singer who had other smash songs such as \u201cFather Figure\u201d and \u201cI Want Your Sex.\u201d \u201cMichael\u2019s post-Wham! solo debut, \u2018Faith,\u2019 offered a blueprint for future generations of boy band singers looking for a way out,\u201d critic Allison Stewart wrote in The Washington Post\u00a0in 2011 , just as \u201cFaith\u201d was re-released. \u201cThe granddaddy of blue-eyed soul-pop discs, most of it has aged remarkably well, even the parts that were already awkward in 1987: The title track is pure, perfect pop; \u2018I Want Your Sex,\u2019 faintly ridiculous then, really ridiculous now, is still completely irresistible. Everything else is either as great (\u2018Father Figure\u2019) or as wince-inducing (\u2018Monkey\u2019) as you remember it.\u201d In 1998, Michael publicly came out as gay in an interview with CNN , a week after he was arrested for \u201cinvestigation of misdemeanor lewd conduct\u201d in a park restroom. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any shame. I feel stupid and I feel reckless and weak for having allowed my sexuality to be exposed this way. But I don\u2019t feel any shame whatsoever,\u201d he told CNN, adding, \u201cI want to say that I have no problem with people knowing that I\u2019m in a relationship with a man right now. I have not been in a relationship with a woman for almost 10 years.\u201d Michael\u2019s legal troubles continued throughout the years, as he was arrested\u00a0for driving under the influence in 2007 and on charges of drug possession in 2008 ; in 2010, he was sentenced to prison after another drunken driving charge and possession of marijuana. He called his four weeks in jail \u201chorrific\u201d and vowed to get help, according to the Daily Mail : \u201cIt shook me out of my denial in a way that the others hadn\u2019t.\u201d In the music world, Michael had been out of the spotlight for the past several years, save for an album in 2014 called \u201cSymphonica,\u201d which included live versions of his songs. He made occasional TV appearances, including on the first version of James Corden\u2019s now-famous \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d sketch in 2011 , as a skit for the Comic Relief charity: In late 2011, Michael had a life-threatening bout of pneumonia that made it difficult to tour. \u201cI\u2019m a new man,\u201d he told the British media after he recovered, adding, \u201cI have an amazing, amazing life, and if I wasn\u2019t spiritual enough before the last four, five weeks then I certainly am now.\u201d As news of Michael\u2019s death broke, tributes started pouring in. On Sunday, the Recording Academy said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of two-time Grammy Award recipient George Michael. During an influential career that spanned nearly four decades, George became one of the most beloved pop craftsmen and respected entertainers. From the enormous success he achieved with pop duo Wham! to his influential solo career, his extraordinary talent had a profound impact on countless entertainers worldwide, and his creative contributions will live on forever.\u201d Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael. You've found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you. ",

    "text": "Israel accuses Obama administration of helping craft, push UN censure Published               December 25, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Israel\u2019s government publicly accused the Obama administration Sunday of helping create and push the recently passed United Nations resolution condemning settlement activity, with a top official telling Fox News they have \u201cironclad information\u201d on the U.S. government\u2019s involvement. \u201cWe have rather ironclad information from sources in both the Arab world and internationally that this was a deliberate push by the United States and in fact they helped create the resolution in the first place,\u201d David Keyes, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s News HQ.\u201d \u00a0 The accusation marks a new escalation in the Netanyahu government\u2019s response to the U.N. Security Council vote on Friday. The resolution passed thanks to a U.S. abstention, a decision Netanyahu has described as a \u201cshameful ambush.\u201d The White House already has acknowledged President Obama made the decision for U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power to abstain. Unclear was how involved the Obama administration was in crafting and pushing the resolution itself \u2013 which initially was put forward by Egypt, and then pursued by New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela. White House spokesman Eric Schultz issued a statement Sunday defending Obama's support for Israel and stressed that the U.S. did not draft the resolution. \"The Egyptians, in partnership with the Palestinians, are the ones who began circulating an earlier draft of the resolution,\" Schultz said. \"The Egyptians are the ones who moved it forward on Friday. And we took the position that we did when it was put to a vote.\"\u00a0 Keyes' criticism followed similar rhetoric by Netanyahu himself, who said that while the U.S. and Israel for decades had disagreed on settlements, they had an understanding that such action before the U.N. Security Council would make peace negotiations harder. \u201cAs I told [Secretary of State] John Kerry on Thursday, friends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council,\u201d Netanyahu said. He pointedly said he looks forward to working with the new Donald Trump administration when it takes office next month. He said he was encouraged by Israel\u2019s \u201cfriends in the United States\u201d who criticized the resolution, saying \u201cthey understand how reckless and destructive\u201d it is.\u00a0 Keyes also told Fox News on Sunday that Israel was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the resolution and the Obama administration\u2019s abstention. Expand / Contract President-elect Donald Trump (AP) \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is an abandonment of Israel, and an abandonment of a long-standing American policy,\u201d he said. Israel's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said it began summoning the ambassadors of countries who voted in favor of the resolution, including those from the permanent members of the Security Council -- Russia, China, the U.K. and France.\u00a0In a highly unusual move, the U.S. ambassador was later summoned as well, Israeli media reported.\u00a0 \"We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision,\" Netanyahu said. The resolution, which condemned Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, sparked outrage in Israel and led to a new low in relations between Netanyahu and Obama. Israel has accused Obama of colluding with the Palestinians against the Jewish state. The resolution's immediate impact appears to be largely symbolic, but Israel fears it could open the door to an increase in international steps, including economic measures. Much of the international community considers the settlements illegal or illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. In addition to the measures declared Sunday, Israel has recalled its ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal for consultations and canceled a planned January visit to Israel by Senegal's foreign minister. A visit by Ukraine's prime minister has also been canceled in light of its support for the U.N. vote and Israel has pledged to cut millions of shekels in funding to certain U.N. agencies. President-elect Trump had intervened last week after the Israelis reportedly appealed to him for help. Trump came out against the resolution but, after a vote was delayed, the Security Council went ahead with consideration and approved it on Friday. Trump tweeted afterward: \u201cThings will be different after Jan. 20.\u201d\u00a0He later tweeted that the vote \"will make it much harder to negotiate peace.\" But, he added, \"we will get it done anyway.\" Kerry said Israel\u2019s continued and stepped-up attempts to build more settlements in the region, which includes East Jerusalem, risks the so-called \u201ctwo-state\u201d solution between Israelis and the Palestinians, who also lay claim to the region.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States acted with one primary objective in mind: to preserve the possibility of the two state solution, which every U.S. administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,\" Kerry said Friday. \u201cTwo states is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors, and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.\u201d He also said the administration does not agree with \u201cevery aspect\u201d of the resolution but that it \u201crightly condemns violence\u201d and calls on both sides to take constructive steps to reverse current trends and advance the prospects for a two-state solution. Netanyahu did not mince words on Saturday in responding to what he described as a \u201cshameful ambush.\u201d Netanyahu said the U.S abstention was \"in complete contrast\" to U.S. commitments -- including one that he said Obama made in 2011 -- not to impose conditions for a final agreement on Israel at the Security Council. \"The Obama administration conducted a shameful anti-Israel ambush at the U.N.,\" Netanyahu said.

My heart goes out to his family, friends and all of his fans. @GeorgeMichael #RIP A photo posted by Elton John (@eltonjohn) on Dec 25, 2016 at 3:24pm PST Born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, George Michael shot to fame in the early 1980s as a member of the group Wham!, with fellow singer and guitarist Andrew Ridgeley. The duo scored a U.S. and U.K. #1 hit with \u201cWake Me Up before You Go-Go\u201d in 1984. \u201cHeartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog,\" Ridgeley tweeted Sunday night about Michael\u2019s passing, \"Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx.\u201d Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog. Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx https://t.co/OlGTm4D9O6 \u2014 Andrew Ridgeley (@ajridgeley) December 26, 2016 Michael had a solo hit with \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d while with Wham!, then went solo a few years later, earning more hits including his Aretha Franklin duet \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting,\u201d which earned the duo a Grammy in 1988. Michael\u2019s debut solo album, Faith, was a huge success, and included the U.S. #1 singles \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cMonkey\u201d and \u201cOne More Try.\u201d It also spawned the controversial #2 single \u201cI Want Your Sex.\u201d Michael\u2019s second album, 1990\u2019s \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\" is perhaps best-remembered for the video of the hit single \u201cFreedom 90,\u201d which featured the biggest supermodels of the day, including Cindy Crawford , Christy Turlington , Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Tatjana Patitz lip-syncing the lyrics. Michael released five more solo albums and a greatest hits collection over the ensuing years -- his last was the 2014 live album \"Symphonica,\" his first album in ten years. Initially describing himself as bisexual, Michael revealed he was gay following his 1998 arrest in Beverly Hills, California for what was described as \u201cengaging in a lewd act\u201d in a public restroom with another man, revealed to be an undercover police officer. Michael later described his actions as the result of a subconscious desire to be honest about his sexuality. He was arrested for a similar act in 2006. Michael also was arrested several times in the 2000s for drug possession. More recently, the singer's health had become more of an issue. In late 2011, Michael was hospitalized off-and-on for a month for severe pneumonia . However, he told the Guardian that he felt like \"a new man\" after beating the illness. \"I still have plenty to live for,\" he said, when asked what got him through the ordeal. \"I have an amazing, amazing life, and if I wasn't spiritual enough before the last four, five weeks then I certainly am now.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story That is the way business has been done at the Trump Organization, a relatively small company with a big reach and a bigger self-image that has come under intense scrutiny as its chief prepares to become president of the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story With extensive entanglements around the world, many packaged in a network of licensing agreements and limited liability companies, the Trump Organization poses a raft of potential conflicts of interest for a president-elect who has long exerted such control over his company that, as he told The New York Times in a recent interview , he is the one who signs the checks. \u201cI like to sign checks so I know what is going on,\u201d he explained. Mr. Trump \u2014 owner of all but the smallest sliver of the privately held company \u2014 has said that, while the law does not require it, he is formulating plans to remove himself and his older daughter, Ivanka, from the company\u2019s operations. (Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, is likely to have a role in the White House.) His sons Donald Jr. and Eric, along with other executives, will be in charge, the president-elect wrote on Twitter in mid-December, adding that \u201cno new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.\u201d People involved in the planning have said that Mr. Trump intends to keep a stake in the business. But in recent weeks, amid rising pressure, Mr. Trump and his advisers have been intensely debating further measures . Among other things, the president-elect has agreed to shut down his personal foundation, has ended some international development deals and has reviewed a plan for an outside monitor to oversee the Trump Organization. Yet an examination of the company underscores the complex challenges of taking Mr. Trump out of Trump the organization. His company is a distinctly family business fortified with longtime loyalists that operates less on standardized procedures and more on a culture of Trump. Mr. Trump may leave the details of contracts to his deputies, but his name \u2014 and influence \u2014 is stamped on every deal the company does. In an interview last spring with The Times, Mr. Trump explained that he approved new ventures based on his personal \u201cfeel.\u201d And while in recent years his three oldest children have taken on more of a leadership role, Mr. Trump has the final say, sometimes weighing in on the most minute design details of planned hotels, golf courses or other properties the company owns or manages. His other top executives \u2014 many of them natives of Queens, where Mr. Trump grew up, or Brooklyn, where his father, Fred, expanded a housing empire many years ago \u2014 have secured power not necessarily through fancy pedigrees or impressive credentials, but through decades of devotion to their boss. Allen Weisselberg, the organization\u2019s chief financial officer, started off as an accountant for Mr. Trump\u2019s father. Matthew Calamari, the organization\u2019s chief operating officer, was recruited in 1981 after Mr. Trump saw him eject some hecklers while working security at the United States Open tennis tournament. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For some executives, there appears to be little division between their service to the company and their service to the Trumps. \u201cWe\u2019re not a publicly traded company. At the end of the day, I work for the Trump family,\u201d Alan Garten, the general counsel, explained in an interview with the legal industry publication Corporate Counsel shortly before the election. \u201cThat\u2019s how I view my job. Whether it\u2019s protecting their business interests or protecting their personal interests. I am here to assist them and represent them in any way they need.\u201d When asked to elaborate in an interview last week with The Times, Mr. Garten said that in any job, \u201cyou want to be as helpful as you can,\u201d but that \u201cobviously the interests of the Trumps and the interests of the company are two distinct things.\u201d The divisions between business and politics were often fuzzy during the presidential race: Mr. Garten became a \u201cliaison\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign; Michael Cohen, an executive vice president, tirelessly promoted his boss\u2019s bid for the White House on television while battling negative media coverage; and Jason Greenblatt, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, began serving as his adviser on Israel. On Friday, it was announced that Mr. Greenblatt would be joining Mr. Trump\u2019s administration as a special representative for international negotiations. After the election, other lines continued to blur as the president-elect and his children met with foreign businessmen with connections to their global ventures and with foreign officials with potential influence over their business dealings. Some government-ethics lawyers have warned that unless Mr. Trump fully divests himself from the company and places someone independent of his family in charge, he risks entering the White House in violation of a constitutional clause that forbids him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity. As Mr. Trump assumes the presidency, it is difficult to foresee him walling himself off from the company entirely, said Michael D\u2019Antonio, the author of a critical biography, \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that he could keep himself from inquiring about the performance of these businesses any more than he can keep himself from tweeting,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio said. \u201cIt is just too vital to his identity. Profit is the way he has always measured himself. I don\u2019t see how he can stop.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Trump in his office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan.

With a gleaming exterior that shoots to the sky, a lobby decked with marble and a collection of high-end tenants, Trump Tower is his primary residence as well as his company\u2019s headquarters.

Credit Rebecca Greenfield Photographs of Mr. Trump with the rich and powerful adorn his office walls, and his desk often overflows with papers, evidence of his refusal to communicate by email. When Mr. Trump wants to talk to someone, he calls out to his assistant, Rhona Graff, a Queens native whose office is right outside his door. She has been his gatekeeper for decades. Anyone seeking access to him over the phone has to go through Ms. Graff, sometimes with a secret code. Mr. Trump often boasts of the size of the Trump Organization. \u201cIt\u2019s a big company,\u201d he said in the interview last spring. A spokeswoman said the business employed \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d But industry experts estimate that no more than 4,000 people work for the Trump Organization worldwide. And executives say that the three floors that make up the headquarters appear to have no more than 150 employees.

The president-elect and his wife, Melania, went to the two-hour service at the Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea. Some members of the congregation stood and applauded as they walked in. The soon-to-be first couple were married at the church in 2005. Church Rector James Harlan spoke to the congregation about the need to make room for God in one\u2019s life by letting go of resentments and hurts.\u00a0 The president-elect is spending the holidays at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where he\u2019s been holding meetings with senior staff, advisers and business executives. In a press release Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump announced that he plans to\u00a0 dissolve his family\u2019s foundation in the wake of questions regarding possible conflicts of interest once he takes office. Mr. Trump has bemoaned the increased use of the term \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d in place of \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d as a sign that Christianity is under attack. As president, he\u2019s said, he\u2019ll reverse the trend. On Sunday morning, he tweeted a photo of himself in front of a Christmas tree with the message, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 25, 2016 Trump also tweeted wishes for a \u201cHappy Hanukkah\u201d last night. The eight-day Jewish holiday began at sundown Saturday. \u2014 Donald J.

They arrived at the Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, an Episcopal church just minutes from his Mar-a-Lago estate, around 10:30 p.m. Some members of the congregation stood up and clapped for the Trumps when they arrived. They attended the same service at the church last Christmas Eve, and also visited the church for Easter. The program for the service listed the Trumps as one of 569 households who contributed to Bethesda-by-the-Sea's December fundraising campaign. When it was time for the the passing the peace during the two-hour service, a few people approached Trump to honor this ritual of greeting and bidding peace to those around you.

The President and his daughters spent an hour-and-a-half inside the room, so whether they made it out, is unclear. Afterwards, the group visited the president's favorite shaved ice spot, Kailua's Island Snow. According to the travel pool, Malia passed on partaking in the frozen dessert, but Sasha opted for a blue shaved ice treat. The Associated Press President Barack Obama, wearing sunglasses, is seen through the window of Island Snow Hawaii as he and family and friends order shave ice in Kailua, Hawaii, Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016, during the first family's annual vacation. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) The president exited Island Snow with a large-sized shaved ice treat. He was sporting a white polo, khakis, flip flops, and wearing sunglasses, while he chatted with bystanders and small children before making his way down the ropeline, making eye contact with a toddler and proceeding to pick up the child, prompting an audible \"awww\" reaction from the crowd. The first lady was noticeably absent, but spent time answering phone calls received by the Santa NORAD tracking center. She spoke with children interested in knowing Santa's whereabouts, and listening to what they want for Christmas. Golf Again Friday, Dec. 23 After a little more than 4-hours, Obama wrapped another round of Golf this afternoon. Returning to play at Marine Corps Base Hawaii (Kaneohe). Playing with him are regulars Darrell Harrington, Bobby Titcomb, Greg Orme. And in his weekday habit made his way to the gym this morning before hitting the links. Back to the Beach Thursday, Dec. 22 For the second time this trip, President Obama and the first family spent the afternoon at the beach with a group of friends. This time the Obamas visited the beach at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, where the president started his day in the morning with his ritual workout. After almost two hours under mostly cloudy skies, according to the press pool, they headed back to their vacation rental where they remained for the night. Golfing on the West Side of Oahu Wednesday, Dec. 21 On another beautiful Hawaiian day, President Obama continued his familiar pattern of an early morning workout at the gym at Marine Corps Base Hawaii followed by a golf outing. Today\u2019s course: Kapolei Golf Club. He was joined by regular golf partners Bobby Titcomb, Greg Orme and Darrell Harrington. The round lasted under five hours and the press who travel with Obama\u2019s motorcade were invited to the 18th green to witness the commander in chief finish out his round. They reported that Obama stepped up on the green and sunk \u201ca rather short putt\u201d and tipped his cap in the direction of the press after making the putt. \u201cFellow players then approached POTUS to clasp hands and bro hug in triumph,\u201d one of the pool reporters noted. Family Fun at the Beach Tuesday, Dec. 20 The Obama family went to Bellows Air Force station to visit the beach with friends. It is a favorite beach spot for the first family; last year, the first family visited the beach three times, and in 2014 made it there five times. The visit came after Obama announced in a statement earlier in the day what he characterized as a permanent ban on drilling in parts of the Arctic and Atlantic. Another Day of Golf Monday, Dec. 19 Obama hit the links for the second time golfing today at Mid Pacific (or \"Mid Pac\") Country Club. He was joined by long time friends Bobby Titcomb and Greg Orme -- regular golf partners for the president when he returns to his home state -- as well as White House aide Joe Paulsen. This evening, the president and first lady ate out for the first time in Honolulu, visiting the Vintage Cave Cafe in Waikiki. Obamas Visit Nature Trail Sunday, Dec. 18 President Obama, along with first lady Michelle Obama joined some friends Sunday for a walking nature trail at Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden. Located in Kaneohe, Oahu, the 400-acre nature garden is part of the Honolulu Botanical Gardens.

Keeping With His Golfing tradition Saturday, Dec. 17 President Obama is hitting the links for his first full day on vacation. The first round is being played on the Marine Corps Base course: Kaneohe Klipper Golf Club. Aaron Tom President Obama is seen golfing in Hawaii, Dec. 17, 2016. According to the website it is \"one of the world's best military golf courses, consistently voted Number One by DoD patrons\" and described as a \"golfers' paradise where the Ko'oalu Mountains frame the front nine and the Pacific coastline spans the back nine.\" Along for the game are White House staffers Joe Paulsen, Luke Rosa and Michael Brush, as well as longtime Obama friend Bobby Titcomb. Obama started his 2014 and 2015 vacations in Hawaii playing this same course, with the same group of regulars. Off to Hawaii for Final Family Vacation as First Family Friday, Dec. 16 President Barack Obama is heading back to his home state of Hawaii for his final vacation as president. Taking off Friday evening, the first family returns to the island Obama grew up on, Oahu, for 17 days, staying near the beach town of Kailua. The final vacation will be historic in another way -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Pearl Harbor following a summit meeting with Obama in Hawaii, becoming the first Japanese leader to go to the site of the Japanese attack that propelled the United States into World War II. The announcement came after the 75th anniversary of the attack and six months after Obama visited Hiroshima, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to visit the site of the U.S. atomic bombing. Obama visited the island earlier this year as to designate Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument off the Hawaiian coast, creating the world's largest marine protected area. \"This is an area twice the size of Texas that\u2019s going to be protected, and it allows us to save and study the fragile ecosystem threatened by climate change,\" Obama said following the designation at a Conference of Leaders and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in Honolulu, Hawaii, in September. This post will be regularly updated throughout the Obama's final vacation as first family. 0 Shares ",

Blizzard warnings were in effect in eastern Montana and swaths of North and South Dakota on Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service, with winter storm warnings issued in Minnesota, Wyoming and parts of Northern Nebraska. The worst of storm was battering the Dakotas with heavy snow and ice, potentially stranding those trying to get home from grandma's house \u2014 or anywhere else \u2014 according to the Weather Channel . \"I don't think anybody's going to be going anywhere, not if they're smart,\" said John Rowe, a senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel.

Klein had traveled approximately 26 miles in search for help, the statement said, and was found in an occupied building and taken to a local hospital after suffering from cold exposure. Klein's husband and child had managed to hike to an area where they had cell phone service to call for help, the sheriff's office said, and both were also treated for cold exposure, including frostbite. The Arizona Department of Transportation warned Christmas travelers throughout Sunday that additional snowfall and wet conditions were causing delays and accidents on several highways. Related: From D.C. to Sydney: Christmas Festivities Around the World The storm was moving north late Sunday, Rowe said, but North Dakota and northern Wisconsin were still forecast to see additional snow. \"Tomorrow in the Dakotas and in Minnesota the wind is going to be so strong that whatever snow is on the ground is going to be blowing all over the place,\" Rowe said. The storm itself was moving up into Canada, he added, but rain associated with the weather front was moving towards the Northeast. Freezing rain was forecast to hit parts of Pennsylvania and New York late Sunday and into Monday morning, Rowe said.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Ms. Brecher now works at a clinic owned by Fresenius, one of the two largest dialysis companies along with DaVita. Together, the two companies provide nearly 80 percent of the charity\u2019s funding. She said her current patients benefited from the Kidney Fund, whose assistance can amount to thousands of dollars in financial aid a year. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf our patients didn\u2019t get that assistance, they would be owing great big huge bills to hospitals and doctors,\u201d she said. The financial help is available to patients with kidney failure, known as end-stage renal disease, many of whom are unable to work. The money covers the insurance premiums for many types of coverage, including Medicare and employer and individual private plans. The Kidney Fund\u2019s payments are part of an unusual deal it made with the government and the dialysis industry 20 years ago. The arrangement allows the dialysis companies to avoid violating anti-kickback laws. It allows dialysis clinics to donate to the Kidney Fund, treat patients whose insurance premiums are paid by the charity and then collect money from the insurers for those patients\u2019 treatments \u2014 essentially guaranteeing a steady stream of paying customers for the companies. But the agreement also has a caveat: It requires that all patient applications be treated equally, regardless of whether their clinic donates. In an interview this month, LaVarne A. Burton, the Kidney Fund\u2019s chief executive, said that the charity treated all patients equally, and that the fund had never denied anyone assistance if they qualified financially. \u201cIt is simply not true that we require any provider to contribute to the program,\u201d she said. \u201cNever have, and never will.\u201d She acknowledged, though, that the charity pushed clinics hard to donate, particularly if they applied on behalf of patients. \u201cWe believe there is a moral obligation for providers to contribute to the organization,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Burton said the concerns raised by social workers like Ms. Brecher and others arose because many in the industry misunderstood how the charity worked. The charity recently updated its guidelines, she said, to provide more clarity. An examination of public documents, as well as interviews with more than a dozen social workers, employees of dialysis clinics, insurance officials and regulators, and a former executive at the charity, put the actions in a different light. Many of the clinic workers, from about a half-dozen states around the country, were called randomly, to limit any chance of coordinated talking points. For years, The Times found, the Kidney Fund\u2019s preference for patients at the biggest clinics has been an open secret among many social workers, who said that as a result they had stopped applying for assistance entirely. Photo A 2011 fund-raiser for the American Kidney Fund in New York. The charity has resisted helping patients at clinics that do not donate to it, The New York Times found. Credit Mike Coppola/Getty Images, for the American Kidney Fund The findings also add to a list of concerns about the group\u2019s relationship with the dialysis industry. This year, for example, the fund faced questions about whether it was helping dialysis companies game the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, insurers and government officials have argued, the dialysis clinics used the charity\u2019s assistance program to push people who were eligible for Medicaid , government health insurance for the poor, into private health coverage available under the new law. The private plans pay the clinics much more than Medicaid \u2014 up to four times as much, adding up to an additional $200,000 per patient per year \u2014 for the same dialysis treatment. In recent months, the federal government has raised concerns about how patients are steered into private plans. UnitedHealthcare sued one company , American Renal Associates, over the practice, claiming it was harming patients by converting them to less generous coverage. American Renal, which declined to comment for this article, has denied the claims and is fighting the suit. The suit against American Renal also says the Kidney Fund directed some donations directly back to patients at American Renal. As part of an investigation by Medicare, social workers and insurers have made similar accusations against the Kidney Fund. Advertisement Ms. Burton denied those accusations and attributed the recent scrutiny of the insurance assistance program to insurers that want to avoid covering the often costly medical bills of people who need dialysis. \u201cThe insurance industry has let us have it full force,\u201d she said. A Costly Treatment Dialysis filters toxins from the blood when a patient\u2019s kidneys no longer work. The process is lifesaving, but also onerous, often requiring that patients be tethered to a machine for hours at a time, three times a week. Patients on dialysis often cannot hold full-time jobs, studies have shown, and those receiving the treatment are disproportionately poor. The poorest people with kidney disease qualify for Medicaid, which covers all of their costs. But Medicare covers most of the 500,000 or so Americans who need the treatment, regardless of their age, under a government program that has existed since the 1970s and that costs the federal government more than $30 billion a year . Even with help, people covered by Medicare are left with significant out-of-pocket costs. Most must pay a monthly premium of about $120, as well as a portion of their medical expenses, which can add up to several thousand dollars a year. Until the late 1990s, the dialysis companies routinely paid these expenses. But a federal law outlawed that practice, out of concern that covering a patient\u2019s bills might dissuade that patient from switching to another clinic that might provide better care. That was when the American Kidney Fund stepped in. In 1995, the charity was relatively small, with a $5 million annual budget and contributions from the dialysis industry that accounted for less than 10 percent of its donations. The Kidney Fund and the biggest dialysis clinics presented the government with a proposal that would allow the companies to indirectly pay insurance premiums for patients. The deal, reached with the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services in 1997, has had a profound effect on the charity. In 2015, the Kidney Fund reported revenue of $264 million, making it one of the country\u2019s 100 largest nonprofits. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dialysis industry has also flourished. DaVita and Fresenius in particular have grown quickly, buying smaller chains, consolidating their market share and locking in profits. The Kidney Fund says it got 78 percent of its revenue in 2015 from two companies, which insurers, state regulators and others identified as DaVita and Fresenius. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of recognition of the unique needs of that patient population,\u201d said Philipp Stephanus, a senior vice president at DaVita who handles patient support and insurance issues. The Kidney Fund, DaVita and Fresenius said the federal agreement prohibited them from disclosing what percentage of applications the fund approved from those companies\u2019 clinics, or how much the charity paid in insurance aid for patients at those clinics. But the 1997 deal tried to prevent any preferential treatment, no matter how big the companies became. Photo LaVarne A. Burton, the Kidney Fund\u2019s chief executive, said the charity treated all patients equally. \u201cIt is simply not true that we require any provider to contribute to the program,\u201d she said. Credit Mike Coppola/Getty Images, for the American Kidney Fund Kevin McAnaney, a former government lawyer who helped draft the original agreement, said fairness to patients was at the heart of the deal. Everyone understood that \u201cthey were covering free riders who weren\u2019t contributing anything,\u201d said Mr. McAnaney, a lawyer in private practice who previously worked at the Office of Inspector General. But if the rules are not followed, the Office of Inspector General has the right to end the agreement, which would profoundly change the relationship of the industry and the charity. \u201cIf all the conditions are not met, the opinion is without force and effect,\u201d said Donald White, a spokesman for the agency. In keeping with the agency\u2019s policy, he would not confirm or deny whether the agency was investigating the group. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Patients Turned Away Tracey Dickey works as a social worker for a nonprofit dialysis clinic in rural Missouri with no connection to a big dialysis company, and many of her patients struggle to pay their medical bills, she said. They are exactly the kind of people the Kidney Fund says it is there to help. In November 2014, Ms. Dickey emailed an executive at the fund. She said she had heard that only clinics that donated to it could apply for financial aid for patients. Her clinic had not donated, she said \u2014 but she still had a patient in need. \u201cI need to know the facts before I tell her there isn\u2019t premium assistance,\u201d Ms. Dickey wrote in an email to the fund. She provided a copy of the email to The Times. An executive at the fund wrote back the same day. He was noncommittal, but attached a set of guidelines that he asked her to review. \u201cIf your company cannot make fair and equitable contributions,\u201d the guidelines read, \u201cwe respectfully request that your organization not refer patients.\u201d And so she didn\u2019t. The patient, Ms. Dickey said, continues to struggle financially. This summer, after Ms. Dickey and other social workers shared their experiences in an industry discussion group, the Kidney Fund invited them to contact the charity about their concerns. When she followed up, the charity told Ms. Dickey that she would need some computer training to enroll in the program. She has not pursued it, she said. Ms. Burton said that Ms. Dickey had apparently misunderstood the exchange with the Kidney Fund employee and that had she applied, her patient would have been approved, assuming the person qualified financially. But Ms. Brecher and several workers at other nonprofit or independent clinics told similar stories. An administrator at an independent clinic in a Midwestern city said he had helped a handful of patients maintain their coverage through the fund after they transferred to his clinic from a large chain. He declined to be identified because, he said, he did not want to anger DaVita and Fresenius, who sometimes send him patients. Each time, he said, the charity\u2019s workers later demanded that the clinic make a donation that at a minimum covered the amount it had paid for the patient\u2019s premium. If he did not pay, he said he had been told, the patient risked losing the financial help from the charity for his insurance. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The administrator said he had refused to donate to the charity. The Kidney Fund continued to help pay for the patients\u2019 insurance, he said, but the aggressive approach angered him. Ms. Burton said the charity never declined a patient because a clinic did not donate. But she said the Kidney Fund did not hesitate to ask clinics for donations. \u201cWe are a charitable organization,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fund-raise for everything that we do.\u201d She said nearly 40 percent of the 213 dialysis companies whose clinics had successfully helped patients apply to the fund had never donated. She would not say, though, what percentage of the 80,000 patients the fund helps annually comes from clinics that do not donate, or how many of those patients come from the biggest companies, which donate most of their revenue. Still, some social workers say the assumption at many clinics where they work is that the aid decisions are not always based on financial need. Jennifer Bruns, now a social worker at the St. John Transplant Specialty Center in Detroit, worked for years in dialysis clinics and said she had many clients who received assistance from the American Kidney Fund. She said sometimes patients would tell her that their insurance premiums \u2014 which the Kidney Fund had agreed to pay \u2014 had not been paid that month. Ms. Bruns called the fund to find out why, she said in an interview, \u201cand they would say, \u2018Well you haven\u2019t made your contribution this month.\u2019\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 26, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Donations Seen Influencing Aid by Kidney Fund.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second right, arrives for a weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Dec. 25, 2016. (Dan Balilty / Associated Press) Joshua Mitnick Still fuming over a United Nations Security Council resolution\u00a0passed\u00a0Friday\u00a0that deems\u00a0Jewish settlements\u00a0in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the rare step\u00a0of summoning the U.S. ambassador\u00a0to express his displeasure with the Obama administration for allowing the measure to pass.\u00a0 The U.S. had abstained from voting on Security Council Resolution 2334, which passed 14 to 0. The decision not to exercise the U.S.\u2019 veto power as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council was criticized in Israel as a break with American policy to shield Israel at the U.N. The decision recognizes all of the West Bank and Jerusalem captured by Israel and the 1967 Arab-Israeli war as \u201coccupied Palestinian territory\u201d and calls for an immediate and complete halt of Israeli building there. Though the Security Council decision is expected to have little immediate effect, analysts say it could give added legal momentum to a possible effort to sue Israel in the International Criminal Court or impose sanctions on Israel. Speaking at the weekly meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday morning, Netanyahu said he was angry over\u00a0the U.N. vote, and accused the outgoing Obama administration of acting as the hidden hand behind passage of the resolution.\u00a0 \"There is no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated the drafts and demanded that it pass,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u00a0 Netanyahu requested a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro to discuss the decision.\u00a0 An official at the U.S. Embassy confirmed the meeting request by the prime minister. The official declined to respond to Israeli criticism of U.S. handling of the resolution. Other\u00a0Israeli politicians were more forceful\u00a0in their criticism of\u00a0the U.S. administration. Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told reporters that the Obama administration had stabbed Israel in the back. Michael Oren, a deputy minister and former ambassador to the U.S., told Israel Television that the goal of the resolution is to \u201cdestroy\u201d Israel economically by exposing it to\u00a0sanctions and lawsuits. The Obama administration portrayed its historic decision to allow U.N. condemnation of Israeli settlement -building as a way to finally and emphatically demand a stop to the activity. But the move may backfire by hardening positions, both in the right-wing Israeli government and in the incoming ... The Obama administration portrayed its historic decision to allow U.N. condemnation of Israeli settlement -building as a way to finally and emphatically demand a stop to the activity. But the move may backfire by hardening positions, both in the right-wing Israeli government and in the incoming ... (Tracy Wilkinson) The meeting with\u00a0Shapiro\u00a0was the latest in a series of diplomatic moves Israel has made in recent days to push back on\u00a0the resolution.\u00a0Ambassadors of all 14 countries that supported the resolution in the Security Council were also\u00a0called into the Foreign Ministry on Sunday in protest. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman ordered the suspension of civilian and political meetings with the Palestinian Authority . The international community considers the Jewish settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law and an obstacle to efforts to create a continuous Palestinian state in the territory. Israel says that resolutions at the U.N. on the peace process are unilateral moves that\u00a0will make it more difficult to restart negotiations, which have been mothballed for two years. Palestinian officials, who have criticized\u00a0settlement expansion for years, hailed the resolution as a\u00a0victory. Speaking to Israel Army Radio on Sunday, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the\u00a0resolution supports a two-state solution. \u201cWhat is disgraceful is the continuation of the building of settlements on what is supposed to be Palestinian land,\u2019\u2019 he said. The passage of the resolution put\u00a0Netanyahu on the defensive at home. Newspaper commentators said the prime minister clashed too many times with President Obama and went too far to curry favor with pro-settlement politicians in his coalition, for example by supporting\u00a0legislation to retroactively legalize settlement activity on Palestinian property. Analysts say that pressure\u00a0is fueling Netanyahu\u2019s fiery response to the U.N. vote.\u00a0\u201cThe overreaction is symptomatic of the fact that I think he knows that this is a mistake, that he messed up,\u201d said Jonathan Rynhold, a political science professor at Bar-Ilan University and an expert on U.S.-Israeli relations. \u201cHe understood that by placating the ideological right he created a position where it was easy for Obama to do what he did. He made a choice to consolidate and maintain his right-wing base, and there\u2019s a price for that,\u201d Rynhold said.

(Photo: Mark Konezny, USA TODAY Sports) It took a last-minute comeback, but the Pittsburgh Steelers wrapped up the AFC North on Sunday. Antonio Brown extended the ball over the goal line on a 4-yard touchdown catch with nine seconds remaining to power Pittsburgh to a 31-27 comeback win Sunday over the Baltimore Ravens, who were eliminated from postseason contention with the loss. Ravens fullback Kyle Juszczyk's 10-yard touchdown run with 1:18 gave Baltimore a 27-24 lead with 1:18 left before Ben Roethlisberger led the Steelers 75 yards on 10 plays on the game-winning drive. \"Right before we went out, we said, 'Let's get the game-winning touchdown and get out of here,' \" Brown told reporters after the game. Le'Veon Bell scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to rally Pittsubrgh back to a 24-20 lead before Juszczyk's big play. Two third-quarter interceptions by Roethlisberger put the Steelers in a 20-10 hole with 14 minutes remaining. But Bell helped wake the offense from its sluggish spell, scoring on a 7-yard run\u00a0and then a 7-yard reception to recapture the lead. \"We showed some resolve,\" Roethlisberger told reporters. \"That showed some fight, no quit. You never heard anything from the defense (after the second interception), you never saw them get down. ... We can only stick together.\" Bell finished with 137 total yards and the two scores after being held to a season-low 32 rushing yards and 70 total in the previous meeting against the Ravens. Roethlisberger completed 24 of 33 passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Pittsburgh closes out its regular season Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, while Baltimore finishes at the Cincinnati Bengals. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 16 Posted!

Francis has spent much of the year denouncing the Islamic extremist violence that has driven Christians from Mideast communities that date to the time of Christ. He has also demanded Europe in particular do more to welcome refugees, saying Jesus himself was a migrant who deserved more than being born in a manger. And he has called out the wasteful ways of the wealthy when children and the poor die of hunger every day.\u00a0 Pope Francis stirred up quite a commotion with his modest footwear choice. He left the Vatican to pick up his own shoes and even stopped to chat ... In his homily, Francis urged his flock to reflect on how children today aren\u2019t always allowed to lie peacefully in a cot, loved by their parents as Jesus was, but rather \u201csuffer the squalid mangers that devour dignity.\u201d Among the indignities, he said, are \u201chiding underground to escape bombardment, on the pavements of a large city, at the bottom of a boat overladen with immigrants.\u201d \u201cLet us allow ourselves to be challenged by the children who are not allowed to be born, by those who cry because no one satiates their hunger, by those who do have not toys in their hands, but rather weapons,\u201d he added. The Mass late Saturday was the first major event of the Christmas season, followed by Francis\u2019 noon Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) blessing on Christmas Day. In another appeal, Francis called for the faithful to not get caught up in the commercialization of Christmas -- \u201cwhen we are concerned for gifts but cold toward those who are marginalized.\u201d Materialism has \u201ctaken us hostage this Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to free ourselves of it!\u201d\u00a0 Last week, Francis \u00a0celebrated his 80th birthday by sharing breakfast with eight homeless people before celebrating Mass with cardinals as greetings flowed in from around the world. \u00a0\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Imprisoned Blagojevich awaits Obama decision on commutation Images of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, from his rise in politics to his fall from office. Tribune news services Contact Reporter One of the last chances for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to win early release from federal prison rests on a pending decision by the man whose Senate seat Blagojevich was convicted of trying to sell \u2014 President Barack Obama . Blagojevich, 60, is in the fourth year of a 14-year prison term. He recently submitted a request to have his sentence on wide-ranging corruption convictions commuted, the U.S. Department of Justice has confirmed. Obama has rarely mentioned his fellow Chicago Democrat since Blagojevich's December 2008 arrest, a month after Obama won the presidency, so it's hard to gauge if he'd give Blagojevich's request for a reduced sentence serious thought. A look at the commutation process and factors that could influence a decision: WHAT IT IS A commutation is a reduction of a sentence, while pardons amount to forgiveness of a crime that also removes restrictions on rights to run for office and vote. In federal cases, only presidents have the power to reduce a sentence. If Obama doesn't get around to deciding on Blagojevich's application before his last day in office, he would leave it for someone else with a tie to the ex-governor to decide: President-elect Donald Trump . Read more stories Blagojevich was on Trump's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" TV show in 2010. While Trump eventually \"fired\" Blagojevich as a contestant, he praised Blagojevich for how he fought his criminal case, telling him, \"You have a hell of a lot of guts.\" Among the factors Obama can consider is whether Blagojevich's punishment was disproportionate to the crime. His 14-year prison term was the longest for an Illinois politician for corruption and his lawyers argue it was too severe. CONVICTIONS Blagojevich's bid to trade an appointment to the Senate seat Obama vacated for campaign cash is regarded as one of the most shocking instances of corruption in U.S. history. A FBI recording notoriously captured a foul-mouthed Blagojevich gushing about how he could profit from an appointment to Obama's seat: \"I've got this thing and it's f------ golden. And I'm just not giving it up for f------ nothing.\" Imprisoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is seeking a presidential commutation of his 14-year sentence on a corruption conviction. U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Dena Iverson said Friday that the department has received a petition for commutation from Blagojevich. She declined to... Imprisoned former Illinois Gov.

(Tribune news services) Blagojevich was convicted on 18 corruption counts, which also included a bid to shake down a children's hospital. While an appellate court later dismissed five counts and ordered Blagojevich be resentenced, his trial judge imposed the same 14-year term earlier this year. Blagojevich's projected release date is in 2024. PERSONAL TIES While Obama and Blagojevich were never considered close, their rise in politics occurred around the same time and in the same place \u2014 Chicago. When Blagojevich first become governor in 2003, Obama was still a relative unknown state legislator, and it was Blagojevich who was considered the bigger star of the Democratic Party. Wiretap recordings played at his trials reveal Blagojevich's deepening jealousy of Obama after he won the presidency. In one, Blagojevich fixates on how Obama's political success has left him in the dust, telling an aide: \"My upward trajectory is ... stalled if not ... terminally wounded by Obama.\" One connection between the politicians \u2014 an uncomfortable one for Obama \u2014 is that he and Blagojevich once shared the same fundraiser, Tony Rezko . Rezko was convicted in June 2008 of fraud, money laundering and bribery. Who is Rod Blagojevich? Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, has filed a notice to appeal his 14-year prison term. Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, has filed a notice to appeal his 14-year prison term. ODDS Chances of Obama granting Blagojevich's request would seem slim. Blagojevich's arrest in 2008 was an embarrassment coming as Obama was about to enter the White House, and it seems unlikely Obama would want to renew any association with the disgraced Democrat as he leaves the White House. Obama has been granting commutations at a rapid pace in his final months. On Dec. 19, he pardoned 78 people and shortened the sentence of 153 others, the greatest number of individual clemencies in a single day by any president. But the focus has largely been on drug cases. Compared to the total number of requests made, Obama, like other presidents, has granted only a small percentage. Nearly 32,000 commutation petitions have been submitted to Obama since 2009, with just over 1,000 granted, justice department data indicates. That's a 3 percent success rate for applicants.

    "text": "1. DO save the receipt It may seem obvious, but many people forget this step! If you're giving a gift, make sure to provide a gift receipt. If you're the gift recipient, stash that receipt away somewhere safe until you decide on whether or not you want to keep the item. While some retailers may give you store credit if you show up with no receipt, most retailers will require proof of purchase if you're looking to get cash back. 2. DO keep the item\u2019s original packaging Rushing to open your gift can be exciting, but if you accidentally damage the box or plastic wrapping that your item came in, you jeopardize your chances of getting a full return. Some stores offer store credit, but will charge you a re-stocking fee if the original packaging is missing or damaged. Others will charge you a small fee if you try to return an item with a dirty or missing user\u2019s manual. RELATED: These are the best holiday shopping windows of 2016 3. DON'T return used items Having second thoughts about a pair of boots you've already worn once? Used or worn items are usually non-refundable, unless the product is defective in some way. A few stores like Nordstrom and Sephora have a more lenient policy, but in general,you won\u2019t get a full refund if your item is used or previously worn. 4. DO be prepared to have proof of identity In an effort to prevent retail fraud, a number of retailers are relying on refund verification systems to keep track of customers\u2019 spending and return habits. This means they\u2019ll ask you for a government-issued ID every time you make a return and will keep track of your activity. Some stores, like Walmart, will allow you to make a maximum of three returns (without a receipt) in 45 days. If you try to make a fourth in that time span, they reserve the right to ban you from making any further returns. Meanwhile, Amazon.com has been known to suspend users\u2019 accounts if they suspect fraudulent return habits. RELATED: 4 glam beauty ideas to help you sparkle this holiday season 5. DO return electronics in a timely manner Most stores offer a shorter, 15-day return window for electronics versus the traditional, 30-to-60-day window for clothing and other items. Although, some retailers are extending their policies just for the holidays. Apple is extending its return window to Jan. 8 and Best Buy will give until Jan. 15 to return unwanted electronics. 6. DO know which retailers are the most lenient Most retailers have a time-sensitive return policy, but a handful of popular retailers will accept returns no matter how much time has passed. It's true! Nordstrom is so liberal with their return policy that you can return gifts and purchases at any point for money back or store credit. At Costco, you can return most items (except some types of electronics) whenever you wish. There are also no time limits on returns at Bed, Bath & Beyond unless you purchase mattresses. But do note: If you don\u2019t have the original packaging, proof of purchase or receipt, Bed, Bath and Beyond policy states that you\u2019ll lose 20 percent of the original selling price. RELATED: 10 kid-approved party outfits that will look adorable in holiday photos 7. DON'T make returns during peak times Instead of going to the stores the day after Christmas, hold off a day or two. Not only will you be in a less hectic shopping environment, but chances are your salesperson will be less crazed, too. He or she might be more willing to help out if you\u2019re trying to make a more complicated return. 8. DO practice kindness Be nice and smile! Store clerks are facing busy times and tough customers this time of year. If you\u2019re extra gracious, they'll be more likely to go out of their way to help you. And why not keep the holiday spirit going! More NBC's Season of Kindness videos ",

    "text": "Email SANDRINGHAM, England \u2013\u00a0A heavy cold kept Queen Elizabeth II from attending the traditional Christmas morning church service near her Sandringham estate in rural Norfolk, England. It is extremely rare for Elizabeth to miss the service, which is a cornerstone of the royal family\u2019s Christmas celebrations and brings the monarch into contact with local residents who gather outside for a glimpse of her. \u201cThe Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery,\u201d Buckingham Palace said. \u201cHer Majesty will participate in the royal family Christmas celebrations during the day.\u201d Those festivities usually include a gala lunch. In past years, the royal family would often go for extended walks in the countryside. Elizabeth has been in generally good health and has maintained an active schedule in the last year despite traveling less often than in the past. Her husband, 95-year-old Prince Philip, has also cut back his public schedule and his charitable works. He was also suffering from a heavy cold earlier in the week, the palace said. Philip did attend the Sunday morning Christmas service, waving to well-wishers on his way out of the church. As a concession to age and his cold, he drove to the church instead of walking. Prince Harry spent time talking to local residents after the church and stopped to pet a dog.

Chris Jackson, Getty Images There were no signs of other family members being ill. The flu season has hit many Britons hard in the last two weeks and colds and flus are spreading. A cold can be dangerous for people in their 90s, doctors warn. Earlier this week, the royal couple delayed their departure from London to Sandringham because of their colds but traveled one day later than expected, using a helicopter instead of a train. ",

That\u2019s all we know.\u201d The tablet showed up one day last week after Booker\u2019s mother, Tyshika Britten, posted a message on Craigslist saying her family of five boys and a baby girl were facing eviction from their home in Oxon Hill, Md.

Vedder knows there are complex social issues beyond the range of his check, but he wanted to provide, as he put it, \u201ca tourniquet\u201d to help the family gain some control and normalcy. A Christmas with presents helps, too. Britten watched her kids tear the wrapping off video games, shirts, remote-control cars, winter coats, science sets, Legos, footballs, basketballs, and more \u2014 arriving at all hours in dozens of UPS truck deliveries, which was a new experience for the family.

Nearby, hanging on the wall, was a sticker that read, \u201cBless the God Before Us And the Love Between Us.\u201d As they unwrapped the love, Britten suspected the hate was waiting for her on social media and in messages from a \u00adGoFundMe page she set up because people were requesting a way to send cash. Online trolls have questioned her parenting ability and demanded she \u201cclose her legs.\u201d A friend on Facebook offered support. \u201cDon\u2019t let the devil mess with your head,\u201d she wrote. Others criticized Britten for exposing and embarrassing her family. But the hairdresser and Booker, her longtime boyfriend and a struggling construction worker, don\u2019t hide their financial problems. Anyway, it would be impossible: They\u2019ve moved multiple times and once ran a hose to a neighbor\u2019s home for water. \u201cI\u2019m not exposing my family,\u201d she said in front of her children. \u201cI\u2019m exposing how a lot of people have to live. There are people all over this country who have the same problems we have. This is real life.\u201d Now the family is hoping this windfall \u2014 in addition to Vedder\u2019s check, the GoFundMe page has raised nearly $18,000 \u2014 will give them, as Britten put it, \u201ca head start\u201d at securing a stable living situation. The landlord wants them out and is planning to visit them Tuesday, probably marking the end of their Christmas miracle. They have dreams of buying their own home, of not living in the dark and cold in winter to conserve money for rent, of owning cars that don\u2019t require the Lord\u2019s Prayer to start. They have regrets but don\u2019t dwell on them. \u201cWe are not perfect people,\u201d Britten said. \u201cWe have made mistakes and that\u2019s life, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d And they think that in asking for help, and getting so much of it, they have given their children a present they can all share \u2014 a message that, no matter what, life is life and love is love. \u201cI am a proud mother of six,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my children. And I will take care of them, and I will get them what they need, any way I can.\u201d Torn wrapping paper was strewn everywhere. Outside, one of her sons squirted a toy fire extinguisher. The others were trying on new clothes, setting up their games, opening batteries for remote-control cars.

Investigators said they are looking into every possible cause for the crash, including a terror attack. All 84 passengers and eight crew members on board the Soviet-built Tu-154 plane operated by the Russian military are believed to have died when it crashed two minutes after taking off at 5:25 a.m. in good weather from the southern Russian city of Sochi. More than 3,000 people \u2014 including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia \u2014 worked from 32 ships and several helicopters to search the crash site, the Defense Ministry said. Drones and submersibles were also being used to help spot bodies and debris. Powerful spotlights were brought in so the search could continue around the clock. Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) from shore. By Sunday evening, rescue teams had recovered 11 bodies and Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said fragments of other bodies were also found. The wreckage and human remains were being brought to shore in Sochi, CBS News producer Svetlana Berdnikova reported.\u00a0 Search and rescue crews retrieve passenger belongings after a Russian military plane crashed in the Black Sea on December 25, 2016. STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Asked if a terror attack was a possibility, Sokolov said investigators were looking into every possible reason for the crash. That contradicted an earlier statement from investigators denying that there could have been any act of terrorism on board, Berdnikova reported. So far, she reports investigators say they have not seen any evidence of fire or an explosion in the wreckage that has been recovered. Russian lawmakers said that the military plane was tightly secured, and security is particularly tight in Sochi, which hosted the 2014 Winter Games and is regularly visited by Putin, who has a residence there. The plane belonging to the Defense Ministry was taking its world-famous choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble, to a New Year\u2019s concert at Hemeimeem air base in Syria\u2019s coastal province of Latakia. Those on board also included nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor famous for her work in war zones.\u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television to declare Monday a nationwide day of mourning. \u201cWe will conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons and will do everything to support the victims\u2019 families,\u201d Putin said. In Moscow, flowers piled up on the sidewalk outside the choir\u2019s home base as residents mourned their loss. \u201cIt is a real tragedy for the whole country, especially because of the people who were on board,\u201d Berdnikova said.\u00a0 A cameraman from Russian Zvezda channel, whose colleagues were on board of Russian military Tu-154 plane crashed into the Black Sea, is comforted by a man outside the headquarters of the Alexandrov Ensemble, also known as the Red Army Choir, in Moscow, Russia, December 25, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin The Black Sea search area \u2014 which covered 10 square kilometers (nearly 4 square miles) \u2014 was made more difficult by underwater currents that carried debris and body fragments into the open sea. Sokolov said the plane\u2019s flight recorders did not have the radio beacons common in more modern aircraft, so locating them on the seabed was going to be challenging. The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively in Russia and worldwide. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 and earlier this year, according to the Defense Ministry. File photo of a Russian Tupolev Tu-154. REUTERS/Dmitry Petrochenko Magomed Tolboyev, a decorated Russian test pilot, said the circumstances of the crash indicated that all on board had died. \u201cThere is no chance to survive in such situation,\u201d he said, according to the Interfax news agency. While the cause remained under investigation, some experts noted that the crew\u2019s failure to report a malfunction pointed at a possible terror attack. \u201cPossible malfunctions ... certainly wouldn\u2019t have prevented the crew from reporting them,\u201d Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti, adding that it points at an \u201cexternal impact.\u201d Russian planes have been brought down previously by terror attacks. In October 2015, a Russian plane carrying mostly Russian tourists back from vacation in Egypt was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane\u2019s luggage compartment. The local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up in the skies over Russia on the same day by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility for the twin attacks. In the last year, the Russian military has repeatedly flown Russian singers and artists to perform at Hemeimeem, which serves as the main hub for the Russian air campaign in Syria . This plane was carrying performers for New Year\u2019s, the main holiday for most Russians. The passenger list for the Sochi plane released by the Defense Ministry included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, including its leader, Valery Khalilov. The ensemble is the official choir of the Russian military and also includes a band and a dance company. The choir sang \u201cGet Lucky\u201d at the opening of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi , becoming an instant online sensation. The toll on the choir was reported to be devastating. Viktor Yeliseyev, head of the rival choir of the Russian National Guard, said \u201cmost singers of the choir have died.\u201d Also on board was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work, which has included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said Glinka was accompanying a shipment of medicine for a hospital in Syria. \u201cWe never feel sure that we will come back alive,\u201d she said when Putin presented her with an award earlier this month. \u201cBut we are sure that kindness, compassion and charity are stronger than any weapon.\u201d Syrian President Bashar Assad was among numerous foreign leaders who sent a condolence note to Putin, saying he received the news \u201cwith deep grief and sadness.\u201d In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and other government agencies in Russia have continued to use them. While noisy and fuel-guzzling, the plane is popular with crews that appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent plane, which has proven its reliability during decades of service,\u201d veteran pilot Oleg Smirnov said in televised remarks. Still, since 1994 there have been 17 major plane crashes involving the Tu-154 that have killed over 1,760 people. Most resulted from human error. In the latest previous deadly crash of a Tu-154, a plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others crashed in April 2010 while trying to land at a military airport in Smolensk in western Russia, killing everyone on board. Investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather, but Polish authorities have launched a new probe. Russia\u2019s military involvement backing Assad in the war in Syria has also made it a target in recent days. The Russian ambassador to Turkey , Andrey Karlov, was shot and killed at a photo exhibit in Ankara last week by a gunman who shouted \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo , don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d before he was gunned down by police. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: Matt_Kryger / Indy_Star) OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 \u00a0The day their season died they finally let it all out, the frustrations and the regrets that have been simmering for weeks, months even. They came to grips with the harsh reality they must now swallow. The 2016 Indianapolis Colts aren\u2019t good enough. What\u2019s worse: They never were. A Christmas Eve clobbering in northern California stamped their fate and sealed their epitaph: They were pretenders all along, a team that made you think they could become something more but never went out and proved it. They weren\u2019t good enough to win a bad division; weren\u2019t good enough to find any semblance of consistency this season; weren\u2019t good enough to make the playoffs with a franchise quarterback on the precipice of his prime. Instead, Andrew Luck will be watching the playoffs from home for the second straight year. There\u2019s no excuse this time, no lacerated kidney to hide behind. Indianapolis is a team that is regressing. Contenders? No. Not even close. Saturday proved it. This season proved it. x Share Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck and coach Chuck Pagano discuss their 33-25 loss to the Oakland Raiders. Matt Kryger/IndyStar They\u2019re as far away from the Super Bowl as they\u2019ve been since Curtis Painter was the starting quarterback. \u201cIt\u2019s not what being a Colt is all about,\u201d Luck said after his team\u2019s 33-25 loss in Oakland sealed their playoff fate. \u201cIt\u2019s not what playing for the horseshoe is all about.\u201d Luck is right  \u2014\u00a0this is an organization that will now miss the postseason for consecutive years for the first time in nearly two decades. They climbed and climbed and climbed his first three years in this league, defying logic, debunking the belief it takes years to rebuild from scratch with a rookie coach, rookie general manager and a rookie quarterback. They ignored all that, won big, won quickly, and soon found themselves on the brink of a Super Bowl. Turns out, it was all a mirage. They\u2019ve done nothing since. \u201cThat\u2019s not OK,\u201d linebacker Erik Walden lamented. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I came to Indy: They (were) in the postseason every year. (Missing it two straight seasons), that\u2019s a tough pill to swallow.\u201d They\u2019ve got no choice now. In the quiet of a stunned locker room Saturday in Oakland, after they fell 33-25 to the Raiders, the leaders of this underachieving team spoke in truths, refusing to hide behind the empty clich\u00e9s that have been spouted throughout this disappointing year. \u201cThose games that we were winning late, Detroit (in Week 1), Houston (in Week 6), that came back to bite us in the (butt),\u201d offered running back Robert Turbin. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck (12) gets after his team late in the game against the Oakland Raiders at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., on Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Matt_Kryger / Indy_Star) Turbin is right \u2014  you can\u2019t blow fourth-quarter leads in September and October and expect those losses not to haunt you in December. The Colts simply weren\u2019t good enough, weren\u2019t deep enough, weren\u2019t resolute enough to overcome their early-season stumbles. Most damning, though, is that they fought their way back, gave themselves a chance, then blew it once more. A Week  14  flop at home against the Texans and Saturday\u2019s beatdown in Oakland proved it all over again. Aren\u2019t good enough. Never were. They yielded 210 rushing yards  Saturday. At one point the Raiders ripped off five straight drives that ended in a touchdown. So much for controlling the controllables. \u201cEverything worked out the way we wanted it,\u201d Turbin said, referring to Jacksonville\u2019s upset of Tennessee earlier Saturday that kept the Colts\u2019 slim playoff hopes alive. \u201cWe talked about it. It was going to work out for us. We believed. I believed in my heart that Houston and Tennessee were going to lose today. \u201cThen we didn\u2019t do our part.\u201d Turbin then weighed that statement for a moment, his frustration growing ... and growing ... and growing. He considered his future. He\u2019ll be a free agent come March. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you what, though, I wanna be back here next year because I\u2019m (expletive) coming back to help this team win a championship,\u201d Turbin said. \u201cPeriod. With a (expletive) vengeance.\u201d The hope of training camp, all that renewed optimism that encircled this team as Luck returned healthy and coach Chuck Pagano embarked on his second chance and second contract? Wasted. Their season was over before Christmas. In that locker room, Dwayne Allen, the tight end the Colts dished out a surprise $29 million contract to back in March, threw the blame on himself. \u201cI personally have to be better. I played like (expletive) this entire year,\u201d Allen said. \u201cReally, as a leader on this team, I can\u2019t have playoff aspirations and go out there and individually play like an 0-2 player, like an 0-16 player. That\u2019s the way I can summarize my season. \u201cAndrew and T.Y. (Hilton), they go out there and play really well week-in and week-out. The rest of the supporting cast, starting with myself, just didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Indianapolis Colts wide receiver T.Y. Hilton (13) sits dejectedly on the bench after Oakland Raiders quarterback Matt McGloin (14) is able to make a first down late in the game at Oakland-Alameda County  Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., on Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Matt_Kryger / Indy_Star) Then the question was raised: Are the Colts moving backward? Are they regressing? Allen considered the hard reality for a moment, letting the question hang in the air. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go far as saying that,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say that word \u2014  regressing. The pieces are there. \u201cMan, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard for me to say that. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re regressing. The league is different, year-to-year, week-to-week. It sucks. It sucks.\u201d It was Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells who put it thusly: \u201cYou are what your record says you are.\u201d More than one Colt bristled at the thought. Their record says they\u2019re 7-8. Their record says they\u2019re a below average football team. Their reality says they\u2019ll be watching the playoffs from home. \u201cWe're better than that,\u201d running back Frank Gore said. \u201cBut that\u2019s our record.\u201d Parcells was right. Records don\u2019t lie. This team isn\u2019t good enough, and never was. Call  IndyStar reporter Zak Keefer at (317) 444-6134 and follow him on Twitter: @zkeefer . ",

In this Jan. 19, 2016 file photo, handguns are displayed at the Smith & Wesson booth at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show in Las Vegas. (John Locher / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Gun rights advocates view the upcoming legislative session as their best bet to get rid of an Indiana law that requires a license to carry handguns. The controversial legislation didn't advance during the 2016 session, but supporters believe this time could be different after sweeping Republican wins on Election Day and the appointment of Republican state Rep. Ben Smaltz to the House Public Policy Committee, which acts as a gatekeeper on such bills. Smaltz has been a staunch advocate of gun rights. Republican state Rep. Jim Lucas plans to file the bill when lawmakers convene in January. He and other advocates of the bill, including the National Rifle Association , see licensing requirements and fees as unnecessary impediments to the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Critics of the measure have said it is unnecessary and could have unintended consequences for public safety and the police. Democrat St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said if people were not required to have a license to carry a handgun then police would lose a way to quickly obtain information about a person discovered with a concealed weapon during an encounter.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Editors\u2019 note: We\u2019re resurfacing this story from the archives to show you that you should be taking more time off. IN the Midwest we\u2019re all very aware of seasons and seasonal change. The cold, the warm, the wet, the dry, the hot \u2014 we have it all every year. Some seasons are more welcome than others, but they\u2019re all good about one thing: change. Change is important. When we were growing up, we got summers off from school. Summer vacation was change. It was something to look forward to. A few months of something different really meant a lot. We grow out of a lot as we grow up. One of the most unfortunate things we leave behind is a regular dose of change. Nowhere is this more evident than at work. Work in February is the same as work in May. June\u2019s the same as October. And it would be hard to tell August from April. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yes, some businesses are more seasonal than others, but ultimately the stuff we do at work isn\u2019t that much different \u2014 it\u2019s just busier some times than others. That isn\u2019t change, it\u2019s just more volume. I wanted to do something about this. So, at 37signals, the software company I\u2019ve run for the past 13 years, we take inspiration from the seasons and build change into our work schedule. For example, from May through October, we switch to a four-day workweek. And not 40 hours crammed into four days, but 32 hours comfortably fit into four days. We don\u2019t work the same amount of time, we work less. Most staff workers take Fridays off, but some choose a different day. Nearly all of us enjoy three-day weekends. Work ends Thursday, the weekend starts Friday, and work starts back up on Monday. The benefits of a six-month schedule with three-day weekends are obvious. But there\u2019s one surprising effect of the changed schedule: better work gets done in four days than in five. When there\u2019s less time to work, you waste less time. When you have a compressed workweek, you tend to focus on what\u2019s important. Constraining time encourages quality time. At 37signals there\u2019s another thing we do to celebrate the seasons: we cover the cost of a weekly community-supported agriculture share for each employee. We enjoy this benefit year-round, but fresh fruit and produce really glisten in the summer months. It\u2019s a simple way to celebrate change. In the spirit of continual change, this summer we tried something new. We decided to give everyone the month of June to work on whatever they wanted. It wasn\u2019t vacation, but it was vacation from whatever work was already scheduled. We invited everyone to shelve their nonessential work and to use the time to explore their own ideas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story People worked independently or joined up with other employees on team projects. The only rule was: explore, see if there are ways to make our existing products better, or come up with a new product idea, create a new business model, or do whatever is of most interest. Then, in July, we asked each person to share, with the rest of the staff, whatever idea he or she came up with, on a day we set aside as \u201cPitchday.\u201d The June-on-your-own experiment led to the greatest burst of creativity I\u2019ve seen from our 34-member staff. It was fun, and it was a big morale booster. It was also ultraproductive. So much so that we\u2019ll likely start repeating the month-off project a few times a year. Are you thinking of introducing change to your business or work life? Try following the seasons. There are few things that are as regular and predictable, yet so fresh and different. Jason Fried is a co-founder and C.E.O. of 37signals, a software company. A version of this op-ed appears in print on August 19, 2012, on Page SR5 of the New York edition with the headline: Be More Productive. Take Time Off. Today's Paper | Subscribe ",

    "text": "Email The push to restrict refugee resettlements and immigration in the U.S. that figured so prominently in Donald Trump's election is now headed to states that are preparing to convene their legislative sessions early next year, immigration advocates said. In Montana, which took in just nine refugee families from January to early December, about a dozen bill requests related to refugees, immigration and terrorism have been filed ahead of next month's session. The measures include requiring resettlement agencies to carry insurance that would defray the cost of prosecuting refugees who commit violent crimes and allowing towns and cities to request a moratorium on resettlements in their communities. Refugee rights advocates say those measures are a sign of what is to come as the anti-refugee rhetoric that featured prominently in the presidential election spills over to statehouses and local governments. \"It's pretty widely known that this is going to be a hard year for those of us who are seeking to protect the rights of refugees and immigrants,\" said S.K. Rossi, advocacy and policy director for the ACLU of Montana. The president-elect campaigned on building a border wall with Mexico to stop illegal immigration , deporting immigrants who are in the nation illegally and halting the resettlement of refugees to strengthen the federal program that vets them. Some down-ticket conservative candidates took Trump's cue and integrated the anti-refugee platform into their campaigns. Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, for example, spoke multiple times about the possibility of child terrorists slipping into the U.S. Empowered by the issue's prominence, anti-immigrant groups have state and local governments in their sights as targets to push restrictive measures in addition to whatever changes may happen at the federal level, said Michele McKenzie, deputy director of the Minneapolis organization The Advocates for Human Rights. That would lead to further manipulation of the deeply visceral fear of newcomers to the U.S. that was exposed during the election campaigns, McKenzie said. \"It absolutely does not end with the presidential election,\" McKenzie said. \"It's a national strategy by a small but organized group of anti-immigration advocates and anti-refugee advocates.\" It's unclear if Trump will make good on his pledges. But his election appears to be enough for an Indiana legislative panel led by state Sen. Mike Delph, which didn't recommend any legislation after it spent eight months reviewing illegal immigration. Delph said after the election that the U.S. government's actions may make immigration less of a problem for the states. Conservative lawmakers in other states such as Montana aren't waiting to find out, and are instead looking at measures to give towns and cities a larger voice in the federal resettlement process. \"We need to get serious,\" said Nancy Ballance, a Republican state representative from Ravalli County. Ballance said refugees are a \"gigantic issue\" in her southwestern Montana county, just south of the liberal college city of Missoula. \"People expect to see some legislation brought,\" she said. Missoula has taken in all of the state's refugees this year and has been approved to accept another 150 through September. That makes leaders in rural surrounding areas nervous that people will settle in their towns, where housing and job opportunities are limited. \"If Missoula wants to have their soft-landing program, that's fine,\" said Bob Keenan, a Republican state senator from Bigfork, a town north of Missoula on Flathead Lake. \"Those communities may not be as willing to expend their social service dollars for a soft landing.\" Soft Landing Missoula and the International Rescue Committee have been the main organizations working with the federal and state governments to resettle the refugees, who come from Congo, Iraq and Eritrea. Mary Poole, Soft Landing Missoula's director, said much of the legislation being proposed in Montana is based on misinformation. Some measures \u2014 such as requiring surveys of communities' capacity to take refugees \u2014 already are part of the federal process, she said. \"I hope people are still open to talking to us and getting accurate information,\" Poole said. \"Our doors are definitely open for conversation.\" Other state-level bills conflict with federal refugee laws and will lead to lawsuits, Rossi said. Just the act of introducing these measures sustains the anti-refugee fear and xenophobia that grew during the election, the ACLU lobbyist said. \"Filing this and making it a public conversation automatically undermines the refugee process,\" Rossi said. \"They can't legally undermine the process, but they can socially undermine the process.\" 0 Shares ",

(Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) Rosanna Xia Contact Reporter The line outside the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles began two days ago, as hundreds of men, women and their children waited patiently for a warm meal and a toy from Santa\u2019s Village\u00a0on Christmas morning. Volunteers arrived early Sunday to greet them, handing out beanies,\u00a0caps and jackets in the chilly hours before the mission\u2019s Santa\u2019s Village opened its doors at 8 a.m.\u00a0 Cecelia Rosales bounced Troy, her 1-year-old son, on her hip as he waved to everyone and said \u201chi\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d among\u00a0the first few words he has\u00a0learned. Rosales giggled with him as he welcomed the day\u2019s sunshine  and saw no difference between those who lived on the streets and those volunteers who came to skid row to spend the day with them.\u00a0 Troy is her sixth child, said Rosales, 33. She said she struggled with  drug addiction for years and her other  children were\u00a0taken away. Now sober for two years, she sees a bright future and another shot at motherhood with her baby boy.  Rosales has enrolled in a community program that will help her read and write, get a job and find secure housing. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the legwork and stop just wishing for what I want,\u201d\u00a0she said, looking at Troy with pride and determination. \u201cFor once in my life, I\u2019m going to have my own apartment. I\u2019m going to be a good mother.\u201d About 2,000 children were expected to  spend Christmas at the mission, which was\u00a0decorated with colorful wrapping paper and filled with donated toys and books. Dozens of volunteers greeted families, helped children select their toys\u00a0and served them a festive brunch.\u00a0 Entertainer Dick Van Dyke, a longtime Christmas volunteer  at the mission, donned a bright red sweater and sang carols with the Urban Voices Project , a choir of spirited singers who consider\u00a0skid row home. \u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s always been a part of what we do here. It\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Joey Weinert, the mission\u2019s volunteer manager, said as he ushered in more families and directed enthusiastic volunteers to their positions in Santa\u2019s Village. \u201cIt\u2019s been super busy. It\u2019s going great.\u201d Luis and Zarela Lopez smiled at the carolers and huddled around their toddler, Liesel Shanell, who just turned 1 this week. The couple woke up early,  took a bus from their home in Koreatown to downtown Los Angeles\u00a0and waited quietly for almost two hours in hopes of providing their  daughter  with a birthday and Christmas celebration. The  couple work in a restaurant\u00a0kitchen, but they have been out of work for a month because the owner could not afford to keep all his employees full time.\u00a0 They said they expect to be back at work after the holidays, when business at the restaurant picks up again. Until then, they\u2019re finding ways to take care of their daughter and just being \u201chappy together,\u201d Zarela Lopez said in Spanish. Walking slowly around the room full of toys, she picked a plastic training\u00a0tricycle for toddlers\u00a0and an interactive book that teaches children about shapes and colors.\u00a0 She likes educational toys, Lopez said, as she wrapped her arms around her daughter.\u00a0 Across the\u00a0L.A. area, Christmas morning  brought numerous other communities together as well. At Union Station Homeless Services in Pasadena, hundreds of volunteers gathered to share a meal with those with no place to go during the holidays. \u00a0At  Hollywood United Methodist Church, in an annual event co-hosted with Temple Israel of Hollywood, children gathered to take photos with Santa, and volunteers expect to provide food, blankets and toiletries to more than 1,000 people. \u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose H. Gomez said\u00a0a 9 a.m. Christmas Mass for inmates gathered in the chapel at the Men\u2019s Central Jail. The archbishop  also said\u00a0a 12:30 p.m. Christmas Mass in Spanish\u00a0at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.\u00a0 For those flying on Christmas Day, Santa Claus  appeared at Los Angeles International Airport, where  he handed out stuffed animals, candy canes and ornaments. Airport police canines were  also  greeting children and weary passengers with tail wags and holiday cheer.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 BERLIN, BACA, IMMIGRATION, DROUGHT\u00a0 Caption Mothers who lose a second child to violence \"You wash the pain.

Robert Foulkes, location manager for \"La La Land,\" is photographed in front of the \"You Are the Star\" mural, in Hollywood. The mural is one of many vintage L.A. locations used in the critically acclaimed movie musical. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) David Ng Contact Reporter As young artists on the hunt for love in \u201cLa La Land,\u201d\u00a0 Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone romance their way through\u00a0the Hermosa Beach pier, the SmokeHouse restaurant in Burbank and the Griffith Observatory at twilight.\u00a0 But the movie\u2019s nostalgic depiction of the area\u2019s vintage sites conceals a tougher industry reality: Retro Los Angeles\u00a0locations are becoming more difficult for movie and TV crews to access as historic structures continue to vanish\u00a0and the rapid gentrification of\u00a0downtown and Hollywood itself imposes an increasing number of hurdles for local productions. These neighborhoods have\u00a0long played a vital role in the history of the film industry, providing locations for classic scenes\u00a0like Harold Lloyd dangling from a clock in downtown in the 1923 film \u201cSafety Last!\u201d and James Dean engaged\u00a0in a knife fight at the\u00a0observatory in \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d Location managers say there is still enough old Tinseltown in existence to play itself, but they are concerned that the influx of retail and residents to formerly underdeveloped areas is rendering those historic cityscapes more inaccessible and making the filming-permit process more onerous. The changes come\u00a0as L.A. is fighting runaway productions to other states and countries that offer attractive financial incentives. \u201cYou have many more neighbors you have to talk to,\u201d said Robert Foulkes, the location manager for \u201cLa La Land.\u201d \u201cThe days of being able to just go down there [to downtown and Hollywood]\u00a0are gone. There are so\u00a0many people to get permission from.\u201d Getting\u00a0permission can sometimes be as straightforward as\u00a0asking the owner of the Retro Dairy Mart \u2014\u00a0a drive-thru eatery in Burbank\u00a0\u2014 to extend its front patio to achieve a\u00a0certain camera angle of Gosling\u2019s jazz pianist, he said. (The answer was yes.) But it also can require more legwork, as with a sequence featuring Gosling and Stone at the Grand Central Market in downtown. Thanks to gentrification, producers struggle to film vintage L.A.\u00a0 (Los Angeles Times) First opened in 1917 and long a destination for working-class shoppers,\u00a0Grand Central Market has undergone\u00a0dramatic development in recent years, drawing throngs\u00a0of hipsters and tourists. At the same time, its retro look makes it a\u00a0popular shooting location, attracting commercials and TV productions. Filming there requires permission from the owner and then from any vendor or tenant  featured in a scene or is significantly\u00a0affected by production, said Chris Farber, director of business development. The market has close to 40 vendors \u2014\u00a0up more than 60%\u00a0in the past four years \u2014 and sees about 4,500 visitors on its busiest days, posing a logistical challenge for film crews. \u201cLa La Land\u201d filmed there for less than a day and shot while the market was open with customers. Filming is becoming especially complicated\u00a0in downtown\u2019s Arts District, where Hollywood\u2019s hunger for the neighborhood\u2019s historic vibe\u00a0is clashing with the area\u2019s retail boom. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to worry about interrupting a business 10 years ago, but now you do. It\u2019s really good for the economy, but it\u2019s tougher for the film industry,\u201d said Paul Audley, president of Film L.A., the nonprofit organization that oversees film permitting throughout the city. Recent productions to film in the Arts District include Netflix\u2019s upcoming \u201cBright,\u201d starring Will Smith, and ABC\u2019s canceled Marvel series \u201cAgent Carter,\u201d set during the 1940s. The demolition this year of the historic 6th Street Bridge\u00a0deprived the Arts District of one of its most popular filming locations.\u00a0\u201cAgent Carter\u201d as well as the 2011 movie \u201cDrive\u201d were shot on and around the 1932 structure. What\u2019s more, the neighborhood is \u201cnow full of coffee\u00a0shops,\u201d said Nancy Haecker, a film and TV location manager who worked on \u201cAgent Carter.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt used to be that \u00a0the warehouses were occupied by garment businesses, and we could work things out. Now, those properties are too valuable.\u201d The surge in residents in downtown means productions that shoot at night have to survey more people to comply with local filming rules, according to Film L.A. The mandatory survey is used by the L.A. Police Department, which is responsible for issuing permits to determine whether a production can operate beyond the normal window of 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. for residential areas. Still, the Arts District is in high demand. \u201cThere\u2019s not one day where there\u2019s\u00a0not shooting,\u201d said Miguel Vargas, head of the neighborhood\u2019s business improvement district. He said there is often friction between productions and local business owners over the scarcity of parking in the increasingly congested neighborhood. Many formerly empty lots and desolate streets are now under development, depriving crews of space needed to park trucks and trailers. Film crews also have chafed at the proliferation in downtown of Metro Bike Share stands and green bike lanes, which they say spoil\u00a0the distinct look of the area. You didn\u2019t have to worry about interrupting a business 10 years ago, but now you do. It\u2019s really good for the economy, but it\u2019s tougher for the film industry. \u2014 Paul Audley, president of Film L.A. Similar frictions are playing out in Hollywood, where real estate development along the La Brea Avenue\u00a0corridor\u00a0has boomed in the past two years as several luxury condominium complexes have risen near Santa Monica Boulevard. But it also has resulted in the demolition of historic small buildings and homes \u2014\u00a0structures not important enough to merit landmark status but whose collective disappearance has altered the historic feel of many blocks. For period shoots, this represents a\u00a0setback because it \u201cbreaks a pattern for a streetscape or look of an area,\u201d said Adrian Scott Fine, director of advocacy at the L.A. Conservancy. \u201cNew buildings are constructed in and around historic ones,\u201d said Mandi Dillin, a location manager for HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe way the surrounding landscape changes is what can complicate filming.\u201d The exterior shots of the Formosa Cafe in \u201cL.A. Confidential\u201d would be almost impossible to get today because of the adjacent Target shopping plaza and giant construction cranes behind it, according to location manager\u00a0John Panzarella, who worked on the 1997 film as well as this year\u2019s \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d \u201cGentrification is not our friend,\u201d he said. The scarcity of untouched\u00a0historic locations was felt during the making of \u201cHail, Caesar!,\u201d which was set in postwar Hollywood. A\u00a0nightclub scene required filming at three different vintage locations that later were pieced together in the editing room: the Fonda Theatre for the exterior; the Hollywood Palladium for interiors; and the Chapman Plaza in Koreatown for some reverse shots. Even neighborhoods on the cusp of gentrification no longer can double for themselves. The most-recent season of Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent\u201d featured scenes set in Boyle Heights during the \u201950s. But the crew found that the neighborhood\u2019s skyline had changed too much. \u201cIf you look at pictures from the era, there\u2019s not much in the background. Now, you see things that are more contemporary that you can\u2019t work around,\u201d said Cat Smith, production designer on the series. Instead, the crew shot in the West Adams neighborhood, which she said has retained more of its suburban postwar feel.\u00a0 L.A. would seem to have the monopoly on\u00a0vintage L.A. locations, but some recent\u00a0shoots have left the city altogether. \u201cThe Nice Guys,\u201d this year\u2019s detective comedy set in L.A. during the \u201970s, was filmed primarily in Georgia, while last year\u2019s \u201cTrumbo,\u201d set in 1940s Hollywood, was shot in Louisiana. Both states offer lucrative tax incentives that have drawn numerous productions in recent years. Location managers say advances in post-production digital technology make it easier to get\u00a0the perfect period shot because anachronistic eyesores like satellite dishes no longer have to be manually removed. \u201cNow they leave them in and paint them out later,\u201d said Caleb Duffy, a location manager who worked on this year\u2019s \u201cCafe Society,\u201d\u00a0set in Depression-era Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheaper option.\u201d\u00a0 He said digital airbrushing was\u00a0used in the 2012 movie \u201cHitchcock\u201d\u00a0to remove signage and other contemporary markings around the historic Palace Theatre in downtown L.A. for exterior scenes set during the \u201960s. The upcoming FX series \u201cFeud,\u201d about the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, is being shot entirely in L.A. The crew recently used the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium to play itself as the venue for the 1963 Academy Awards ceremony. \u201cThe building still looks great,\u201d said Foulkes, the \u201cLa La Land\u201d location manager who also is working on \u201cFeud.\u201d But he said other vintage\u00a0locations he wanted to use have fallen victim to development, like the old Hollywood haunt Perino\u2019s Restaurant, which was demolished several years ago to make way for apartments. The crew replicated the eatery on a set.\u00a0 \u201cThere are all kinds of buildings we wished were still around.\u201d\u00a0 Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Caption Natalie Portman on the importance of the infamous pink dress in 'Jackie' For her role as Jackie Kennedy, Natalie Portman says, \"It's not a fashion story,\" but the clothes do tell a story.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov. Eleven bodies had been recovered as of Sunday evening, Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov told reporters, adding that fragments of other bodies were also found. Asked if the crash could have been the result of a terror attack, Sokolov said investigators were looking into every possible cause. President Vladimir Putin declared Monday a national day of mourning for the crash victims. Rescuers carry a stretcher with a body recovered after a Russian military plane crashed in the Black Sea outside Sochi on Sunday. AFP - Getty Images More than 3,000 rescue workers on 32 ships, including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia, were searching the crash site at sea and along the shore, the Defense Ministry said Sunday. Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about a mile from the shore. The Tu-154 three-engine aircraft carrying 84 passengers and eight crew vanished from radar at around 5:20 a.m. local time (8:20 p.m. Saturday ET), around 20 minutes after takeoff, RIA Novosti reported citing an emergency service source. Officials \"in charge of the flight\" as well as technical personnel involved with preparing it before takeoff were being questioned, according to an earlier statement by government investigators. The Defense Ministry told local media the plane was carrying the Alexandrov Military Ensemble for a performance at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. Russian forces have been helping President Bashar al-Assad quash Syria's six-year civil war. Members of the Alexandrov Ensemble stand while choir conductor General Viktor Eliseev (right) arrives onstage at the Palais des Sports in Paris in October 2015. AFP - Getty Images The Alexandrov ensemble was founded in 1928 and is the official choir and dance group for the Russian military. It was named after its first director and organizer, Alexander Alexandrov, who is famous for composing the music for Russian national anthem. The ensemble with around 200 members has won numerous international awards. A video of their cover of James Bond's theme song Skyfall went viral in 2013 . Nine Russian journalists, including a TV crew from Channel One, were also among those on board. A TU-154 plane of Bashkirian Airlines lands in Domodedovo Airport in Moscow, Russia. EPA Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was personally coordinating the rescue efforts, and President Vladimir Putin has received official reports on the incident, according to local media. Russia's RT reported the plane took off on a planned flight and failed to check in with the control tower at 5:40 a.m. Maria Stromova ",

Netanyahu lashed out at President Barack Obama on Saturday, Dec. 24, accusing him of a \"shameful ambush\" at the United Nations over West Bank settlements and saying he is looking forward to working with his \"friend\" President-elect Donald Trump. Netanyahu's comments came a day after the United States broke with past practice and allowed the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law. (Abir Sultan, Pool via AP) 0 Shares Email The Israeli government's furious reaction to the U.N. Security Council's adoption of a resolution opposing Jewish settlements in occupied territory underscores its fundamental and bitter dispute with the international community about the future of the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state. But Friday's U.N. rebuke was a stark reminder that the rest of the world considers it a crime. The embattled leader is now placing his hopes in the incoming administration of Donald Trump, which is shaping up as the first major player to embrace Israel's nationalist right and its West Bank settlements. In a series of statements, Netanyahu has criticized the Obama Administration for letting Resolution 2334 pass Friday by abstaining, using unprecedented language that has turned a policy disagreement into a personal vendetta. \"From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\" Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday. In turning his anger toward Israel's closest and most important ally, Netanyahu has underplayed the embarrassment that all 14 other nations on the Security Council voted in favor of the measure. Those votes came from countries that Netanyahu loves to boast of cultivating relations with, including Russia and China and nations across the developing world. \"This is the same prime minister who told us dozens of states are on board with us,\" former Prime Minister Ehud Barak told Channel 2 TV on Saturday. \"I looked for Russia, China, England, France. Where are all the friends that were meant to stand with us?\" The resolution marked a sharp international rebuke of Israeli settlement policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians as parts of a future independent state. Some 600,000 Israelis now live in the two areas, complicating any partition of the land between Israel and a future Palestine . Netanyahu routinely dismisses international criticism of the settlements, saying that the dispute with the Palestinians goes back to long before the 1967 war. He also notes that when Israel dismantled its Gaza settlements in 2005, Hamas militants responded by firing rockets and subsequently seizing control of the territory from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. With Friday's resolution, however, the world sent a strong message that it rejects these arguments. The resolution said the settlements have \"no legal validity\" and constitute a \"flagrant violation\" of international law. It also urged all states to distinguish between Israel and \"the territories occupied since 1967.\" In the short term, the resolution is largely symbolic. It did not include talk of sanctions or any other punitive measures against Israel. \"The importance of the resolution is to remind Israel, at least at the rhetorical level, that the international community is not completely happy, to say the least, with the ongoing status quo,\" said Arie Kacowicz, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, said Netanyahu was being disingenuous by calling the resolution anti-Israel. \"This resolution is about settlement activities, the two-state solution and ending the occupation,\" he said. \"Netanyahu, by his statements and his actions, is isolating Israel for the sake of settlements.\" Malki said the Palestinians hoped the resolution would bolster their case at the International Criminal Court, which has launched a preliminary investigation into the settlements. He also said he hoped it would encourage European countries to follow up on an EU recommendation to clearly label products manufactured in settlements, and encourage other countries to do the same. On Jan. 15, days before Obama leaves office, France is expected to host a Mideast conference where dozens of countries may endorse an international framework for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Netanyahu vehemently opposes such activity, saying it undermines the negotiating process. The recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahu's hand: the incoming Trump Administration. In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that \"things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" Critically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire. After Friday's vote, Netanyahu's office said he looked forward to working with Trump \"to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\" Netanyahu has since gone on a campaign to punish the countries that took part in the resolution. He has canceled a slew of diplomatic visits and summoned ambassadors from Security Council countries, including the U.S., on Sunday, Christmas Day, in protest. According to an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, Netanyahu also canceled an upcoming meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn Friday's decision appears to be impossible. The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesn't apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds. When Netanyahu's rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for Israel's democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its 2.5 million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy. The country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome \u2014 some openly, and many more quietly \u2014 any world pressure to bring that about. Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution. He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist. 0 Shares ",

There appeared to be no survivors. (Dec. 25) AP All potential causes for the crash under investigation, including terrorism: Russian transport minister A 2002 photo shows a TU-154 plane of Bashkirian Airlines, the same type of aircraft that went down Sunday over the Black Sea. (Photo: Sergei Ilnitsky, EPA) Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a\u00a0day of mourning\u00a0after a Russian military plane carrying the\u00a0world-famous Red Army Choir to Syria crashed into the Black Sea on Christmas morning minutes after taking off from the coastal town of Sochi. All 92 aboard apparently died, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Transport Minister\u00a0Maxim Sokolov arrived in Sochi on Sunday to convene an investigative mission, according to the Tass News Agency. The minister said all possible causes are being considered, including a terror attack, according to The Associated Press. While officials said they did not believe the crash was caused by terrorism, Russian broadcaster MKRU reported that security cameras nearby recorded a bright flash near the plane before it went down. Viktor\u00a0Ozerov, head of the defense affairs committee at the upper house of Russian parliament, downplayed the possibility of terrorism, according to the AP. The Tu-154 was operated by the military, so the\u00a0crash may have stemmed from\u00a0a mechanical problem or a crew error,\u00a0Ozeroy said The plane disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from Sochi, AP reported. The crash site is less than a mile from the shore. The plane, which belongs to the Russian Defense Ministry, was carrying 64 members of the Russian army's official choir, also known as\u00a0the Alexandrov Ensemble,\u00a0to\u00a0a military base in Syria for a New Year's concert, according to Turkey's Daily Sabah. Russian forces have helped the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad gain the upper hand against rebel groups in the country's nearly six-year-old civil war. Last week, the rebel stronghold of Aleppo in northern Syria, the country's commercial capital, was recaptured by Syrian government troops. It was a major defeat for the rebels, who had held eastern Aleppo for most of the war. The Russian Army choir, established in 1928, for decades presented a human face of the Soviet Union's military by traveling the world during the Cold War to perform\u00a0Russian folk songs and spiritual music. Also on board\u00a0was humanitarian activist Elizaveta Glinka, Russian Foreign Ministry spokewoman Maria Zakharova said, according to state-owned broadcaster RT. Glinka was a \u201csocial and political activist, but she was outside any politics, above any politics,\u201d Zakharova said. Recovery crews pulled several bodies from the water\u00a0as drones, divers, helicopters and ships searched for the remains of other passengers, the\u00a0Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.\u00a0 Mourners visit a small memorial outside the home stage of the Alexandrov Ensemble (The Red Army Choir), in Moscow, Russia. \u00a0(Photo: Maxim Shipenkov, EPA) 18489 CONNECT TWEET 9 LINKEDIN 170 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hk57ed NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

A lot of vehicles bit the dust in 2016, and more are expected to go in 2017. In the automotive equivalent of mass extinction caused from a comet striking the Earth, Toyota wiped out the whole Scion brand, and Fiat Chrysler exterminated its midsize and compact sedans. That sounds dramatic, but you\u2019re not likely to miss many of these vehicles.\u00a0An autopsy would declare their cause of death to be indifference by customers or the companies that built them. Despite that, a deserving few could become targets for smart bargain shoppers. Here\u2019s a roll call of the departed and doomed: Buick Verano \u00a0(Photo: Buick) Buick\u2019s enjoyable little compact expired because\u00a0of the boom in sport-utility vehicle sales. Car dealers are a Darwinian lot, so floor space will go to the more profitable Envision compact SUV. It\u2019s survival of the most profitable. Chrysler 200 2016 Chrysler 200 C \u00a0(Photo: A.J. Mueller, FCA US) This midsize sedan was the latest, and one hopes last, in a line of serviceable but unexceptional cars from Chrysler. The 200 never challenged leading midsize sedans\u2019 value, features, quality or fuel economy. Just a few years after investing $1-billion to build 200s, FCA is ripping up the car\u2019s assembly plant again for another billion-dollar remake to produce pickups. Chrysler Town & Country \u00a0(Photo: A.J. Mueller, FCA US) The sleek and advanced Pacifica minivan replaces the T&C in Chrysler\u2019s lineup. Dodge\u2019s Grand Caravan minivan is likely to soldier on as a price leader until sometime in 2018. Dodge Dart 2016 Dodge Dart Limited \u00a0(Photo: FCA US) The Dodge Dart is another casualty of Dodge and Chrysler\u2019s baffling proclivity to develop lackluster small cars to share dealer space with exciting classics like the Charger and 300. The final nail in the Dart\u2019s coffin may have been delays developing a transmission that could have made its fuel economy and performance competitive with popular compacts. Dodge Viper \u00a0(Photo: Richard Prince, FCA US) Despite its dramatic looks and V10 engine, the Viper never achieved iconic status. It was created more as a marketing ploy to generate positive publicity than to test new technologies or match the sophistication or comfort of great sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette or Porsche 911. Honda CR-Z 2016 Honda CR-Z \u00a0(Photo: Honda, Wieck) You know\u00a0a problem exists when one of the most frequent comments about a new hybrid is that it would be better if you got rid of the battery and electric motors and converted it to a lightweight sporty car. This little hybrid managed to displease both those who wanted it to be sporty and those who hungered for high fuel economy. The two-seat CR-Z was too heavy to satisfy enthusiasts and never approached the fuel efficiency that hybrid fans could get from the more practical Toyota Prius. Hyundai Equus and Genesis \u00a0(Photo: Hyundai) Brand strategy giveth and brand strategy taketh away. While Toyota mothballed its youth-oriented Scion brand, Hyundai created a new Genesis upscale brand. The G90 large sedan is essentially a greatly improved replacement for the Equus, while the G70 sport sedan is a rebranded version of the Genesis sport sedan. The Genesis coupe disappears. Lincoln MKS 2015 Lincoln MKS \u00a0(Photo: Lincoln Motor Company) The best this ungainly sedan can hope for is that history recalls it as the last car before Lincoln rebooted with the 2017 Continental. The MKS may have been the least visually interesting big sedan since the Ford Five Hundred. It complemented those humble looks with a small trunk opening that annoyed Lincoln loyalists and performance like Ambien. Mini Paceman and roadster Mini Roadster \u00a0(Photo: Mini) These were a pair of specialty models whose existence seemed to assume a reservoir of buyers was just dying for cars that were less practical and comfortable and had worse visibility than the Mini Cooper hardtop. Both were fun to drive, but so is the more practical and comfortable hardtop. The roadster in particular, though, could become a popular used car if prices fall substantially. Rolls-Royce Phantom Rolls-Royce Phantom \u00a0(Photo: Mark Bramley, Rolls-Royce) Derided at its debut as the first car that was too big, heavy and expensive even for Rolls-Royce, the Phantom became a success. The first Rolls developed under BMW ownership, it earned billions and re-established the British brand as an apex luxury sedan after decades when the brand had devolved into a nostalgia act. Rolls is building a final handful of Phantom coupes and convertibles. An all-new aluminum-intensive car in Phantom\u2019s class \u2014 and probably bearing the revered name \u2014 is expected in 2018. Scion \u00a0(Photo: Toyota) Born in fanfare, Toyota\u2019s former youth brand died with a whimper. The boxy little xB hatchback that defined the brand died with the 2015 model year. The tC coupe that was Scion\u2019s other mainstay will be gone soon. The Scion iA and iM compacts have been rebranded the Corolla iM and Yaris iA. The enjoyable but rough-riding FR-S sporty coupe has been rechristened the Toyota 86, the name it already is sold under in the rest of the world. Toyota Venza 2015 Toyota Venza \u00a0(Photo: Toyota) If somebody tells you it\u2019s impossible to build an SUV Americans won\u2019t buy, bet them $50 and tell them to Google \u201cVenza.\u201d This stylish\u00a0SUV never caught on\u00a0despite Toyota\u2019s enviable reputation for reliability. Don\u2019t ask me why. I loved it and would recommend a used Venza to anybody looking for a good five-seat SUV. Toyota FJ Cruiser 2014 Toyota FJ Cruiser \u00a0(Photo: Toyota) The moral of this SUV\u2019s demise may be that even retro designs need to be updated occasionally. Or maybe it's just that people like to be able to see out the rear window. The boxy FJ recalled the looks of a classic Toyota off-roader when it debuted, but its design sacrificed usability for appearance. And it received no meaningful updates during its production run. The rear suicide doors were impractical, the backseat barely fit for human occupancy. Offroad ability rated high, but fuel economy was poor and the FJ used pricey premium fuel in its first several years of production. Volkswagen CC 2017 Volkswagen CC \u00a0(Photo: Daniel Byrne, Volkswagen) This sleek derivative of the previous-generation Passat convinced a few buyers to pay a premium for a VW midsize sedan, but too few for VW\u2019s taste. In addition to its unique profile, the CC offered V6 power, all-wheel drive and other upscale features.\u00a0VW longs to be seen as a step above mass-market brands like Ford and Toyota, so don\u2019t be surprised if the recent Atheon concept car foreshadows a replacement for the CC.

Abir Sultan/AP hide caption toggle caption Abir Sultan/AP Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu escalated his criticism of the U.S. on Sunday, summoning Ambassador Dan Shapiro to Israel. Abir Sultan/AP In remarks at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed \"anger and frustration\" over the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Israel summoned 10 ambassadors to Israel from countries that voted in favor of the resolution, as well as the U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro. Netanyahu escalated his criticism of the U.S. for abstaining, even accusing President Obama of orchestrating the resolution himself. \"From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. He added the following in English: \"Over decades, American administrations and Israeli governments had disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the Security Council was not the place to resolve this issue. We knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace further away. \"And, as I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don't take friends to the Security Council. I'm encouraged by the statements of our friends in the United States, Republicans and Democrats alike. They understand how reckless and destructive this U.N. resolution was, they understand that the Western Wall isn't occupied territory.\" Article continues after sponsorship Security Council Condemns Israeli Settlements As U.S. Abstains From Vote Netanyahu added that he looks forward to working with the new administration when it takes office next month. President-elect Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the U.S. abstention, tweeting Friday , \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" NPR's Bill Chappell reported on Friday: \"In explaining the U.S. abstention, Ambassador Samantha Power said the move doesn't signal diminished U.S. support for Israel; she later added that the continued construction of settlements 'seriously undermines Israel's security.' \"Power said, 'The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades.' \" Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to President Obama, told reporters on Friday that the administration \"tried everything.\" \"Prime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today,\" Rhodes said. \"Absent this acceleration of settlement activity, absent the type of rhetoric we've seen out of the current Israeli government, I think the United States likely would have taken a different view, because our preference is for there to be a credible peace process underway.\" A U.N. spokesperson said in a statement that the secretary-general welcomed the adoption of the resolution, adding that it was a \"significant step, demonstrating the Council's much needed leadership and the international community's collective efforts to reconfirm that the vision of two States is still achievable.\" ",

Artur Lebedev/Artur Lebedev/TASS hide caption toggle caption Artur Lebedev/Artur Lebedev/TASS A search and rescue team attends to the crash site of a Russian Defense Ministry plane after the Tupolev Tu-154, with 92 people on board, fell off of radar over the Black Sea early Sunday. Artur Lebedev/Artur Lebedev/TASS A Russian military plane carrying 92 passengers has crashed into the Black Sea, according to local media, citing the Russian Defense Ministry. The ministry says 84 passengers and 8 crew members were on board, reports the Associated Press , and that emergency teams have been dispatched. Russian state TV reports the Tu-154 passenger plane dropped off from radar about 20 minutes after taking off from Sochi's Adler airport at 5:20 a.m. local time on Sunday. The Defense Ministry says wreckage debris has been found about a mile off the Sochi coast. So far, rescuers have found one body and personal documents belonging to some of the passengers. As NPR's Lucian Kim tells our newscast from Moscow, the plane was reportedly carrying members of a military choir, the famed Alexandrov Ensemble, who were to perform in a holiday concert for Russian service members deployed in Syria. Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said soldiers and nine reporters were also on board the plane, notes the BBC . A respected Russian charity doctor, Yelizaveta Glinka, was among the passengers, says the AP. \"Glinka, known as Doctor Liza in Russia, has won broad acclaim for charity work that included missions to the war zone in eastern Ukraine. \"Her foundation, Spravedlivaya Pomoshch, or Just Help, says she was accompanying a shipment of medicines for a hospital in Syria.\" Article continues after sponsorship There's no indication of any known survivors. The cause of the crash remains unknown, but Russian officials dismiss terrorism on the basis that the plane is military-operated. Viktor Ozerov, head of the defense affairs committee at the upper house of Russian parliament, said, \"I totally exclude\" the notion of an attack leading to the crash, reports the AP, citing his remarks carried by state RIA Novosti news agency. Lucian adds that Russian commercial airlines have been gradually phasing out the Soviet-designed three-engine aircraft for more modern models, but, as the AP notes , the military has continued to use them.
